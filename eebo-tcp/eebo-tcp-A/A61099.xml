            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CERTAIN
CONSIDERATIONS
upon the duties both of
Prince &amp; People.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG many intemperances that minister
disturbance to the Church and State, we have
those, whose supine affectation of flattery has
grown to that impudence, as that they have not
only for learnings sake disputed, but in the name
of the word of God, and at the time and place
when we should expect no other then the lively Oracles of God,
delivered, that the persons, and fortunes of all Subjects, are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
at the will and command of the Prince, to dispose according
to his will and pleasure. To such licentiousnes, we need give no
other answer, then only to demaund, that the maintainers of such
Doctrine, would put us but a case, wherein (those opinions of
theirs being admitted) a Prince can commit any Injustice, and that
they would shew us, wherein lies the justice which the Scripture
commaunds Princes to execute, and which it affirmes to be the
establishment of their Thrones,<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 4.</note> and the violation of it to be their
adversity or subversion.</p>
            <p>We have on the other side those, who finding it written, that
Governours are for the good of the People, pursue it with Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
That the people are the end of Princes and Governors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
and that therefore as their government is for, or against the
good of the People, so may they be continued or deposed by them.
To that end also there are opinions set on foot; That all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
first came from the people, and that all authority does in the
last place reside in them; That in every Kingdome the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45044:3"/>
of the people must of necessity contain, all power and authority
whatsoever either is or may be erected in it; so as that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or the greater part of them (which amounts to all) may by
their votes, re-assume all power into their own hands: abrogate all
Ordinances: anull the formes of present government: and new
mould the State into such formes and institutions as best liketh
them. These are falsities which yet lay hold upon reasons, and
prevaile over the judgements of many that are understanding men,
and which have no evill affection toward government, and these
are of that consequence, as that they subvert the stability of all kind
of government whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But were we shie of <hi>Iesuitisme,</hi> as well as of <hi>Popery,</hi> we would
not with so little examination receive opinions, which we know
had their first hatching in the Schoole of the <hi>Iesuite.</hi> The matter
would require a very large field, should we set forth all things that
fitly conduce to the support of the truth, but my purpose is to be
very short. Therefore declining to controvert what may be, and
usually is alleadged in the matter, I shall humbly offer to conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
such apprehensions of the truth as I have conceived lesse
vulgar, &amp; submitting them to the approbation or correction of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judgements, expect they shall returne unto mee, with confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or rectification of my own private thoughts; if from so
mean a talent, no mite of benefit be raised to the publique,</p>
            <p>And first, we are to consider that the originall of Kingdoms is of
three sorts, to wit, Naturall, (which we may also call civill,) Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
(or if you will, Martiall,) or mixt of these two. The first
was of Parents over their children, childrens children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
bought or borne unto them. In this, the person of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
was before the being of the Subject, and his authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever the Subject consented, or had power to obey or disobey.
Such a King was <hi>Shem,</hi> called therefore <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> or <hi>King of
righteousnesse.</hi> And a Prince of this kind was <hi>Abraham,</hi> after that
by Gods command he had left his Country and his father <hi>Shems</hi>
house, and lived of himselfe, and Kings of this nature were they
that were intimated in the names of <hi>Abimelech, Abiam, Abiram,
Abram, Abishalom, &amp;c.</hi> And this soveraignty was not inherent
to the person of the Father only, but from him descended, by
right of primogeniture,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> to the eldest sonne, to whole rule, we see
that God subjected the younger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45044:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The second sort of Kingdoms was wholly founded by the
sword, over people that were subjugated by usurpers and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
such as followed the way of <hi>Nimrod:</hi> who being potent in
his naturall dominion, used his power to the oppression of his
neighbours, and changed the state of government into tyranny; I
say not the state of liberty, (as if till then men had lived in solute
liberty) but changed the naturall government into that which is
tyrannicall.</p>
            <p>The third sort had much what the same originall with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
where people surcharged at home and forced abroad; men
in division; in distresse; in feare; exiles; and fugitives, distrusting
their present condition, served themselves on the Wit, Spirit, and
courage of some notable man; to whose command they (with such
limitation of his power as they could agree on,) subjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and then falling into action prospered even into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
from hence sprung our Moderne Kingdoms, more novell
and various in their frame, and many of them so qualified, as not
properly to be called Kingdoms, but rather Republiques under
Regall stiles, with Princes elective, much circumscribed in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and obnoxious to deposing. Now in the first and second sort,
apparantly the people had never any thing to doe with the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and limitation of Soveraign Power: and though in the third
sort they had more to doe therewith, yet not alike in all of that
sort, nor had they the whole and sole power of instituting, scarce
in any of that sort, so as we must rectify that misapprehension, that
in all Kingdoms the first derivation of authority was from the
people.</p>
            <p>In the next place, we are to consider; that Kingdomes are not
associations of men in their naturall capacityes: but communions of
men <hi>quatenùs</hi> members politique, united in one common bond of
obedience into one politicall body, where none can move to give
his due aid for the weale of the body, but in the capacity of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
member, and according to the peculiar office which every
severall member properly ought to execute; which office the
members duly exercising, make a true and perfect civill Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Now though we consider a Kingdome as a meere Civill or
temporall State only; Yet even there, the observance of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is a duty strictly required of every member, even by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45044:4"/>
law of nature, or morall law, and by the law of God it selfe. For
man having lost his originall righteousnesse or justice, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the right of governing himselfe; and being thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
subjected to the government of some justice without
himselfe: it was necessary, for his owne good and safety, that he
should not only be subject to that justice in the things that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the well governing himselfe toward others; but likewise in
those things that concerned his safety and defence from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of others misgoverning themselves toward him, and that
necessarily brings in Empire. So that (unlesse we can imagine some
Kingdome to consist of people sprung of themselves, in perfection
of righteousnes, not depending, nor obliged to God, or nature,
nor obnoxious to those conditions to which the fall of man has sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
all men,) we cannot devise how men should naturally be
free from subjection to government; and lesse, how (being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
private men in any State, should in their naturall capacity,
meddle with any thing concerning government; or so much as goe
about the making, changing, on anulling of ordinances; or so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
Governours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to doe them, without being criminally culpable;
not only against the positive lawes of the land, but even against
conscience pressed with the bonds of naturall, or morall, and also
divine law. Therefore to explicate the sense which all intend, but
some (not well distinguishing) confound: It is certainly true, that
all the people of a Kingdome must needs comprehend all power
whatsoever is, or may be exercised in it: but when we say so, we
by all the people, meane, the whole entire body of the members
politique, from head to foot, every one of them abiding and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
according to his proper and ordained office politique. But if
beside their ordained office &amp; power, any shall doe or attempt any
alteration in the State, (howsoever intended for common good)
their act must needs be so farre from being lawfull, as being from
the beginning repugnant and resisting the ordained power, it can
never become a lawfull act, though all the Subjects of a Kingdome
should after consent unto it.</p>
            <p>But in the third place, we are farther to consider: That if the
Kingdome be also a Church of God, then is the originall, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of it, of farre higher nature, and more remote from the reach
and power of the people. It is true, God is King of all Kings, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45044:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
highest Soveraigne in all Kingdomes, as well Heathen as Christian:
yet, as he cautioned in the behalfe of his Church, that no stranger
should be King there, but by any meanes one that was of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the people: so in His Church He himselfe is a neerer and
(as it were) a more cognate Soveraigne, then in other Kingdomes;
and his Vicegerents there, are of more immediate and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
subordination to him. For which cause he there reserves
to himselfe the choice of the man, and leaves the people no more
then the bare investing of him. Not but that God in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
makes Kings whom he pleaseth; but he will have it
known, that in his Church, the choice is not only his, and to be
sought at his hand, but that he more strictly requires the observance
of his right, in his Church; then he does otherwhere. Therefore he
expresly commands there;<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt in any case set him over thee,
whom thy Lord thy God shall chuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as in his Church he to himselfe reserved the nomination; so
when he had nominated, he did not leave it to the people, there
to declare the right and manner of the Kingdom: but by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
by whom he signified his choice, by the same was the manner
of the Kingdom declared to the people,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 25.</note> written in a book and
<hi>laid up before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kings of Gods Church, having from God a more immediate and
more sacred ordination, have also a more especiall endowment of
his spirit, for which cause they have beene ever instituted with
<hi>annointing,</hi> &amp; their persons therewith consecrate, for the exercise
of their function. This we see in <hi>Saul,</hi> whose person (though he
were a wicked Prince) <hi>David</hi> in this respect declared so sacred,
as that he pronounced a curse upon the Mountaines of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in them his person was cast downe and vilefied, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the sacrednesse of his annointing. Their annointing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is not a meere outward solemnity, but is significant of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God in a more especiall manner given unto them, and from
thence proceeds that which the Scripture witnesseth,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 10.</note> 
               <hi>A divine
sentence in the lipps of the King,</hi> yea, and a sacred integrity also,
<hi>His mouth transgresseth not in judgement.</hi> And suitable to their
Prerogative of graces, beyond the ordinary of other Princes, God
vouchsafes them his eare, with more favour and familiarity then to
the other, as we may see by his ready hearing, gratious answers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45044:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vouchsafed messages sent, and will declared touching them; not
only to the good, as <hi>David, Salomon, Asa, Iehosaphat, Hezechiah,
Iosiah, &amp;c.</hi> but even to <hi>Coniah, Saul, Ieroboam, Ahab, Jehu,</hi> and
other wicked Princes. And we not only heare God himselfe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>by me Kings Raigne;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15. Psal. 81.</note> 
               <hi>and I have said yee are Gods:</hi> but his
word couples also the feare that is to be rendred unto Kings, with
the feare that is due unto himselfe, <hi>Feare God and the King. Keepe
the Kings Commandement, in regard of the oath of the Lord.</hi> Nor
is it ordinary obedience that is commanded, but the highest (under
God) <hi>Submit unto the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>as unto the Supreame.</hi> And that not
for the danger that may ensue, but (as the Apostle saith) <hi>Not for
wrath only,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>but also for conscience sake.</hi> Now if the King be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame,
then is there in no Kingdome any superintending power
or authority, that may lawfully call the King to account: for that
power only is the supreame, over which there is not any other to
take account. So high and sacred is the authority of them whom
God has made, <hi>nursing fathers, and nursing mothers,</hi> to his Church.</p>
            <p>When Kings then, both in their Persons, and Functions, are of
so sacred an ordination, and so hedged in, by Gods especiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
where is there place for the people to interpose and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the affaires that doe belong unto them? besides, when
without the Kings consent there can be no concurrence of people,
to joyne in any accord for the disposing of any affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but that the matter must first passe the project, sollicitation,
and prosecution of diverse private men, no way thereunto authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:
how can any act of the people to such an end be justifiable,
when an unlawfull beginning, (what number or quality soever
the attempters be of) can never make a lawfull act? Therefore
omitting those places of Scripture, <hi>It is not fit to say to a King thou
art wicked, Who may say to a King, what doest thou? Feare God and
the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and meddle not with those that love innovation:</hi> And
many others (which yet block up the way against private mens
medling with matters of government.) If it were to be granted
that the people in any Kingdome had power over all rights of the
Kingdome; yet unlesse that by the Ordinances of that Kingdome,
it be expresly declared and appointed, how, and by whom, that
power shall be executed, (and by the way, where such Ordinances
are, there is not a right Kingdome, but a Republique) and againe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45044:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unlesse those ordinances be rightly pursued, there can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binement,
to doe any such act, but with the guilt of Sedition, and
Treason, in the sight of God. For it will lye against every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
man, betweene God and his conscience to answer, who hath
called thee to this? who hath separated thee? who hath made
thee a Iudge or an Executor of these matters? And though it be
pretended (and perhaps intended too) that the worke so to be
done shall make for the glory of God and good of his Church: yet
that will but little helpe the matter; for, for men to doe God a
good office against his declared will, is to be Gods good maisters,
not his good servants.<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. 2.</note> He does expresly command, that <hi>Every soule
be subject to the higher powers;</hi> and declares plainly, <hi>that the powers
that are, are ordained of God,</hi> and that <hi>they that resist the power,
resist the ordinance of God, and receive to themselves damnation:</hi> and
our Saviour himselfe forbids us, that we <hi>doe not evill, that good
may come thereon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 22.</note> The Scripture tells us the reason, for <hi>God hath
no need of a wicked man,</hi> &amp; he is best <hi>glorified when his voyce is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
We have also the examples of Scripture to the same purpose.
It did not only turne to sinne to <hi>Saul,</hi> that he, to satisfie the people
in their devotion, spared the best of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> spoile to offer
in sacrifice unto the Lord, when God had commanded that all
should be destroyed: but it became a finall sinne even unto his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
And <hi>Vzza</hi> was strucke with suddaine death,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 6. 6. 1. Chr. 13. 10,</note> for nothing
but putting his hand to the Arke of Gods Covenant; (which no
man but the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> might doe) yet <hi>Vzza</hi> did not doe it,
but with a good and a pious mind to save the Arke of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
from falling. Therefore it is not enough for men to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the worke which they doe, in their consciences tends to
a good and a religious effect: but they must every man have a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
warrant for his conscience, and for his calling to the worke;
that is, either the expresse word of God, or else such manifest infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and deduction from it, as by the concurrent judgement of
the Church universally in all ages, is agreed for truth, not such
judgment as some particular ministers take upon them to make, for
the <hi>spirit of the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>are subject to the Prophets;</hi> that is the
spirits of the particular, to the spirit of the universall: <hi>For God is
not the author of confusion,</hi> which else would necessarily follow.
Men therefore must looke to the ground &amp; first beginning of their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45044:6"/>
actions; for if the root be evill, so will also the branches be, though
it promises never so good fruit, and be countenanced by all the
people of a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>If further we looke into Scripture, The story of <hi>Moses</hi> is not
without some doctrine to this point. <hi>Moses</hi> having an ardent
zeale to the reliefe of his brethren the people of God, and finding
himselfe above others inabled to be the instrument of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
both by his extraordinary abilities, &amp; also through the great
power he had with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, perswades himselfe, and
(as appeares by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephens</hi> relation) would have the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,<note place="margin">Acts. 7. 25. Exod. 2. 12.</note>
that he was even then called to be their deliverer. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he makes his addresse to the people, and by the slaughter of
one of their oppressors, takes say of their affection toward an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of liberty, as if there needed no more in the case, but that
the people should resolve, and joyne with him to breake from the
subjection of the King they lived under, who was an enemy to
Gods Church. In this now, (though we make no question but
that <hi>Moses</hi> had a zeale acceptable to God) yet may we see by that
which followeth, that he had not yet a particular calling thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
neither was the way wherein he thought to have executed his
zeale agreeable to the will of God; therefore the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(whom <hi>Moses</hi> only sought unto) they reject him: his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
is frustrate, and himselfe is driven to repent it with forty
yeares exile in the wildernesse.<note place="margin">Acts. 7. 30.</note> After that long space of expiating
the errour of his selfe-led zeale, God calls him then indeed to the
worke to which he came of himselfe before;<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Come now</hi> (saith
God) <hi>and I will send thee:</hi> and God sends him then indeed; but
sends him not to the people (that we may know he sent him not
before) but (though he could have made the people able to make
their owne way by the sword, and could by his command have
made it lawfull so to have done) yet (to teach us the observance
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ustice and duty, in our proceedings) he sends him to the King,
of him to demand the dismission of his people, that so the peoples
obedience to his messengers, and to the word delivered in his
name, might be without any reluctance of conscience in regard of
their allegiance to the King. When <hi>Moses</hi> did this way set upon
the worke, all went the right way, and the unspeakable obstinacy
of King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> being aggravated by the fairenes of proceedings
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45044:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
toward him, did to his condemnation before men and Angells, and
to the magnifying of Gods justice redound the more unto his praise
and glory.</p>
            <p>It is not inconsiderable that God by a Starre declared our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in his birth to be the borne King of the Iewes; and in that stile
brought the wise men to worship him. And likewise, that when
our Saviour (to fulfill the prophesyes concerning him) did solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nly
present himselfe to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> he suffered his Disciples pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
to congratulate his comming by the name of King, and
told those that were offended at it, that their gratulation was so
necessary, as that if they should omit it, the stones in their default
would have performed it also. That he himselfe before <hi>Pilate,</hi>
maintained that he was a King, and at his death had his Crosse
(notwithstanding the Iewes opposed) adorned with the Title,
King of the Iewes: but when the people would have made him
King, he refused their officiousnes and would by no meanes accept
of that dignity from them: he would rather be without his right,
then receive it either in a wrong way, or from a wrong hand: no,
he would not at any of their instances so much as acknowledge
himselfe to be authorized for a judge or divider amongst them. So
little did he acknowledge any power in them to conferr crownes,
or to have superintendence over them. But it is true, that when
God had determined to make a division of the Kingdome of his
people, the first King of the ten Tribes was of the peoples making,
and was made in the way of reformation:<note place="margin">1. King. 12. 4.</note> but that you may know
it was only permitted by God, that so he might give that stiff-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people of the fruit of their owne hands, and make them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
unto others; he designed <hi>Ieroboam</hi> King, which neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing,
nor blessing, nor other ceremony then a rent: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
rent the new coate into twelve pieces, and when he had
done, he gave him none of them, but (as if he would shew he
should be a King in fact, not in right, in some way in which God
would own nothing but the permission only) he bad him (as one
would say) be his owne carver, and <hi>take ten peices to himselfe.</hi>
What the progresse of the story was we all know; when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had made a King of their own, then they and their King must
have a Religion of their own fitted to their new framed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to effect that, the old Priests of God must be sent away,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45044:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as absolute impediments to the setling of their new government:
and when that was done; then were they absolute indeed, and had
as much authority over their God, as they before had taken liberty
against their King: so it followed, that when the People had made
an usurper King, their King and they made a Calfe their God; and
the summe of the peoples reforming their Kings misgovernance,
and relieving their own grievances, was; they made them selves a
King that made them all castawaies: he himselfe the reproach of
Soveraignty, and an infamous stigmatique to all posterity, and his
sinnes for ever adhering to the People, till they had caused their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
extirpation, and till of free-borne Subjects under a King of
their own, they became perpetuall slaves to the Subjects of another
Kingdome. So unpleasing to God, and so pernitious to the people
themselves, are the fruits of those reformations which only or
principally are managed by the popular inclination, in which,
though for the most part a desire of doing justice, or preserving true
religion be pretended; yet private discontent in some, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in others, is commonly the chief and radicall incitement of the
work.</p>
            <p>The means that belongs to private men to use, for reforming of
Kingdoms,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 1.</note> is that which the Apostle shewes, <hi>Let prayers,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>and supplications be made for Kings and all that are in Authority,
that we may lead a Godly life.</hi> The people must not with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and puffed up mindes invade Gods peculiar right, of calling
Kings to account, but every man betaking himselfe to the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himselfe, and to prayers unto God, must seek of him (<hi>that
has the hearts of Kings in his hand</hi>) to dispose the Kings heart to
the desired reformation.<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note> Many think this way long and tedious,
and like better that the people should <hi>Offer themselves willingly,</hi>
and help God in some readier way. But truly if such private refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and prayer be the right means of publique good, and be
too long neglected, that is the peoples own fault; and they may
not by their fault, gaine a power which before they had not. Yet
true it is, that in great misgovernances, God often uses the peoples
hand, to doe his work of Iustice, but that we may know the way is
not right; as not agreeable to his revealed will; we shall finde that
the work of justice that he so beginneth by them, he endeth not
till he hath finished it on them, and his hand is never more heavy,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45044:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then against that rodd, that in the way of injustice, hath done his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
service. But will you heare God himselfe taking cognisance
of the misgovernance of Princes, and determining of it?</p>
            <p>In the 81. <hi>Psalme,</hi> God declares himselfe to <hi>stand in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Princes, and to be judge among Gods</hi> (so calleth he
Kings there.) Then he expostul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teth the matter with wicked
Princes, <hi>How long will ye give wrong judgement and accept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the wicked?</hi> Then he complaineth, <hi>They will not be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but walk on in darknesse, the foundations of the earth are out of
square.</hi> The misgovernance is great and the consequence of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
but does God in that case give the people power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme?
No clean contrary: God without any revocation still af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes,
<hi>I have said ye are Gods, and ye are all children of the most
high,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> persons sacred, not to be approached by the prophane hands
of the people: but to awe, and restraine Princes, he tells them,
that though he has made them Gods, yet <hi>they shall dye like men,</hi>
when they must make account to him of their misgoverning: so
that God reserves the judgement of them to himselfe, and no whit
authorises the people to have any thing to doe with their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeings.</p>
            <p>This is not to flatter Princes, to say God has appointed men no
meanes to relieve themselves against their misgovernment, but
only praiers, to be made either to them, or for them: and that men
have not otherwise to meddle with the right of liberty and duties
of Princes, then only by way of supplication. Nor is this a security
for Princes, for though in a lawfull and ordinate way there be no
other means, yet no examples are more familiar, then those in
which the sinne, the injustice, and violence of wicked Princes, are
in this world punished, by the sinne, injustice, &amp; violence of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people, sometimes their own, sometime others subjects, Gods
extraordinary and supream justice is tied to none of those regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with which he has circumscribed his ordinary justice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the administration of man, but (as we said before) we
may still observe Gods indignation, not more fatally incensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any, then against those whose wickednesse has put them
forward to be the instruments of his extraordinary justice upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>But to pursue the examination of the right that people may have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45044:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in questioning and reforming the rule of Kings. Let us farther exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what we find in Scripture. <hi>David</hi> sinning by numbring the
people, was enforced to his choice of one of three plagues, Famine,
Sword, or Pestilence; <hi>&amp; Deus malum avertat,</hi> this is but a dolefull
instance for the people. The King sinnes, and God laies all the
punishment upon the people: Nay he gives not them so much as
the choice of the punishment which they must suffer for the King,
but the sinning King must choose, which of the three plagues, the
innocent people must undergoe: this is strange, did not <hi>the great
judge of heaven and earth doe right?</hi> yes undoubtedly, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was; the wickednesse of the people had grievously provoked
God,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 1.</note> so as the King must be let goe, and suffered to fall into sinne,
that way may be made for the peoples punishment. This seems no
lesse strange on the other side; that because the people sinne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prince should be let fall: that for the transgressions of the
land, the Prince (as wee have it in another place) should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with division and diminution, and <hi>many should be the Princes
of the land:</hi> Nay, that for the sinne of the people, the Prince should
be cast away,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12. 25</note> as in that place, <hi>If ye doe wickedly ye shall perish, you
and your King.</hi> All this were strange indeed, should we consider
Prince, and people, as persons strangers in interest to one another:
but therefore these places shew the strict union, and indivisible
mutuality of interest, that they have in the doings and sufferings
each of other, beyond any thing that can be created by the meer
constitution or agreement of men.</p>
            <p>This case of <hi>Davids</hi> further teaches; that if when the sinnes of
the people be grown high, it be any way necessary that the King
be let fall into sinne before the People be punished: then are Kings
immediatly between God and the people, and stand there like
<hi>Moses</hi> in the gap, to with-hold the hand of God from the people,
untill that they also by falling someway be removed. Again if the
Kings transgression in government has the originall from the
sinnes of the people; then are the People the prime offendors, and
first agents in the Kings transgression, and He himselfe is as it were
accessary, and in a manner passive in it. We see that God himselfe
here judged so, and laid the reall punishment upon the people,
whom he accounted the originall sinners: as for the King (to
whom the sinne is verbally ascribed) we see God reckons, as if he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45044:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were only passive in committing it, and therefore inflicts no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
on him, but what he voluntarily took upon him, an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of himself, and a compassionate fellowfeeling of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
such as a good common father has alwaies by the sense of
his peoples suffering.</p>
            <p>It now followes plainly: that the people that have their hands
in sinne, are no competent Iusticiars for hearing, judging, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of any misdemeanours; especially of those in which they
themselves (having the principall hand) are the principalls; and
lesse, where the person questioned, is but an accessary, drawn in
by them: and least of all, where he is a person sacred, and one so
much superiour, as by Gods ordinance to stand immediatly betwixt
God and them, sure, he that would not suffer one with a beam in
his eye, to pull a moat out of the eye of his brother; does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to doe it toward one so much superiour as his Prince: nor
suffer guilty Subjects to arraigne their soveraigne; guilty servants,
their Lord; nor guilty sonnes their common father.</p>
            <p>To conclude, we may consider the unlawfulnesse of popular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversion
into the manners and government of Princes, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Princes that are lawfull Christian Monarchs) even in this
alone, that there are no received, nor known bounds of limitation,
how farre people may walk in the way of questioning and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the errours of Princes, but that if any thing at all be lawfull for
them to doe therein, then may they without restraint proceed so
farre as to depose Princes, and deprive them of their lives, if (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the doctrine of the Iesuite) they finde it for the good
and reformation of the Church and Commonwealth, which how
well it is warranted by the word of God, we may see plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in the case between <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> was King, but, misgoverning himself and the Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as bad as excommunicate and deposed:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 23. &amp; 16. 13.</note> for he was rejected of
God, and <hi>David</hi> was by Gods expresse command annoynted to be
King, all which notwithstanding; neither <hi>David</hi> nor the people
ever sought to depose him; to renounce obedience unto him; to
combine against him; question his government, or so much as med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with ordering any of the affaires that belonged to the King.
Nay, <hi>Saul</hi> after this persecuted <hi>David</hi> unjustly, and in the midst
of his unjust and hostile persecution, was delivered into Davids
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45044:9"/>
hand, and it was of necessity that <hi>David</hi> should take the advantage
and kill him, for he could not otherwise have any assurance of his
owne life: <hi>David</hi> did then but even cut of the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the end it might witnesse his faithfull loyalty, because it
made it manifest he could as easily have cut the thread of his life;
and even for this, his heart so smote him, as that he cries out, <hi>The
Lord forbid that I should doe this thing to my Maister the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
to stretch forth my hand against him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 24. 5.</note> That was not all nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but there were more circumstances in the case, <hi>Saul</hi> was
not yet reformed, and going on still, was another time delivered
into <hi>Davids</hi> hands, and the people both times understood it, the
speciall delivery of his enemy into his hands by God, and would
have embraced the opportunity and have made him away: <hi>David</hi>
restraines them still with the same bridle; <hi>The Lord forbid &amp;c.</hi> and
tells them,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 26. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Who can lay his hands on the Lords annointed and be
guiltlesse? No, David</hi> (though already annointed) would tary
Gods time, <hi>the Lord should smite Saul,</hi> or <hi>his day should come, or he
should descend into battaile and perish,</hi> but <hi>Davids</hi> hand should not
be against him. No whatsoever <hi>Saul</hi> was, or whatsoever he had
done; neither his falling from God, nor Gods declaring him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
nor <hi>Davids</hi> annointing by Gods command, nor <hi>Sauls</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
persecution of <hi>David</hi> the Lords annointed in future, could
dissolve the duty of his Subjects, nor make it lawfull for them to
lay their hands on him, no not when he was in wicked hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. But <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> account, was still the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
still a sacred person, still <hi>Davids</hi> maister, notwithstanding
the circumstances which might seeme to have discharged the tyes
of duty which <hi>David</hi> and the people did formerly owe unto him.</p>
            <p>Neither is the annointing of Kings a thing sacred as to their own
Subjects only: but the regard thereof is required at the hands of
strangers also, because of the prophanation and sacriledge that in the
violation of their persons is committed even against God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we see that though the <hi>Amalekite</hi> were a stranger, and made
a faire pretence, that he had done <hi>Saul</hi> a good office, when at his
own request he dispatched him of the paine of his wounds, and of
the pangs of his approaching death: yet <hi>David</hi> (taking his fact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne confession) makes a slight account of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which he pretended, as a frivolous extenuation of an haynous
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45044:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fact, and condemnes him, though a stranger, as an hainous Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
against the Majesty of God. <hi>How wert thou not afraid</hi> (saith
he) <hi>to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the Lords annointed?</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his being a stranger, nor any of the other circumstances were
so availeable, but that his bloud fell deservedly upon his own head.
The act is in it selfe perfectly wicked, and in the degree hainous;
altogether against the word of God: and therefore all actions of
Subjects, that in the progresse of them tend, or by the way threaten
to arrive at that upshot, are all unlawfull, fowle, and wicked; and
not only the actors themselves wicked, but their assistants, favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
those that wish them well, or (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes) <hi>That bid
them God speed, are partakers of their evill deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But errour in this point, has made such impressions in the mindes
of many, as that they will never be perswaded, but that they may
disobey and resist Authority, if ever they finde it faulty, or the
commaunds thereof not agreeing with their consciences. They
will grant, that they may not disobey Authority in the lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
thereof, neither doe evill that good may come thereon: but
then, they themselves will be the judges what commaunds are
lawfull, and what not; what things good, and what evill; &amp; so they
make obedience arbitrary, and government (by pretending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science)
at the discretion of the Subject: yea, though the things
whereat they take check, be of their own nature indifferent, or
doubtfull, (and therefore not matters of faith) yet will not they
submit themselves, nor their opinions unto any, no not to the
judgement of the Church they live in, no not to the judgement of
the Church Catholique, nor to the authority of it, even in the purest
times thereof. But they from the authority of their own opinions,
or from the authority of such Teachers, as they themselves have
chosen to themselves to be their guides, they will both censure,
condemne, disobey, and revile the Ordinances of their Church,
and the Governours thereof, so secure in opposing imaginary, or at
least unproved superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they will not see how incompatible,
self-will, presumption, disobedience, arrogance and railing are
with true Religion, nor that the false Teachers, and their Disciples
(which our Saviour and his Apostles foretold should be in the <hi>last
and perilous times,</hi> and which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<hi>Corah</hi> was, that he (being a Levite, and countenanced by an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Princes of the assembly, famous in the Congregation,<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note>
and at least fourteen thousand seven hundred of the people) upon
his own private opinion (to which also his followers adhered)
that both he, and all the Congregation were holy, and might offer
incense before the Lord as well as <hi>Aaron,</hi> Charged <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> that they tooke too much upon them, and that they exalted
themselves above <hi>the Congregation of the Lord,</hi> and therefore they
holding themselves in a parity of authority with them, would not
appeare on their Summons, nor be obedient unto them. Yet (as if
these passages of Scripture nothing concerned our times) we are
nothing shie of those things whereof they doe admonish us.</p>
            <p>There be some, that justifie, that private men may resist autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
when it would doe that which is hurtfull to the Church of
God, yea, that it is then their duty to resist it, that such resistance is
no disobedience, no rebellion, no sinne at all. These swallow that
which may not be granted, <hi>viz:</hi> that they are competent Iudges
of the Churches hurt, and besides they make the rule that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
gave us for discovering teachers of false Doctrine to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth.<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16.</note> Our Saviour tells us, we <hi>shall know them by their
fruits,</hi> as granting fruit to be a thing apparant, knowne of all and
unchangeable: but these men make the fruit to alter according to
the diversity of the tree that beares it, though otherwise it have the
same shape, taste, and vertue. For example: disobedience, resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of authority, sedition, and rebellion, are by the law of God,
and by the law of nature, agreed both by Christians and Heathens
to be evill fruits. But these men (and Iesuites) tell us that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45044:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
authority, and raising force against it, thereby to worke the
good and safety of the Church of God, though done by Subjects,
is no resistance, no rebellion, no sinne. The fruit has lost his own
nature, which in it selfe was nought, and takes a new nature of
goodnes, because it was brought forth by the good tree of piety
toward the Church of God. So our Saviours precept is made of no
effect, and we must learne of the Iesuite, to un-know a knowne
thing, and know it for some other thing, then ever we knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and that by a new way too; <hi>viz:</hi> by that which is not to be
known of it selfe. We must know the fruit by the tree.</p>
            <p>We deny not, but that authority may commaund things, that by
no meanes at all ought to be done, and that then we must not doe
them: but those things are such as are manifestly contrary to the
expresse word of God, and principles of Religion. And even in
them we are only simply to refuse the doing of the evill commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
without any actuall resistance otherwise, and so doing, our not
obeying, is not to be counted disobedience; because it being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
obedience to the expresse word of God, the primitive Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
of all authority: it can never be disobedience as to the deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
But where authority commaunds nothing against the expresse
word of God, and principles of Religion (as in things disputable it
doth not) there, except the Governours that are the derivative be
obeyed, God, the primitive is disobeyed. For he strictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
obedience to his Vice-gerents, even in every ordinance of
man.</p>
            <p>But we are also to take heed we play not the hypocrites with
God. When thinking to doe a good office to the Church or State,
we resist authority, that presses us with that, which (as we suppose)
threatens depravation of true Religion, or due liberty. For what
know we but that by <hi>wrongfull suffering</hi> (whereto all are called)
God calls us to a tryall of our faith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 21.</note> patience, and obedience in that
way, which if we doe not shew by keeping close to his command,
not turning on the left hand to doe any evill though commanded,
nor on the right hand to resist authority with violence, although
it hath commanded evill, we then refuse Gods tryall, and with an
unseasonable zeale for Religion, and for our wordly rights, we
contrary to Gods commaund resist his lawfull Vice-gerents, &amp; the
excuse we have for it, is little better then like the Pharisees, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45044:11"/>
say <hi>Corban, God shall have profit by it in the good that we shall doe
his Church thereby,</hi> and <hi>make the precept of God of no effect;</hi> and
antevert the glory that god seemed to seeke in our tryall: And
having so justified our resistance, we must then call it pious, and an
act of duty, and such as God requires, and so make God the author
of our sinne, and lodge it where we can never repent us of it.</p>
            <p>There may undoubtedly be such pressures laid upon Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as that humanity cannot but commiserate, and perhaps in some
part excuse their impatience and resisting of them. But the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of the case cannot make the resistance lawfull, though we
remit much to the doers, we must yet condemne the fact; and
though their sufferings wash away much of the soile that would
make both the deed and the doers more odious, yet must they be
content to confesse the deed to be evill. But to justifie it, were to
commit the accursed sinne of calling <hi>good evill, and evill good;</hi> yea,
the sacrilegious sinne of making God weake and wicked, who for
the necessary support of his Church, should stand in need, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not only the helpe of sinfull men, but even of their sinnes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Private men, in things not plainly forbidden, cannot say they
resist not authority, but sinne: not the lawfull power, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnes
of them which abuse it: for they have no authority to
distinguish. And if they offer to pull the mote out of the Governours
eye, they will put a beame into their owne. For though we be
every one tyed to resist sinne in our selves that we commit it not;
yet are we not every one tyed to resist it in others, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it not; and we must leave every thing to be rectified by those
only, to whom it properly belongs; and where there is no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
meanes of reforming, there God has reserved that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
case unto himselfe, and we must not justle him out of his
tribunall.</p>
            <p>We might in this place remember also what infinite doubts, and
questions (perpetually ensnaring and wounding the consciences of
private men, and with continuall disturbance and divisions threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ruine of the State) doe follow the admitting of this one
opinion: that when other remedies faile, Subjects in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
may leavy Armes, and defend their Lawes, Liberties, and
Religion, against the oppressors of them. For what shall be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
necessity? and who shall be judge of it? what way, and how
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45044:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
farr may Subjects so proceed? who shall commaund? &amp;c. But it
is impossible to set forth all the branchings and consequents of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
or the confusions that follows upon them. We might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
remember, what dangerous straines and snares these opinions
are to those that have taken expresse oaths of obedience and
allegiance; but we hope, that this shall be hint enough to stirr men
up to take heed, how they entertain such opinions: and if already
they have been led away with them, they make a more advised
examination of the matter, and like good Christians be content
(whatsoever censure fall upon their actions past, or whatsoever
diminution upon their present esteem) they will yet submit, that
Gods truth may not be corrupted, nor his holinesse blasphemed,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>
but that, as the Psalmist faies, <hi>he may be justified in his sayings and be
cleere when he is judged,</hi> yea that God may be found <hi>true and every
man a lyar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not all this while contend that Princes are without law,
we have in the entrance of our discourse shown the contrary: and
we doubt not but that the rights &amp; maners of Kingdoms, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously
to be observed as well of the Prince as of the People: that
the establishment of a Kingdom depends upon the observance of
the rights thereof, as well by the one, as by the other: and that
the Rights, and Maner of every Kingdom is as sacred as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
it selfe. When God layd a curse upon those that removed
the bounds between private man and private man, he left not the
bounds of publique right (in which all private right is included)
open to secure violation: but what was wicked in the one case he
accounted hainous in the other, as carrying with it, not only the
transitory fortunes, but even the lives and soules of the People.
And for this cause, when God finds in <hi>Princes the sinne of those
that remove the bounds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea. 5. 10.</note> he threatens that he will <hi>Powre out his
wrath on them like water.</hi> It will not be unworthy our labour a
little to enquire into the reason.</p>
            <p>Tyranny (as we have touched) began first in the Eastern parts,
and thence dispersed it selfe through the world. And being from
the beginning greivous, and incomportable, in time it discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it self to be but weak. Withall it was supposed, that the grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousnesse
of it consisted in the Monarchall forme, for remedy of
which they instituted, in some places Aristocraticall, in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45044:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Popular government, But in the use of them, they all also were
discerned to be but other faces of the same tyranny: and men
found plainly, that the absolute government of either People, or
Nobles, was as well obnoxious unto tyranny, as the sole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Prince: and that in which of the three soever the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
absolutly resided, the government was both tyrannicall
and infirme: and that in every of them the comportablenesse and
stability depended only on the well regulating of the soveraigne
power, by a reasonable interposition of some power committed
into the hands of the two other potent limbs. So it became an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
principle among Statists; that the composite forme
(wherein every of the three potent limbs, for the surer support
of the instituted State, had such apportioned influence and power
as was proper for the frame of government) was the only firme
and durable forme; and that of the three powers, Regall, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall,
or Popular, any of them prevailing so far, as to be
wholy free from being qualified or tempered by some operation of
the other two, corrupted the legitimate form into a tyrannicall, and
made a prognostick of the States declining into ruine. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of State is not impeached by any instance of long continuance
of the old <hi>Assyrian,</hi> or present <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, because the
<hi>Assyrian</hi> had a peculiar advantage of continuance, by the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and unactivenesse of the age it was in. And the <hi>Turks</hi> to
worke their security and continuance, have wholy put out the
light of knowledge from among their people, and have subdued
them to a false Religion, that has in it selfe no other end, nor office,
then only to keep men in subjection; so that they having depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themselves of the principall of all conditions of humanity, and
made themselves (in a manner) an Empire of beasts, the successe
of their affaires determines nothing of the event of theirs, that
ayme to live as men; much lesse of theirs, who are to live the lives
of supernaturall men, that is to say of Christians.</p>
            <p>Absolute power then, when it hath neither bound, nor limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
(like the naturall heat too much enforced, which soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures
the radicall moisture that maintaines it) tends not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
but to the distruction of itselfe. For all things being created
in number, weight, and measure, the destruction of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
must needs be the decay of their being.<note place="margin">Eccles. 36. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Where there is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45044:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no inclosure</hi> (saith the wise man) <hi>there the possession goes to decay.</hi>
For though one, by decaying his fence, gives himselfe liberty
to prey upon his neighbours, (which seems some advantage) yet
he thereby layes himselfe open to be a prey also unto them; and
when after he would close it again, he will find it hard to shut un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
beasts out from the haunt they have once gotten. Now for
preservation of the bounds and fences of a Kingdom, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
not only to have just and equitable lawes, but it must have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an institution of good and sound orders, for the making and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
of those Lawes: which orders must be sacredly observed.
for as evill words corrupt good manners; so evill manners fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the effect of all good lawes; and good manners (especially
those that belong to government) are not preserved without strict
adherence to the instituted orders of the Kingdom. Neither will
those orders long continue valid and of use, unlesse the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and care of them be committed into the hands of some conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory
power, more especially interessed in the continuance of
them. Who though not absolutely, nor with any single power of
immediate coertion, yet by their powerfull intercession in the
Councells, and convocate Assemblies of the State, may be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
operative to the preservation of the publike right, for which
cause the use of these Assemblies are by no meanes long to be
neglected.</p>
            <p>When then the continuance and prosperity of every State, stands
upon no surer ground, then the observance of the Rights and Orders
of the Kingdome: upon no better stand the lives and fortunes of
the Subject, of the Prince, and Royall race; yea, and of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Church of God himselfe. And it is then no marvaile
that God should threaten to <hi>powre out his wrath like water on Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that are like to those that remove the bounds.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea. 5. 10.</note> It is no marvaile
that to the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> (to whom God (no question) with a
promise of perpetuity, gave the most absolute dominion that has
beene communicable to the Princes of his Church) he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Execute Yee judgement and righteousnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 22. 3. 7.</note> &amp;c: <hi>for then shall

but otherwise, <hi>I will prepare destroyers against thee.</hi> It is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
consequence that makes God not give the charge without
threatning. Though God declares Princes to be Gods among men,

yet between him and them, God (as <hi>David</hi> confesses) has

condition of their reigning.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 23. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bear rule</hi> (saith <hi>God</hi> to <hi>David</hi>)
<hi>over men, being just, and ruleing in the feare of God.</hi> Indeed
when Princes derive their authority from <hi>Christ,</hi> and justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng
the prerogative of his vice-gerents, it well behoves them
to looke that the derivatives faile not of the condition of their
primitive.<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Scepter of Christs Kingdome is</hi> declared to
be <hi>a right Scepter,</hi> and therefore <hi>his seat to endure for ever.</hi>
If his vice-gerents would have their seates durable, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
must have care their Scepters be right Scepters: they must
see that the aunciently-established Formes and Orders of their
Kingdomes be not violated or neglected, but from time to
time renewed and kept: they must not, to be absolute, breake
the Rights, and Orders of the Kingdome, and thinke to be
good and just Princes in their Arbitrary Rule: it were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
incongruity, and nothing suitable to the vice-gerents
of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be good and faire Governours of that which they
have made a tyrannicall government. The Governours and
government must have one face and way, their rule cannot
otherwise escape infamy; not their providence cut off occasion
from after times of invading the Rights, and consequently the
continuance of their Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>The Lawes then, the Rights, and Orders of Kingdomes, are
most sacred, and binding, even to Kings themselves: but that
is to be understood, in Safety, in Honour, in Conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and them: not in any way, wherein, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault,
the people can become authorized. For if we looke to
what is written, we find that when Subjects doe amisse, they
ought to feare,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> for the Ruler is <hi>Gods minister to take vengeance,
and beareth not the sword in vaine.</hi> But we read of no authority
committed to the people, in case the Prince failes of his Duty;
nor of any sword that is to be born by them: if therefore they
take the sword, or any course that leades unto it, they take
the sword of injustice to the wounding of their own soules.
But while we name the people in these things, we doe not
make all Subjects, living under the obedience of Soveraignes,
naturally to have this protence, that they may doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45044:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
right, in case their Prince doe not.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8. 5.</note> For as we see them
of their owne naturall inclination to desire a King, so we know
they naturally submit unto his government. And Prince, and
people, of themselves stand naturally well-affected one to
the other. But as there are those that are sinisterly officious to
the one, so are there toward the other also. And as those often
counsell the Prince, as if they would have him pull out the
stones from out the foundation of his Throne, to build higher the
roofe and enlarge the battlements thereof: so these often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the people, that they have the authority of Princes,
though they have neither Throne, Scepter, nor any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Sovereigne right: these find pretences, and broach opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in the peoples behalfe; and then the people naturally jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and impatient of the violation of their supposed Right or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
are facile to entertaine suggestions, and through want of
judgment easily carryed away with them; but wanting also mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
they so violently adhere unto them, as that with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
prosecution, they often by their owne instruments
bring upon themselves the evills that they most doe feare from
others.</p>
            <p>So the people of <hi>Rome</hi> having expelled their Kings and setled
a Republique with such hatred to the memory of them, as that
they would not endure the name of King: growing afterward
ill satisfied with the proceedings of their Senate, they would
not only have Tribunes, (Guardians of their Liberty, and Rights,)
which was indeed no more then necessary, but they would
have their Tribunes indued with <hi>Consular</hi> authority; then with
that of the <hi>Dictator;</hi> of the <hi>Pontifex Max:</hi> and whatsoever
other power the common-wealth afforded. In the end, they
made them so unresistable, to vindicate their Liberty against
the Nobles, and the Senate, as that in the upshot, when they
were become secure against their adverse party, they had
no meanes of interposition against the absolutenes of their
own Guardians. Insomuch as that <hi>Caesar,</hi> obtaining to be
head of their Faction, could not be hindered, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
under the formes which they ordained to preserve their
Liberty, he introduced a Tyranny more absolute, and worse
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45044:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conditioned, then was that of their Kings, which they
expelled.</p>
            <p>Hitherto tends the Doctrines of those, who while they
pretend to instruct for the common good, Liberty, and Right;
doe as it were appeale unto the people, and support
their doctrines with the peoples approbation and
applause, and do so, in shew, make the
people, and indeed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the soveraigne
judges of all
