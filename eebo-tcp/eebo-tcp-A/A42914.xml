            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>in the week days with due reſpect,</l>
                  <l>Think not the time ill ſpent all you</l>
                  <l>that count your ſelves as Gods Elect:</l>
                  <l>As well as on the Sabbath-day,</l>
                  <l>as I have done, as you do know,</l>
                  <l>For I to you may truly ſay,</l>
                  <l>I find the comfort of it now.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let none Gods Ordinance condemn,</l>
                  <l>the means of their Salvation,</l>
                  <l>Let not the Devil prevail with them,</l>
                  <l>to bring them to Damnation:</l>
                  <l>I praiſe my God in all my grief,</l>
                  <l>I never left my hold of Grace,</l>
                  <l>When other folks are bent to ſtrife,</l>
                  <l>I held the Church the chiefeſt place.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And therefore mind me what I ſay,</l>
                  <l>before your Glaſs be run,</l>
                  <l>Though other people go aſtray,</l>
                  <l>go forward as you have begun:</l>
                  <l>And meddle not with them that are</l>
                  <l>contentious any kind of way,</l>
                  <l>But ever let it be your care,</l>
                  <l>Gods Holy Ordinance to obey.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For thoſe that will not ſerve him here,</l>
                  <l>in Heaven ſhall never dwell,</l>
                  <l>Therefore my friends now have a care,</l>
                  <l>that you may eſcape the pains of Hell:</l>
                  <l>So farewel friends, farewel to all,</l>
                  <l>i'm going to a better place,</l>
                  <l>Let not the Devil bring you to thrall,</l>
                  <l>nor fondly loſe your hold of Grace.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Lord Ieſus Chriſt receive my Soul,</l>
                  <l>I do bequeath the fame to thee,</l>
                  <l>O Lord forgive my ſins moſt foul,</l>
                  <l>and ſo to Heaven paſſed ſhe:</l>
                  <l>And ſo departed ſhe in peace,</l>
                  <l>to heaven, with Angels to remain,</l>
                  <l>The Lord above gave her releaſe,</l>
                  <l>from her afflictions, grief, and pain.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let people mind her dying words,</l>
                  <l>if in Heaven they would live,</l>
                  <l>Her Life and Death ſo much affords,</l>
                  <l>and Heavenly comfort now doth give:</l>
                  <l>O Lord give us all Grace, that we</l>
                  <l>may live to him, and dye to ſin,</l>
                  <l>Our life and death ſhall happy be,</l>
                  <l>though in a wicked world we've been.</l>
