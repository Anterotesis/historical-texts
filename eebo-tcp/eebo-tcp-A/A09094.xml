            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The one, for that it séemed to me, both conceued and penned, with such modestie and humilitie of spirite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with al dutiful respect, to your highnes, to your honorable Lordes of the Counsaile, and to the whole estate of your noble Realme, (contrarye to the spirite and procéedings of al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The other cause was, for that it séemed to me, to contayne matter of great and weightie consideration, and much important, not onelye to the cause of God, but also to your Maies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties soule, estate, and Realme, and vnto the state of many a thowsand of your graces most louing, faithful, and dutiful subiectes: who being now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for their consciences, and brought to such extremitie, as neuer was hard of in England before, haue no other meanes to redresse and ease their miseries, but onely as confident children to runne vnto the mercy and clemency of your Highnes their Mo

al the rest (hauing begotten and bred vp the other, and deliuered to them this Realme, conserued by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion, these thowsand yeares and more:) soe did they alwayes hope to receaue more fauour then the rest, or at leaste wyse, equall tolleration with other religions disalowed by the state. But God knoweth, it hath fallen out quite contrarye.

But the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion, hath bene soe beaten in, with the terror of lawes, and the rigorous execution of the same, as the verye suspition thereof, hath not escaped vnpunished.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> albeit the world doth know, how that the great mercye and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of your Maiestie, hath stayed often times, and restrayned these pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, from their execution, and from the ouerthrowinge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

(as I haue sayd) there wante not verye pitiful examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, which would moue greately, and make to bléed that Princely and compassionable harte of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if their miseries in particuler were knowen to the same: especially it beinge in such subiectes, as loued and doe loue most tenderly your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie: and for such a cause, as lyethe not in them to remoue, that is, for their conscience and iudgement in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

But at this time present, and for certaine monethes past, the tempeste hath bene so terrible vppon these kinde of men, and their persecutions so vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal, as the lyke was neuer felte, nor feared before. For besides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral<note place="margin">Particuler ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</note> molestation, and castinge into geales, both of men, women, and children, of that religion, throughe out all partes of your Maiestyes Realmes: there are certayne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers reported here, which make the matter more afflictiue.

for religion. And that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other thinges is most grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, iniurious, and intollerable, is, the geuinge out publiquelye, that all Catholiques are enemies and traytors to your Royall Maiestye: and this not onely to vtter in speach, but also to let it passe in print, to the vewe of the worlde, and to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of Catholiques hartes, which are preuye of their owne truthe and dutifull affection towardes your Highenes, estate, and person. This was wryten and putt in printe this<note place="margin">Iohn Feild in his epistle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorye of Philip of Mor neis booke to the Earle of Leycester.</note> Sommer paste, to a Noble man of your Maiesties preuye Counsayle, for the excitinge of him to the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all Catholiques, by a straunge braynesicke felowe, whom Newegate possessed a longe tyme, for his phantastical opinions: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is soe pregnant (if men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte truelye,) as he can deuyse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye newe religion, vppon a wéekes warninge geuen him at anye tyme.

This Felow affirmeth there, that al Papistes (as he termeth them) are enemies to God, and to your Roial Maiesty.

to him, it shal be soe accounted at the last day. Which thinge, hath made al good men from time to time, to stand very scrupulously in defence of their conscience, and not to commit anye thing, against the sentence and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the same. Al Princes also, and Potentates of the world, haue abstayned from the beginninge, for the verye same consideration, from<note place="margin">Actes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not to be enforced.</note> enforcinge men to actes against their conscience, especially in religion: as the Histories both before Christ and since, doe declare. And amongest the very Turkes at this day, no man is compelled to any act of their religion, excepte he renounce firste his owne.

feare of tormentes, myghte by youre obiection, saye that they dyd it not willynglye but by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of tormentes, and therfore were not to be damned for it. But yet Chryste sayde, that he would take it as done voluntarylye, and therfore damne them for it, by denyinge them openlye before his Father, and hys Angels, at the<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> daye of iudgemente. And yet to<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> geue an other example néerer to oure matter: Saynte John sayeth of the noble men and gentilemen<note place="margin">Io. 12.</note> of Jurye in hys tyme. <hi>Manye of the princypall men dyd beleue in Chryste, but they did not confesse hym outwardlye for feare of the Pharises leste they shoulde be caste out of the Synagoge, for they dyd loue more the glorye of men then the glorye of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we sée the acte of these noble men and Gentyle men: also the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion to the acte, the cause of their compulsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; lastly S. Johns iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t upon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acte.


<pb facs="tcp:2535:40"/>
The acte, whereof they are accused is onely houlding their peace, and not confessing Christ ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, according as they did inwardlye beléeue of him: The cause or excuse that they had to laye for them selues, was, the feare of the Pharises or Magistrats which compelled them against their wil soe to doe. Now, what punishment they feared at the Pharisies handes S. John expresseth, saying, that it was. <hi>Lest they should be cast out of their Synagoge.</hi> The which punishment<note place="margin">What a great matter it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ie wes to be cast owt of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</note> was then, and is now at this day, amongest the Jewes, the greatest punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, besides death, that can be deuised. For he looseth thereby al offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, dignities, and credit whatsoeuer: noe man may buye or sel with him: noe man may visite him, or talke with him, or salute him in the streates. Finally, it is a death vpon earth (a great and sufficient excuse a man would thincke) to answer for a mans silence onely. For I sée manye a one in England, not onelye to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2535:40"/>
their owne consciences, but also to speake against the same for a lesse cause. But what is Saynt Johns iudgement vpon the matter? for sooth he accepteth not the excuse, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them in a damnable mortal<note place="margin">A seuere iudg ment geeuen by S.

That by this silence of thers they did put the glorye of God behynd the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of men, and thereby shewed that they loued men, better then God, Noe doubt but to their euerlastinge damnation, except they hartelye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them.

be layed vppon them, at the daye of iudgement, but vpon the Prince and<note place="margin">A bad shift of dissemblers.</note> the Magistrats, which compel them to doe the same against their owne willes. But what compulsion this is, and how furre it shal excuse their doings, I haue now declared. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hereafer let noe man saye, that he goeth to Church against his wil, thincking thereby to excuse him selfe from schisme.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, to proue it schisme, yea, and that obstinate and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous schisme, it were sufficient to knowe that the meaninge, wil, and commaundement, of the general and vniuersal Catholicke Church at this day, is, that Catholicke men should not present them selues to Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes Churches, or conuenticles, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are denounced open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to the foresayde Church, and their religion hath bene as orderlye condemned in the last general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent, As the doctrine of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius was, in the first general Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2535:41"/>
of Nice. And albeit the Councel of Trent made noe particuler decrée of this matter, yet is their noe cause, whye any man should take any hould thereat: séeing the reason there of was<note place="margin">Can. Apost 63. 44. 45. apud Eus. li. 7. caq. 9.</note> because such a decrée was néedles: for the Church hauing alredye condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the beginninge al prayinge with Heretykes, or reparing to their conuenticles: it was sufficient for the councel onely to condemne the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes for such men, without anye<note place="margin">what the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cel of Trent determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout goinge to churche.</note> further particuler prohibitinge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to come to their Churches, and seruice, séeing their conuenticles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once pronounced to be heretical, the other was to be presupposed.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2535:57"/>
seruice whiche nowe Protestantes haue, and thereupon doe refrayne from it, as much as Catholicks. But I wil geue more perticuler reasons, as foloweth.</p>
                  <p>First the scripture is read there in<note place="margin">3. False transs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> false and shameles translations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning manifest and wilful corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to drawe it to their owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, as hath bene shewed in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, by manye learned men in their worckes: and is lyke to be (shortly) more playnlye by the grace of God. As for example, throughe out the scripture, where Idoles are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they translate it Images, as in Sainte Iohn they reade. <hi>Children<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.</note> keepe your selues from Images.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas the scripture sayeth Idoles: And this is, to make simple men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that Idoles and Images are al one, which is absurde. For then, where Moyses sayethe: <hi>That God<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> made man accordinge to his owne Image.</hi> We should consequently say:


<pb facs="tcp:2535:58"/>
God made man accordinge to hys owne Idole. Againe, where in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie maner S. Paule sayth. <hi>That<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> a couetous man maketh his mony his Idole.</hi> We shoulde saye, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, his Image. The which howe foolishe it is, euerye man seethe, and it can not stande with anye sence of the Scripture. The like absurde translations they haue, in infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, which I cannot stande to rehearse. Let some man reade the latter ende of the xy. chapter of the second booke of the Machabies, where he shal see what labour their Inglishe translatour taketh to shifte ouer the woordes of the Scripture, which talk<note place="margin">2Macha. 12.</note> of oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and prayers for the dead: and by that one place, let euerye man iudge of his fidelitie in the reste. For<note place="margin">See the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe Byble de dycated to Kynge Henry.</note> I am sure, that if a Boye should soe corrupte Tullies epistles, in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge them in a Grammer Scoole, he should be bréeched for his labour. The Scripture therfore, being read there, in false translations, it muste néedes


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2535:58"/>
seme to be false, which is blasphemis against the holy Ghost the indyter of them. Soe that by this, it appeareth, that, that part of their seruice which they pretende to be Scripture, is no Scripture, because it is by the malice of the interpretour false, the whiche Scripture can not be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the seruice that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">4.

                  <p>I beleue and confesse, that it is not lawful, for any Christian, to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant, nether in spirit nor body, at the Sacrifices of idolatours, nor also to enter into their Temples, whilst they are doeing their idolatries and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,

excepte it be to rebuke them, in shewinge them their abuses, and to teach them the truth, as the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophets haue done, and not for to dissemble as hipocrites. For if the body be a creature of God, (as it is) as the soule is the temple of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and member of the mistical bodye of Christ: and if it must one day rise agayne, and possesse the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lyfe with the soule: It must also necessarily be, that it be altogether ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the seruice of God, in this world, with the soule and spirite: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they can not be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the general resurrection: but being seperated, the one should be in heauen with God, whom he loued, and the other in hel, with the deuil whom he serued, the which is an impossible thinge.

                     <pb facs="tcp:2535:76"/>First, it foloweth of the premises,<note place="margin">The first Con clusion.</note> that this goeing to the Protestantes Churches, is forbidden not onely by the positiue lawes of the Church, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable by the Church againe: but also by Gods lawe, and the lawe of Nature, as the consideration of most of the reasons, dothe declare.

Wherfore, that which hath bene geuen out (as is sayde by some great men) that the Pope by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to her Maiestie, did offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the seruice of England, vppon condition that the title of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie might be restored him againe, is impossible to be soe: soe that, if anye such letters came to hir Maiesties handes, they must néedes be fayned and false.</p>

haue geuen diuers other causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Scandal, which make it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Wherof it foloweth, that a man cannot goe to their Churches, albeit he might goe in such secrete manner, or otherwise haue their seruice in his howse soe priuelye, as no Scandal should follow therof, or any man knowe therof, (which is notwithstanding impossible to do) but if it could be, yet were the thing vnlawfull, especiallye for the. 1. 4. 5. 6. 7. reasons before alledged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdely</hi> it followeth, that a<note place="margin">The 3. Conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion.</note> man maye not goe to Church vnder anye vayne pretence, as pretending that he goeth only for obedience, and not for anye lyking he hath to their seruice: yea, although he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teste the same openly. For that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation should rather agrauate then diminishe the sinne. Séeing by this protestation, he should testifie vnto the whole worlde, that he did a thing against his Conscience. As if a man


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2535:77"/>
should proteste, that he did thinke<note place="margin">A protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil not serue.</note> that to rayle against the Pope, at Pouls Crosse, were nought, and yet for obedience sake, (being soe commaunded) would doe it. The which was Pilates case, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested first, that he thought Christe<note place="margin">Math. 27.</note> innocent, and therfore sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him: but in the ende (fearing<note place="margin">Pilates Case</note> the displeasure of the Iewes, and their complaynte to the Emperour) washed his handes, and soe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him: thinking by that protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to haue washed of the sinne, and to haue layd it on the Iewes neckes, which compelled him therto. But (I think) by this time he hath felt, that he was deceaued. For when a thing in it selfe is nought, noe protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can make it lawful, but rather maketh the doing of it a greter offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by adding to the vnlawfulnes of the<note place="margin">Marke this ob iection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But you wil perhapes saye: to goe to the material Church, is not a thing euil of it selfe. I aunswer and


<pb facs="tcp:2535:78"/>
that it is true. But you must not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out the matter soe. For in this<note place="margin">How manye things contay ned in goinge to Churche.</note> one action of goeing to Church, there be many thinges contayned, whereof the whole action is compounded. As for example, there is the materiall Church: the possession of the same by the enemye of the Catholicke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the seruice and sermons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the same religion: the dayes and houres appoynted for the same: the bel ringing and publikely calling al men thither: the Princes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for the Catholickes to goe to the same: the end of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, that they, by goeing, should pray with them, allow of their seruice, and by their presence honour it. Then is there the peril of infection: the scandale whereby I offende other mens consciences: and perhaps bring dyuers others to be corrupted by my meanes: the dishonoring of God his cause: the honoringe of his enemies cause: hearing God blasphemed, and houlding my peace: Semblably there


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2535:78"/>
is the conscience of the Catholicke, that thinketh he doth nought: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Church, that it is not lawful: the matter now in tryal: and the vnlawfulnes of it, defended both by worde and wrytinges of learned men, and by imprisonment of manye other: the controuersie now knowen to al the world, and many thousande mens eyes fixed vpon them, that are called in question for it: the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, whereas he estéemed nothing of goeing to Church before, yet now soe desirous to obtayne it, that he thinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the yelding in that one pointe, to be a sufficient yelding to al his desirs: the which thing on the other side, is so detested of the true Catholickes, that, whoe soe euer yeldeth to this, they thincke him a flat Scismatycke, and so abhorre him. And by this meanes the matter is made a signe distinctiue betwixt religion and religion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of agiane it foloweth, that if the thing were much lesse then it is, (as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the houldinge vp of a finger)


<pb facs="tcp:2535:79"/>
yet because it is made, Tessera, a marke, token, or signe, of yelding to their procéedings in religion, it were vtterly vnlawful. As if a man should but lift vp a straw to the deuil, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of obedience, it were as much, as if he did, worde by worde, deny his Créede. These poyntes, and manye moe that might be thought of, beinge put together, and one entyer action made of them, the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this entyre action of goeinge to Church, with these anneres, be of it selfe vnlawful or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and euery wise man wil thincke it is. Nether, if you could by some deuise, plucke from this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one or two of these thinges, must we thincke that by and by the action were lawful. As for example, if by a protestation you could signifie that your mynd were not in goeinge thether, to consente to their seruice: as also, that the Princesse mynde to you in particuler, were only that you shoulde goe for temporall obedience sake, yet were not by this al the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2535:79"/>
amended. For if a péece of meate were venemous for ten causes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curringe together, if you should take away two of them, and so eate it, you might for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be poisoned therewith.</p>
                  <p>One only thing there is, which as<note place="margin">In what sort a man may goe to Churche, with 4. qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</note> the Deuines iudge, might make go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church lawful: which is, if a man did goe thither for some méere, partyculer, knowen, temporal busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: as to beare the sword before the Prince to the chappel: to consult of matters of warre at Poules by the Princesse appoi tme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: albeit it were in the time of seruice, &amp; the lyke. But here is to be noted, that I say first, for<note place="margin">The 1. Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> méere temporal busines. For if a man should goe partly for seruice, &amp; partly for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral busines, as to talk with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> church warde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church after ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, it will not serue. Secondly I say:<note place="margin">The 2. Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> for particuler te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral busines. For it is not enough for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince to saye in general I wil haue you go only for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which is a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral respect, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assigning any particuler busines to be donne.


<pb facs="tcp:2535:80"/>
For that was the sayinge of al Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Martyrs in the Primatiue Church, that they would haue them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme themselues in exterious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to other men: and that for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, howe soeuer they ment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Thirdly I say, for some kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen<note place="margin">The 3. Quali fication.</note> busines: For if the busines wer not knowen, men might thincke that they wente of conscience to seruice: and therefore to take away this scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, they ought to protest, for what busines they goe. To these thrée qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, adde this fourth, which is,<note place="margin">The 4. Quali fication.</note> that a man that shoulde thus goe, might not geue anye signe of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or honour to their seruice: as by knéeling, putting of his hat, or the lyke, more then he would doe, if the seruice were not there. And that it is lawful to goe to any Church of theirs obseruing these foure poynts, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident. For this is as much to saye, as not to goe to Church at al: Séeing he goeth in this case, to their méere material Church, that is, to that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2535:80"/>
house or buyldinge, which is their Church: nether goeth he to it as to a Church, but as to a house to doe his busines in. And this was the case<note place="margin">4. Reg. 5.</note> of Naaman the Syrian, who beinge vpon a sodaine conuerted from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye,<note place="margin">The case of Naaman Sy rus</note> promised, that he would neuer sacrifise or offer more to Idoles: how beit, because his office was to stay vp the King of Syria with his handes, when he went to adore the Idoles in the temple Remnon, and because he could not doe that, excepte he bowed himselfe downe, when the King bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe, whoe vsed to leane vpon him: for this cause he desired the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Elizeus, to pray to God for him, that it might be pardoned him: and the Prophet answered him, Depart in peace. Which wordes can importe noe more, but a grantinge to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: which was, to praye to God that he would pardon him, if he went so to Church: or at the vttermost (as some will enforce it) a tolleration with him, being yet a Proselite or a

new gotten man, to do this temporal seruice vnto his King: (for he wente not vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to shew his religion as our men doe) especially, it being in such a contrey, as noe scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale could folowe thereof. And that many thinges are tolerated with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, which afterwards are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it appeareth by S. Paul, whoe circumsised Timothye for satisfiynge the weake Iewes, and yet afterward he condemned in al men al circumsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Nether maketh it anye matter although he say. <hi>Si adorauero in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo Remnon, adorante rege in eodem loco, vt ignoscat mihi Dominus pro hac re.</hi> That is. If I shal adore in the temple Remnon, when the King doth adore in the same place, that God wil pardon me for this thinge.

This kynde of speach (I say) importeth nothinge. For nether doth he aske pardon to commit Idolatrye thereby, séeinge immediatelye before he sayed, that

he would neuer committe it more:) nor if he had asked such leaue, could the Prophet haue lycensed him, or would God haue pardoned hem: But his meaninge was onelye, to haue pardon for his seruinge the King in that place, and bowinge downe with him, for the better staying of him vp, when he did adore. For the same worde which we translate héere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore, doth both in Hebrewe, Bréeke, and Latine, n<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gnifie often tymes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye bowinge downe, without anye<note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> deuyne adoration.

God graunt we may all wel beare in minde, and execute, as Gods cause and glorye shall require: especially those, which are by peculier preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, called to the publique triall of the same.
