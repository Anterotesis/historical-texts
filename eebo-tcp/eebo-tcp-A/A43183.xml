            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>ENdeavours for an Agreement among Christians, will be grievous to none who desire the flourishing State of Christianity it self. The Success of these Attempts among us, must be ascribed to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God so signal, as not to be concealed; and seems a hopeful Pledg of further Blessings.</p>
            <p>The favour of our Rulers in the present Established Liberty, we most thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg; and to Them we are studious to approve our selves in the whole of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. Therefore we Declare against inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling with the <hi>National</hi> Church-Form: Imposing these Terms of Agreement on others, is disclaimed: All pretence to Coercive Power, is as unsuitable to our Principles, as to our Circumstances: Excommunication it self, in our respective Churches, being no other
<pb facs="tcp:94645:3"/>
than a declaring such scandalous Members as are irreclaimable, to be incapable of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us in things peculiar to Visible Believers: And in all, we expresly determine our purpose, to the maintaining of Harmony and Love among our selves, and preventing the inconveniences which humane weakness may expose to in our use of this Liberty.</p>
            <p>The general concurrence of Ministers and People in this City, and the great disposition thereto in other places, persuade us, this happy Work is undertaken in a season designed for such Divine influence, as will overcome all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to Peace, and convince of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement which has been always among us in a good degree, tho neither to our selves nor others so evident, as hereby it is now acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Need there any Arguments to recommend this Vnion? Is not this what we all have prayed for, and Providence by the directest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications hath been long calling and disposing us to? can either Zeal for God, or prudent
<pb facs="tcp:94645:3"/>
regards to our selves remissly suggest it, seeing the Blessings thereof are so important, and when it's become in so many respects even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary; especially as it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the preservation of the Protestant Religion, and the Kingdoms Weal; a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency whereto, shall always govern our Vnited Abilities, with the same disposition to a concurence with all others who are duly concerned for those National Blessings.</p>
            <p>As these considerations render this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desirable, so they equally urge a watchful care against all attemps of Satan to dissolve it, or frustrate the good effects thereof so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly destructive to his Kingdom. Therefore it's incumbent on us, to forbear condemning and disputing those different sentiments and practices we have expresly allowed for: To reduce all distinguishing Names, to that of <hi>United Brethren</hi>: To admit no uncharitable jealousies, or censorious speeches; much less any debates whether Party seems most favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:94645:4"/>
by this Agreement. Such carnal regards are of small moment with us, who herein have used words less acurate, that neither side might in their various conceptions about lesser matters be contradicted, when in all substantials we are fully of one mind; and from this time hope more perfectly to rejoice in the Honour, Gifts, and Success of each other, as our <hi>common</hi> good.</p>
            <p>That we as <hi>United,</hi> may contribute our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the great concernments of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, it's mutually resolved, we will assist each other with our Labours, and meet and consult, without the least shadow of separate or distinct Parties: Whence we joyfully expect great Improvements in Light and Love, through the more abundant supplies of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; being well assured we herein serve that <hi>Prince of Peace, of the increase of whose Government and Peace, there shall be no end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Agreement is already assented to by above Fourscore Ministers, and the Preface approved of.</hi>

The following Heads of <hi>AGREEMENT</hi> have been Resolved upon, by the <hi>UNITED</hi> Ministers in and about <hi>London,</hi> formerly called <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congregational</hi>; not as a Measure for any <hi>National Constitution,</hi> but for the Preservation of Order in our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that cannot come up to the Common Rule by Law Established.</head>

            <head>I. Of <hi>CHURCHES</hi> and <hi>CHURCH-MEMBERS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1.<seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E Acknowledge our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> to have One <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> comprehending all that are united to Him, whether in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>Earth.</hi> And do conceive the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94645:5"/>
whole multitude of <hi>visible Believers,</hi> and their Infant-Seed (commonly called the <hi>Catholick Visible Church</hi>) to belong to <hi>Christ's Spiritual Kingdom</hi> in this world: But for the notion of a <hi>Catholick Visible Church</hi> here, as it signifies its having been collected into any formed Society, under a Visible human Head on Earth, whether <hi>one</hi> Person singly, or <hi>many</hi> collectively, We, with the rest of Protestants, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously disclaim it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We agree, That particular Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Visible Saints, who under Christ their Head, are statedly joined together for ordinary Communion with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in all the Ordinances of Christ, are <hi>particular Churches,</hi> and are to be owned by each other, as Instituted Churches of Christ, tho differing in <hi>apprehensions</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> in some lesser things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That none shall be admitted as Members, in order to Communion in all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94645:5"/>
the special Ordinances of the Gospel, but such persons as are knowing and sound in the <hi>fundamental Doctrines of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> without Scandal in their Lives; and to a Judgment regulated by the Word of God, are persons of visible Godliness and Honesty; credibly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing cordial subjection to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A competent Number of such <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saints</hi> (as before described) do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the capable Subjects of stated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in all the <hi>special Ordinances of Christ,</hi> upon their mutual declared consent and agreement <hi>to walk together therein according to Gospel Rule.</hi> In which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, different degrees of <hi>Explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> shall no way hinder such Churches from owning each other, as <hi>Instituted Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Tho <hi>Parochial Bounds</hi> be not of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> yet for common Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Members of a <hi>particular Church</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94645:6"/>
ought (as much as conveniently may be) to live near one another.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That each <hi>particular Church</hi> hath Right to chuse their own Officers; and being furnished with such as are <hi>duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified</hi> and <hi>ordained</hi> according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Rule, hath Authority from Christ for exercising <hi>Government,</hi> and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying all the <hi>Ordinances of Worship</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the Administration of <hi>Church Power,</hi> it belongs to the <hi>Pastors</hi> and other <hi>Elders</hi> of every particular Church (if such there be) to <hi>Rule and Govern</hi>: and to the Brotherhood to <hi>Consent,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Rule of the Gospel.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. That all Professors as before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are bound in duty, as they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to join themselves as <hi>fixed Members</hi> of some particular Church; their thus joining, being part of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed subjection to the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi>

and an instituted means of their Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Edification; whereby they are under the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> and in case of <hi>scandalous</hi> or <hi>offensive walking,</hi> may be Authoritatively Admonished or Censured for their recovery, and for vindication of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> professing it.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

            <p n="3">3. That ordinarily none shall be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the work of this Ministry, but such as are <hi>called</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> thereunto by a particular Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in so great and weighty a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the calling and chusing a <hi>Pastor,</hi> we judg it ordinarily requisite, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such Church consult and advise with the <hi>Pastors</hi> of Neighbouring Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="5">5: That after such <hi>Advice,</hi> the Person consulted about, being chosen by the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of that particular Church over

which he is to be set, and he accepting, be duly ordained, and set apart to his Office over them; wherein tis ordinarily requisite, That the <hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>Neighbouring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi> concur with the <hi>Preaching-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> if such there be.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That whereas such <hi>Ordination</hi> is only intended for such as never before had been ordained to the <hi>Ministerial Office</hi>; If any judge, that in the case also of the removal of one formerly <hi>Ordained,</hi> to a new Station or <hi>Pastoral Charge,</hi> there ought to be a like Solemn recommending him and his Labours <hi>to the Grace and Blessing of God</hi>; no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sentiments or Practice herein, shall be any occasion of <hi>Contention</hi> or <hi>Breach of Communion</hi> among us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is expedient, that they who enter on the work of <hi>Preaching the Gospel,</hi> be not only qualified for Communion of Saints; but also that, except in <hi>cases extraordinary,</hi> they give proof of their <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>fitness</hi>
