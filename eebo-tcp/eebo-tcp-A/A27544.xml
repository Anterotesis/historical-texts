            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THERE being found amongſt us a certain
ſottiſh Generation, who out of Love to Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and Hatred to our Legal and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rights, do diſown any Miſcarriage or Error in the
Miniſters and Inſtruments of the Two laſt Reigns;
I thought it neceſſary to make ſome Obſervations upon
the Tranſactions of thoſe Times, to the end to raiſe
our Hearts to a thankful Admiration of God's Grace and
Goodneſs in preſerving us in our Priviledges by his
over-ruling Hand of Providence, through many Ages,
whilſt other Kingdoms have been raviſhed of theirs;
and to diſcourage the like Attempts againſt us for the
future, by Men of ambitious, ſelfiſh and depraved
Principles. And becauſe I know this will meet with
many Enemies, who, as concerned will be ready to
cavil at it, I have for the farther Proof of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Matter relating to the Two laſt Reigns and the
Inquity of them, annexed hereunto two <hi>Affidavits,</hi>
which together with the uncontradicted Information of
that eminently honeſt Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:55407:3"/>
true Son (tho' no Bigot) of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
will, I ſuppoſe, be ſufficient to make good the Truth
of what is here ſuggeſted. And if any deſire farther
ſatisfaction concerning the Four laſt Kings, I referr
them for <hi>James</hi> the Firſt to that Book called, <hi>The
Court of King</hi> James, writ by Sir <hi>Anthony
Welden,</hi> who being a Courtier, writ his Knowledg and
Experience. For <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s
Authentick Collections. For <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and
<hi>James</hi> the Second, to that Book called, <hi>The Diſplay
of Tyranny,</hi> where you will find named the Judges,
Juries, Witneſſes and Council, made uſe of in ſeveral
Trials upon Life and Death, as well as for pretended
Miſdemeaners; ſome of which Verdicts have been ſince
reverſed by Act of Parliament declaring ſeveral
Men murthered; and ſome of the Verdicts for Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanors,
reverſed by Judgment in the Houſe of Lords,
to the Credit of the Sufferers, but little to the Credit
of thoſe Juries, who found them guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>THE
PROVIDENCES OF GOD
OBSERVED THROUGH
Several Ages
TOWARDS THIS
NATION.</head>
            <p>AS it is the duty of Man to contemplate the various
Diſpenſations and Workings of God in the World;
ſo no Country under Heaven affords more Matter
than <hi>England,</hi> for raiſing our Souls to the higheſt
admiration of his Greatneſs and Goodneſs, and that as well in
reference to Civils as Spirituals.</p>
            <p>To look no further back than <hi>William the Firſt,</hi> who ſome
call <hi>Conquerer,</hi> the Mercy of the Lord towards this Nation hath
ever ſince been to a Miracle in preſerving their Rights and
Privileges through ſo many Ages and Reigns of covetous and
ambitious Princes, who never wanted evil Counſellors to joyn
with them for Arbitrary Power and Government, they knowing
that he that makes no Conſcience of couſening the Community
for whoſe good he is ordeined, muſt ſuffer them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to couſen him, as he doth the other; and tho' we find,
they have for the moſt part firſt or laſt, failed in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55407:4"/>
it hath not frightened others from the like Deſigns;
the Examples of <hi>Gaveſtone,</hi> Lord <hi>Spencers, &amp;c.</hi> in former times;
nor of <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Laude</hi> ſince, being any caution to thoſe
whoſe Pride and Covetouſneſs overballanceth ſuch Preſidents;
and it's no wonder, that all times ſhould furniſh bad Kings with
evil Counſellors, there being more Men in the World of Parts
without Honeſty than there are of both Parts and Honeſty, and
more of Honeſty without Parts than of th' other two; whoſe
weakneſs the firſt makes uſe of to ſupport themſelves in their
tyrannical practices; and tho' through Mercy we do at preſent
injoy our Liberties, the preſervation of them, from the Firſt
<hi>William</hi> down to this time, hath been almoſt by perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
with our Kings and their pernicious Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>In times of Popery, the Clergy (who are always governed by
their ſeparate Intereſt) owning the Pope for their Head, were
tenacious of their Engliſh Priviledges, equal to any, and from
thence were the greateſt ſupporters of them, and the greateſt
Checks to our aſpiring Princes, for which reaſon they were then
ſo much honoured and adored; but ſince the Reformation in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath changed their Intereſt, in making them dependent
upon the Crown, from whence iſſues all their Preferments, they
have been the greateſt Flatterers of our Princes, and Enemies
to our Engliſh Liberties; it being hard for a Flatterer to be an
honeſt Man: And this may be made an additional Reaſon to
Dr. <hi>Itchards</hi> ſeveral Cauſes of the preſent Contempt of the
Clergy; for as it's natural to Mankind to reverence thoſe from
whom they receive good, ſo on the contrary, to have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for thoſe from whom they derive their miſeries; and tho
Statiſts would monopolize beyond contradiction, all knowledge in
Government to themſelves as a defence for their evil practices.
The wiſer ſort of Men, of both Parts and Honeſty, ſee eaſily
thorough their tricks, and the reſt feel where the Shooe pincheth;
and in truth, Politicians without Honeſty are but like Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks
on a Stage, to cheat the Ignorant: For as King <hi>James the
Firſt</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy;</hi> and whether he had
the Vertue to follow his own Maxim, he was able to judge of
what was good and vertuous; and ſurely all Governments thrive
beſt, that make Honeſty the rule; not only as a bleſſing of God
may be expected from ſuch proceedings, but alſo from Natural
and Human Reaſon, the worſt of Men liking Honeſty beſt in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55407:4"/>
others, tho' they do not practiſe it themſelves: And therefore
all Vertuous Princes will be careful to make choice of Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
of upright and juſt Principles, as ſuch may be well known
by their Creatures; for if their Favorites are Men of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
depraved and debauched Lives, as to Tyranny and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
they muſt be the ſame in their own Nature; and who they
are that are ſuch, the late Times have ſo ſufficiently diſcovered
as is beyond concealing.</p>
            <p>And now, as this may ſerve to raiſe our hearts in a thankful
remembrance to Almighty God for Temporal Mercies, ſo I ſhall
obſerve that which is of greater concern, our Eternal Being,
which requires our moſt ſerious Meditation, as, That the Lord
by his over-ruling Hand of Providence ſhould make a profeſſed
Enemy to the Truth, <hi>Henry the 8th,</hi> his firſt Inſtrument of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us out of Darkneſs into Light, cannot be ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired;
who being followed by that Miracle of Piety, eſpecially
for his Age, <hi>Edward the 6th,</hi> he made ſo grounded a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his ſhort time, that his mercileſs and perſecuting Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of the Popiſh Communion could not get totally over in her
Reign, but was forced to leave in a great meaſure his Pattern
of Church Government for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to proceed upon;
which had he lived, would in all probability have been more
perfect, he ſeeming to have been inſpired with an Holy Spirit
for Reformation, in purging the Church from all the fulſom
Dregs and Rubbiſh of Popiſh Superſtition and Idolatry; and
the cutting ſo early the Thread of his Life, before he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
his Deſign, gives us great cauſe to reckon it a Judgment
of God upon this Nation for their Sins; and we have the more
reaſon to believe his pious Intentions, becauſe Dr. <hi>Heilin</hi> (a late
Champion for the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law, and
Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s great Creature) tells us in his Preface to his
Church-Hiſtory, (at leaſt to this Effect) <hi>That it was a great
Mercy to the Church that he was taken away, otherwiſe he had ſurely
reduced Epiſcopacy to Primitive Inſtitution,</hi> &amp;c. and ſince the
Doctor could not be ignorant that the Papiſts were violently
ſuſpected to be the Authors of his Death, we may by this, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Doctor and his Patrons Inclinations.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Preſervation in the Tower, in the time of
her Impriſonment, is a remarkable Providence not to be forgot,
that when her bloody Siſter had deſigned her Death, ſhe ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55407:5"/>
be preſerved by King <hi>Philip</hi> (Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Husband) who had
not at that time (beſides his Queen) his Fellow in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>
for Cruelty and Perſecution of the Reformed, and was moved
to the ſame, not by Bowels of Compaſſion, but upon a Politick
account, That ſhould Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dye Childleſs, as it ſeems he
feared, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being out of the way, the Queen of
<hi>Scots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a Papiſt, would come to the Crown, who being inſeparably
joyned in League with <hi>France,</hi> they both might be too hard for
<hi>Spain;</hi> and that his Lenity towards Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no other ſcore, appears by putting his Eldeſt Son to death
for no other cauſe, than being too mercifully inclined towards
the Proteſtants in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And thus the Lord wrought
for us when we could not help our ſelves, in bringing her to
the Crown, and preſerving her thorough her whole Reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the perpetual Plots and Endeavours of the Papiſts for
deſtroying her.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having in her Fathers and Siſters Times (tho
averſe to the groſs Idolatry of <hi>Rome)</hi> imbibed too great a liking
of the gaudy Splendor of the Church, inſomuch that the pious
Reformers of that Age could not bring her to that height of
Reformation they deſired, as appears by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s (now Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s) Letter from <hi>Zurick</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> had it
not pleaſed God in his Providence to furniſh her with wiſe and
moderate Counſellors, as Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi>
Lord <hi>Burley,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Rawleigh,</hi> &amp;c. ſhe might have proved more ſevere againſt
the then Diſſenters than ſhe was; but having had a true Love to
the People of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly to the City of <hi>London,</hi>
which ſcarce any of her four Succeſſors have ſince had, ſhe
reigned moderately, ſome of thoſe Acts of Parliament made in
her time, and ſince wreſted againſt Diſſenters, being intended
only againſt Papiſts. Piety was by her and her Counſellors
encouraged; all Debauchery, Blaſphemy, Atheiſm and Profaneſs
diſcountenanced; Honours, places of Profit or Penſions never
beſtowed otherwiſe than for Merit, by which all ſorts being
provoked to the ſtudy of Vertue and generous Actions, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were in that time in higher eſteem and of greater Intereſt
than many Noblemen at this day; the benefit of which we
found in a Bleſſing upon all our Undertakings, the Nation not
ſuffering the leaſt diſhonour in any of their Actions during her
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55407:5"/>
Reign, tho ingaged in war upon the account of Religion with
all her Neighbours; with <hi>Spain</hi> in defence of the Proteſtants
in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> with <hi>Scotland</hi> in the behalf of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there, and with <hi>France</hi> in the aſſiſtance of the Reformed
in that Kingdom; in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the Rebels there, and at
home in ſuppreſſing the perpetual Plots of the Papiſts. And
having prevailed in all places with a ſmall but well managed
Revenue; extravagant Sallaries, Fraud and Couſenage, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Penſions, multiplying Offices and Officers to gratifie a
Party for Popery and Arbitrary Government, not being then
known, her and her Peoples intereſt being reckoned one, and
not ſeparated as our Courtiers have ſince done, ſhe became glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
through the World, ſo far as the Name of <hi>England</hi> was
heard of; inſomuch, that in honour of her, the Emperor of
<hi>Muſcovia</hi> did voluntarily beſtow extraordinary Immunities
upon the Engliſh Nation.</p>
            <p>When this Queen died, the Renown of <hi>England</hi> ſeems to have
died with her; for ſince her time, we have gon backward in
Honour and Reputation, having received many Eclipſes: None
of our four ſuceeding Kings, nor even <hi>Cromwel</hi> in his almoſt
five years Uſurpation, having any one glorious Action to boaſt
of, ſave the concern the laſt had for the Proteſtants Liberty in
<hi>Piemont,</hi> which I confeſs, ought not to be forgot, tho his War
with <hi>Spain</hi> and joyning with <hi>France</hi> is his Reproach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James the 1ſt</hi> was a Scholar qualified for an Univerſity to
make Harangues in the Schools, but had nothing beſides to brag
of, ſave Diſſimulation, which he called <hi>King-Craft,</hi> but was really
his blemiſh; in that by it he ſo far loſt all Reputation, except
that of a Pedant, that no Princes or States could confide in him,
and for all his boaſted Cunning was ever worſted in Foreign
Treaties; as in that with <hi>Spain</hi> about the <hi>Infanta;</hi> with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
about the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> with <hi>Holland</hi> about the cautionary
Towns, not in delivering them up, for that was but Juſtice,
but in the ſum due to us for them; and as a proof of his
great Wiſdom, he ſpent that in fruitleſs Embaſſies, which good
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did in glorious Atchievements. And therefore
our flattering Clergy (for their own ends) ſtiling him a <hi>Solomon,</hi>
was groundleſs, none ever having deſerved it leſs; his Diverſions
wherein he ſpent his time, not being the Care of his People,
according to the duty of his Calling, but in Hunting, Masking
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55407:6"/>
and Drinking, and to pleaſe the Eccleſiaſticks, by making their
Sabbath-days-work eaſie; in promoting the Profanation of that
day, in inviting the People by a Declaration to Sports and
Games, when they ſhould have been either at Church or at home
better employed; as if the way to fit a People for Arbitrary
Government, was firſt to make them godleſs, which Maxim
hath been ſince improved.</p>
            <p>This King was no ſooner removed to <hi>England,</hi> than forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Methods of Church and State, he had been bred to in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> aſpired as much to Arbitrary Government as if he had
never heard of any other Principles, as appears by his hectoring
Speeches in Parliament. But it was the happineſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that his Bravery lay only in his Tongue, and that the
Nation was not then overrun with the Leproſie of Luxury and
Lincentiouſneſs; nor the Eccleſiaſticks and Judges corrupted as
they have been ſince; ſo that tho no means or tricks were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for compaſſing his Ends, through Providence he failed of
his Deſign, his toſſing of Parliaments by Prorogations and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journments
for bringing them to his bow, not doing his work,
he projected for raiſing of Mony (to ſupply the want of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments)
the Dignity of Hereditary Baronets; and to induce
Gentlemen of the beſt Quality to give Credit to this pernicious
Invention by accepting of it, he gave them Precedence of all
meerly Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſingly Knights Batchelors,
not being the younger Sons of Barons, of whom they have no
place; but to make the Title more valuable and deſirable, he
ingaged that the number ſhould not exceed two hundred. And
all this under the Romantick pretence, that every perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
hereof, ſhould be obliged to maintain a certain number
of Souldiers in <hi>Ireland</hi> to defend the Proteſtants againſt the
Papiſts in that Kingdom; and as a badge of their Duty adds a
bloody Hand to their Coat of Arms; yet with this Condition,
that each paying 1000 <hi>l.</hi> into the Exchequer, they ſhould be
excuſed from that Service; for notwithſtanding the pretence in
the Patent, it was meerly a trick to get Mony without Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
As was the conferring Titles upon Women; <hi>Scotch</hi> and
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Titles upon Perſons not having any Lands in either Country,
a thing not practiſed before: And as to the Title of Baronet, it
may be obſerved, that tho it is pretended againſt Papiſts, thoſe
of that Religion were as forward to buy this Honour as others;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55407:6"/>
and thus he defrauded the People of the benefit of Parliaments,
by expoſing (for raiſing of Mony) this and all other Honours
to ſale, which hath been ever reckoned a mark of a depraved
and corrupt Government. And thus begun our governing by
tricks (hardly known before) which continued till our preſent
happy Change; but this according to the Maxim of our Law,
<hi>That the King can do no wrong,</hi> muſt refer to his evil Council, and
not to him.</p>
            <p>This new Honour of Baronets was ſtruck at by ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Parliaments as illegal in the Inſtitution, as well as the
end; the firſt in being hereditary without annexing it to ſome
place, and the latter in depriving the Nation of their Security in
the uſe of Parliaments: But in a little time the Intereſt increaſed
ſo much in the increaſe of their Number, that nothing could be
done to diſannul this Project; for notwithſtanding the cajoling
promiſe of not exceeding two hundred, no limitation was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
the Number (by falling the price to leſs than half, tho
obliged to have a Receipt out of the Exechequer for the whole
<hi>1000 l.)</hi> being increaſed to near, if not 1000.</p>
            <p>And in theſe and ſuch like waies this celebrated <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpent
a Reign of two and twenty years, without bringing any Honour
to the Nation; but on the contrary, through evil Counſel a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of it to a great degree; and when he had finiſhed his
Courſe, left his Preſidents to his Son <hi>Charles the 1ſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This King, as no Man can deny, followed his Fathers ſteps,
and in an higher degree affected abſolute Monarchy, wherein
being obſtinate, it was fatal to him; he was free from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
diſſoluteneſs his two Succeſſors have been ſince guilty of;
for the Nation not being then arrived at that impudent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs
it is now come to, the People were then modeſt in their
Vices, compared with theſe times; yet Lewdneſs then, as it hath
ever ſince, increaſed more and more, helped forward by Biſhop
<hi>Laud</hi>'s Advice, in diſcouraging Piety and giving incouragement
to Debauchery by aſperſing ſober Men with Nicknames, as Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans
and Preciſians, &amp;c. promoting Arminianiſm, the Doctrin
of Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance; and then, ſeconding
this King's Father, in publiſhing another Book of Sports, giving
Liberty on the Lords Day for all manner of Games, as Foot-ball,
Cudgels, &amp;c. injoyning the reading it in the Churches, to the
great grief of all ſerious Chriſtians fearing God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55407:7"/>
His Carriage in the State was as offenſive as in the Church;
he called Parliaments meerly to ſerve his own turn, without any
eye to the Publick; and when they did but enquire into any
grievances, as the Death of his Father, who was violently
ſuſpected to be poiſoned, &amp;c. they were readily diſſolved. And
in <hi>Ann. 1628.</hi> he forbid by Proclamation the ſpeaking of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
(a high Arbitrary Act) he paſſed indeed the Petition
of Right aſſerting the Peoples Liberties; but had no ſooner
given his Conſent than he broke through all the Bonds of it,
illegally forcing the Payment of Tunnage and Poundage, Ship-Mony,
Coat and Conduct Mony, Knighthood Mony, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Members for ſpeaking in Parliaments. To increaſe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
monopolized (contrary to Law) moſt Commodities,
made an extrajudicial uſe of the Star Chamber to the fining,
and otherwiſe puniſhing of Gentlemen without cauſe, removing
them for their greater vexation, out of their own Counties, to
Priſons in other Countries; and to prevent Complaints had no
Parliaments in twelve years, nor then, till compelled by the
Troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> to call one: For though that Book falſly
intituled this Kings, for which his Admirers Saint him, begins
with his ſpontaneous calling of the Parliament in 1640. that
Chapter made one of his own Party, upon the reading of it,
throw the Book away, ſaying, If it begun with ſo known a Lie,
nothing leſs could be expected in it, and therefore would not
read it.</p>
            <p>This Expreſſion ought to be pardoned, the King not being
concerned in it, both his Sons, the two laſt Kings, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to the late Earl of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> that their Father did not
write the Book, but that it was writ by Dr. <hi>Gaudin,</hi> afterwards
Biſhop of <hi>Exeter.</hi> He wreſted the Statute for Foreſts, to the
Ruin of many, by the inlarging them; his Court was filled with
Prieſts and Jeſuits: He careſſed the Heads of that horrid and
odious Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> clapped up a Peace with them in
order to bring thoſe Cut-throats into <hi>England.</hi> His Son <hi>Charles
the 2d</hi> confeſſed that the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> (reckoned one of
the maſſacring Rebels) acted by his Fathers Commiſſion, and
upon that account, he had his Eſtate reſtored him by the Court
of Claims; he ſolicited the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> to bring his more
than ordinary rude and wicked Army into <hi>England;</hi> and all
this, beſides his deſerting <hi>Rochel</hi> after he had ſtirred them up
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55407:7"/>
to ſtand upon their defence, promiſing them Relief, to the
ruin of the whole Proteſtant Cauſe, as appears by the Hiſtory
of the Siege of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are but hints of ſome few of the Practices in his time,
which if not ſufficient to ſuſpend (according to the Romiſh Rule)
the Sainting him till after an hundred years, that his Vertues
may be forgot; Thoſe that read <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collections, will
find enough there for deferring the Solemnization thereof:
His Reign was ſo Arbitrary, that I remember it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, that the ſtudying Proclamations, which made a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
as big as a Church-Bible, was more neceſſary for Lawyers
than their Books: His endeavouring to impoſe a more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
and approaching Liturgy to Popery upon the Church
of <hi>Scotland</hi> than ours in <hi>England,</hi> was the beginning of his
Troubles; wherein he was as much out in his Politicks as in any
of his other Actions; for it could not be well expected, that
they, who had ſwept their Church as clean from all the Rubbiſh
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Geneva</hi> it ſelf, and more zealous and refined in
their Doctrin than they, would be eaſily impoſed upon in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion: But it was the Pride of Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> who
was ambitious of being the Founder of a new Popery, and of
ſeeing it accompliſhed in his days, by driving too furiouſly, that
prevented the deſigned Miſchief; and ſo we find it confeſſed

the Pope to leave <hi>England,</hi> and go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the Credit
of that See declare themſelves Papiſts, provided the Pope would
allow them at <hi>Rome</hi> the value of their Engliſh Biſhopricks,
which they computed each at 16000 Crowns <hi>per annum;</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for anſwer from the Pope's Nephew, Chief Miniſter of
State, who at that time was (as I remember) Cardinal <hi>Franciſco
Barbarino,</hi> reputed a great Stateſman, that if their Converſion
were real, they might at <hi>Rome</hi> live comfortably of ſo many
hundred Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi> For the Cardinal was jealous, that
the bottom of <hi>Laud</hi>'s deſign was a Patriarchal Popedom for
<hi>England,</hi> which would have been a bad Example for <hi>France</hi> and
other Popiſh Countries. If any are curious to know further
concerning the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> at that time, I refer them to
the aforeſaid <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is writ in <hi>Italian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſucceeding eighteen years interval, this Nation received
not the leaſt diſhonour, ſave what happened at <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi>
in War with <hi>Spain,</hi> during <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Uſurpation: For the
greateſt part of the reſt of that time our Neighbours trembled
when we frowned; tho ſince that, the Cataſtrophy hath been
ſuch, that we have trembled at their Frowns, occaſioned by
the miſgovernment of <hi>Charles the 2d.</hi> who yet came to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Crown moſt advantageouſly, not an Enemy
daring to ſhew his Teeth (excepting that mad freak of the 29
Fifth Monarchy Men) he ſeeming to be the univerſal Delight
of the People. At <hi>Breda</hi> he promiſed Liberty of Conſcience to
thoſe diſſenting Miniſters, that were with others, ſent by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to invite him into <hi>England;</hi> and at his arrival made
ſhew of being true to his Word, by appointing at the <hi>Savoy;</hi>
in order thereunto, a Conference, betwixt the two Parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Conformiſts and Diſſenters; but the latter being under hand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced
by him (who was a great Miniſter of King <hi>James</hi>
the <hi>Firſt</hi>'s Art in King-Craft) it came to nothing more than
making their Burthens the heavier; ſo that in a ſhort time,
the Presbyterians, who had been the chief Authors of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55407:8"/>
(his own Party being then ſo inconſiderable, that
they cannot be ſaid to have contributed more to it, than as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the other) were moſt ungratefully uſed; their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
turned out of their Livings; their Families expoſed to
live in a great meaſure upon Charity; and that by him
whom they had brought from that Condition himſelf, to the
injoyment of three Crowns.</p>
            <p>His firſt Parliament acted regularly with an eye to publick
good and quiet; paſſing an Act of Indempnity for all, ſave ſome
few excepted; which he ſeemed to approve ſo much of, that
in his cunning and cajoling way, he gave them the name of the
healing Parliament, and then diſſolved it, calling another more
to his purpoſe; after which, how he kept his Indempnity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by his uſage of the great and incomparable Sir <hi>Henry
Vane,</hi> Alderman <hi>Ireton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Moyer,</hi> Major <hi>Gladman,</hi> &amp;c.
taking away contrary to Faith, the Life of the firſt, impriſoning
others without cauſe, till they redeemed their Liberty by great
Sums, like Slaves in <hi>Algiers;</hi> others ſtanding it out till the
<hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Bill came in uſe, after the withdrawing of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<hi>Hide</hi> (which for ſeven or eight years had been denied,
or from the Iniquity of the Times, durſt not be moved for)
were freed by Law without Fines.</p>
            <p>He pretended great zeal for the Reformed Religion with an
Abhorrence of Poperty; yet in favour of the latter, endeavoured
to ſet the Conformiſts at the greateſt difference with the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by ſeveral Acts againſt the latter, and ſevere Proſecution
thereupon. And this, whilſt at the ſame time, all proceedings
againſt the Papiſts in the Exchequer upon Conviction were
ſtopped, to the preſerving of them, when Proteſtant Diſſenters
were many of them ruined by cloſe Impriſonments, where they
died; he deſigning all a long no leſs than Popery and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
even when he pretended the contrary. His two unjuſt,
coſtly and cauſeleſs Wars with <hi>Holland,</hi> being in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
as was the burning of <hi>London,</hi> and the Popiſh Plot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by Dr. <hi>Oats;</hi> yet rather than be thought to have any hand
in the latter, he ſuffered about twenty perſons which he is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſpected to have imployed in it, to dye for it.</p>
            <p>When the burning of <hi>London,</hi> the frequent ſubſequent Fires
in <hi>Southwark,</hi> St. <hi>Katharines,</hi> and ſeveral parts of the City, &amp;c.
would not ſerve his ends, he contrived a Proteſtant Plot for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55407:9"/>
murthering of himſelf, and (as he untruly ſuggeſted) intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a Commonwealth; and as the moſt probable Inſtrument
(as he thought, tho therein miſtaken) Mr. <hi>Clapol</hi> a Son-in-law
of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> muſt be charged with it, and without the leaſt ground
clapped up in Priſon, in the cloſeſt way; and had not the real
Popiſh Plot broke out, he had ſurely been ſacrificed to give
Credit to the Forgery; but Mr. <hi>Capol</hi>'s unſuitable Principles to
ſuch a Deſign was enough to detect the Fraud and Villany, he
having been in the Civil Wars, reckoned all a long a Royaliſt
and Anti-Republican: And thus ill Men are ſometimes caught
in their own ſnares, as this King was by his miſtake in this
perſon.</p>
            <p>This King having by turning and changing, got Judges and
Counſellors to his purpoſe, corrupting by Penſions, &amp;c. a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
in the Parliament, carried all things as he pleaſed, till at
laſt he loſt his Credit by the odiouſneſs of the Popiſh Plot, and
his Compliance with <hi>France,</hi> to the advancing that King to what
he is now come to; teaching him, (compared to what he knew
before) to build Ships, man, victual and ſail them; nay even
to fight and ſound our Coaſts and Rivers; which was done in
the time of his unhappy Adminiſtration, eſpecially in the year
1672. in joyning with him againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> when none of his
Ships were ſuffered to fight, but ſtand by and learn, that one
<hi>French</hi> Commander that did ingage, being as its ſaid, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
clapped in the Baſtile for it, which we never heard was
complained of by us, nor excuſed by them: Nay, not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any thing towards the advancement of the <hi>French</hi> King,
we gave him <hi>Canada,</hi> that neceſſary place for our <hi>Newfound-land</hi>
Fiſhery; (our chief Nurſery for Seamen) for an inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
part, compared to <hi>Canada,</hi> of the Iſland of St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi>
which had belonged to us, under pretence, that he had taken
it from us in our former War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when he ſided
with them againſt us and ſerved them as he did us, never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
with them; making uſe only of his Declaration of War
for them, to the end, to ſet us together by the Ears; that ſo
he might have the better opportunity, to ſet up himſelf, and
worm us (as in a great meaſure he hath done) out of our <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Land</hi> Fiſhery, and hath taken it to himſelf; whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they uſed to pay us a kind of Tribute for Liberty of
Fiſhing there; but now through our favour and careleſneſs they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55407:9"/>
are arrived to that height of Fiſhing, that they are ſaid to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſo many Men in it, as produceth them five thouſand new
Seamen yearly; ſo that by the Conduct of our Counſellors this
King is ſince 1662. when he had hardly 20 Men of War great
and ſmall, come now to be Maſter of 150 at leaſt: But tho by
his wiſe management of Affairs and our bad, he hath rid this
Summer in our Channel without controle, I hope he will
never do ſo more, nor ever be encouraged to intitle himſelf to
the Dominion of the Narrow Seas; except God for our Sins
gives us over to be again betrayed by our Counſellors as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
for tho Kings themſelves may be ill Men, yet without
the like Counſellors, they cannot perpetrate their evil Deſigns.</p>
            <p>This Government of ours hath been by our late Kings carried
on by tricks, which our Statiſts valued themſelves upon, as the
effect of their great Wiſdom; whereas it is truly nothing more
than the tranſendency of Immorality, in which honeſter Men
have not a latitude. To enumerate their deceitful Artifices is
hard, they are ſo many. This King at his Reſtauration in 1660
made a League with the States General in deſign to prepare
for a War with them, having then found his Naval Forces
very low.</p>
            <p>In 1664. he began to quarrel with them without the leaſt
cauſe, and againſt their real endeavours for preventing it: But
<hi>Downing</hi> being Envoy Extraordinary at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to remove
their Jealouſie of us, which was great, gave them according
to the Policy of thoſe Times all aſſurance of Friendſhip, telling
them, that if their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships then expected, were above
<hi>London</hi>-Bridge, they would be as ſafe as in their own Harbours;
yet their Merchants Ships to about the number, as it is ſaid, of
120. were upon frivolous pretences, firſt ſtopped as they came
into our Channel, till at laſt ſome Months after, without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of War or any cauſes ſhewn, they were confiſcated;
and at the ſame time their <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet was fallen upon before
<hi>Cadiz;</hi> whereupon <hi>Downing</hi> thought fit to make a haſty Retreat
by <hi>Mazeland-Sluce;</hi> and this Action was as little to our honour
as profit; for tho we ſunk one or two of their Ships, to their
great dammage, we took none; and for thoſe ſeized at home,
our management was ſo commendable, that upon the ſale of them,
as I have heard, the King was made Debtor: And thus this War
began, which proſpered in our hands according to the Juſtice of
it.</p>

The firſt year of this War, the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Fleet coming
home by the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s
promiſe of Security, or at leaſt relying upon their League with
him, put into <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway;</hi> where they were preſently

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
him 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> for that Summers War; but it was the Wiſdom
and Honeſty of our Counſellors, out of good Husbandry, to
ſave the Mony, by not ſetting forth a Fleet, which gave op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to our Enemies to burn our Ships in Harbour, for
which we made an horrid Outcry againſt them as treacherous,
in doing it in the time of our Treaty with them for Peace at
<hi>Breda,</hi> falſely adding, That it was contrary to a Ceſſation agreed
upon; whereas when a Ceſſation was deſired by us, they poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
denyed it, which is ſufficient to vindicate the Integrity of
their Proceedings, in anſwer to ignorant popular Clamour:
And indeed, tho our Counſellors might be willing, for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
to have the People underſtand this diſgraceful Affront
to proceed from Falſeneſs in the Dutch, I never heard, that
they at any time did publickly accuſe them of breach of Faith
in this matter or Action.</p>
            <p>Being thus worſted, it was pretended that want of Mony was
the Cauſe, tho upon examination of the Accounts, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
appointed by Act of Parliament to that end, there
was not much above half ſpent, of what was given expreſly for
that War, which evinces our Miſcarriage to proceed from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Counſels, want of Conduct, and not Mony.</p>
            <p>A Peace being concluded, to be revenged on the Dutch for
what was our own Fault, we invited them, and the Crown of
<hi>Sweeden</hi> to a Triple League with us againſt <hi>France,</hi> for reſtraining
that King in his aſpiring Deſigns, wherein the Dutch were real,
when our Deſign was only to render them odious to the French
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55407:10"/>
King, and enrage him againſt them, that by our then joyning
with him, we might both together deſtroy them, and in them
the Proteſtant Chief Bulwark.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in 1671. at the Interview at <hi>Dov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> betwixt
<hi>Charles</hi> II. and his Siſter the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleance,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> agreed
to break the Triple League, to joyn with <hi>France</hi> againſt the
Dutch; and to ſatisfie the <hi>Swede</hi> for this Breach Mr. <hi>Henry
Coventry</hi> was ſent Ambaſſador to that Crown, who procured from
them the Diſſolution of the League. When this was done, and
we had recovered Breath, after the Diſgrace we received in the
former War, to have a Pretence for a ſecond: One of our
Yachts was ordered, in her coming from <hi>Holland,</hi> to ſteer
out of her Courſe, and through the States Naval Fleet, then
riding at Sea, that in caſe the whole Fleet did not ſtrike to our
Boat, we might make that the ground of a Quarrel.</p>
            <p>That great Commander <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> then Admiral, not thinking
their Articles of Peace could be underſtood to reach ſuch a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Circumſtance, did not anſwer our Demands or Expectation,
and for not doing it, together with ſome Trivial Medals and
Pictures, which that People are much addicted to, was made
the Cauſe of a Quarrel-without Remedy, and Dr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> as a
fit Man for the Work, was ſent for out of the Country, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by Writing the Juſtice of our Cauſe, which for 400 <hi>l.</hi> he
performed the beſt he could, by two large Pamphlets, in the
latter of which having been too free, in his magnifying the
wiſe and excellent Management of the War againſt the Dutch,
in that time called a Commonwealth, when we firſt made known
unto the World our Greatneſs at Sea in beating them when in
their <hi>Zenith,</hi> (which coſt, with the Ships in that time Built<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>210000 l.)</hi> this Pamphlet was for ſome time ſtopped, till there
being a neceſſity for it, that it paſſed; and when <hi>Stubbs</hi> was by
a Friend of mine queſtioned, how he could in Conſcience write
ſo falſly and injuriouſly againſt the Dutch? He confeſſed, He
could write much more for them, than he had done againſt them,
if he would.</p>
            <p>After a Pretence for War was agreed on, the next thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
was to find a Fund for the Charge, which was very difficult;
for the Parliament having by woful Experience felt, from ill
Conduct, the Burthen of the firſt War, was unwilling to engage in
a ſecond; but at laſt the new made Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> with the help of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55407:11"/>
his Friends, projected the ſtopping of all private Payments in
the Exchequer, for which, as a Reward, he had the Treaſurers
White Staff given him; the Fund gained hereby being about
13 or 1400000 <hi>l.</hi> which was a loſs to particular Creditors, many
of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ruined by it, ſo that from the Immorality of the
Project, the Author of it deſerved rather another Reward, than
that he received.</p>
            <p>The War was commenced without any previous Declaration,
by falling upon their <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet in the Chanel (as we had done
in the firſt War before <hi>Cadiz)</hi> as they were upon their Voyage
home, wherein we miſcarried, as well to our Diſhonour in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worſted, as in beginning the War by Surprize. In this
War we ſhould have had the Aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> and had a
Squadron of that Kings Ships joyned us, but in deſign only to
teach them to fight, ſound our Coaſts and not help us; for (as
it is before mentioned) that one Ship which from ignorance of
the Intreague, did fight, the Captain of her at his return home
was (as is reported) clapped up in the Baſtile for hazarding
his Maſters Ship. The Parliament perceiving the drift of the
<hi>French</hi> to be the weakning of both Parties, that at long run he
might become Superior to either or both, preſſed the King to a
Peace betwixt us and the <hi>Dutch;</hi> which he (tho) unwillingly,
conſented to; for not knowing how to deny ſo juſt a requeſt, a
Peace was concluded.</p>
            <p>Now new meaſures were taken, and a new Miniſter of State
made choice of, one intirely devoted to the Kings Will without
reſerve. To gain the Kings ends, a Majority of the Members
of Parliament was corrupted by Penſions, which were liberally
beſtowed upon ſuch as were of depraved Principles, fit for any
miſchief, by which means, every thing, during ſome time, brought
barefaced into the Houſe of Commons, and afterwards by ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,
for the Kings particular Deſigns, paſſed currently; until
the Court going too high for a ſtanding Revenue, the Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſuſpecting, that when that was gained their Penſions
would ceaſe, they turned readily againſt the Court; which
cauſed them for gaining Mony from the Parliament to pretend
a quarrel to <hi>France,</hi> and in all haſte to raiſe an Army to that
end; and to procure belief of their real Intentions, a Book under
the Title of <hi>Chriſtianiſſimus Chriſtianandus,</hi> writ by Dr. <hi>Marchemond
Needham</hi> was publiſhed, rendring the <hi>French</hi> King ſo ſcandalous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55407:11"/>
in all his Ways, Actions and Deſigns, as cannot be thought
would have been writ, without having firſt that King's Leave
for writing it.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, to take away from the King all Pretences of
Complaint, gave him a Supply, by which he raiſed an Army;
but finding in the Iſſue, that he was not real in his Pretenſions for
a War, by refuſing to declare War, they preſſed him to disband
his new-rais'd Army; and to effect the ſame, gave him Money
to do it with; appointing Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi>
Col. <hi>Whitley,</hi> and Col. <hi>Birch</hi> to ſee it done; who diſcharged the
Truſt repoſed in them with all Fidelity and Honeſty.</p>
            <p>Theſe Arts or Tricks uſed for the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King,
by which our Parliament was diſobliged, our King had no Cauſe
to doubt but that that King would hold himſelf obliged to aſſiſt
him; and therefore he was applied to, and probably he had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from him a ſtipend of 300000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for ſome Years,
had not the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> prevented it: and upon what
other Account, than of being a Friend to his native Country, is
unknown: However, he did not only thereby irrecoverably loſe the
Favour of the Court, but alſo drew ſo much the Hatred of it upon
himſelf, that he was proſecuted for a Crime, which, tho the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the Proſecution made little Conſcience of the thing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they hoped by it to have taken away his Life for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
in preſerving the Life of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Diſcovery of theſe, and other pernicious Deſigns, begot
(not without cauſe) a great Jealouſie in the Parliament, of the
Court and their Party; which carried them on to the Addreſſing
the King againſt ſome conſiderable Perſons, as evil Counſellors;
which was for ſome time avoided by Adjournments and Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of Parliament, till the horrid Popiſh Plot breaking out,
thoſe Tricks could not longer hinder the impeaching ſeveral of
them in Parliament for the higheſt of Crimes, bringing one of
them to the Block; as had not Diſſolution of Parliaments prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, the reſt in all likelihood had had the ſame Fate, all of them
having been arraigned at the Bar of the Lord's Houſe, where ſome
pleaded Guilty in pleading the King's Pardon; by which, Time
being got for arguing the Point, till by the Diſſolution of ſeveral
Parliaments, (which was on purpoſe to prevent Juſtice) they were
unduly preſerved, for no ſuch Pardon (as the Lawyers ſay) againſt
an Impeachment in Parliament is valuable in Law; and the King
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55407:12"/>
having no power to pardon Offences, where in the Indictment
he is not made a Party, as he is not by Impeachments in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they being by the Houſe of Commons, in the Name of
all the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> The Diſſolution of Parliaments
doth not give Priſoners at the Suit of the Commons the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of being bailed, no inferiour Court having by Law any ſuch
power; eſpecially the fault of their not being brought to Trial
not being in the Parliament, but in the King, in not ſuffering
them to ſit till they had cleared, or paſſed Judgment upon them,
as he ought to have done.</p>
            <p>This King, an Artiſt in King <hi>James</hi> I's King-craft, obſerving his
Conduct to have loſt all Reputation, confeſſed by a Declaration
his Errour, in governing his Affairs by Cabals, and not by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and his Privy Council, by whoſe Advice he had always
thriven beſt; reſolving for the future to be ruled by them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cabals: And in Conformity thereunto, he diſſolved entirely,
by the ſaid Declaration, his Privy Council, and choſe another,
under the notion of a new Council, into which was taken ſome of
the moſt popular and honeſt Members of the Houſe of Commons;
as the good Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the then Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Powle, &amp;c.</hi> but the Majority being of the old Leaven,
they ſoon found that the deſign of bringing them into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was merely to give Credit to their ſiniſter Proceedings; which
made them as ſoon unanimouſly withdraw, rather than be in the
leaſt acceſſary to their unwarrantable and deſtructive Counſels
and Actions. So that tho ſome will have the ſmall time theſe
Gentlemen were in Council, to have been a great advantage to
the Court, in their Reputation, and blame them for it, I am of
a contrary Opinion; and that there could not have been a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more prejudicial Affront put upon a Prince, than that by
ſuch an unanimous and publick Leaving of his Council, in a way
that amounted to no leſs than a Proteſt againſt his Proceedings;
which could not but make a more diſadvantageous Impreſſion on
the Minds of the People, than ſo ſhort a Continuance with them
could be of advantage to the King.</p>
            <p>Now new Meaſures were again taken, and with them a new
Miniſter of State choſen; ſeveral Parliaments are diſſolved, and
new ones called, in hopes of getting one at laſt to ſerve their
turn; but the People growing more and more ſenſible of the
Growth of Popery and Slavery, ſent ſuch ſuitable Members to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55407:12"/>
Condition of the Nation, that they were almoſt as ſoon diſſolved
as aſſembled, for three Parliaments ſucceſſively; and then, to be
revenged of the Corporations for ſending ſuch Members, and of
the Members themſelves for being averſe to the Deſtruction of
the Nation, <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s, by the Advice of a new Set of evil
Counſellors, were brought, to take away the old, and give them
new Charters, that might ſubject them to the arbitrary Will of
the Prince; (illegal in the higheſt degree.) Nay, Burroughs by
Preſcription were deſtroyed, and Charters impoſed upon them,
to the infringing of their Privileges. <hi>Hereford,</hi> I think, was the
firſt that had a new Charter impoſed upon them, by which all
Power was ſo reſerved in the King, as an Example for thoſe
that ſhould follow, that one might have thought ſhould have
wrought an Hatred in all true Engliſh Men, to the Authors or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors
of ſuch Counſels.</p>
            <p>The Charter of <hi>London,</hi> by many Acts of Parliaments, and in
the comprehenſiveſt manner confirmed, was ſo gallantly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the City, nothing material being againſt them, as appears
by the learned Arguments of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pollixfen,</hi> and
Mr. Attorney General <hi>Treby,</hi> that one may wonder there ſhould
be Lawyers found to plead againſt it; and that ſuch were found,
is a Reproach upon the Perſons for being too mercenary.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s were for being revenged of the Corporations,
ſo a Proteſtant Plot was contrived, as well to ſtifle the Popiſh Plot,
as to deſtroy ſuch Gentlemen as were thought to ſtand in the way
of Arbitrary Power and Popery, by falſe Evidence, leaving trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Papers at their Houſes (as was done at Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi>'s Houſe
in <hi>London;)</hi> or putting them into their Pockets, and then ſeizing
them, (of which Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> gave my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:)
Which made thoſe that knew they were under the Envy
of the Court, when they were to come into Crowds, to ſow up
their Pockets, to prevent practiſing ſuch Tricks upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> whoſe Province it was to act in theſe ways, to get
or make treaſonable Lampoons, to trepan Perſons falſly judged
to be of Antimonarchical Principles, for not playing his part
well, and fearing his Diſcovery, according to his Promiſe to the
then Sheriffs, of the Popiſh Plot, had a Rope for his Reward,
being Drawn, Hanged and Quartered; but, as a Gratuity for
his weak Endeavours, his Head and Quarters were given to his
Wife to bury. Soon after he was dead, an impudent, falſe and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55407:13"/>
lying Confeſſion was made for him, as is fully demonſtrated by
the publiſhed Anſwer of thoſe concerned in it, under the Title of
<hi>Truth vindicated, in reference to the Aſperſions caſt upon Sir</hi> Robert
Clayton, &amp;c. <hi>publiſhed in the name of Dr.</hi> Hawkins, <hi>as</hi> Edward
Fitz-Harris'<hi>s Confeſſion.</hi> As alſo, the falſeneſs of this Confeſſion
appears by the laſt Actions of his Life, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Paper he read
at his Execution, which was printed; and his giving the Sheriffs
Thanks for their Civility and Kindneſs to him, which were his
laſt Words; and yet by his Confeſſion, he is made to complain
of them.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this Confeſſion, and publiſhing of it, was by it
to vindicate the Guilty, and accuſe the Innocent; for certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being determined for Deſtruction, it was thought fit to make
them hereby odious to the People; that when they ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by Form of Law, their Deaths might be the leſs reſented.</p>
            <p>To give an Inſtance of the Evidence made uſe of in theſe Times,
the Witneſſes againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> were ſo ſcandalous, as
Ages to come will not believe that ſuch ſhould be offered againſt
any Man, much leſs one of his Quality: As <hi>Booth,</hi> a Miniſter of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Parſon of <hi>Ogle,</hi> in <hi>Northumberland;</hi>
well known to be an infamous Raſcal, and violently ſuſpected for
the Murther of one of his Servants, to conceal his Clipping of
Money, of which he was (notwithſtanding) convicted; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and had been hanged, had not the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi>
who gave him his Parſonage at <hi>Ogle,</hi> begged his Pardon. And I
have heard an honeſt Divine of the Church, who had known him
from his Youth, ſay, that he could write a Volume of his Rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
So that nothing leſs than ſhameleſs Impudence could have
produced him againſt the Life, Honour, or Eſtate of any one. The
reſt of the Witneſſes were not better, as the Affidavits hereunto
annexed do evince, <hi>Barry,</hi> or Narrative-<hi>Smith</hi> being one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And that ſuch Evidence might paſs with the Grand Jury, both
they and the Witneſſes were heard in Court, that the firſt might
be brow-beaten, and the latter countenanced, and hear what one
another ſaid; (at leaſt an unuſual Method, if not contrary to
Law.) And to help all forward, the Lord Chief Juſtice told the
Grand Jury, that they were not to enquire into the Credibility
of the Witneſſes; whilſt the Law, in expreſs Words, ſpeaks the
contrary. And to make all ſure, that none ſhould eſcape, whom
the Court at <hi>Whitehall</hi> would have deſtroyed, the Witneſſes to an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55407:13"/>
Indictment brought againſt a Combination of Rogues, for Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Subornation of Perjury, to diſable them for taking
away the Lives of the Innocent, the Lord Chief Juſtice refuſed to
ſwear them, becauſe againſt the King's Evidence, except the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
General would give leave; who, he could not but know,
was too much of the Court-Faction to do it: By which means
thoſe Villains eſcaped Conviction, and left at liberty to hang whom
they pleaſed. And tho Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> then Sheriff, complained publickly
in Court, that he had Affidavits to prove his Life ſo far deſigned
againſt, that thoſe profligate Raſcals offered (in <hi>Auguſt, 1681.)</hi>
to lay Wagers of Ten to One, that they would hang him before
<hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> following, he could not procure any Proceedings againſt
them: But it is believed that his Complaint had this Effect, that
it hinder'd the Attorney General's producing a Bag of Indictments
he had then ready againſt ſeveral honeſt and innocent Perſons,
againſt whom theſe Varlets ſhould have been made uſe of. And
this was the Conſequence of the Courts turning out and changing
Judges, till they had got Men for their turn, who would make
any thing Law the Court would have; and who having by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Rewards, got Witneſſes to ſwear accordingly; and by
packing of Juries, got ſuch as would find what they would have
found, it was in the King's power to hang whom he pleaſed; and
that of a large Liſt of Perſons marked out for Deſtruction, there
were no more murthered, muſt be aſcribed to the over-ruling
Hand of Providence. The Lord deliver us from the like Times,
when Judges, Juries, Witneſſes and Council, all ſtrive who ſhould
moſt ſignalize their Zeal for Tyranny, by ſtrains of Wit, and
wreſting of Law; as appears by Mr. <hi>Hawle</hi>'s Remarks upon ſome
of the Trials of thoſe Times. Beſides, ambitious Citizens, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in Places of Profit, Penſioners, and Suitors for the like,
were all the ſame; inſomuch that it might in ſome meaſure
be ſaid, that all Fleſh had corrupted their Ways, and if we
ſhould again hunt with the ſame Dogs, they would ſtart the ſame
Hare.</p>
            <p>The Parliament by ſeveral Acts hath judged the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> murthered, voted Sir <hi>Thomas
Armſtrong</hi> the ſame, reverſed ſeveral unjuſt Verdicts to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Infamy of all thoſe Juries, and yet have pardoned moſt
of the Murtherers and Oppreſſors by an Act of Indempnity;
which may well be feared, will incourage the like in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55407:14"/>
againſt all that ſhall ſtand in the way of Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if we have a King that ſhall affect it.</p>
            <p>The corrupting and viciating the Nation had been long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
as neceſſary for introducing Popery and Slavery; for
whilſt Men are virtuous, and not afraid of the Laws, they will
expect and contend for the benefit of them; but when by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
and Immorality they ſtand in need of Indulgence, for
incouragement of their Luſts, they will be careleſs of their civil
Rights; and therefore the lewdeſt Examples were thought fit
to be given them, with connivance at their Practice, as in
ſwearing, whoring, drinking, atheiſtical and blaſphemous Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
diſcouraging all Religion, ſave what conſiſted in meer
formality, without diſcouraging diſſoluteneſs; ſome of the worſt
of Men being made choice of to gratifie with Honours, Penſions
and places of Profit: But of all the odious ways uſed to gain a
Party, none like that of teaching Youths to drink Healths with
<hi>Huzzaes,</hi> crying up the breach of Laws for Loyalty (when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ſuch, but Obedience according to Law, the contrary
being Diſloyalty) as was the publick feaſting of the Apprentices
of <hi>London</hi> with the Kings Veniſon, not leaving it in the power
of their Maſters, without making themſelves obnoxious, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them that School of Vertue, or command obedience in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
thereof; and that this ſhould be projected by the
greateſt of the Court, who graced their Society with their
preſence, may be reckoned, for all their Wit, an Error in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
in courting in ſuch manner the Mobile, or rather Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(as it was no leſs;) in whom there is no conſtancy; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acted by preſent apprehenſions or humor, they are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
as the Wind; nothing being to be relied upon, ſave ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
unſelfiſh Principles, for ſuch will in the end prevail in ſpite
of all the Devils in Hell; and in the Faith of this I ſhall dye,
tho I may not live to ſee it.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like courſes, which moſt of our Conforming
Parſons teaching from their Pulpits, in Taverns and Coffee-houſes,
the Doctrin of Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance
without limitation, hath ſo poiſoned the Nation, that without
an extraordinary Work of God, a Recovery cannot be expected;
for tho I think, the good People of <hi>England</hi> of all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the beſt, I believe the Profane as they are by ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of late years brought unto, are the worſt of Men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55407:14"/>
all others in wicked and immoral Practices, which we
owe chiefly, to the two laſt Kings Examples, their evil and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Counſellors and Favourites.</p>
            <p>It is a Maxim in our Law, <hi>that the King can do no wrong,</hi> which
muſt refer only to Matters of State, and not perſonal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for that it cannot be denyed, but he that lies with another
Man's Wife, or kills his Neighbour, &amp;c. doth them wrong:
but as the King, in other caſes muſt act by Inſtruments; ſo it
is but reaſonable, they ſhould be anſwerable for miſcarriages
in Government; becauſe being free Agents, what they do is of
choice, the Service of Princes being ſought and not compulſed;
and were it not for evil Counſellors, Princes would no be ſo bad
as they often are. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous Memory,
her Vertue appeared, not only in her natural, juſt and equal
Principles, but alſo in the election of ſuitable Counſellors, Men
at leaſt morally honeſt, aiming more at publick than their own
private Benefit; ſhe incouraged Vertue, making Honour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of it, and not of pimping and all manner of Vice; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
her great Favourite (that unhappy) Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
whom ſhe made General in her Expedition for <hi>Cadiz,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the honour of Knighthood upon ſome few, whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
at that time, he judged deſerved it, when ſhe thought a leſs
Reward might have ſerved. In her time, Knighthood was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
voluntarily by any Citizens, ſave the Lord Mayor; nor was
it thought of by the two ſucceeding Kings, till <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi>
at his Return from <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1641. after failing in his deſign
there againſt Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Argile</hi> and General <hi>Leſly,</hi>
&amp;c. thinking it a convenient way to corrupt a Party for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
quarrel with the Parliament; that he Knighted ſeveral
Aldermen of the City of <hi>London;</hi> and after that, both he and
his Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Second made liberal uſe of their Sword in
dubbing all that came near them, from whom they could hope,
for the leaſt aſſiſtance, in their deſign for Popery and Slavery;
the deliverers of Addreſſes, abhorring petitioning for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as likewiſe thoſe giving thanks for diſſolving the beſt of
Parliaments, &amp;c. being procured by the Emiſſaries of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, could not in the opinion of thoſe that hated Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
deſerve leſs than a Knighthood, to the incouragement
of others to follow their Example. It may be the Enemies to
this good Queen will object that ſhe had ſome angry fits; to which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55407:15"/>
may be anſwered, that they were born with, as Children at ſuch
times do with their Parents, being ſatisfied that ſhe had a true
and ſincere love for the Nation; upon which account ſome
little Paſſions ſubject to her ſex might very well be indured.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates, that have by corrupt waies to advance the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
been raiſed, and Honours conferred in the four laſt
Reigns, eſpecially ſince the Reſtauration, exceeds I believe above
forty times thoſe in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and yet
the number of years of all their Reigns, abating the eighteen
years interval, comes a quarter part ſhort of doubling hers; She
made few Lords, about four or five; very ſparing of Knighthood,
and never conferred any, but (as is before noted) for Merit;
and accordingly ſhe thriv'd in the Love of her Subjects at home,
and Honour abroad. In her time the Nation was famous for
glorious Action, as before mentioned, in relieving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
Proteſtants in <hi>France, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which ſhe
could not have done, had ſhe been tyed up by the late deviſed
Doctrin of Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance; beſides ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
her Rebels in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down, when none elſe could do it, the proud Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> deſigning then the univerſal Monarchy; whereas I do not
find one generous or honourable Act to be boaſted of, during the
laſt four Reigns.</p>
            <p>There are two ill Notions in behalf of Statiſts, which to
the prejudice of Mankind have prevailed in the World, the one
the calling Knavery Reaſon of State, by which they excuſe all
their ſiniſter and wicked deſigns, as if God had left us without
honeſt means for preſerving our ſelves; the other, that Wit and
Parts do alone qualifie a perſon for the ſervice of his Prince in
his weightieſt Affairs: It's true ſuch qualities are ornaments and
with Honeſty without Debauchery (which provokes God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
are fitteſt for publick Imployment, and below Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot be too much magnified and applauded; yet good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
parts with Diligence and Integrity, is much beyond the
higheſt flowen parts without the other; and we find great
things have been done, by ſuch as have not otherwiſe exceeded
than in Uprightneſs, Induſtry and Sincerity; for without theſe
Vertues Men are but like the Devils, the worſe for their Wit;
and therefore of all Men, as to publick Imployments, Men of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Principles are to be avoided, and they may infallibly be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55407:15"/>
diſcovered, if formerly imployed by their Actions in thoſe
times; for if they have been wicked in one Reign, they will be
the ſame in another; except there appear in them, a ſignal Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Repentance and Reformation; and beſides, they may
be known by their Favourites; for he that makes choice of ſuch
for his Confidents, as are of Immoral Principles, formerly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Injuſtice, Oppreſſion and Cruelty, may well be concluded
to be of the ſame Principles himſelf; for <hi>Birds of a Feather
flock together,</hi> and that Proverb ſeldom fails, That <hi>a Man may
be known by his Companion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit of God ſaith, <hi>Take away the wicked from before the
King, and his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs;</hi> But our
laſt Kings did ſo little regard this Divine Exhortation, that
when the Commons in Parliament (who ought to be accounted
good Judges of Mens fitneſs for State Imployment) have in
diſcharge of their Duties, endeavoured to follow this Advice,
by addreſſing againſt obnoxious perſons; tho they were never
ſo vile, it was the way to advance them in their Princes Favour,
as <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> &amp;c. to the dignifying and farther
rewarding them with Penſions or places of Profit; and then to
protect them by Adjournments, Prorogations or Diſſolutions
of Parliaments, to which we owe the diminution of our Glory
abroad, and the exaltation of our lately become great Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>Now if any of theſe perſons be in being, tho upon ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
they may merit a pardon for former Crimes, it cannot
an opportunity of acting over again, what they have been
already guilty of, to the prejudice and danger of the Nation,
but of being diſabled of all farther Imployments, either Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical,
Civil or Military.</p>
            <p>The Iniquity of the late times was ſo grear, that nothing that
could help the introducing of Slavery was left unattempted,
inſomuch, that we owe our Deliverance meerly to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God. The giving Power to the King, to levy Mony
in the Interval of Parliaments upon emergent occaſions, which
he was to be Judge of, was projected by our Counſellors, for
the perfecting our Slavery; and to get a Majority in the Houſe
to effect it, all ways poſſible were uſed; as the buying the
Votes of Members of Parliament, by Penſions (the higheſt of
Treaſons in the Judgment of that great Oracle of the Law, Sir
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55407:16"/>
               <hi>John Mainard)</hi> maintaining Tables at the publick Charge;
managed by ſome Members of the Houſe, that what could
not be done by dry Mony, might be by Debauchery, highly
odious, as well in the Executors as Deſigners; both proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from fordid, ſlaviſh and unmanly Principles: And ſo
many Members had by theſe means liſted themſelves againſt
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that had they not feared the ſelling of the
Nation, would have proved the ſelling of their own Stipend or
Wages, all had gone; which leaves us without being indebted
in the leaſt to our Truſtees, for refuſing to give us up to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power and Popery. But I do not in this deny, but that
there were a conſiderable number of worthy Patriots, that
would rather have ſuffered death, than have ſold the Rights
and Privileges of their Country, (whoſe Names deſerve to be
writ in Letters of Gold to Poſterity, whilſt th' other to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated
or marked with Infamy) had they not alas been over
voted by a corrupt and depraved Party, which muſt raiſe the
Indignation of all true freeborn Engliſhmen againſt thoſe in
the late times, that have had any hand in plotting, projecting
or abetting the betraying of their Country, if ſtill they continue
the ſame Principles without remorſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the ways uſed, as is before mentioned, for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of Popery and Slavery, it may be obſerved, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Deſigns of good Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were againſt the Pope
and his Adherents, the Deſigns of our late Governors have been
for him and his Friends. All the little tricks ſerviceable therein
having been made uſe of; as the impoſing Conſuls upon our
Merchants abroad, in places where they had never been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
meerly at their charge, to gratifie and oblige to them the
worſt of Men; giving them Patents to levy Mony, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their Office, upon the Subjects without their conſent,
contrary to the fundamental Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> as was done at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> &amp;c. And the like vigorouſly endeavoured in behalf
of a profeſſed Papiſt at <hi>Roterdam,</hi> but by the ſuddenneſs of our
Revolution they failed in that. And alſo another approach
to Arbitrary Government, was the paſſing by the Rules, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Law, for chuſing Sheriffs for the Counties, and
taking them at large, as might be moſt ſerviceable to unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Will and Luſt, &amp;c. And ſuch Practices as theſe were ſo
many, as are hardly to be enumerated; and now having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55407:16"/>
theſe, they with what goes before, and our League
with <hi>France,</hi> for exalting him in order to his humbling and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us low, one may think are enough to render thoſe times,
and the Actors in them, odious and unfit for future Truſt;
nothing that comes from ſuch, tho never ſo plauſibly delivered,
but the Integrity of it ought to be ſuſpected: For as formerly
they cryed out of 41 as a Scarecrow, that Notion being now
worn thread-bare, they have taken up that of a Commonwealth
and the care of the Church, to couſen the good People of this
Nation into a jealouſie of their beſt Friends, whilſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
work their ruin; but it is hoped that experience hath
made them wiſer, than to be ſo impoſed upon by miſapplying
of Names.</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> tho the Language of the Law was
endeavoured to be made an obnoxious Character of all ſuch as
ſhould ſpeak of Law, or expect the benefit of it; and it is to
be feared, that the ſame Projectors do aim at the ſame Deſign,
in adding to the word Commonwealth, the Care of the Church;
becauſe a plauſible Notion, when it is in no danger, except of
reducing them to a more ſober and vertuous Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
otherwiſe they would think it for the honour of the
Church, to have Men of Sobriety and Morality, accounted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it; and yet they will not allow any to be of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> tho ſuch as were never at a ſeparate Congregation
in their Lives, and as ready and perfect in their Reſponſes, as
any Cathedral Man whatever, if free from Immorality, and for
ruling according to Law.</p>
            <p>But it is no wonder, that our Bigotted Churchmen (who are
the only Men I mean) ſhould be willing to forget Forty one,
and in place thereof, to take up an outcry for Care of the
Church; becauſe about that time, the Committee for ſcandalous
Miniſters appointed by Parliament, diſcovered great Lewdneſs
and Ignorance in many of the Clergy; and had not the War
prevented their Proceedings, they had at that time, purged the
whole Kingdom of inſufficient, Popiſhly affected, ſuperſtitious
and debauched Miniſters; but having no Command over any,
(by reaſon of the War) ſave ſuch as were near hand; they
could not receive Information from above ſix or ſeven Counties,
which afforded them, according to my Information, not above
three Centries; the firſt of which (having eſcaped the Flames
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55407:17"/>
of <hi>London)</hi> is to be bought at Mr. <hi>Millers,</hi> Bookſeller near <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Church; by which it appears, they were ſo horridly ſcandalous,
that the Parliament could not have expoſed the Church; and
therein the Biſhops of thoſe times, for want of care in their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations,
had not Complaints from <hi>Oxford,</hi> for having unjuſtly
deprived them, forced the Parliament for their own Vindication,
to make the Names of the particular Miniſters with their Crimes
known by publiſhing them in Print.</p>
            <p>And if by the outcry of having a Care of the Church, is meant
the having ſuch another Inquiſition, all ſober Men will readily
agree to it; and if in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> of ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
a memory for Piety, there was need of ſuch an Inquiry
into the Lives, Converſations, Popiſhly affected and Sufficiency
of the Clergy; it may well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be thought much more needful,
after the ſeveral Reigns of his two Sons; beſides, if they be
not prevented, they may as they have already begun, go on
in taking upon them the Legislative Power, by farther Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Worſhip of God: For though the Act for injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Book of Common Prayer forbids, both affirmatively and
negatively, any other Method or Form of Service, Rights or
Ceremonies than is there directed, they are great Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,
in diſobeying that rule, in ſeveral additions in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to Popery, as in their ſecond Service, &amp;c. as alſo in being
ſuperabundant to Popery, in endeavouring to make a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
faſhion, to ſit bare during Sermon, which is but a new
thing in <hi>England,</hi> and not known in any other Chriſtian Church;
for tho the Papiſts are bare in their Church out of Service
time, whom we indeavour to imitate in that circumſtance, yet
they are covered during Sermon, wherein we outgo them; the
reaſon for which I leave to themſelves, confeſſing I never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
any for the one more than for th' other, and if it be
objected, that our Church doth not command being bare during
Sermon, yet they do it in making it uncivil to do otherwiſe.
And the Miniſter of <hi>Finchly,</hi> not long ſince, cauſed one for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covered, whilſt he was in his Sermon, to be committed;
who bringing his Action againſt the Juſtice, for falſe Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
recovered good damages of him; which tho ſufficient to
prove the Churches Uſurpation in this matter, they do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
go on in it, as a part of that new Popery former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended by <hi>Laud,</hi> in his time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55407:17"/>
This may perhaps be thought Severity upon the Church, but
there is no general Rule without an Exception; and I believe
there are many good Men to be herein excepted, tho the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
are guilty, and ſo bigotted, that there is no obliging them,
or Quarter to to be had with them, by any, but ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which is the unhappy Cauſe of our great Diviſions at
this time, eſpecially in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and that which is
worſt of all, without Remedy, ſo long as nothing leſs than the
Denial of Senſe, Reaſon and Morality will be allowed by our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
(the Perſons I only complain of,) as the Conditions of
Union and Converſation; and theſe following Inſtances may
well be thought, in ſome meaſure, a proof hereof: As, The
Lieutenancy refuſing a Captain, becauſe it was objected againſt
him, that he had, ſixteen Years before, heard that eminent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of the Goſpel, Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> (now with God,) preach a
Sermon: As another was refuſed by one of their Captains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Lieutenant, for anſwering to the Queſtion of What Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
he heard? That he heard ſuch an one, a moderate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
Upon which he was told by the Captain, that Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would not ſerve at this time; and therefore rejected him,
as not for his turn: Whereupon, the Party that ſhould have
been his Enſign being by, and hearing it, moved with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereat, rejected him for his Immoderation, and denied to
ſerve him; and all this ſince the Act of Toleration. But this
Spirit reigns ſo violently in them, that they are now feared to
be more ready than formerly, ſhould they, by Sheriffs like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
be called upon Juries, to murther and undo, by falſe
Verdicts, all that ſhall be known to own King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> to be King and Queen <hi>de Jure,</hi> as well as <hi>de Facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I leave <hi>Charles</hi> II. whoſe Council and Favourites left
nothing undone, which might perfect the Deſtruction of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſave the Selling <hi>Tangier</hi> to the <hi>French;</hi> which that they did
not do, is one of the Wonders of this Reign. There needs no
other Character of this King, than his Anſwer to one, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
him to have regard in his Deportment, to his Memory after
Death, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Let not Men ſpeak ill of him whilſt he lived,
and he cared not what they ſhould ſay of him when he was dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How he was taken away is in the dark, but vilely ſuſpected:
His Succeſſor may be ſaid not to be ſo Godleſs as he, tho not leſs
cruel; but from what Principle is not to be determined, unleſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55407:18"/>
it was from being both equal as to Fear, from whence Cruelty doth
generally proceed. I know, all the ill things done by the eldeſt
Brother, is ordinarily laid to the Charge of the younger; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I differ from that common Opinion, believing that <hi>Charles</hi> II.
was never impoſed upon by <hi>James</hi> II. but the firſt having the
Maſter-wit, and with it great Cunning, was willing his Brother
ſhould have the Name of any thing offenſive to the People, when
even it was that himſelf deſired moſt to have done. And thus
ends the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. whoſe Practices for arriving at Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power and Popery appear, in ſome degrees, over and
above what is before mentioned, by the Affidavits hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
with Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi>'s Information; which ſhew the
Subornation of Perjury to have been uſed by his Miniſters, for
taking away the Lives of Innocent Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> II. who ſucceeded his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> II. ſending two Men
to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to burn their Ships in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
who being taken, and at Execution confeſſing the Fact,
it ſticks much upon him in that Country, as do ſeveral other
Actions in this, which, for the ſake of his vertuous Succeſſors,
ought to be forgot, were it not neceſſary to give ſome Hints,
for the vindication of the preſent Government, and juſtifying
the late King's Abdication. The Burning of <hi>London,</hi> and the
many Fires ſince at St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> and <hi>Southwark, &amp;c.</hi> belonged
without doubt, to the Popiſh Plot; and how far the then Duke
of <hi>York</hi> was concerned therein, <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, in print, in
ſome kind ſhew.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by all other things before his coming to the Crown,
he no ſooner arrived at the Throne, than he declared himſelf a
Papiſt; a Name (in favour of that Religion) out of faſhion ever
ſince the Reſtoration; but being the Language of the Law, I
think fitteſt to be uſed. At his firſt appearing in Council after
his Brother's Death, which was as quick as could be, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to rule according to Law; and yet, in two or three Days
after, commanded by Proclamation the Payment of Cuſtoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given by Parliament, which is contrary to Law; and from
that time forward went on in the ſame way, going publickly to
Maſs the firſt <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> of which Religion the bigotted Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(who will never believe any thing till it be too late) would
not before own him to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55407:18"/>
His Brother died on the <hi>Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi>-ſeven-nights af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was in the Evening privately buried. Before the Burial he
knighted Sir <hi>Peter Rich,</hi> and ſoon after did the ſame by Sir <hi>Roger
L' Eſtrange,</hi> and made Sir <hi>George Jeoffreys</hi> a Baron; none of which
three, as may be obſerved, would King <hi>Charles</hi> II. ſo far digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
tho he had made them his Tools to ſerve the worſt of Turns.
The now Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> was knighted in his Sheriffalty, and
poſſibly for the ſake of his Family; for Sir <hi>Peter Rich,</hi> his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who joyned with him in appointing the Jury that found my
good Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> guilty, and brought him to Execution, was
paſſed by till <hi>James</hi> II. came to the Crown, and judged him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Honour of Knighthood.</p>
            <p>This King called immediately a Parliament, and thought he
had by his Influence ſo pack'd one, that there were not thirty
Members that would not do as they were bid. They gave him
great Supplies of Mony, and were as ſevere againſt the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> as himſelf was by his Inſtruments, <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Jeoffreys,</hi>
againſt all in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſuppoſed to be of his Party; contrary to
the Mercy of former Times, when the Suffering of a few attoned
for the reſt. But when Popery came upon the Stage, this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would not ſerve the turn; which cauſed the Adjourning
and Proroguing of it from time to time, hoping in the Intervals
to have moulded it to his purpoſe; but that not ſucceeding, at
laſt he diſſolved it, and then betook himſelf to Popiſh Counſel,
<hi>Petre</hi> the Jeſuit bing made one of his Council, and of his Cabal,
not only contrary to Law, but alſo to the practice of moſt, if
not all other Popiſh Princes. For tho the Jeſuits make it their
Deſign to skrue themſelves ſo far into the Favour of Princes, as
to become their Confeſſors, that having Opportunity of infuſing
wicked Principles into them, and by knowing their Secrets,
may have the greater Advantage of doing Miſchief; yet are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never admitted Members of their Councils. The wiſe
<hi>Venetians</hi> baniſhed them their Territories, for their pernicious
Principles, until, in requital of the Pope's aſſiſting them in their
Wars againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> they were received into the City of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
Anno 1664.</hi> but are by the People, who hate them, very
inviduouſly looked upon there. Nay, <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo jealous of their
Immorality, (as may be preſumed) that they rarely admit of above
two, or three at moſt, to be at one time of the Conſiſtory, the Pope's
Council, which conſiſts of Seventy two Cardinals, when all are
there, which is ſeldom, or never.</p>

Theſe Men hurried this King into all Extravagances, and the
higheſt Invaſion of the Rights and Liberties of the People that
had ever been attempted. The Corrupting of our Mercenary
Judges, to the making any thing Law he would have, for taking
away the Lives of innocent Men at his pleaſure, and giving him the
Diſpenſing Power: The ſetting up extrajudicially Eccleſiaſtical
Commiſſioners, to turn Men out of their Free-holds at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
as at <hi>Magdalen</hi>-College in <hi>Oxford:</hi> The erecting Popiſh
Schools, Chapels, Convents and Seminaries; all expreſly againſt
Law: The Breach of his repeated Promiſes, and Coronation-Oath:
Theſe, I ſay, were all but Trifles, compared to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Endeavours of overturning our Foundations, in going from
Town to Town, to diſcourage thoſe Magiſtrates that would not
engage to ſend ſuch Members to the Parliament, (he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,)
as would repeal the Teſt and Penal Laws, and cajole
thoſe that would: His turning out the Mayor and beſt of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
of <hi>York,</hi> and chuſing Papiſts in their room, had not the
Commiſſion been defective as to the filling thoſe empty Places;
ſo that that City was without a Mayor, till His preſent Majeſty
reſtored them to their Rights: As alſo his Commiſſionating
others, under the Name of Regulators, to reform (as they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it) other Corporations; and all to the End of having the Teſt
removed, (the only Obſtacle,) that the Way might be open for
an entire Popiſh Parliament, who would have been ſure, in twelve
Months time, to have made new Laws againſt all Diſſenters
from Popery, and have perſecuted them for the ſame with Fire
and Fagot.</p>
            <p>As to the propounding an Equivalent, or a new <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
for eſtabliſhing Liberty of Conſcience, which ſhould be unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,
that was ſo vain and idle, as could not expect Belief
or Regard from any, ſave Men of little Wit or Proſpect; for it
ever will be, as it ought to be, in the power of ſucceeding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
to repeal the Acts of former: And therefore, tho the
King might promiſe he would not conſent, during his Time, to
any Alteration, he could not promiſe ſo much for his Succeſſors;
and farther, as to himſelf, his Steadineſs to his Engagement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(after Breach of his Coronation-Oath, and re-iterated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of Ruling according to Law) might well be ſuſpected.
Beſides, had he really intended to make good his Promiſe, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which, by his own Principles, is his Superiour)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55407:19"/>
would have forbid it: And he that is not ignorant of their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Doctrin and Practices, in caſe of Diſobedience, durſt not
have diſobeyed, for fear of a Doſe, or a Fig. So that it is no
leſs to be admired that the Papiſts ſhould make ſuch ridiculous
Propoſitions to a knowing Proteſtant People, as that there ſhould
be found any among them who would give heed to the leaſt
thing of this nature, coming from their implacable Enemies.
There were in a few Days two Proclamations of Pardon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
the latter excepting ſome that had been pardoned by the
former, when the Parties being beyond the Sea, could not be
guilty of new Tranſgreſſions, not hearing of the one before the
other, the diſtance of Time being too little; and, as it is ſaid,
one or both was not ſealed, deſignedly neglected by <hi>Jeoffreys,</hi>
that Engine of Cruelty, and Monſter of Impudence. Nay, it is
ſaid, that the King, upon hearing of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
for <hi>England,</hi> ordered the Reſtoration of the Fellows of
<hi>Magdalen</hi>-College in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and upon the News of his Diſaſter
at Sea, gave preſently contrary Order. All which is a clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of his Principles, and how little his Promiſes or
Pardons are to be relied upon.</p>
            <p>The Arts and Tricks his Predeceſſors had made uſe of, for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and Injuſtice, (as by <hi>Innuendo's, &amp;c.)</hi> to take away
the Lives and Eſtates of honeſt Men, were by his blood-thirſty
Inſtruments illegally improved; as the Deaths of Alderman <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Charles Bateman,</hi> and the barbarous and inhumane
Proceedings againſt Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> do ſufficiently evince; he having
been, without Preſident, ſo cruelly and unmercifully uſed, as
may charitably be concluded, was intended by that way to have
murthered him, becauſe they could not have the leaſt Colour of
Law for doing it otherwiſe; and that he out-lived the Barbarity
of it, he hath reaſon to acknowledge a Miracle of Mercy from
God, and for it walk thankfully before him all the Days of his
Life. But beſides this, this whole Reign was no leſs than Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Cruelty, as appears by excepting about One hundred
and eighty Perſons by Name, out of his Pardon, upon the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Invaſion; and by Qualifications, ſcarce any that
were not profeſſed Papiſts, or as bad, were left unqueſtionable;
eſpecially if ever they had croſſed the Seas, by that Exception of
all Treaſons beyond the Seas. Some of thoſe excepted were Girls
at School, from ſeven, to ten Years of Age, for giving Ribbonds
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55407:20"/>
to a few of the Duke's Soldiers; and they, with the reſt, were,
by Order from the King and Council, proſecuted for Rebels,
by the King's Envoys Extraordinary with the States General, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence of their Articles of Peace. To that End, ſuppoſing
them all to be fled into their Countries, and the Faith of the Nation
being engaged for the truth of it by the Envoys Averment thereof,
the States not thinking it decent to queſtion the Validity of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
gave Sentence of Baniſhment, upon pain of Death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the whole Number, (ſave two or three that had bought
their Pardons, the Children being included,) that ſhould come
into their Territories: Yet had all that was in any of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
under their Dominions been brought to a Trial; it was but
a few which had been with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> that could
have been found guilty of Rebellion, according to the Proceſs;
however, could they by this Means have got them all ſent home,
they would there, right or wrong, have been murthered, as was
Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong.</hi> But the Injuſtice of this ought to reflect
only upon the King's evil Council, for the Violation of the Faith
of the Nation with a Foreign State, (which ought to be ſacred;)
and not upon the States for giving Credit to the Information,
which, according to the Rules of Nations, ought to have been
authentick; and being falſe, it was highly injurious to the States,
of which, had they known, they might well have complained:
But the King, for the Immorality of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath received his
Reward, (tho the reſt eſcape,) in a juſt Abdication; and we the
Benefit, by an happy Exchange for the better: The Lord grant
we may not ſin away our Mercies.</p>
            <p>After twenty eight Years induſtrious Endeavours to debauch
the Nation by wicked, profane and Atheiſtical Examples, which
prevail more with corrupt Nature than Precepts, this King, who
by adding of Papiſts in all Employments, having brought the
Judges, Gariſons, Sheriffs and Juſtices of the Peace throughout
all the Nation to his devotion, and got a ſtanding Army of Six
and thirty thouſand Horſe and Foot, every way well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
wanting nothing in the Eye of Reaſon, we were left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt hopes of Recovery, the help of Man ſeeming to be
in vain; but then, when he ſaid in his Heart, All was his own,
and none ſhould control him, it pleaſed God in his Providence,
for the Good of his People, to infatuate him, in ſetting up a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to diſ-inherit his own Children, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55407:20"/>
the Heirs to the Crown; which when nothing elſe in humane
Proſpect could have done it, this opened the Eyes of all ſober
Proteſtants, to the ſeeing his Deſign of leaving us and our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
under Popiſh Idolatry and Thraldom; from whence aroſe
an Agreement for forcing him to rule according to Law, as he
was by Oath obliged; which cauſing him to abdicate the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in running away, and applying himſelf to the great Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Earth for Help, gave the People the Opportunity of
aſſerting their natural Right, in providing for their own Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by chuſing King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for their rightful
and legal Sovereigns, whom the Lord in Mercy bleſs with a long
and proſperous Reign over us; and whilſt we give due Honour
to the Inſtruments, let us not forget aſcribing the Praiſe and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
due to Almighty God, as the Author and Principal of our
Deliverance, and have always in a thankful Remembrance this,
and all other his ſaving Providences towards this poor Nation,
through ſeveral Reigns and Ages.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> was under Perſecution in the
Perſons of the Biſhops, the Preſident of <hi>Magdalen</hi>-College in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi>-College in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> they were full of Compaſſion and Brotherly Kindneſs
towards Diſſenters, and ready to joyn with them for Redreſs
of Grievances, by the help of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now King of
<hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> but were no ſooner freed from their Fears of being
ſuperceded by Prieſts and Jeſuits, than headed by ſome who
ſtood in need of a Party to render them conſiderable, that thereby
they might blot out the Remembrance of former Crimes; than
they forgot former Profeſſions of Moderation, and the Afflictions
of their Brethren; and to that degree, that they caballed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
their Burthens, and monopolizing all Employments to
themſelves, by continuing the Sacramental Teſt, though to the
fatal detriment of the Kingdom; for had not that Bar for truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſſenters been in the way, <hi>Ireland</hi> (in the Opinion of thoſe
that beſt know that Country) might e'er this have been reduced,
to the ſaving moſt of the Blood and Treaſure that hath been ſpent
upon it; and I fear, the Blood ſo needleſly ſpilt will lie at their
Doors that were the Authors of it.</p>
            <p>It was the Diſſenters that ſaved <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>Ireland;</hi> for tho by the Artifice of ſome eminent Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
the Honour was aſcribed to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and his Party, (for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55407:21"/>
which he got a Reward he did not deſerve,) it appears by the
Narrative of that Siege, writ by Mr. <hi>Mackenzy,</hi> Chaplain to a
Regiment during the Siege, and writ with that Candour and
Faithfulneſs as carries its Teſtimony with it, the Applauſe and
Reward belonged to the Diſſenters; for even the Anſwer to this
Book, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> doth no way detect, but rather
gives it Credit: But Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> being dead, I ſhall forbear all
farther Reflections upon him, he having been a good-natured
Man, and what he did amiſs being from the influence of others:
He confeſſed there were four Nonconformiſts in the Town for one
Conformiſt; and ſome ſay, eight for one; but the Authority
being in the Church-men, who were timerous, if not worſe, you
will find by Mr. <hi>Mackenzey</hi>'s Relation, that it was the <hi>Mobile,</hi>
who were Diſſenters, that ſaved the Place, againſt the Will of
the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now I ſuppoſe I may be cenſured, as being diſcontented for
want of Employment, as not being able to qualifie my ſelf. To
which I anſwer, That thoſe that know me, know I never ſought
any Employment; and if I had, I have a Latitude to qualifie
my ſelf: So that I may truly affirm, that what I here write,
proceeds purely from Affection to my Country, and the Cauſe
of God.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>London-Derry</hi> was at laſt relieved, and as is
ſaid, might have been ſix Weeks ſooner, with leſs difficulty,
and the ſaving of four or five thouſand Lives, which in that time
died of Famine. After the Relief of it, Collonel <hi>Murrey</hi> and
thirteen Troops of Horſe, who had done the greateſt Service in
defending of the Town, were reduced, and greatly ſuſpected,
for no other Reaſon than becauſe Diſſenters, and free from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery;
tho we may obſerve, that after Relief of the Town,
little of moment was done, till His Majeſty's happy Arrival,
ſave what was done by thoſe called <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-men, who tho not
all Diſſenters, are much of their Judgment, Friends to them,
and joyned with them; which one would think, might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
the reſt of that ſort to Employment in theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Times.</p>
            <p>I do not aim herein at reflecting upon the Conformiſts in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for it muſt be confeſſed that there are many ſober, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and religious Perſons of that Judgment, as <hi>London</hi> hath
experienced, in being, contrary to what was deſigned by others,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55407:21"/>
providentially preſerved by them, as appears by the Oppoſition
the preſent worthy and moſt deſerving Lord Mayor hath met
with from thoſe that were <hi>Hectors</hi> for delivering up of Charters,
and joyning with <hi>Jeffreys, &amp;c.</hi> in all Arbitrary and Tyrannical
Ways; and for no other Reaſon that we know, than for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
next under God, and Her Majeſty, by his wiſe Conduct in
the Abſence of the King, the Preſerver of this City and Nation
in Peace and Safety; for his Oppoſers were no ſooner delivered
by the Act of Grace from fear of Puniſhment for former Crimes,
than they returned with the Dog to his Vomit, and with the
Swine to the wallowing in the Mire of their corrupt Principles;
inſomuch, that I think one may, without breach of Charity, ſay,
That there is none, who are not guilty of great ignorance, that
is for turning out the preſent Lord Mayor, but ſuch as would, if
they could, turn out the King.</p>
            <p>But I would not be underſtood in this, to complain of any,
ſave the Bigots of the Church, ſuch as will not allow of any to
be of their number; who have Charity for thoſe that are not
of their Communion, and have not the ſame Latitude in all
Immorality, as they have even to the taking away the Lives
and Eſtates of innocent Men, that are not of their minds, by
falſe Verdicts, when it ſhall be in their power; and that they
may reach their own Members, that exceed them in Vertue and
Sobriety, they nickname them with the Name of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
Men; for ſince, they cannot call them Drunkards,
Swearers nor Whoremaſters, they will call them ſomething,
to render them, as they think, odious to the People; and tho
they have reaſon to know, that from the experience, the People
have had, of their Integrity and Uprightneſs they are not be
cozened by injurious Names; yet from <hi>Machivel</hi>'s Rule, That
by calumniating boldly, ſomething will ſtick, they continue
their Reproach, tho contrary to ſenſe or reaſon. Every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman,
that is not Knave or Fool, being as much a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
Man, as thoſe they mean, who are no more for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
than <hi>Magna Charta</hi> makes them.</p>
            <p>But it hath had this effect, to hinder the moſt uſeful Men
from ſerving their King and Country, to the great damage of
both, if it prove not their deſtruction; in keeping up the way
for advancing Folly, Ignorance and Knavery, by a bare reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the choice of Officers to one Party, which, if continued,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55407:22"/>
muſt undo this Kingdom. And for preventing the ſame, it
were to be wiſhed, that as in a great meaſure, the Bigots of the
Church have had the Conduct of Affairs this two years, with ill
ſucceſs; that the moderate Men of all ſides might be tryed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Affairs will proſper better in their hands: By moderate
Men, I mean thoſe of both Judgments; that are free from groſs
and open Scandal, which are the perſons upon whoſe endeavours,
we may moſt reaſonably expect a Bleſſing from God; for from
the contrary qualifications, it is not to be hoped. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
till Men of Religious, or at leaſt, Moral Principles, who
ſhall ſerve their King and Country, not from ſelf-ends, but from
a true zeal for Civil as well as Religious Liberty, be imployed,
(as ſuch are to be had) it cannot be expected that <hi>England</hi>
ſhould proſper; for common Swearers, Drunkards, Whore-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who impudently carry their Whores into the Field and to
Sea, to corrupt, by their Examples, the People; nor thoſe for
King <hi>William,</hi> as King <hi>de facto</hi> only, will ever do the Work.
And the Bigots of the Church cannot with ſo much reaſon, call
thoſe of their own Communion, Diſſenters; becauſe they have
Chriſtian Charity for Non-Conformiſts, as they themſelves may
be called of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for declaring they had rather
be Papiſts than Presbyterians, as many of them do; when their
difference with the Papiſts, is upon fundamentals, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
their Salvation; and with the Presbyterians, by their own
Confeſſion, but about things indifferent, which ought not to be
impoſed, according to that Scripture; <hi>For it ſeemed good to the
Holy Ghoſt and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthens than theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
things.</hi> Acts 15. ver. 28.</p>
            <p>And farther, to inforce this Argument, (which I know will
be little regarded by Church-Bigots and Formaliſts) it is to be
obſerved, that it was, until the King's Arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thoſe
of Religious Principles, there, as alſo in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi>
that hath done any thing of moment; and it is not without ſtrong
ſuſpicion, that thoſe two excellent Gentlemen, Lieutenant Col.
<hi>Cleland</hi> and Major <hi>Henderſon</hi> was deſerted, who to ſave the Life of
their Country, loſt their own; and that the relieving of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderry</hi>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was delayed, both in deſign to reduce thoſe
over-ſober Men, as of too vertuous Examples for thoſe Times:
And as to <hi>Savoy,</hi> that Duke whoſe Family hath from all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
been great Perſecutors, is now come totally off from that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55407:22"/>
Helliſt and Deviliſh Principle, in uſurping the Prerogative of
God, who only hath dominion over the Conſcience, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to receive the Aſſiſtance of his reformed Subjects without
debarring them by a Sacramental Teſt, the benefit of which he
hath already ſufficiently experienced. And to this may be added,
the Example of <hi>Spain,</hi> as a warning to all of undepraved ſenſe,
to avoid Perſecution upon account of Religion; for that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
when under Paganiſm, Mahometiſm, with a mixture of
Jewdaiſm, was populous, rich and flouriſhing, beyond all or moſt
Countries, is now under Chriſtianity, by Perſecution become
diſpeopled, beggerly and of little account, compared to others
formerly of no conſideration to them. And it may be foretold,
that our great Neighbour, who by Liberty in Religion firſt
raiſed himſelf to that height he is now arrived at, ſhall by his
late contrary actings, loſe his Grandure, have all his Honour
laid in the duſt, and brought as low as he is now great.</p>
            <p>I think no ſober perſon, but will after the peruſal hereof,
own our two laſt Reigns to have been cruel, unjuſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
to the laſt degree; and that ſuch Guilt could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
by our Kings, without Inſtruments imployed by them,
who by Law are anſwerable for miſcarriages in Government.
And as Oppreſſion is a crying Sin, that pulls down Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon a People, if not repented and reformed; ſo there
is a Duty incumbent upon us, to anſwer the Rebukes we have
lately met with from God in our Affairs, by a ſpeedy and
thorough Reformation, not deferring it till times of Peace;
the want of Reformation being generally the occaſion of
War: And God ſeems to call for it, by the little uſe he hath
made of our Immoraliſts, either at Sea or Land, other than as
a ſcourge for our Sins. His Majeſty hath a great Reputation
for a profeſſed Enemy to Swearing, Drinking and Cheating, &amp;c.
And if thoſe, whoſe Calling makes it their Duty to promote
Reformation, be the Obſtructers of it, Flattery, which never
proceeds from a ſincere Heart, will not defend them againſt the
Almighty; to whom I leave them, with putting them in mind,
that an Inſtance might be given of a Reformation that was made
in the height of a War, which never had ſucceſs till then.</p>
            <p>The way to appeaſe God's Wrath, is to inquire after Men of
debauched Lives, and avoid them; after the Authors and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of our former Grievances, cauſe Reſtitution to be made to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55407:23"/>
ſufferers, by thoſe that did the Wrong; and to diſable, for the
future, all Offenders therein from bearing any Office, either in
Church or State, in whom doth not appear, a true change in
practice, and eſpouſing honeſt Principles, to the end, they
may have no more opportunity for acting their Miſchiefs over
again.</p>
            <p>The Lord ſeems to have done his part in puniſhing the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
leaving the Inſtruments to us; for it may be reaſonably
thought, that had it not been for evil Counſellors, our Kings
could not alone have projected or endeavoured the ruin of our
Nation by introducing Popery and Slavery, as was without
contradiction intended.</p>
            <p>By what goes before, together with what may be farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
it will appear, that the Preſervation of our Rights and
Liberties hath to a miracle, been ſolely from the Providence
of God, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the late King <hi>James,</hi> in favour of Popery, ſhould
ſet up a ſuppoſititious Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to diſinherit his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and all the Heirs of the Crown; whereby he alienated the
Hearts of the People, when nothing leſs could have done it, was
a great Providence.</p>
            <p>2. The King (when Prince of <hi>Orange)</hi> his diſaſter at Sea,
upon his firſt ſetting ſail, cauſing the late King <hi>James</hi>'s recalling
his Order, for reſtoring the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> was a Providence, in that he thereby convinced the
People, that there was no relying upon his Promiſes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were ready to do.</p>
            <p>3. That when the Prince was deſigned for the North, he
ſhould change his Courſe, for the Weſt, where the Wind and
Weather was miraculouſly ſerviceable to him, was a ſaving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>4. That the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Naval Fleet which might with
eaſe have deſtroyed the Fly-Boats, which tranſported the
Prince's Army, and did not do it, was a ſignal Providence.</p>
            <p>5. That the late King <hi>James</hi> deſerted his Army at <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
when half of it was more than ſufficient, to have fought the
Prince, was a Providence not to be forgot.</p>
            <p>6. That the late King <hi>James</hi> abdicated the Government, when
otherwiſe, we muſt have been all in Blood, ſome of the chief
of the City ſhewing ſo much fondneſs of him, that with ſpeed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55407:23"/>
they with Tears for Joy, congratulated his Return after his
firſt leaving of the Town, was a Mercy.</p>
            <p>7. That <hi>London-Derry,</hi> a little inſignificant place without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Fortifications, ſhould with ſo much Miſery and Hardſhip
defend themſelves; and in that, preſerve <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the
late King, who was ſaid to have 60000 Men in Arms, and to
loſe 8000 before it; and this done by the <hi>Mobile,</hi> headed by
ſome honeſt Officers againſt the good Will of thoſe in Authority,
was a Providence, which in after Ages will hardly be believed.</p>
            <p>8. That the <hi>French</hi> had ſurprized us, whilſt at anchor, had
not the Wind providentially turned to our preſervation, was a
Mercy that ought not to be forgot.</p>
            <p>9. That the <hi>French</hi> ſhould not underſtand the advantage <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>
gave them at Sea, in retreating before them; and that
they ſhould neglect the opportunity of intercepting, at the
Mouth of the Channel, our ſeveral Fleets of Merchants Ships,
then expected from ſeveral Parts of the World, and no care
taken by us for their Preſervation, was an unexpreſſible Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
For if thoſe Fleets had miſcarried, the trading Party
of the Nation had, in a great meaſure, been ruined: So that
upon the whole, we may ſay, we have been preſerved by the
Providence of God, againſt our own Wills, whether we will
or no. But this miraculous Deliverance gives us no Warrant
to rely upon Miracles for our Preſervation, but is a Caution to
us for the future, to be careful in the choice of Officers of
Truſt.</p>
            <p>I know it is ordinarily pleaded, in the behalf of Favourites
to Princes, That the Complaints againſt them are from Envy,
and not Juſtice; but in contradiction to that, it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that the Counſellors to good Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were,
for ought we find, free from all Complaints by the People in
Parliament. Nay, <hi>Leſter,</hi> who had much of the Queens Ear, being
an ill Man, or none of the beſt, could not influence her in what
was not good; nor prevent her Reproofs, when guilty of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
which obviated Parliaments Complaints. And I think,
it may be relyed upon, that the Commons in Parliament will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
complain of any, who ſeek not themſelves, but the good and
true Intereſt of King and Country. And as the ways for Kings
to gain Love and Honour, and be in Safety, is to make the Law
their Rule, and not as the two laſt Kings, without regard to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55407:24"/>
their Coronation Oath, ſetting all Law aſide, and acting Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily;
as in their pricking of Sheriffs for the Counties,
not out of thoſe preſented to them, as the Law directs, but
taking them at large, as they pleaſe or corrupt Intereſt directs.
For to govern well, (which is a Security beyond Arms, Oaths or
all the tricks of ill Men and Favourites) ſo it is the Intereſt of
Favorites, tho they ſeldom believe it, to make publick Intereſt
equal (if not ſuperior) to their own private; for we do not
find, the Families raiſed formerly, by evil Counſel given to their
Princes, to have been of long continuance.</p>
            <p>Our Diviſions at preſent are deplorable, and far be it from
me to deſire the widening of them; but they may be ſaid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from Selfiſhneſs in the Clergy, and ſome Criminals, who
joyned with them, to make a Party for their own particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and Preſervation, againſt the true Intereſt and Senſe of
vertuous and honeſt Men; ſo that in this diſtracted condition we
are divided into thoſe for the preſent King, and thoſe for the
Abdicated King; theſe latter being irreconcilable to all that are
not of their Opinion, and the former ſubdivided into thoſe that
are profeſſedly for King <hi>William,</hi> as King <hi>de Jure,</hi> and thoſe for
him only as King <hi>de Facto;</hi> whereby the latter making the King
no better than an Uſurper, muſt themſelves be little leſs than
<hi>Jacobites,</hi> whoſe Actings gives us cauſe to have ſad Thoughts of
Heart, in ſeeing ſome of the late ways or proceedings put in
practice with improvement.</p>
            <p>I do not remember, any formerly taken up and impriſoned,
without pretended Proof of ſome Crime againſt them, or at leaſt
of pretended great Suſpicion; but of late, we had Perſons freeſt
from ſuſpect, firſt ſeized, and then their Studies and Writings
ſearched, to get matter to juſtifie the Seizure; which leaves all
Men unſafe, as well in reference to their Eſtates (from the
danger their Writings are thereby in) as in reference to their
Liberty. And herein they ſhewed their Spleen againſt ſuch as are
for the preſent King, as King <hi>de Jure;</hi> for of any other Crime,
one lately impriſoned, could not be ſuſpected, having expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf, ſufficiently in Print, againſt a Commonwealth, a
Notion out of hatred to Liberty (our natural Right) lately
ſtarted, to render all thoſe obnoxious, that are for Common
Freedom. Our ancient Government, according to Law, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that in a corrupt and factious Age, the honeſteſt things may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55407:24"/>
be blaſted by miſapplying of Names, as in calling Evil, Good;
and Good, Evil; Diſloyalty, Loyalty; and Loyalty, Diſloyalty,
&amp;c. And this, whilſt <hi>de Facto</hi> Men can hardly (in ſome Mens
Opinion) offend in any thing they do or ſay. But his Majeſty,
being now through Mercy, returned in Health and Safety from
<hi>Ireland,</hi> we hope, that Men ſincerely honeſt, real and faithful
to him, without reſerve, in reference to any Pretender, will be
as well in Security, as Enemies, or thoſe that are no farther for
his Intereſt, than may render them meritorious. Should the
Abdicated King return, from which good Lord deliver us, and
from all ſuch, whoſe Deſign is to juſtifie the two laſt Reigns,
by diſowning any Fault in them (ſave the endeavour of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of Popery, of which they make the King ſoly guilty)
that by his Inſtruments and ſuch like, they may the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
play the ſame Game over again.</p>
            <p>As there is no perfection in this World, ſo there is nothing
good, but as it is compared with worſe. The Reign of good Queen
<hi>Eliz.</hi> who was a true Lover of her People and Country, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be liable to ſome exceptions; but being a Reign of glorious
Actions, of impartial Juſtice, not murthering and otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
innocent Men by corrupt Juries, Judges and ſuborned Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
ſo free from tricks for plundering the Subjects Purſes to
ſpend viciouſly and profuſely, to make a Party for Arbitrary
Government, that when Mony hath been given her for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Occaſions, the Cauſe being taken away, ſhe returned the
Mony to her Subjects. This Reign, I ſay, compared to the four
ſucceeding Reigns, chargeable with all that is contrary to theſe
Excellencies, may comparatively be reckoned perfect.</p>
            <p>The Counſellors and Favorites of this great Queen may have
had ſome Errors in Politicks, tho unknown to me; yet having
made the end of all their Counſels, the Honour, Proſperity,
Safety and joynt Intereſt of the Queen and Country without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
them; I ſay, thoſe Counſellors and Favorites compared
with thoſe of the four laſt Reigns, whoſe Counſels and Actions
have been diametrically oppoſite to theirs, may comparatively
be ſaid to have been unblameable.</p>
            <p>Tho the Church, in good Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome of perſecuting Spirits, yet thoſe being over-ballanced
by the Piety and Zeal of ſome of the then Guides of the Church,
not incouraging the Profanation of the Lord's Day, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55407:25"/>
Preaching twice upon that Day, nor yet putting
down Weekly or Monthly Lectures. Tho that Reign may be
ſaid, not to have been totally free from profligate and ill Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the generality was ſober and vertuous, compared to the
ſucceeding Reigns, eſpecially the two laſt, ſo overrun with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
and all manner of Profaneſs.</p>
            <p>And now, being freed from the Grievances of the four laſt
Reigns, it might be expected, that all ſhould hate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of thoſe Times, and never more hanker after the like;
the doing of which cannot proceed from any thing leſs, than in
ſome, a depraved, ſlaviſh Nature, delighting in the Barbarity
of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries: In ſome well meaning honeſt Men,
from Ignorance, not underſtanding their true Intereſt; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
from a hatred to common Freedom, being content to be
tyrannized over by their Superiors, ſo they may but do the ſame
over their Inferiors: And in others, who underſtand the true
Intereſt of the Nation, from preferring an Opportunity of
cozening, cheating and advancing themſelves to Honours and
Dignities to all other Conſiderations whatever. And from
hence, together with Selfiſhneſs and want of Integrity in ſome,
profeſſing Honeſty, thereby deceiving the weak and credulous,
whilſt they purſue their own Intereſt without regard to the
Publick, proceeds the Miſery of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I take no pleaſure in remembring the Vices and Enormities
of our Country, but am greatly troubled to hear of the horrid
Debauchery, that is amongſt us; and to obſerve, how this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is degenerated from a Land formerly famous for Piety,
to that, of all manner of Profaneſs, againſt which, I have
thought it my Duty, thus to bear my Teſtimony.</p>

                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> I the ſaid <hi>Henry Wilkinſon</hi> do declare, and am ready to

of the Clock in the Evening, one Mr. <hi>Walter Baines</hi> came to
Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Seller in the <hi>King's Bemch</hi> Priſon, and ſent for me,
out of the Garden in the <hi>King's Bench;</hi> who, upon ſight, told
me, he was ſorry to ſee me in that place, and afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
me to accept of a Pot of Beer or Ale. In the time of its
drinking, Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> ſhewed and expreſſed the greateſt Kindneſs
that could be expected from a Brother; which made me believe
he had ſome Deſign. Then he deſired to know what ſort of
Wine I would drink: I told him, not any; beſides, the Cellar
had none: But he then called for Brandy, which we had. Then
he told me Mr. <hi>Brownrig</hi> was ſent Priſoner to <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle for
Treaſon, and for appearing for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> And alſo
the ſaid <hi>Baines</hi> ſaid, he had ſent a Note to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to

him, done for the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> at my Requeſt, as he pretends;
and that my Lord ſent him word, it was a Sham and a Cheat put
upon him, and therefore he would pay him no ſuch Bill.</p>
               <p>At the ſame he told me, I could not but know much of the
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Deſigns againſt the King, and that I might do
well to diſcover it to him, who was ready to do me any Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and deſired an Opportunity. Alſo that he had been lately
with Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> and that he had a great Intereſt with my Lord
<hi>Hyde.</hi> (All this time I underſtood what was deſigning for my

did know formerly, from Mr. <hi>Baines,</hi> about three Months ago;
That he was then of an Opinion that Mr. <hi>Brownrig</hi> could diſcover
ſome unlawful Practices againſt the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which, I
confeſs, I did wiſh might be diſcovered; for although I have
ſerved His Majeſty in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond Sea, (and no other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55407:28"/>
Intereſt,) and was as inſtrumental in His Majeſty's Reſtoration as
any Perſon of my Fortune could be; ſo I am for his Continuance
by all lawful Means, and never to ſtudy the Deſtruction of his
Friends or Enemies by unjuſt Deſigns. I have cauſe to believe
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> loves His Majeſty, for he always was pleaſed
to ſhew me Reſpect, for that I had ſerved His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Now Night drew on for Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> to be gone; all the time he
ſtayed was ſpent with a great deal of Zeal upon me on the ſame
Subject. He told me, I ſhould have a Pardon, and need not to
fear it: I would not deny his profer. But he farther told me,
I ſhould be conſiderably rewarded: Neither did I deny that, but
told him, When I was requited for my former Service, I would
ſerve his Majeſty in what I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaw here was a deſign laid; and
although I had reaſon to take it unkindly to have any thing fixed
upon me, or to make me an Inſtrument beyond my Knowledge
yet I was reſolved to humour the Buſineſs. Upon which Mr. <hi>Baines</hi>
took his Leave this Night, and told me, at parting, he would
in a few Days ſee me again, but left me with ſuch Promiſes as
at preſent I cannot expreſs, not much queſtioning my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> That on <hi>Tueſday, October</hi> the 11th, 1681. I was ſent for
to Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi>'s Houſe, near the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Booth;</hi> who
told me, he was glad to ſee me, but ſorry to ſee us both in that
Condition; for he was a Priſoner, as I was. He told me, he had
removed himſelf laſt Night from one of the <hi>Compters.</hi> I required
of him, how he came to be at a Waiter's Houſe? He told me,
it was not denied him, although I could not be admitted one
Night. I underſtood he was engaged in the Deſign; I conſidered
he had been a Man of bad Principles, therefore I was reſolved to
ſtand upon my Guard. Preſently he told me, he was to tell me,
I had an Opportunity to be a better Man in my Fortune than
ever I was before, and that now I had an Opportunity to make
my Fortune; and that I might have Five Hundred Pounds <hi>per
Annum</hi> ſetled upon me and my Heirs, or Ten Thouſand Pounds
in Money, which I pleaſed, if I would diſcover what I knew of
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and his Deſign in changing the Government
to a Commonwealth, and witneſs againſt him. I replied, and
told him, No Body would believe I ſhould be made privy to ſuch
a Deſign, (if ſuch a thing was,) being I had ſerved His Majeſty
in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond Sea. He anſwered, I was the likelieſt
Man to know; for he knew I had ſerved the King, and had been
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55407:29"/>
ſlighted and neglected. I told him, That was true. I anſwered
him again, I never deſired any thing of His Majeſty for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but that which would coſt him nothing; but only to have the
Preference of others, that never had been concerned in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Service, by way of Farm on part of His Majeſty's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.
He told me, His Majeſty knew me, and that he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of my Service and Sufferings, and deſired to gratifie me;
for he often told me, Now was the time to do ſomething which
would advance me; for it muſt now be a King, or a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
for the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Party would but only make uſe
of me, to ſlight me when their Buſineſs was done. I told him, I
was with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> the Night before he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and that Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> was there; a Perſon I
knew out of Favour, on purpoſe that he might ſpeak out his
full Mind; but ſtill told him, I knew nothing of any Deſign. I
alſo told him, I would ſay nothing, nor appear at Court, until
I was conſidered for my Sufferings, (a thing I never expected;)
and as for going to Court, I never intended it: But the more I
told him I knew nothing of a Deſign, the more he put me in
mind of what Reward I might have, in ſuch Words, that I
ought to ſwear to it, whether I knew any thing or nothing of
the Buſineſs. Now I fully ſaw the Deſign; and though I ſtayed
late, at my Return I began to conſider who I ſhould make this
Buſineſs and Deſign known to, being a Stranger in the <hi>King's
Bench.</hi> I obſerved one, who appeared to me to be a ſober and
ſenſible Perſon; that Night I repaired to him, and (leſt I ſhould
be tempted with what Offers were made) I told him, that I had
a Deſign to commit a Secret to him; whereupon I told him,
and deſired him to put the ſame in Writing; and that if I ever
declared more than what I did then to him, (that was,) That I
knew nothing of any Plot or Deſign againſt His Majeſty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> I told him this, and declared in
the Preſence of God, that if ever I ſhould be tempted to ſwear
more than this at any time, it was for Reward; and that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to witneſs the Truth of this againſt me, and that I
would daily give him an Account of what paſſed for the future,
which I deſired him every Day to put into Writing, which I
believe he hath done; as alſo the conſtant Invitations abroad,
and the Viſits they gave me here; which were ſo frequent to me,
as nothing could be more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55407:29"/>
Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> told me, I muſt appear at Court, and I ſhould have
an aſſurance of my Reward from ſome Perſons of Honour: I
told him, I would not truſt any Courtier I knew, for a Groat;
I am ſatisfied he was put upon this, but by whom God knows, I
am aſſured not by his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>That on Wedneſday <hi>Octob.</hi> the <hi>12th,</hi> 1681. I was invited by
Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> to dine with him that day at Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi>'s Houſe,
which I refuſed, (although he ſent a Waiter, and promiſed him
ſatisfaction for his Attendance.) After Dinner he ſent again;
I went, and found Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> with him, both riſing from Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
I was moſt kindly received with Wine and good Words,
working upon me to come in a Witneſs againſt my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
deſigning to change the Government; declaring, I had
an opportunity to make my Family and Friends, as they had
expreſt formerly. I told them, as I had done before, until I was
ſatisfied for by-paſt Services, I would not be concerned any way
at Court. They told me, I might be aſſured of what I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
from my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> and my Lord <hi>Hide.</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
what would ſatisfie me; I told him, if they would give
me two thouſand Guineys towards the Injury I had received, and
my Friends upon my account, I would diſcover what I knew.
Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> told me, a greater thing was intended me, for I was
five Hundred Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> or ten Thouſand Pounds in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
But I ſtill told them, I knew nothing of any Deſign by my
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> The more I declared I knew nothing, the more
Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> urged the Reward. I told him (when he was ſo earneſt)
when I had that Mony and a General Pardon, I would then do
any Service I could; but I would not truſt the Promiſes of
Courtiers. Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> told me, as to a Pardon, I might have
it in two or three days: He deſired to know my Chriſtian
Name, which I conceived was an intention to get a Pardon, a
thing never in my thoughts; but Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> formerly mentioned
it to me; and truly I did not know what I might ſtand in need
of, or what they would fix upon me in our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> told me, he had the night before been with my Lord
<hi>Hallifax</hi> and my Lord <hi>Hide;</hi> now they thought they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with me, and were mighty chearful: Before I parted from
them, my Wife coming to me, told me; Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> had been
mighty urgent with her, to engage me to come in a Witneſs;
and then told her, I ſhould have five hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55407:30"/>
ſetled upon me; but what grounds he had for this, I know
not; for all Perſons that know her, knew her to be a perſon
of unqueſtionable Repute. Nor did I queſtion the performance,
for I thought, what I could ſay, would not deſerve; neither could
I tell, why they ſhould think me ſuch a Man, as they would have
me to be; for I ever hated to be a Witneſs or a Jury-man all
my time: I conceieve Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> thought I might be wrought
upon, becauſe I had great Misfortunes, and that this was a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to repair me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> the 13. 1681. This day I had a Waiter ſent me, about
eleven a Clock, to deſire me to go to Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi>'s Houſe, which
I did; there was Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baines,</hi> who told me, they
ſent for me to dine with them: I had no deſire to have any
Table-talk with them, I deſired to be excuſed, and alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ſee them after Dinner. Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> told me, Mr. <hi>Graham</hi>
was not far off, and would be there, and that he was ſent by
ſome of the Council to diſcourſe me: Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> told me, on
<hi>Tueſday</hi> night he was at Court with my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> and Lord
<hi>Hyde,</hi> and the two Secretaries of State, and that they enquired
who knew me: He replyed, Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> who was ſent
for; they askt him as to my Reputation; they askt him if
he knew me, and how long; he ſaid, about twenty years:
they enquired of him concerning me. He told me Mr. <hi>Graham</hi>
anſwered, I had ſerved his Majeſty and his Father in <hi>England</hi> and
beyond Sea faithfully, and that I was very honeſt Man, and
alſo that I was a great Sufferer, and that I had received great
Diſappointments, and had been ill dealt with by ſome that
belonged to the Court, as, in particular, Mr. <hi>Edward Progers;</hi>
and that they engaged Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> to come over to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
and to aſſure me, that I ſhould be requited for my Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:
Alſo to take me over with him to the King, where I
ſhould have the Promiſe of His Majeſty for the ſame, and the
opportunity to declare my former Grievances, and receive His
Royal Word and Promiſe for my Reward and Sufferings. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Diſcourſe, Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> came in, who told me the ſame
things as above, and that I might be aſſured of thoſe things
from the King; alſo that he had an Order to carry me to His
Majeſty. I told him, I could ſay nothing, neither would I go
to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> for I had taken a Reſolution againſt going to
<hi>Whitehall.</hi> I was hard preſſed for my going thither. I deſired
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55407:30"/>
to be excuſed; for if I could ſay any thing, I muſt be guilty
my ſelf: But he told me, whether I was or not, I might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed
for my Sufferings: Upon which I took my leave, and
went away not well pleaſed, that for my Requital I ſhould be
thought an ill Man or a Traytor.</p>
               <p>That on <hi>October</hi> the 14, 1681. Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> came to me about
Eleven a Clock to the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> we walked in the Garden
about an Hour. His Buſineſs was to know my Mind, whether
I would go voluntarily to the King or not. He alſo told me,
That Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Secretary, that was in the
<hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> had ſent to the Council to inform Them, That if he
might have his Pardon, he would come in, and declare his
Knowledge; and therefore he would have me to have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be the Firſt Diſcover. I told him, I had no Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> Then he told me, it was intended that Mr.
<hi>Graham</hi> ſhould be at his Lodging this Afternoon, to ſee if I
would go to the King; if not, my Lord Chief Juſtice's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
would be ſent to compel me to appear at his Chamber, where
there would be ſome of the Council to examine me and ſwear
me. He alſo told me, That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had a great
Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he would give me Five hundred
Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> there, beſides all former Promiſes, to be ſetled
upon me and my Heirs, if I would come in a Witneſs againſt
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> I told him, they might meet with many
Perſons in this Age, that would accept of ſuch Offers. I told
him, if I had any thing to ſay, it was the moſt proper time in
Court, for me and Witneſſes to ſpeak their Knowledg. I told
him, I did not know, but the Preſence of a King and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
might make a Man ſay more than what was true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or than
he could ſay fairly in a Court. Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> ask'd me, if I did not
ride with my Sword and Piſtols out of Town with my Lord
<hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> when he went to <hi>Oxford?</hi> I told him I did, I could
not do leſs than wait upon him out of Town, who had been
ſo kind, with the reſt of the Lords Proprietors, to do me the
Honour to make me their Governour for the Country of <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina.</hi>
He then told me, I muſt needs be privy to this, That if
His Majeſty would not paſs Three Acts, One, for Excluding the
Duke of <hi>York;</hi> the next, for making void the Act of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> againſt Recuſancy; and the third, for Uniting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Subjects; then by force of Arms he was to be compelled.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55407:31"/>
He told me, all the Council was ſatisfied I knew this, and as much
as any Perſon, in regard that both my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and my
ſelf was diſguſted at Court. He ſaid, the Council knew I was a
Soldier, and was ſatisfied I was to act in that Concern. I begun
now to conſider what a Fortune was now promis'd, and what a
good Addition this Five Hundred Pounds Additional from the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> would make to the former Promiſes; and after
he was gone, I acquainted my Wife, and told her how great a
Perſon ſhe was like to be: But this was no News to her; for Mr.
<hi>Booth</hi> had often been deſiring her, for her own good, to engage
me in this Honourable Service. Thus theſe things in our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
ſerved us to be merry with, to conſider how eaſily we were
like to leap into an Eſtate: But all this time we were out without
fear and danger of enjoying it, or any part of it, much leſs
of intailing it upon our Poſterity:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the Fifteenth, 1681. This day, about Eleven a Clock,
Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> came again to me to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> to know of me,
if I yet would go to <hi>Whitehall:</hi> I demanded, For what? He told
me, To Evidence againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> I told him, I
had nothing to ſay againſt him. He importuned me not to loſe
this great Opportunity I now had. Before we parted, Mr. <hi>Baines</hi>
came to us; I deſired to know why they ſhould be ſo urgent
to have me a Witneſs. He told me, there were none but <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Witneſſes yet to come againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and they were
not Perſons of Credit; but if I would come in, although I had
been unfortunate in my Private Concerns, yet I was not blemiſh'd
in my Credit. Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> told me, if I would not go to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
the Marſhal had an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from my Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to carry me. So we parted.</p>
               <p>About Four a Clock in the Afternoon, the Marſhal came with
Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> to require me to go along with him.
I demanded, Whither? He told me to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> I demanded
to ſee his Warrant. He ſhewed it me. Now I was forced to
obey. After my coming thither, in a little time I was called
into Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi>'s Office, where he and my Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
was, who ſtrictly, but very fairly and honeſtly, Examined
me about my Lord <hi>Saftsbury,</hi> and what I knew of any Deſign
againſt His Majeſty. I told them, as I did to the former At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackers,
I knew nothing. Great Arguments were uſed; but I
could give no ſatisfactory Anſwer, as was (I conceived) expected.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55407:31"/>
After this, His Majeſty came into the Office; when He ſaw me,
He was pleaſed to do me the Honour, to ſay, He knew me well,
and that I had ſerved His Father and His Majeſty faitfully,
and He hoped I would not decline my Obedience. To which I
anſwered, I never deſerved to be ſuſpected. His Majeſty was
pleaſed to tell me, He had not had the Opportunity to ſerve
His Friends, but hoped He might: He was pleaſed to promiſe
to conſider me for my ſufferings. Then his Majeſty began to
Examine me, (If I had been exhorted by the beſt Divine in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he could not have ſaid more than His Majeſty) in telling
me, what Kindneſs was intended me, was not with a deſign to
invite me to ſpeak a Word but Truth it ſelf; and that if He
knew I did, or any other Perſon, His Majeſty would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
them. Then His Majeſty demanded, What I knew of a
Deſign againſt His Perſon and Government? I truly told His
Majeſty, That I knew nothing of any Plot or Deſign againſt His
Majeſty or Government; that I admired why I ſhould be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that had ſerved His Majeſty and His Father in <hi>England</hi> and
beyond-Sea, and was as Inſtrumental as any Perſon in His
Majeſty's Reſtoration: But ſome Perſons had poſſeſſed His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
I was deep in ſome Deſign againſt the Government, and
knew much of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> So His Majeſty ſeemed not
to be ſatisfied, but ſtill preſſed hard upon me. To all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Queſtions, I could give no Anſwer that would ſatisfie.
Then His Majeſty was pleaſed to tell me, If I would ſay, <hi>As I
hope to be ſaved, I knew nothing of any Deſign againſt His Perſon,</hi>
He would believe me; which I did ſay, in thoſe very Words,
which His Majeſty ſeemed to wonder at. Then I was left to Mr.
Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> who was pleaſed to uſe ſuch Arguments
as he thought fit. I told him, I knew my Duty to His Majeſty,
I would not draw a Sword againſt Him; but I could freely do
it againſt ſome of the Court, that were Enemies to His Majeſty
and His Friends; and ſo I was diſmiſſed out of the Office. Then
I was carried into another Room, where His Majeſty, my Lord
Chancellor, Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> Lord <hi>Hyde,</hi> the two Secretaries of
State were, and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton;</hi> where I was
Examined, Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> preſent. My
Lord Chancellor was ſharp upon me with ſeveral Queſtions, which
I could give no Anſwer to. Content thus I was to run the Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
from one place to another. My Lord Chancellor would not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55407:32"/>
believe, but I muſt be guilty of knowing great things againſt my
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> I told him, If I could not be believed upon
my Word there, if they pleaſed to bring my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
upon his Trial, I would declare it in open Court upon Oath
what my Knowledge was, without any hopes of Gain or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.
My Lord Chancellor, I thank him, did me that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to tell me, There were two ſorts of Advancement; I need
not give my ſelf that trouble, for I was like to come to my
Trial my ſelf before my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> My Lord Chancellor
demanded of me, If I had no Commiſſion for this New Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
His Majeſty. I told him, No. Then he told me, I was to have
a Troop to conſiſt of fifty Men. I told him, That was a ſmall
Troop: I hoped, that if ever I had a Command of a Troop, it
ſhould be a better than that. But I deſired to know who gave
that Information. He told me, Mr. <hi>Booth;</hi> who was by, and was
liſted under me. I deſired Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> to tell me, if he had given
this Information, and made this Oath? He told me, Yes; and
it was true. I was unconcerned, and am, knowing my ſelf not
guilty: For I proteſt, in the Preſence of Almighty God, by
whom I expect to be judged, I never had a Word with Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi>
or any other Perſon, in my whole Life, tending to any ſuch
thing. For at the ſame time that he ſaid this was to be, which
was when the Parliament was to be laſt at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I had taken,
on a Ship for <hi>Carolina,</hi> where I was to go Governor, a Buſineſs
more to my Content than any Military Employ; eſpecially againſt
His Majeſty, and the Government. But I conceived this was in
hopes of Reward, and to ſhew his Loyalty; for which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he will neither be regarded, nor rewarded. I told the
Council, if they had ſuch another Witneſs, they might do my
Buſineſs. I thank God, I am not afraid of him, nor twenty
more ſuch Witneſſes, if they come againſt me; for, 'tis well
known, he hath been accuſed and condemned for Clipping and
Coining, beſides Murther; for which he had His Majeſty's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Pardon, as I have been informed. I am glad I live in ſuch
Days, wherein Juries conceive they are Judges as to Matter
of Fact; for if they were not, I am ſatisfied, in this Swearing
Age, many an honeſt Man would be forced to march before they
know either Rank or File. At the ſame time I told my Lord
Chancellor, if any honeſt Man would come and witneſs againſt
me, I would never deſire His Majeſty's Pardon, or ever will.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55407:32"/>
Let all the World judge how unlikely it is, that I ſhould be thus
concerned, when I had about twenty eight Men-Servants, four
or five Women-Servants, beſides my Wife, three Sons, (of which,
two had been in His Majeſty's Service at Sea,) and one Daughter,
all the Children I have, prepared, and lay at my Charge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for <hi>Carolina,</hi> and thought my ſelf happy; and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to leave <hi>England,</hi> with a Reſolution, to ſee if I could find
a People that had leſs Wit, and more Honeſty, than I have found
in my own Country; where, I muſt needs ſay, I have found very
unfaithful Dealings amongſt ſuch as account themſelves Perſons
of Honour and Quality. But truly, when I thought I had made
my ſelf almoſt ready for my intended Voyage, I found my ſelf
like a Man betwitched, that could neither budge, nor ſtir; until,
at laſt, ſome Debts that I was bound for fell upon me, and others
of my own increaſed, being burthened with a great Charge,
which unexpectdly put a ſtop, at preſent, to my intended Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
I did always intend to leave <hi>England</hi> honeſtly and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
Thoſe things fell ſo unexpectedly, that my ſelf and Wife
concluded there was a Divine Hand in it.</p>

Henry Wilkinſon.</head>
               <p>I The ſaid <hi>Suſannah Wilkinſon</hi> do declare, That on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi>
the 12th of <hi>October, 1681.</hi> I went to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> Priſon,
to ſpeak with my Husband; (where I met with three Carpenters,
which were entertained by him, as Servants for <hi>Carolina,</hi> and
who had waited a long time; and not finding him likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in his Voyage, they deſired to be diſcharged;) but not
finding him in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> I went with them to Mr. <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s
Houſe; where I found him in Company with Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi>
and one Mr. <hi>Baines,</hi> (who were very largely treating my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
with Wine.) My Husband went out to perſuade the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and diſcourſed them: Then Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> took an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to ſpeak to me, and told me, my Husband was a moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
Man, and Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> deſired me to perſuade my Husband
to be guided and perſuaded by him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Booth.</hi> And he
ſaid, the King would do more for my Husband, than ever the
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> would; and that the King was ſenſible of my
Husband's Service, and Sufferings; and if my Husband would
be perſuaded by him, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> to appear againſt the
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he was ſure my Husband would be the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Man in the World, and that he ſhould have 500 <hi>l.</hi> a Year
ſetled upon him and his Heirs for ever.</p>
               <p>That on <hi>Friday, October</hi> the 14th, 1681. I was with my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
at the <hi>King's Bench</hi> Priſon, when Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> came into our
Room. Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> took an Opportunity to ſpeak with me, and
deſired me, for God's ſake, to perſuade my Husband to be ruled
by him; which if my Husband would, he might be an happy Man,
and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> would ſettle 500 <hi>l.</hi> a Year in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon
my Husband and his Heirs; and very much intreated me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
my Husband to what he deſired. All which ſhall be atteſted
upon Oath, when required.</p>
