         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>'TIs the Common Practice now adays, for baſe and
mercenary Pens to paſs the worſt Cenſures upon
the beſt Intentions of Men. The Arguments
that follow are all grounded either upon Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or upon Equal Juſtice and Prudent Morality; and
thoſe not enforced with Heat and Paſſion, but with all the
Mildneſs and Submiſſion imaginable; which argues the
Fairneſs and Honeſty of the Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to procure, if it may
be done, a happy <hi>Union</hi> between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi>
whom it rather mainly concerns to joyn their
Forces againſt the Common Enemy of their Profeſſion, than to
make themſelves the Scorn and Triumph of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by a <hi>needleſs Separation;</hi> which, if duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
would ſoon be found unhappily fomented and encreas'd
by the encourag'd Emiſſaries and <hi>Scribling Bravo's of
Rome.</hi> Is it not apparent, how they already begin to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
and blow up the Truth of the <hi>late Horrid Plot,</hi>
ſo miraculouſly diſcover'd? To which purpoſe, is it not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
apparent what daily Affronts they put upon the <hi>King's
Evidence,</hi> to the end that by rendring their Perſons, and
whatever they have ſaid or ſworn, ridiculous, they may be the
better able to raiſe a Miſt before the Eyes of the People,
and then totally withdraw the <hi>Plot</hi> from their Belief? Is
it not apparent how vigorouſly they aſſail the whole Body of
the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> Men of <hi>Religious, Serious, Upright,</hi>
and moſt <hi>Loyal</hi> Principles, under the ſcandalous Names of
<hi>Fanaticks</hi> and <hi>Whiggs;</hi> and by throwing the Failings
and Miſdemeanours of ſome <hi>few</hi> upon <hi>all</hi> (this Earth not
affording that Happineſs to the moſt Holy Society in the
World, of being without ſome Hypocrites and bad Men) to caſt
an Odium upon above a third part of the moſt Induſtrious and
Wealthy Part of the Nation, on purpoſe to enervate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh
<pb facs="tcp:101356:3"/>
the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> and make the ſofter and
more eaſie way for <hi>Popiſh Intruſion?</hi> Enormities much
more deſerving the Puniſhment of <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> than Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Meetings</hi> for the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Upon which Conſiderations, it cannot be look'd upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
by Perſons of truly pious and cordial Affection for the
Good of their Country, as a Deſign either <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> or
<hi>factious,</hi> to vindicate, ſo far as may ſtand with Equity
and good Conſcience, the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> from the
heavy Imputations of <hi>Schiſm, Sedition,</hi> and <hi>Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
every day caſt upon them, though moſt undeſervedly, by the
<hi>Pope's Weekly Drudges</hi> here in this City. To which
end, the Deſign of theſe few Sheets is to more than to plead
their Cauſe, with all modeſty and ſubmiſſion, before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals
of Juſtice and Divine Charity; to rectifie the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Perſons miſguided by <hi>Mercenary Scriblers,</hi> by
ſetting forth the Nature and Ends of <hi>theſe Meetings,</hi>
and the dangerous Conſequences of ſetting up a <hi>Proteſtant
Perſecution,</hi> to the encouragement of thoſe <hi>Peſts</hi> of the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> ignorant and greedy <hi>Informers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe a Sight of the <hi>Statutes</hi> themſelves may be
neceſſary to thoſe that have them not, they are hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd;
there being nothing more Moral than the Reaſon of
Self-Preſervation in a <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Orderly</hi> Way; which
they that ſeek by no other Means than by thoſe of <hi>Duty</hi> and
<hi>Allegiance,</hi> no other being here propounded, cannot be
thought to deviate from the Laws of God or Nature.</p>

            <head>A Guide for Proteſtant Diſſenters, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing that ſeems a greater blemiſh to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than that little Differences about the Exerciſe of <hi>Divine
Worſhip,</hi> ſhould cauſe ſuch Heats and Animoſities among
Men: And for them whoſe Buſineſs it ſhould be to Preach
Unity, Love, and Charity, under the Notion of Church-Government,
to inſtigate and animate the Civil Magiſtrate to make
rigid <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> to enforce the Conſciences of good People, ſeems in
ſome meaſure contradictory to the eaſie Yoke of Chriſtian Obedience.
It ſeems ſomewhat hard, when a poor Man has by his Induſtry and
Frugality got together a ſmall Subſiſtence for himſelf and his Family,
that becauſe he is diſſatisfied with ſome few Indifferent Circumſtances,
that are impos'd upon their Conſciences, he ſhould be preſently laid at
the mercy of Rapacious <hi>Informers</hi> and Officers; that his Goods ſhould
be at the diſpoſal of Perſons many times fuller of Heat and Paſſion, than
of true Charity; that he ſhould be <hi>excommunicated,</hi> and conſequently
under the laſh of a <hi>Civil Writ,</hi> becauſe he will not come to the <hi>Parochial
Church:</hi> as if the Place were ſo material where God were worſhipp'd, ſo
in any Place he be ador'd in Spirit and Truth. Nor is this ſpoken in the
leaſt in reference to the Civil Government, but onely in point of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
It is apparent by the very Prefaces of the <hi>Acts</hi> themſelves hereby
intended, that the Civil Magiſtrate aims at nothing but what is Right
and Juſt; to prevent <hi>Sedition,</hi> for the Good and Quiet of the Kingdom.
But 'tis to be fear'd, that want of Charity in others, and too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictedneſs
to Opinionated Severity, ſways others to extend the lawful
Pretence of the Civil Power beyond the Bounds and Limits of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlaters</hi>
Intention; in regard that for the Miniſtry to aggravate Civil
Crimes upon their Brethren, and incence the Sword of Juſtice, appears
no where in Scripture agreeable to Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>There are two Statutes, that of the <hi>35th</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the <hi>22d.</hi> of
His <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> that create the loud Complaints that run through the
whole Nation: And yet the <hi>Proems</hi> of neither of thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> ſeem to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that Rigour which is at this time meditated by ſome Perſons, and
deſended perhaps with too much heat in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Preamble <hi>of</hi> 35 Eliz. <hi>runs thus:</hi> For the preventing of ſuch great
Inconveniencies and Perils as might happen and grow by the wicked and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Practiſes of SEDITIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S SECTARIES and DISLOYAL
PERSONS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Preamble <hi>of the</hi> 22d. of <hi>His</hi> preſent Majeſty <hi>runs thus:</hi> For provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
farther and more ſpeedy Remedies againſt the growing and dangerous
Practiſes of SEDITIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S SECTARIES, and other DISLOYAL PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS,
who, under pretence of tender Conſciences, have or may at their
Meetings contrive Inſurrections, as late Experience hath ſhewn.</p>
            <p>Here are two <hi>Statutes,</hi> by which moſt Lawful and moſt Neceſſary
Proviſion is made for the Preſervation of the <hi>Peace</hi> and Quiet of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
Now, if it ſhould be asked, What the Civil Magiſtrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
from hence? It is to be anſwered, in general, Obedience, Paſſive
and Active; Tranquillity, Publick and Private: and particularly, That
no <hi>Diſloyal Perſons,</hi> nor <hi>Sectaries,</hi> ſhall meet, under pretence of Tender
Conſciences, to contrive <hi>Inſurrections.</hi> Hence it is ſubmiſſively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd,
That if the <hi>Subject</hi> live dutifully towards his <hi>Prince,</hi> free from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101356:4"/>
giving occaſion of Civil Diſturbance; amicably toward his Neighbour;
pay thoſe Duties and Taxes which the Law or Cuſtom impoſes; and
actively, if he be always ready with his Sword in his hand to defend his
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Country;</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> does not regard the inward Conſciences
of ſuch <hi>Subjects,</hi> nor their inconſiderable Differences in Matters of <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi>
ſo that the <hi>Religion</hi> which they profeſs be not contrary or oppoſite
to the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Law</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And it is plain,
that the <hi>Law</hi> extends it ſelf no further than <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Diſloyal Perſons,</hi>
as being look'd upon by the <hi>Law</hi> to be the moſt likely Perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<hi>Inſurrections,</hi> and diſturb the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving then the Civil Power to its ſelf, the Queſtion is between the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> and their <hi>Oppoſers,</hi> What a <hi>Sectary</hi> is? For it is ſuppos'd, That if
the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Wrath</hi> were appeas'd, the Diſpleaſure of the <hi>Civil Power</hi>
might the more eaſily be atton'd.</p>
            <p>Now then <hi>Sectaries</hi> muſt either be <hi>Heretics</hi> or <hi>Schiſmatics. Heretics</hi>
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot be; for they do not err in <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> for ſuch
a one is a <hi>Heretic.</hi> The next Queſtion then will be, Whether they be
<hi>Schiſmatics?</hi> What is a <hi>Schiſmatic?</hi> A <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> is one that holding
firm the ſame Foundation of <hi>Faith,</hi> departs from ſome <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> obſtinately, and out of ambitious Ends. Thus it appears, that
<hi>Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>Ambitious Ends</hi> are the Diſtinctions that make a <hi>Schiſmatic.</hi>
From whence it is apparent, that there may be ſome Grounds and Reaſons
why a Man may diſſent from ſome <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet be no
<hi>Schiſmatic.</hi> For example: <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> is the oppoſite to <hi>Conſtancy; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Ends,</hi> or <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> as being a Contempt of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to <hi>Integrity.</hi> So then if a Man diſſents from any <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> out of Integrity, which is a Vertue by which we yield up our
Obedience to God, though imperfect, yet without <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> or out of
Conſtancy, by which a Man reſolves to perſiſt in the Knowledge of God
and his Worſhip to the end, he can be no <hi>Schiſmatic.</hi> For the <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſenters</hi>
and their <hi>Oppoſers</hi> agree in the ſame <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> in the ſame <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and the ſame <hi>Worſhip;</hi> onely the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> diſallow ſome outward
adiaphorous <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of their <hi>Church.</hi> Again, To make them <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi>
that is, <hi>Obſtinate</hi> or <hi>Ambitious Diſſenters,</hi> there muſt be <hi>Conviction and
Contumacy:</hi> But in regard that neither the one nor the other appears
againſt them, it follows, That they <hi>diſſent</hi> out of <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and conſequently are no way liable to the Severity of the <hi>Statute,</hi>
eſpecially if the <hi>Preamble,</hi> as it is taken in <hi>Law,</hi> be the <hi>Key of the Statute.</hi>
Seeing then that the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> where there is no proof of Petulancy or

obnoxious to the <hi>Law,</hi> it remains, that they muſt be <hi>Brethren,</hi> profeſſing
the ſame Fundamentals of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip.</hi> And then it ſeems very
hard, That the Severity of Perſons who call themſelves <hi>Divines,</hi> and
<hi>Teachers</hi> of the Doctrine of Charity, ſhould ſtretch and ſtrain a <hi>Law</hi> to
encourage <hi>Accuſers of the Brethren,</hi> and to lay violent hands upon thoſe,
to whom it never meant any <hi>diſturbance.</hi> And 'tis look'd upon as a

<hi>Divine,</hi> that the one ſhould take it for a Charitable Maxim, That <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum

<hi>Divinity,</hi> and the Example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> preſſing <hi>Summum Ius</hi> yet with ſo
much inveteracy, advance <hi>Summam Injuriam,</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>

this Doctrine of their Head and grand Inſtructer thoſe Perſons are, who
avoiding the healing Doctrine of Unity, make their <hi>Pulpits</hi> ring with
nothing but corroſive Invectives and <hi>Satyrs</hi> againſt Friend and Foe,
Brethren and <hi>Schiſmatics,</hi> under the general Notion of <hi>Fanaticiſm;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the conſtant Rule, <hi>That he onely teaches well, that well diſtinguiſhes.</hi>
Certainly it can never be thought that it ſhould proceed from the Dictates of
Reaſon and Conſcience, that they who ought to come with Healing in their
Doctrine, ſhould make it their Buſineſs to exaſperate and incence the Civil
Power, meerly to eſtabliſh an unlawful <hi>Hierarchie</hi> over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of
their <hi>Brethren.</hi> They that firſt ſhook off the <hi>Roman Toke,</hi> thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
not to make a total and abſolute Change; but guided by Reaſons of
<hi>State,</hi> left ſeveral of the <hi>Ceremonies, Popiſh Ceremonies,</hi> untouch'd, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

now that the <hi>State</hi> has no occaſion for thoſe Fears, now that the People uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
deſire to be freed from theſe <hi>Relicks</hi> of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> for ſome Perſons

ſought the Accompliſhment of what they left imperfect. The Law was
made to puniſh <hi>Mutiny, Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> againſt the <hi>State</hi> and

have been ſo careful to make Proviſion for the Repoſe and Quiet of
the Kingdom? it may be thought a hard Chapter, that the peeviſhneſs and
choler of ſome Men ſhould turn the Stream of that Rigour, where no Proof
is made, upon <hi>pretence</hi> of Breach and Diſobedience. How ill will it ſound
in the Ears of <hi>Poſterity,</hi> when they ſhall hear of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being ſo ſeverly

Temper, and to have a Chancery of Charity always open in their Hearts, to
mitigate and compoſe, not to exaſperate and provoke the Civil Magiſtrate,
eſpecially in Concerns not of the Government, but of their own Intereſt.
Some People will not have their <hi>Children ſign'd with the Croſs;</hi> others <hi>meet

Proceeding, that can never be thought agreeable to the Examples or Doctrine
either of Chriſt or his Apoſtles. If ſuch Perſons did but conſider how much
more fragrant the Memory of a <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſmells in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> than that of a <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
they would ſurely ſteer another Courſe. Nor can they be thought

about <hi>outward Forms and unneceſſary Circumſtances,</hi> they render themſelves
leſs able to withſtand the Impetuoſity of daily-<hi>menacing Popery.</hi> That is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>the Decree is gone forth, and muſt be obey'd;</hi> and though the <hi>Preamble of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101356:5"/>
Law</hi> may be avoided, the <hi>Body of it,</hi> more <hi>explanatory</hi> of it ſelf, admits, <hi>no
Evaſion.</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> poſitively ſays, <hi>That if any Perſon or Perſons, above the
Age of Sixteen years,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be preſent at any Aſſembly, Conventicle, or Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
under colour or pretence of any Exerciſe of Religion, in other manner than
according to the Liturgie and Practiſe of the Church of</hi> England, &amp;c. <hi>Where
there ſhall be Five or more Perſons aſſembled, over and above thoſe of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt part of the Words, <hi>Whoever ſhall be preſent at any Aſſembly
or Meeting, under pretence or colour of any Exerciſe of Religion,</hi> &amp;c. ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
do ariſe upon the fair accompt of <hi>Reaſon and Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether the meaning of the Words extend themſelves to ſuch an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Religion</hi> which is <hi>truly Chriſtian,</hi> and according to the direct Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of <hi>Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Or whether <hi>onely</hi> ſuch a Religion as carries <hi>onely a pretence and colour,</hi>
without any <hi>truth and ſincerity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it is moſt certain, That the moſt pure and Chriſtian Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of <hi>Devotion</hi> carries with it a <hi>pretence and colour,</hi> as well as the falſe one,
though it be onely that of ſerving and performing our Duty to God.</p>
            <p>Now then it can never be imagin'd, that the <hi>Intention of this Law</hi> was
ever to <hi>prevent the Exerciſe of Devotion and true Piety.</hi> let the Place or the
Number be more or leſs, in a rational Proportion. For, if ſo, the <hi>Statute</hi>
would be void in it ſelf; in regard that all unbyaſs'd <hi>Caſuiſts, Lawyers,</hi> and
<hi>Divines</hi> agree, That all <hi>Humane Laws</hi> made againſt the Law of God, are <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> annull'd as to any <hi>Obligation</hi> upon the <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing therefore it cannot be thought, that this <hi>Law</hi> intendeth the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
of it ſelf, there muſt be a looking backward to the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi>
of the <hi>Law,</hi> which from the <hi>Preamble</hi> is apparent to be onely the prevention
of <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> and <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> for the Repoſe and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then let a <hi>Meeting</hi> be ſuppos'd, <hi>though of more than Five or Ten;</hi> yet
if at this <hi>Meeting</hi> there be nothing done that tends to <hi>Diſloyalty, Inſurrection,</hi>
or <hi>diſturbance of the Publick Peace,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> hath its End, and can take no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notice, there being no <hi>Breach of the Law,</hi> and conſequently no <hi>occaſion</hi>
of <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is collected from <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf; for, ſhould any other Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be put upon the Words, it would be contrary to the <hi>Law of God,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prevent the <hi>true and real Worſhip of God,</hi> under pretence of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
and <hi>Diſloyalty.</hi> A Thought, an Intention, which it were a Crime to
imagine <hi>ſuch Worthy and Pious Legiſlators ever dream'd of,</hi> however the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law may be ſtrain'd in the abſence of its Makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that ſuch a Meaning of the <hi>Act,</hi> as it is inforc'd, is contrary to the
Word of God, is apparent from the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf: <hi>Acts 28. And Paul dwelt
two years in his hired houſe, and received all that came to him, preaching the
Kingdom of God, no man forbidding him. 1 Tim. 2. I will therefore that men
pray every where;</hi> with ſeveral others. Nor will it ſerve as an <hi>Objection,</hi> to
ſay, <hi>That the Times are otherwiſe, now that there are ſuch plenty of Publick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi>
For, if they be poſſeſs'd by ſuch as will not admit their fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to come together, without prejudice to their Conſciences, 'tis the ſame
thing to them, as if thoſe Places were not at all.</p>
            <p>Which being a clear confirmation, that God may be Worſhipped in Spirit
and Truth in any Place, or at any Time; 'tis as clear, that the Meaning of
this <hi>Law</hi> cannot reach the <hi>Exerciſe of Real Piety.</hi> For, if the Worſhip in it
ſelf be Evil, it is not to be endur'd <hi>in Four;</hi> if conſonant to the Word of
God, the Number of <hi>Fourſcore</hi> cannot render it <hi>criminal.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101356:5"/>
            <p>But here in regard there is ſo much inſiſting and ſtreſs put upon the word <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
it will be much to be clearing the meaning of the Act, to enquire in to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the word, and whether it be not taken too unwarily in an ill ſenſe, by thoſe
that would extend the <hi>reaſon and meaning of this Act</hi> beyond its limits?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Conventicle then in the general ſenſe is a certain place appointed for the Aſſembling
and coming together of People to ſome purpoſe or other;</hi> In the particular ſenſe it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the <hi>Aſſembly it ſelf there met.</hi> If then the purpoſe be for the ſake of Divine
Worſhip, it will be fit next to enquire the Difference between a <hi>Church-Aſſembly</hi> and
a <hi>Conventicle-Aſſembly.</hi> That which conſtitutes a <hi>Church,</hi> is an <hi>Aſſembly or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of people called to the ſtate of Grace by Prayer, by Teaching and Hearing the Word,
and the due adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi> The Efficient cauſe of this <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is
the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> in general, particularly <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The form of this <hi>Aſſembly</hi> conſiſts
in a <hi>double Communion of the Aſſembly with Chriſt as the Head, and of the particular
Members among themſelves. The matter of this Aſſembly are the perſons or ſeveral
Members called to the Covenant of Grace. The end of this Aſſembly is the glory of God,
and their own Salvation. The marks of the real Chriſtianity and legality of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
are the true Preaching the Word, and due Adminiſtration of the Sacrament?</hi> If then
the ſame ſubſtantial Efficient cauſe, the ſame ſubſtantial matter, the ſame ſubſtantial
Form, the ſame ſubſtantial end, the ſame ſubſtantial Marks of a truly Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
be <hi>found in a Houſe or any other convenient place,</hi> though not adorned with
<hi>Steeples</hi> or <hi>Stone Arches,</hi> call them <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> or what you pleaſe
they center the main fundamentals of Faith and Doctrine, differ only in ſome <hi>ſlight</hi>
and <hi>outward Ceremonies,</hi> and are therefore an Eſſential Body of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
And if there be any <hi>External Circumſtances in diſpute,</hi> they are to be argued
and determined among themſelves, not by the <hi>Arbitrary Power of a Juſtice of the
Peace,</hi> who is an <hi>Officer only of the Peace, and not of the Conſcience.</hi> So that it can
never be thought that the determination of Chriſtian Prudence will ever grant it to
be rational that <hi>this Law</hi> was ever made for the prevention of ſuch <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
which muſt prove the <hi>ſuppreſſion</hi> of much true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> This makes ſome
people think that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> is in a very weak condition and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
of it ſelf, when it is ſo earneſt and clamarous after the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Civil
Magiſtrate.</hi> And indeed it is eaſily demonſtrable in <hi>Story,</hi> that there was nothing
more advanced the beginnings of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>England</hi> than the weakneſs
which <hi>Henry</hi> 8. perceived in the <hi>Arguments</hi> which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> brought againſt the
<hi>Reformers</hi> in all their Diſputes. And therefore a <hi>Convocation Diſpute</hi> had been much
more proper for this <hi>Controverſie</hi> than the deſtructive Arguments of <hi>Diſtreſſes and
Crown Office Writs.</hi> Which, if it were put to the Teſt, there are many that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether the <hi>Law-Provokers</hi> might not come by the worſt. For as to thoſe things
which are called the <hi>Rites and Ceremonies</hi> of true Worſhip, <hi>true Religion</hi> has none
but what God has preſcribed in His Word; and they are looked upon, either as parts
or helps to our <hi>Devotion.</hi> As parts of Devotion, they conſiſt in <hi>promulgation</hi> of the
<hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which requires alſo decent
compoſure of geſture and poſture. As helps to Devotion, they are divided into
<hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Vows.</hi> And theſe are all the <hi>Rites or Ceremonies of true Worſhip. Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Form,</hi> are apt to wander into <hi>Superſtition</hi> if not plain <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is, that ſome unbyaſſed perſon, not without Reaſon, fear, <hi>That the Diſſenters
who have abandoned all, would have much more Argument on their ſide, than they whoretain
ſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being thus apparent, that the <hi>Law</hi> was never intended to <hi>prevent ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi>
whoſe only end of <hi>Meeting</hi> is to <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Glorifie God,</hi> and that too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>ſame Fundamentals</hi> which the <hi>Statute enforcers profeſs,</hi> it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to examin, whether the <hi>Evidence</hi> offered be ſufficient to make the <hi>Diſſenters
guilty of the Crimes aſſigned by the Law,</hi> viz. <hi>Diſloyalty and Inſurrection.</hi> Firſt then
as for <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>pretence,</hi> they are only <hi>Non-Appearances</hi> lodg'd in the Heart of Man;
which are only diſcloſed to the Omniſcience of God himſelf. And therefore to judge
of <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>pretence</hi> appertains only to God, and not to any <hi>Law:</hi> from whence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101356:6"/>
aroſe that common Maxim, that <hi>De non apperentibus,</hi> the <hi>Law takes no Cognizance.</hi>
Much leſs is in the power of an <hi>Informer</hi> to make Oath of <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>pretence,</hi> until
<hi>colour</hi> and <hi>pretence</hi> break forth into ſome <hi>overt</hi> and <hi>apparent act</hi> which may afford
matter for Teſtimony and proof. From whence it is plain, that unleſs there be due
and ſufficient proof made of <hi>falſe Doctrine, ſeditious words, or contrivances tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Inſurrection and Diſloyalty,</hi> which are the breaches of the <hi>Law;</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> can
never <hi>puniſh,</hi> where there is no breach committed. Nor does the Conſcience of
any <hi>Magiſtrate oblige</hi> him to <hi>ſine</hi> and <hi>levy</hi> upon the bare <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi>
As for the addition of thoſe words, <hi>Do or may contrive,</hi> it ſeems ſomewhat
repugnant to reaſon, that <hi>Plots and Contrivances ſhould ever be carried on in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Aſſemblies of Women and Children;</hi> ſo that the fear ſeems only to be of the
<hi>Teachers</hi> moving the <hi>people to Sedition.</hi> But as for that, one would think it ſhould be
an Argument rather for the permiſſion of <hi>Conventicles,</hi> it being a thing far more
eaſie to diſcover a man that Preaches open <hi>Sedition,</hi> than one that goes from Houſe
to Houſe, clandeſtinly inſinuating the ſame Doctrine. Nor is this branch Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
but caſts its influence into the whole Crime deſcribed and intended by the <hi>Act</hi>
thus embody'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any perſon or perſons ſhall be preſent at any Conventicle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>under coulour or
pretence of any exerciſe of Religion, in other manner than according to the Liturgy
and Practice of the Church of</hi> England. Perhaps ſome perſons carry away with the
preſent torment of unwary Paſſion, may from hence aſſent that there is no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Religion, that can be truly real and ſincere, but only colourable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
which is not performed in the very words of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> according to
the Common acceptation of the Word in <hi>England.</hi> To which though there were no
other anſwer to be given, yet the conſequent words, and the practiſe of the
Church clearly contradict ſuch an uncharitable Paraphraſe, for that in all Parochial
Churches it is the general cuſtom to Pray both before and after Sermon. But if the
nature of the word <hi>Liturgy</hi> be duly conſidered, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Liturgy</hi> is not more
than the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Prayer:</hi> the Compilers themſelves call the Engliſh <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
an order for Morning and Evening Prayer, or a ſet <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> whereby it
becomes only a Species of the Grand <hi>Genus</hi> Prayer or Oration, by which with a true
and humble contrition of Heart, we addreſs our ſelves to God, concerning ſuch
things as are conſentaneous to his Holy Will; and this divided into two parts <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> Now ſuppoſe that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> now the moſt
exact <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the World, as moſt certainly it is not, it cannot be thought that the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> are obliged by this <hi>Statute</hi> to uſe no other <hi>Prayers</hi> than what are ſet down
in the <hi>Liturgy, For then the Law enforcers may be preſum'd to lie under the Penalties of
the Statute themſelves.</hi> Who after the full performance of all the duties of <hi>Prayer,</hi>
which is ordered in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> both for Morning and Evening Service, if it may not
be ſaid, out of a contempt of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> yet ſomewhat to the diſcredit of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi>
are never ſatisfied till they have given it the ſupplement of their tedious and
vainly Oſtentatious additions of <hi>ſuper-excellent</hi> and <hi>ſuper-fine:</hi> which after a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all the duties of Innovation and Thankſgiving, ſeems in them a kind of
Tautology forbidden in Scripture. However becauſe the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> uſing the ſame
form of Prayer, though not in the ſame words, avoid that inconvenience, therefore
they muſt be reduced into obedience to ſomething not well conſidered what it is, by
<hi>Conſtabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Informers.</hi> But there is a more exquiſite Liturgy yet, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
Liturgy preſcribed by our Saviour himſelf; which though out of Veneration it be
reduced into one Prayer for general uſe; yet is no other than a ſet form of Prayer,
teaching heedleſs Mortals, who might elſe be extravagant in their Petitions, the true
matter of Prayer; that is, what we are to implore from God, and what we are to give
thanks for, as enjoy'd. Examin then the Prayers of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and if they differ either
in the Cauſe, the Matter, the Form, or end from the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy of Men,</hi> mentioned
in the <hi>Act,</hi> or the <hi>Heavenly Liturgy of Chriſt,</hi> let them be delivered over to all deſerved
puniſhment; but if their Prayers be agreeable to the preſcrib'd forms of both; nay,
if they be agreeable to the Coeleſtial Liturgy, though not according to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101356:6"/>
               <hi>Verbatim</hi> of the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Liturgy of</hi> England; 'tis a hard caſe that they ſhould by
any <hi>Statute</hi> be adjudged not to exerciſe ſuch a Religion. If it be <hi>objected,</hi> that the
Notions of many are Abortive, and through weakneſs may deſerve Reprehenſion,
there is an eaſie way to remedy thoſe Errors by impoſing a more equal Injunction
by the Authority of Church Diſcipline, that no perſon ſhould preſume to aſcend the
Pulpit with <hi>ex tempore</hi> Raptures.</p>
            <p>For confirmation then that there is no need of uſing of Form and Order, ſo the
matter be the ſame, there are many of the Diſciples Prayers recorded in Scripture,
and there is no queſtion to be made but that they were acceptable to God; and yet
we do not read they uſed the abſolute <hi>Form</hi> preſcribed by our Saviour, but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves in other words, though altogether agreeing for matter.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, ſuppoſe this Queſtion ſhould be put, Whether the Apoſtles did
uſe any other <hi>Form</hi> than that which was taught them by Chriſt? There is, no doubt,
but the Anſwer will be, They did not.</p>
            <p>Put then this Queſtion to the <hi>Informer;</hi> Did the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> uſe any other Prayers
than what were agreeable to the <hi>Church of England?</hi> In the firſt place, 'tis ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to one, whether he be a Competent judge. If he be not, he ſtakes his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at a dreadful hazard; for it behoves him to Swear poſitively in the Affirmative,
or elſe in juſtice his <hi>Information,</hi> and all his hopes of Gain, are loſt. And thus by
a rigid Proſecution of uncharitable ſeverity, a neceſſitous and <hi>greedy wretch</hi> is
brought to this tempting <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to Perjure himſelf, or loſe his Expectation.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Liturgy</hi> it ſelf is not always read altogether; but on ſome days more,
on ſome days leſs. The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> perhaps uſe leaſt of all, yet they uſe ſome, for
they read the <hi>Reading Pſalms, A firſt and ſecond Leſſon,</hi> and afterwards make uſe of
<hi>Singing Pſalms:</hi> So then it being apparent that the degree of Compariſon does not
annihilate the ſubject of the Compariſon, it may be preſumed that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are
preſent at their <hi>Conventicles,</hi> poſitively according to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi>
England. Which things not being conſidered, how uncharitably do they fall under
the cenſure of <hi>Laviſh and Inveterate Pulpits?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place, though it would be very unreaſonable to diſallow what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid; yet ſhould it be contradicted, the next words, <hi>or the practiſe of the Church,</hi>
will certainly give relief. For it is the <hi>practice of the Church of</hi> England, to Read and Sing
the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> to read the firſt and ſecond <hi>Leſſon,</hi> and ſo <hi>do the Diſſenters;</hi> many
of them alſo militate under the ſame <hi>Ordination:</hi> And if there be any that do not,
'tis preſumed they might ſoon be better adviſed, the refuſal deſerving reproof if
they may be admitted, being certainly to be look'd upon as an obſtinate piece of
weakneſs. But which is more, as to the <hi>Harmony of practice,</hi> they uſe the <hi>ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
though perhaps with ſome ſmall difference in the <hi>Form and Ceremony of
Adminiſtration,</hi> which one would think might be eaſily reconciled without all this
Combuſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is one thing more to be conſidered upon the account of Moral Equity:
That though the</hi> Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity <hi>made in this</hi> His Majeſties Raign, <hi>it is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
declared,</hi> That no other Form or Ceremony ſhall be uſed, but what is preſcribed
in that Act, or in the Book of Common Prayer: <hi>Yet both by the Act and the Book it
plainly appears, that the</hi> Proſecutors of the Diſſenters make no ſcruple to diſſent from
what is there Enacted, while they uſe ſeveral Ceremonies that are not there, and omit
much of what is there, as their going up and bowing to the Altar, and reading ſecond
Service there. Their coming out of the Pulpit, and reading Part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Service in their Desks, or at the Altar again, and giving no Bleſſing at all in
Pulpit: Their ſetting the Communion Table Altar-wiſe, Richly adorned at the Eaſt
end of the Church, whereas it ought to be placed either in the Body of the Church, or
in ſome convenient place, Covered with a clean Linnen-Cloath. Their Turning their
Faces all of a Sudden to the Eaſt, and bowing to the Name of Jeſus, and not at the
Name of God or Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Diſpenſations argue an apparent <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> or <hi>Over-Conformity;</hi> the
ſame thing in ſtrickneſs and partiality one among another: So that it ſeems a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101356:7"/>
not only againſt Charity, but againſt Common Juſtice, to proſecute thoſe
that do no more than only <hi>Non-Conform</hi> to thoſe very Ceremonies which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
regard leſs of a publick <hi>Statute,</hi> either neglect, or over act at their own will
and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And for a further confirmation of the Nonconformity of our moſt <hi>Regular</hi> (ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
themſelves) <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> point blank even againſt the <hi>very Law of the Land;</hi>
let them that pleaſe but conſider, how many there are that diſpence with <hi>Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,</hi>
and <hi>Pluralities,</hi> to the deteriment of many deſerving perſons that want, and
poſitively againſt the <hi>Statute of the 21 of</hi> H. 8. <hi>and yet no queſtion but they would think
it hard meaſure to be proſecuted upon that Law.</hi> So Partial is a man to forgive thoſe
failings in himſelf, which he Proſecutes in others.</p>
            <p>However, becauſe all the meekneſs of Perſwaſion and Argument will not ſtop the
Career of ſome mens Impetuoſity in the <hi>Proſecution of this Act,</hi> it will not be from
the purpoſe to caſt an Eye upon the <hi>Executive part of the Statute.</hi> In order to which
the moſt conſiderable Inſtructions are couched in the firſt and eleventh Section. The
Inſtructions of the firſt Section run thus.</p>
            <p>That it ſhall and may be lawful to and for any one or more Iuſtices of the Peace within
the limits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where ſuch Offence ſhall be committed, <hi>or for the Chief</hi> Magiſtrate of the
Place or Corporation, and upon proof of ſuch Offence, either by the Confeſſion, or Oath
of two Witneſſes, or by Notorious Evidence and Circumſtance of the Fact, to make a
Record under their Hands and Seals, which Record ſhall to all intents, &amp;c. <hi>be taken to
be a full Conviction, that thereupon, the ſaid Juſtices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall impoſe the ſum of,</hi>
&amp;c. From which words it is clear, that by this clauſe no power is given to any <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi>
to make out any general <hi>Warrant</hi> upon this <hi>Act</hi> till after Conviction by two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<hi>or</hi> Confeſſion of the Offender. Neither has any Conſtable to do with any ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Warrant in reference to this Act, unleſs the Warrant grounded upon ſuch a Record
as is mention'd in the Act, upon confeſſion or proof and conviction of the Party by two
Witneſſes be given into his hands. <hi>Whence ariſes this Queſtion,</hi> Whether any Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Head-borough that acts in relation to this Statute, by vertue of a Power not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by the literal words of the Law, do not act at his own peril?</p>
            <p>2. Whether he ſhall incur any penalty for not doing that which the Law requires not
at his Hands?</p>
            <p>For by this part of the <hi>Law</hi> it is required only that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhould be the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.</hi>
But by <hi>general Warrants</hi> the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> &amp;c. are compelled to turn <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
themſelves,</hi> and to find themſelves work to accuſe their Neighbours on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to find themſelves yet more work to diſturb and diſtrain upon their Goods and
Perſons: A duty which the literal ſenſe of this Paragraph does not in the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon them.</p>
            <p>But the Eleventh Section is more particular in theſe words:</p>
            <p>And be it farther Enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That if any Conſtable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſhall know or be
credibly informed of any ſuch Meetings held within his Precinct, and ſhall not give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to his duty, and endeavour the Conviction of the
Parties, but ſhall wilfully omit the performance of his duty in the Execution of the Act,
and ſhall be convicted thereof, ſhall forfeit the ſum of five pounds.</p>
            <p>By this <hi>Paragraph</hi> it is very plain indeed, that if the <hi>Conſtable</hi> do either know of
himſelf, or be credibly informed, and do not do his duty he forfeiteth 5 <hi>l.</hi> but ſtill
if he neither know nor be credibly informed, he is not bound to be ſo ſedulous as to
go upon the Hunt. But ſuppoſe the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould either know of himſelf,
and be credibly informed, and ſhould do his duty, that is, give <hi>Information,</hi> and
ſhould receive a <hi>Warrant</hi> to break open the Houſe and enter: yet finding nothing of
Reſiſtance, he is ſtill but where he was, in regard that not having been there from
the beginning to the end, he cannot be poſitive, whether the Perſons there Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
did exerciſe a Religion according to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>the Church of</hi>
England <hi>or not,</hi> which if they did, he has no power either to take their Names, or
apprehend their Perſons, unleſs they ſhould be ſo imprudent as to make reſiſtance,
and give an occaſion for their Military Power to be raiſed for their ſuppreſſion, for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101356:7"/>
then as <hi>Mutineers and Seditious perſons, they break their own peace by diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the Kings,</hi> and by making it appear they are the Perſons intended by
this <hi>Act,</hi> render themſelves obnoxi us not only to the <hi>Penalties</hi> of this but of
much more <hi>ſevere Laws.</hi> From which enjoyning of the Military Officers to be
aiding and aſſiſting to the <hi>Conſtables</hi> with armed Force, Reaſon may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
collect the ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Act</hi> to be no other than what has been
already preſum'd. For <hi>Armed Force and Conſtabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> could never be intended
by the Law againſt Paſſive ſubmiſſion and obedience. Naked Swords and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables</hi>
Staves could never be intended by Chriſtian <hi>Legiſlators</hi> to compel the
compliance of ſincere and upright Conſcience, to things of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in reſpect of thoſe Fundamentals wherein the <hi>Proſecutors</hi> and the
<hi>Proſecuted</hi> both agree. And therefore while the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> has taken
ſuch extraordinary care for the <hi>publick ſafety</hi> and <hi>tranquility</hi> of the Nation, it
ſhould not be the aim of others to carve out for them their Care, the ſupport
and maintenance of any By Intereſt whatever: An aim too apparent, by their
publick diſſatisfaction, and open exclaiming againſt that <hi>noble Act</hi> of his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
moſt Royal Goodneſs, His Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience</hi> (too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
ſevere thoſe <hi>Counſels</hi> that removed the <hi>Land-mark</hi> of his <hi>Regal Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
A preſumption that they believe themſelves more worthy or more able to
manage that part of <hi>Prerogative</hi> themſelves, and grutch him the exerciſe of his
Right. Whereas the <hi>Legiſlators</hi> with more Duty provide <hi>that nothing in their
Act ſhall extend to invalidate or avoid his Majeſties Supermacy in Eccleſiaſtical
Affairs.</hi> But the <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants</hi> acknowledge their <hi>Soveraign</hi> to be both
<hi>King and Prieſt:</hi> A <hi>King</hi> as he is the <hi>Supream Head of the Government;</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
as the <hi>Supream Head of the Church.</hi> To whom, as their <hi>lawful Soveraign</hi> and
<hi>Head of the Government,</hi> as they have been alwaies ready to yield the utmoſt
of their obedience, ſo ſhall they never withdraw from him the utmoſt of their
Fidelity. And from whoſe <hi>Prieſtly Office</hi> they have yet hopes to feel the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<hi>of his former Grace and Mercy,</hi> when their Cauſe ſhall be better exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
For 'tis not the Exaſperation of the <hi>Pens of Wicked men</hi> continually
<hi>ſcribling Diviſion,</hi> nor the <hi>Subornations of Popery</hi> to fix <hi>imaginary Plots, and
load their Innocence with the guilt and Villanies of others,</hi> but the Truth of their
<hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and their upright walking before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> which they hope
will at length turn the <hi>Reproaches</hi> and <hi>Calumnies</hi> of their <hi>Enemies upon their
own Heads.</hi> 'Tis <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which all <hi>True Proteſtants</hi> deſire, which they daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
from God. There is nothing but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> wanting in this Rich and Plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Land. Which as it is only obſtructed by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or perſons <hi>papiſtically affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
as it is apparent by their <hi>daily Machinations</hi> and <hi>contrivances to unſetle and
weaken the true Proteſtant Intereſt;</hi> ſo there can be no greater Argument for
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> to unite with <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt the <hi>Common Enemy</hi> of their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
From theſe and Grounds of the ſame Nature, there are ſome who have
drawn this general Concluſion, <hi>That it would be more conducing to the good of
the Kingdom, and the Benefit of the Proteſtant Religion, that the Penal Laws
againſt Non-Conformiſts,</hi> in reference to differences of Religion, <hi>might not be
put in Execution, but forborn, till our moſt Gracious Soveraign, and his great
Council the Parliament, ſhould take the ſtate of Divided Proteſtants into their
wiſe Conſideration, and reduce things to a happier Legal Eſtabliſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eor proof of which it may not be altogether improper to give a ſhort Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation
of the Reaſons brought in defence of the Poſition.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That it cannot be good to execute the 35 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> which the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
thought dangerous to the whole Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> and
did as far as in them lay diſannul.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101356:8"/>
               <p>2. It cannot be proper to execute that Law upon them who cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be guilty of the Crime at which the Law aims.</p>
               <p>3. It cannot be proper to execute any Law upon Diſſenting Proteſtants,
which was promoted by men Popiſhly inclined, and which ſince appeared to
be Papiſts, as was the Five Mile Act.</p>
               <p>4. Becauſe it ſeems ſomewhat prepoſterous to rid the Land of Diſſenting
Proteſtants, perſons profeſſing true Religion and Loyalty, yet leave the Papiſts
the Enemies of the King and Church to ſtay behind.</p>
               <p>5. Becauſe the Penal Laws are to be inflicted upon the proper objects, as
Seditious Sectaries, diſloyal perſons, Hypocrites, that make Religion a cloak
and pretence to inſtall principles of Schiſm and Sedition, not upon Meetings
where there is no tendency to any ſuch Deſigns.</p>
               <p>6. A ſixth Argument is drawn from the Piety of the Non-Conformiſts Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and the Peaceableneſs of their Behaviour, found ſo to be from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of many years.</p>
               <p>7. Becauſe they are Proteſtants; and it ſeems not ſo well done to uſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
the Kingdoms Friends, and Strength worſe than Papiſts, the Enemies
of the Kingdom and Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>8. Becauſe it is not good to execute the Law with a heavy Hand upon all
and every Offender, without making a difference between one man and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
between one Offence and another.</p>
               <p>9. Becauſe by their publick Preaching their judgments and practiſes are beſt
diſcovered, and being in the Head of the younger Diſſenters, they are as
Directions and Examples to them, to keep them from dangerous Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>10. Becauſe that when pious and good men have their publick Liberty, and
make uſe of that Liberty only to inſtruct the People in their Duty to God and
the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one chief end of the Magiſtrates care of the State is obtained,
which is to maintain ſound Doctrine.</p>
               <p>11. Becauſe thereby they will be better enabled and encouraged to perform
other good Offices to the King and State.</p>
            </q>
            <p>2. <hi>Then in Reference to the Church, theſe Reaſons are added:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>1. Becauſe agreeing in Fundamentals with their Proſecutors, they are a
great Addition of Strength againſt the force and ſubtleties of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Becauſe thereby Schiſm will come to a greater cloſure, when the Church
ſhall be ſatisfied in their profitable Doctrine and peaceable Behaviour, which
will create a greater deſire of Peace and Union.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe by this publick Preaching, Multitudes of poor Souls that will
go no where elſe, are in the way of Salvation and Profeſſion of the Goſpel, of
which ſome Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are ſo deeply ſenſible, that they
Treat the Non-Conformiſts as Friends and fellow Labourers.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All which Reaſons are more at large diſcuſſed in the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> Plea for the
<hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> to which the Reader is referred.</p>
            <p>There remains now no more than only the humble Propoſal of ſome few
<hi>Queries,</hi> and ſo to conclude. Firſt in Reference to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> may be lawfully prohibited from Preaching the Word
of God in truth and ſincerity, at any time, or in any place?</p>
            <p>2. Whether by the bleſſings and rewards that are promiſed to thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the Doctrine of Chriſt, they are not obliged to do it?</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101356:8"/>
            <p>3. Whether the Example of Chriſt and his Diſciples does not admit of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Houſes, Streets</hi> and <hi>Fields to more than five in a Company?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Whether it be not ſomething Erroneons for the <hi>Law</hi> of Man to contradict
the Law—</p>
            <p>5. Whether the Paſſive Obedience of Perſons prohibited by a <hi>Law</hi> from
<hi>preaching</hi> the Word of God, be not deſtructive to the propagation and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Goſpel of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In reference to the Law of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether the Opinion of the Commons of <hi>England, That the proſecution
of</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters, <hi>upon the penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the
Subject, a weakning of the proteſtant Intereſt, and an encouragement to</hi> Popery,
<hi>and dangerous to the peace of the Kingdom,</hi> ought not to be taken into a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conſideration?</p>
            <p>2. Whether the proſecution of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> does not ſeem a little ſtrange, as to
the preſent timing of it, when the Papiſts lie under ſeveral Convictions of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Ruin</hi> of the <hi>proteſtant Religion</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and when the <hi>Kingdom</hi>
is under ſuch fears and Jealouſies of the Predominancy of their Abettors?</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be not more proper to begin with <hi>Popery</hi> before they go about
to extirpate <hi>Non-Conformity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Whether they who have with ſo much inveteracy rak'd into the <hi>forgotten
and pardon'd Miſcarriages of the</hi> Presbyterians, had not better have ſpar'd their
pains, as nothing at all to the purpoſe, except to what is unbecoming either
peaceable or wiſe men?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether a <hi>Law</hi> that <hi>creates Arbitrary Diſtreſſes and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
be not contrary to the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>1. Whether the <hi>proceedings</hi> of the <hi>Law enforcers</hi> be not contrary to the
Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Whatever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even
the ſame unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whether it be according to <hi>Scripture;</hi> For <hi>Proteſtants</hi> acknowledging the
ſame <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the ſame <hi>Scripture,</hi> and agreeing in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Religion,
only for differences</hi> in <hi>human Ceremonies</hi> to tear and devour one another?</p>
            <p>3. Whether in point of <hi>Appeal</hi> to make Parties themſelves <hi>Judges,</hi> be a thing
uſual?</p>
            <p>4. Whether in the proſecution of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to make uſe of
<hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>Promooters,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> calls, <hi>Turbiolum Hominum

            <p>4. <hi>In point of Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether it be not againſt the <hi>Rules of Policy,</hi> for <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> of the ſame
<hi>Religion,</hi> by cruelties and ſeverities to deſtroy one another, which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

the Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s Maxims, <hi>That a King can never be poor when his Subjects are
Rich;</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p>2. Whether it be not againſt the <hi>Rules of Policy</hi> to ſet up a <hi>Law</hi> for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of <hi>vexatious Informers, who under the reverend Mantle of Love and
Juſtice</hi> (to uſe the Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s own words) <hi>inſtituted for the protection of the

            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101356:9"/>
            <p>3. Whether it be not contrary to the Rules of <hi>prudence</hi> to make attempts in

than appeaſes Enmity, and the common Maxim is, that <hi>Sanguis Martyrum
eſt ſemen Eccleſiae?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Whether <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>mildneſs</hi> would not abſolutely remove the <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
given to the <hi>proteſtant Churches</hi> abroad, and endear us to our <hi>Forraign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Alliances?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whether it be prudence to afflict Proteſtants at home, when we entertain
afflicted Proteſtants from abroad?</p>
            <p>6. Whether by theſe unnatural Diviſions the neceſſary Leagues and Tyes of
Friendſhip and acquaintance, common Truſt and Confidence among men, may
not in time be broken, to the ruin of all Society?</p>
            <p>7. Whether the wicked diſtinctions of <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Whigg,</hi> &amp;c. were not ſet on
foot to encreaſe the <hi>Diſſentions</hi> between Proteſtants, and whether the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Malicious continuance of them, do not deſerve a puniſhment equal

            <p>5. <hi>In Reference to the Executive part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether the Iſſuing out of general Warrants by the Juſtices of the Peace

to be pleaded, at the Parliament holden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
of ſubſidy are accordingly and the proviſo call
it a ſeſſion; Then this being done, the Lord Chief Baron did
not deliver any Opinion, for he ſaid, that he had not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the ſtatute, and afterwards it was deſired that the Lords
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101356:12"/>
would deliver their Opinions, and thereupon the Lord <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi>
declared his Opinion accordingly, That it ſeemed to him
that it was a Seſſion, and that it was not ſafe to meddle with
ſuch Law; and that he would never refuſe to declare his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
with his Brethren. After the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Ley</hi>
made a long diſcourſe concerning the purpoſe and intent of
Parliament, <hi>Scilicet,</hi> That it was not their purpoſe to deſtroy
ſo good Laws, and therefore it was not any ſuch Seſſion, as was
within the intent of the preceding Parliament, which was,
that theſe ſhould determine when it is a Parliament or Seſſion,
in which good Laws are made.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Doderidge</hi> ſaid, that it was fit to ſee the Commiſſion,
and that that which hath been ſaid, was not to bind any one,
but every one ſpoke what then he was adviſed of, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
might change upon better conſideration. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> on an Aſſembly of the two Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,
the Chief Baron, Juſtice <hi>Haughtom,</hi> Baron <hi>Denham,
Hutton, Chamberlain,</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> the Attorney General brought
the Commiſſion <hi>de 12 Eliz. June</hi> 1. and that had theſe words;
<hi>Pro eo quod nullus Regalis aſſenſus, nec reſponſio per nos Praeſtat.
fuit nullum Parliamentum nec aliqua Seſſio Parliamenti lata aut
tent. fuit.</hi> They have power to adjourn this Parliament thus
begun, and the Commiſſion to Diſſolve this Parliament 28
<hi>Feb. Anno. 19 Jac.</hi> had the ſame words, ſaving that he recite
that he had given his Royal aſſent to an Act of Subſidy, by
which was intended, that it ſhould not be a Seſſion; and upon
view of the Commiſſion, the Lord Chief Juſtice moved that
the King was miſtaken in this, that he had given Power to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
this Parliament, which had not any Seſſion, and if it be a
Seſſion, then he had no power to Diſſolve it, and then it is as it
were a receſs, and a Parliament cannot be diſcontinued or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
but by matter of Record, and that by the King alone;
and if the Parliament yet continue, then this Statute alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
during the Parliament by the Proviſo; but that would
not ſerve: For firſt it is againſt the intent of the King, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Proclamation: And alſo the Caſe is truly put in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
as to the matter in Fact; and he is not miſinformed, but miſtaken
in the Law, and then the Commiſſion for the Diſſolving is good, ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable
to the Lord <hi>Chandois</hi> Caſe, and other Caſes, <hi>vide</hi> in <hi>Cholmley's</hi>
Caſe; but becauſe that all the Judges were not at this Conference, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was deferred until the next term; and in the interim the Grand
Secretary and the Attorney General were to inform the King, that the
Statute is obſcure, and had not been put in ure, and that we could not
agree.</p>

               <p>Since this was finiſhed, I found in the <hi>London Gazette</hi> Publiſhed <hi>Thurſday April</hi> 21.
1681. this Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To undeceive the Kings Loyal Subjects, who may be miſled into Error by a Pamphlet
called <hi>The Hiſtory of the Life and Death of 35 Eliz.</hi> Theſe are to inform them, that
that Act amongſt others, was continued 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> until the end of the firſt Seſſion of the next
Parliament, There were four Seſſions in that Parliament, the laſt whereof ended 7 <hi>Jac.</hi>
but the Act was to continue to the firſt Seſſion of the next Parliament; and though every
Seſſion to ſome purpoſes be as a ſeveral Parliament, yet it is no ſuch Parliament which can
have a firſt Seſſion, and is never in Acts of Parliament ſtiled the next Parliament. The
next Parliament ſummoned was 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> but becauſe nothing was done therein, it was held
no Parliament. Then a Parliament was ſummoned 18 <hi>Jac.</hi> wherein paſſed only Subſidies
Granted by the Spiritualty and Temporalty. Hence a queſtion aroſe 20 <hi>Jac.</hi> whether
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101356:16"/>
35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was not diſcontinued upon this ground, that 18 <hi>Jac.</hi> was a Seſſion by paſſing the
Subſidy Act, which being referr'd to all the Judges, nine of them were of Opinion, 35
<hi>Eliz.</hi> with the other Laws continued 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> were thereby diſcontinued. To prevent
which miſchief, The Parliament 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> not only revives 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and thoſe other Laws
in all 58. but Enacts that they ſhall be ad udged ever ſince the Seſſion of Parliament 7 <hi>Jac.</hi>
to have been of ſuch Force and Effect as the ſame were the laſt day of that Seſſion. And
'tis undoubted they all were then in force, by Virtue of 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> and the latter continuance
run clear without the aid of the Declaratory Law of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. And though this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
Act of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. be expired, yet there is another of greater Force 22 of the
King yet in being.</p>
               <p>And having therein mentioned the Act of the 22 of his Preſent Majeſty, I
thought I could not juſtly acquit my ſelf of what I had undertaken (<hi>viz.</hi>

            <head>A Poſtſcript touching Proſecutions in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</head>
            <p>HAving thus done with the Temporal Proſecutions, it may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
to add a word concerning the Spiritual Perſecutions now on
foot, by Citations and Excommunications, not only to the great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and trouble, but to the great expence of the people. In reference to
which, Men are to conſider whether the preſent Eccleſiaſtical ſeverity be
according to Law or no: For what ever is done to diſturb the quiet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of particular Subjects, contrary to Law, is down right Oppreſſion.
That the exerciſe of the Puniſhments of Excommunication and an Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
is allowable againſt obdurate Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, is apparent
from Scripture; and the ſame Scriptute directs both by whom, how, and
upon whom theſe Sentences ought to be pronounced. On the other ſide,
as there is no part of Scripture that erects any Eccleſiaſtical Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
or Warrants the formal Proceſſes of Citations, Pleas and Anſwers,
or the extravagant Fees of Proctors, Apparitors and Promooters; ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that ſince the Reformation, they have been abrogated by the Law
of the Land, as being look'd upon meerly to be the effects of Popiſh Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation:
For Epiſcopal Authority conſiſts not ſo much in keeping Courts,
as in a true Inſpection and Care over the Flock of Chriſt; the Weapons of
their Authory are only Admonition and Reprehenſion, and then Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
comes of courſe, a more Regular aud Apoſtolick way, than by
Proceſſes and Citations As to all other Juriſdiction comprehending Force
and Compulſion, it is veſted ſolely in the King, who is by all true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
accounted the Defender of the Faith, and the ſupream Head of the
Church. The Law it ſelf runs thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And whereas the Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops, and other Spiritual perſons
in this Realm, do uſe to make and ſend out their Summons, Citations and
other Proceſſes, in their own names, and in ſuch form and manner as was
uſed in the time of the uſurped power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to
the form and order of the Summons and Proceſs of the Common Law
uſed in this Realm (ſeeing that all Authority of Juriſdiction, Spiritual and
Temporal, is derived and deducted from the Kings Majeſty as ſupreme
head of theſe Churches, and Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the Clergy of the ſaid Realm, that all Courts Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
within the ſaid two Realms) be kept by no other power or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
either forreign or within the Realm, but by the authority of his moſt
excellent Majeſty. Be it therefore further enacted by the Authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
that all Summons and Citations, or other Proceſs Eccleſiaſtical, in
all ſuits and cauſes of Inſtance betwixt party and party, and all cauſes of
Correction, and all cauſes of Baſtardy or Bigamy, or enquiry, <hi>de jure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronatus,</hi>
Probates of Teſtaments, and Commiſſions of Adminiſtartions of
perſons deceaſed, and all Acquittances of, and upon account made by the
Executor, Adminiſtrators, or Collectors of goods of any dead perſon, be
from the firſt day of <hi>July</hi> next following, made in the name, and with
the ſtyle of the King, as it is in Writs Original or Judicial at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law: And that the Teſt thereof be in the name of the Arch-Biſhop
or Biſhop, or other, having Exccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, who hath the
Commiſſion and grant of the Authority Eccleſiaſtical immediately from
the Kings Highneſs, and that his Commiſſary, Official or Subſtitute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
Juriſdiction under him, ſhall put his name in the Citation or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
after the Teſt.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101356:19"/>
               <p>Further be it enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That all manner of
perſon or perſons, who have the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,
ſhall have from the firſt day of <hi>July</hi> before expreſſed, in their Seals of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the Kings Highneſs Arms decently ſet, with certain Characters under
the Arms, for the knowledge of the Dioceſs, and ſhall uſe no other Seal of
Juriſdiction, but where His Mejeſties Arms be ingraven, upon pain, that if
any perſon ſhall uſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction (after the day before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
in this Realm of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> or other his Dominions or Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and not ſend or make out the Citation of Proceſs in the Kings name,
or uſe any Seal of Juriſdiction other than before limited; that every ſuch
Offender ſhall incur, and run in the Kings Majeſties diſpleaſure and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and ſuffer Impriſonment at his Higneſs will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Provided that no more, nor other Fees be taken or paid for the Seal and
Writing of any Citations or other Proceſs than was heretofore accuſtomed.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Which being true, what power the Biſhops have to hold their Spiritual
Courts, and ſend out Proceſs in their own Names, and to make Citations
and Executions of Judgements under their own Seals, is an enquiry not
improper for them that believed themſelves wronged.</p>
            <p>This Act is ſaid to have been repeal'd by the 1. and 2. of <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
c.</hi> 8. though no mention be made of it among the repeal'd Acts of that

divers good Laws and Statutes were made and Eſtabliſhed, as well for the
utter extinguiſhment and putting away of all Uſurped and Forreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Authorities out of this your Realm, and other your Highneſs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and Countries, as alſo for the reſtoring and uniting to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Crown of this Realm, the Ancient Juriſdictions, Authorities, Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and Preheminencies to the ſame of right belonging and appertaining,
by reaſon whereof, we your moſt humble and obedient Subjects, from the
Five and twentieth year of the Reign of your ſaid dear Father, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
kept in good order, and were disburdened of divers great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
Charges and Exactions before that time unlawfully taken and
exacted by ſuch Forreign power and authority as before that was uſurped,
until ſuch time as all the ſaid good Laws and Statutes, by one Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made in the firſt and ſecond years of the Reigns of the late King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> your Highneſs Siſter, intituled an Act Repealing all
Statues, Articles and Proviſions made againſt the See Apoſtolick of <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſince the Twentieth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; and alſo for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of all Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Poſſeſſions and Hereditaments
conveyed to the Laity, were all clearly repealed and made void, as by the
ſame Act of Repeal more at large doth and may appear; by reaſon of
which Act of Repeal, your ſaid humble Subjects were eftſoons brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an uſurped Forreign Power and Authority, and yet do remain in that
bondage, to the intollerable charges of your loving Subjects, if ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs

               <p>And to the intent that all Uſurped and Forreign Power and Authority

the Tenor and effect of the ſaid Letters Patents; any matter or cauſe to
the contrary in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</p>
            </q>
            <p>By which branches of this Statute, it ſeems to be moſt demonſtrable,
that all manner of Juriſdiction in Cauſes Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
in the Crown, and that no Spiritual Courts may be holden, but by
the Kings Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, By the 16. <hi>Car. primi,</hi> the very branch of the Statute for granting

            <p>Seeing then that all Power both Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical is veſted in
