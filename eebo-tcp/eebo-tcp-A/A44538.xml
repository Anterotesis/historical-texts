         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thy Peace! <hi>Why art thou cast down, and why art
thou so disquieted within me!</hi> Is there no Ground of
Hope left to cast the Anchor of thy Faith upon?
Drop on holy Jesus, who will uphold and sustain
thee. Nay tho' I have search'd all the City thro',
yet I can hear no Tidings of him.</p>

undefiled One.</p>

fair, having Dove's Eyes,</hi> and is the chiefest of ten
Thousands. O that I had my Beloved, I would
not let him go, but he should lye all night betwixt
my Breasts. O therefore, tell me quickly, good
Watchmen, that I may find him whom my Soul
longs for, Why truly, you seem to be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

Halberts, and a Candle and Lantern, whispering
as they went, but know not what they said or meant,
but this we heard them say, <hi>He's in the Garden of
Gethsemane.</hi> Aye, and are ye sure they said so?
Then my beloved is there, I will follow hard after
him, lest the Rabbles find him whom my soul
loves. Hark, hark my soul, methinks I hear his
Voice most bitterly crying out Lord, where art
thou; What are they a doing to thee; O my Soul
run to his Relief, aye, but whether; 'Tis dark,
and the Voice comes from far, and I know not the
way. O good Watchmen, pray now lend me, tell
me, or shew me the way. We can't go from our
Rounds, nor will we, to seek out we know not
who, but keep on this Road which leads to the
Garden of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> and you'll find him, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

but matter of Fact; for some of us not only heard
him say at the Grave's mouth, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> come forth

            <p>O my dear Lord, What is it they witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee? Do they affirm thou raised <hi>Lazarus</hi>
from the Grave? What then, ye faithless and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Generation, is it not lawful to do good
rather than Evil? Verily, your Hearts are seared,
otherwise they would not act contrary to Law and
<pb facs="tcp:31676:7"/>
Reason. And O holy Jesus, who raised up <hi>Lazarus</hi>
to Life, raise thou my Soul out of the Grave of
Sin, to live the Life of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>Then the Chief Priests and Elders with the
Scribes and Pharisees, farther consulted and said,
What do we? This Man doth many Miracles, and
if we let him alone, all Men will believe on him,
and the Romans will come and take away our
Place and Nation. Miserble Jews how fearful are
you lest any should venture on him, and Believe,
seeing his Miracles! Lord, I will freely part with
all for thy Sake, Yea, let who will come and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
this earthly Substance, I am content, so I
may enjoy the Influence of thy blessed Spirit,
which none can rob me of. But Caiaphas said
unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider
that it is Expedient for us, that no Man should
die for the People, and that the Nation perish not.
And this he spake not of himself, but God order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it so, that the Prophecy should come out of
his own Mouth, to condemn him at the last Day.
<hi>And from that time forward, they took counsel to put
him to Death.</hi> Hitherto all they did, could not
accomplish their wicked Designs. At last mad at
Heart, they, with a detestable and wicked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
contrived to hire two impudent Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to Swear against him in the High Priest's
Hall. Accordingly the Wretches came, and
with loud Voices and open Mouths, Cryed,
saying, <hi>This Fellow said, I am able to destroy the

            <p>Then they began to Spit on him, and to buffet
him, and strike him with the Palms of their
Hands, reviling him as a seditous Fellow, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
and smiting him on the Face, saying,
<hi>Prophecy now unto us, thou, Christ, who is it that
smote th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.</hi> At last, finding they could not agree
together, as to putting him to Death, and to pass
Sentence on him, (for they all agreed in the just
Merits of his Condemnation) yet he must first be
sent to Pontius Pilate their chief Governor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31676:8"/>
And now, O my Soul, didst thou ever hear such
Arrogance, Malice, and Envy before! Could any
imagine their Hearts should be so hardened, who
void of any Pity and Compassion, hunted and
worried the Lord of Hosts from one Place to
another. Well might he say, Foxes have Holes,
and Birds of the Air have Nests, but the Son of
Man have no where to lay his Head. O my Soul,
doth it not make thee tremble to see Christ, thy
God, King, and Redeemer, haled by rude Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to Condemnation. Ah, my dear Jesus,
what made thee descend from Heaven to Earth,
become Man, and be born in an open Stable, in
such Poverty and Misery, but Love, celestial
Love, to make Satisfaction to thy Father, for all
my heinous Sins committed against thy ever bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Majesty. O dear and wonderful Lord, how
shall I require thy Love! O let me never fall away
from Thee, nor thy Faith, but be stedfast to the
End; and happy are all they that after they have
denied with Peter their Redeemer, find a Door
of Mercy open to receive them again. O Peter,
dost thou not remember thy Master's Words now!
What curse and swear you know him not,
when but a little before you said, <hi>Though I
should Dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee!</hi>
How hast thou forgotten thy own Promise
and Ingagement made to thy departing and
dying Saviour! Now <hi>Peter</hi> art thou in the
Gall of Bitterness, and in the Blood of iniquity
<pb facs="tcp:31676:9"/>
Doth not the Arrows of the Almighty wound thy
Soul, now thou seest thou art fallen? O let him
that standeth, be cautious lest he fail in the same
manner as thou hast done!</p>
            <p>And now, my Soul, hark, what are they going
to do? O dear Lord God, precious Jesus, what
will nothing appease the Tumult, but thy Death?
O <hi>Pilate,</hi> proceed not to condemn thy Redeemer,
but rather suffer thy Body to be torn in Pieces by
the Multitude.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Pilate,</hi> seeing nothing would avail, nor
would they suffer him to be released, after he was
scourged, buffetted, smitten, spit upon, reviled,
mocked, and hist at, with his Head crowned with
sharp Thorns, which like Needles pierced his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Brain; and his Body is scorn cloathed with a
Purple Robe. Thus dealt with, they admitted
no Plea for him, but cryed out, <hi>Release unto us
Barabbas, and crucify this seditious Fellow Jesus; away
with him, away with him.</hi> Pilate seeing this, and
that the Uproar was great, called for Water, and
washing his Hands, said, <hi>I am innocent of the Blood
of this just Person, see you to it.</hi> Then answered all
the People, <hi>His Blood</hi>—Nay, hold Gentlemen,
(saith <hi>Pilate</hi>) here your King stands, I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
him, and endeavoured to trap him in
his Replies, and lo! I find no fault at all in him.
But they cried out the more outragiously, <hi>Crucify
him, Crucify him: his Blood be upon us, and on our
Children.</hi> Then released he <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jesus delivered him to be Crucified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31676:9"/>
Ah, cruel Pilate, who hast thou Condemned?
The Lord of Glory, the Son of God, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the World. See yonder, how He's haled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from thee, stooping under the Burden of his
Cross, and his feeble Legs trembling by Reason of
its Weight; so that with the Dust, Dirt, Crowd,
Sweat, Blood, and want of Sustenance, to revive
his fatigued drooping Spirits, the blessed Jesus is
ready to sink. Can'st thou look after him, Pilate,
and see all this, and thy Heart and Soul not faint
and bleed? O Lord, let me with the happy <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
help to bear thy Cross.</p>
            <p>And, after they had abused him, and put many
Indignities upon him, they led him towards <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha</hi>
to crucify him? where they gave him <hi>Vinegar</hi>
and <hi>Gall</hi> to drink, and when he had tasted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he would not drink.</p>
            <p>And now, O blessed Jesus, what Eye can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to see or behold thee? How with rude,
brawny Fists, and sear'd Hearts, they force, twist,
pull, hale, and extend thy sacred Hands, which
were always doing Good, and Healing Diseases,
now Nailing to the Cross? What Heart cannot
but Mourn, and Lament bitterly, as not being
able to behold thee? Surely, our very Souls must
be pricked, and our Hearts break within us, to see
thy ever blessed Side pierced, springing out
Streams of Blood.</p>
            <p>And now, dear Jesus, to see how with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled
Severity, they pierced thy Hands and

Feet, and penetrate thy Nerves and Sinews,
forcing the sacred Blood out of thy tender and
delicate Veins upon the Cross, and all for me,
and my Sins, dost thou endure this Torment,
and shed so many Drops of Blood, crying out
in the Bitterness of thy Soul, behold and see if

God's own Hand, Where is that Beauty of
thine? Where is that Grace of thy Lips?

Offences, which took my wickedness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

rise again from my Fall; return home
