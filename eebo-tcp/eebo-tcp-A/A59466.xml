            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HENRY Lord OGLE, SON to his GRACE <hi>HENRY</hi> Duke of <hi>NEWCASTLE,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE great Obligations I received from my most Noble Patron, your illustrious Grandfather, and the favours conferred upon me by your Excellent Father (amongst which, I can think none greater than his recommending me to your Lordships Kindness and Protection) have engaged me to make this acknowledgment of my Duty to your Lordship; and to beg that you will own me, and defend this Comedy. I hope I shall, hereafter, be able to present you with something more worthy your Acceptance; but let this suffice to give you a title to me, and all my endeavors, which, as often as I can, shall be employ'd to serve you.</p>
            <p>Had you not been obliged by the commands of your Father to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and protect me; yet, from you I should have hop'd to have found Patronage; for the great Love which you have for Arts and Sciences, which would have made you cherish my endeavors towards them: By this inclination you give us early proofs of your inheriting the Vertues of your Ancestors, as you are like to do their Fortunes; which with the great accession by your Match with the Noble and Renowned Family of the <hi>Piercies,</hi> will make your Lordship the greatest Subject of <hi>England.</hi> And, by your early Vertues, you give all, that know you, hopes that you will be able to maintain that Character, by all the qualities that become a great Man: And, from the two Noble Stocks of <hi>Cavendish</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi> Posteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>My Lord, it has been the custom of Dedicators of late to make the Praises they give to their Patrons so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extravagant, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Abuses, and therefore I am loath to say what I think: only one virtue of your Lordships I am too much pleas'd with not to mention; which is, that in this Age, when Learning is grown contemptible to those who ought most to advance it, and <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Sence is despised, and <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Nonsence applauded, when the ancient Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> who not long since were famous for their Learning, have now sent into the World a certain kind of spurious brood of illiterate and degenerous Youth, your Lordship dares love Books, and labour to have Learning. And may your Lordship go on in this virtuous race you have begun, that so you may be a Protection to your Servants, a Consolation to your Friends, and an Honour to your Countrey; which is the hearty Wish of</p>

                  <p>It is beyond the sence of Fops; a Fool has not wit enough to be pleas'd, he but seems merry, when he's sad at heart.

               <l>WHo dares deny the Poet his applause</l>
               <l>When I am Champion, and assert his cause?</l>
               <l>Let him be Bully, ne'r so stout and tall,</l>
               <l>'Sdeath I'll not fear the briskest of ye all:</l>
               <l>No, though ye Rant and Roar, and sometimes Fight,</l>
               <l>I've that which never fails to do me right.</l>
               <l>Your would-be Wits love what is slight and bright</l>
               <l>In Tinsel-wit, just like their own delight,</l>
               <l>And Plays like Birth-day Suits, made for a Night,</l>
               <l>These are o'rejoy'd to have a jest at hand</l>
               <l>That costs but little Wit to understand.</l>
               <l>Good sence, like solid Meat to sickly Men,</l>
               <l>As soon as swallowed, is thrown up agen;</l>
               <l>And for strong Meats, but few of ye are fit,</l>
               <l>Who to meet Wit, should come with equal Wit,</l>
               <l>And faith of late, that's but thin sown i'th' Pit.</l>
               <l>He found by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s last, you would not like what's good,</l>
               <l>Though it was praised by all that understood.</l>
               <l>Remembring how you used that last he writ,</l>
               <l>He made this Low, so to your Level sit;</l>
               <l>Plenty of Noise, and scarcity of Wit—</l>
               <l>The Devil's in you all, if this don't hit:</l>
               <l>Yet after all, if any one there be</l>
               <l>So careless of his Life to anger me,</l>
               <l>In daring to dispraise the Play, or Action,</l>
               <l>There take my Glove, for I ll have Satisfaction.</l>
