            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>First therfore, our religion teachethe actuall restitution of all goods vvhat so euer, ether <note place="margin">1.

And it teachethe this restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in suche seuere manner, as no priest may absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue anie man from his sinnes duringe his lyfe, nor admitt him to any Sacrament, no nor at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pointe of deathe it selfe, (vvhere not vvithstandinge all other matters are released) except he be content to make actuall restitution (accordinge to his abilitie) to the partie iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed: nether can anye mortall povver, or prelate of the Churche, dispense in this point, vvhere the vvill of restitution is not, but that suche a one dyinge, is accounted a reprobate and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned person, and not to be praied for by our Churche, of vvhiche thinge doe ensevv tvvo greate commodities to the common vvealth. <note place="margin">Tvvo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First that men knovvinge they must make this restitution againe, if euer they be able, are muche staied from extortion, thefte, bryberye, vserye, Simonie and the like offences, vvhiche temporall lavves of them selues can neuer tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovvghlie bridle.

            <p>But for the protestant, he troubleth hym selfe litle aboute this matter, nether hathe he

any meanes in deed to do the same (confession beinge taken avvaie) and the practise is so stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge amongest them, as you shall reade in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye folovvinge, a good man punished fovver ye res in the Tovver of London, for restoringe of tvventie povvndes for an other man after his deathe.</p>
            <p>Secondlie our religion teacheth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <note place="margin">2.

               <note place="margin">Psal. 75.</note> vovv and paye your vovves to God. Of vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiche our churche inferrethe, that seinge our promisse to our neighboure, is also a kinde of vovv, vve are bounde in like sorte to keepe that for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science sake: muche more then if vve stoode bounde to the same by obligation, and to make devve recompence and restitution, if vve breake the same. VVherof ensued suche <note place="margin">The conse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quent of keepinge and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of vovves.</note> faithfull and trustie dealinges amongest our auncient forefathers.

            <p>Thyrdlye our religion vse the abstinence of <note place="margin">4 Abstinen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce from fle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>she.</note> fleshe and some other meates at certayne times and dayes, not condemninge the creatures, but forbearinge the vse ther of, for punishinge our bodies for more feruent seruinge of God, at certaine tymes more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other: as i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lent, frydaies,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18081:8"/>
Saterdayes, and other, as is appointed by our churche, vvhiche daies beinge in number very neere 160. that is, almost the one halfe of the ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, besides the obseruances of religious people, vvherof many neuer eate fleshe at all, and besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the particuler deuotions of infinite priuate perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vvhiche abstaine at certaine other times: doe brynge an inestimable commoditie vnto a vvealepublique. For that fishe, herbes, frute, and <note place="margin">The publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie by ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh.</note> the like, vvhiche Catholiques vppon these daies do vse, do not any vvaye impouerishe the lande, beinge taken the most parte from the vvater: But consuminge of fleshe dothe, beinge vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye fed vppon the grounde, vvhiche fleshe, by thes daies of abstinence encreasethe greatlie, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie aboute the springe tyme, vvhen our lent fallethe out, at vvhat time, by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of skilfull men the forbearinge of fleshe for tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se onlie six vveekes, is sufficient for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of all the yere after. And vvhat auaile this abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce bringethe to a kingdome in one yere, it maie be gessed, if a man make but an estimate vvhat the fleshe is vvorthe, vvhiche vvoulde maintaine all Englande one daie, and then dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the same eight score times in euerve yere, and consider vvhat it vvill amounte to in fevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeres.</p>
            <p>And novv, albeit the protestant (for polycies sake onlie as he saithe) vvill seeme to commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the like abstinence at some of thes daies: yet seynge it is but an externall punishment onlie, and no matter of conscience to breake the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lavve therin, as they affirme: hovve manye (trovv you) vvill breake the same? or hovv ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18081:8"/>
protestantes them selues do obserue it? if you conuerse vvithe the preachers, you shall see them eate fleshe euerie daie, and inuite other men to do it, and iudge verie yuill of them, that vvyll not therin beare them companye. The temporall iudges also, vvhen in their lent circuite, thei pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe this verie proclamation of abstinence, do eate openlye fleshe them selues. Hovv then shall the people obserue the same, vvhen they see bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the their Ecclesiasticall and temporall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to do the contrarye? the trueth is, that the exacte obseruinge of this lavv amongest higher estates, is onlie in Catholiques, as also amongest the common people, except some poore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant that can get no fleshe, and therby is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned to make of necessitie a vertue, for other vvise he vvill eate it euen in despite of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. So that this commonvvealthe point depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onlye in deed of the Catholique parte. Fovverthlye our religion, besides this absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <note place="margin">4 Fastinge.</note> aforesaide from fleshe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundethe also<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many of the same dayes to be kept in fast, to the number at least of a hundred euery yere in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande. In vvhiche tymes there is but one meale to be made a daye, and the other to be spared, vvhiche one meale sauede beinge valued, but at alovv price thorough ovvt all the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s aboue <note place="margin">The sequel of fastinge.</note> xvi yeres of age in Englande, (for after that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me they are bounde to fast), amountethe to a greate summe of monye, and beinge doubled a hundred tymes euerie yere, arysethe to muche more, vvhiche greate summe is vtterlye lost by the protestant that faste the not, and ys saued by the Catholique to the vvealpublique. VVhiche
<pb facs="tcp:18081:9"/>
difference albeit it be not felt presentlye in a greate state (for greate palaces shrincke not at the beginnynge vvithe litle chvnkes:) yet in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it vvill shevv his effecte, vvhen greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people shalbe by the same meanes of protestancie increased (as shalbe shevved in the next reason folovvynge) &amp; the olde prouision of the lande by litle &amp; litle consumed, as alredie I thincke in parte vve see it fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Fifthlye our religion commaundethe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie and sole lyfe to all cleargie men, and to <note place="margin">5. Sole lyfe of cleargye men.</note> all sortes of religious people, vvhiche (to omite all other respectes) profitethe greatlie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealthe, and the libertie of marriage gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the protestante, bringeth infinite incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. For first if vve make an estimate of the number vvhiche lyued vnmarryed in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique tymes in England, allovvinge to euery parishe churche but tvvo pryestes one vvithe an other, vvithe other temporall offices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendinge of the spiritualtie, and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiringe sole life: &amp; if vve add to this, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te numbers of all religious people, bothe men and vvomen in monasteries and other vvhere, vvhiche perhaps vvere tvvise as manye as the other: vve shall finde the number to arise verie greate. vvhiche all lyuinge then vnmaried and chast (or els shoulde haue donne) if vve novv allovv them to marye and accounte to euerye coople, but three or fovver children, and so consequentlye to their children, and childrens children? vve shall see that the encrease of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vvilbe huge in one age: and much more in manye ages follovvinge, vvhiche all beinge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished

by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvealthe, must needes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster greatlie the lande, vvithe mayne multitude of people, and they, for the most parte ydle also (for so are clergie mens children commonlye) and consequentlye, muche empouerishe the same:</p>
            <p>Besides this, if vve consider the necessitie of temporall prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cast vppon clergye men, by their mariage, as to prouide first for the present needes, and then for the tyme to come: as ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dovvrye, or some portion for the vvife, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges for the children, and the like: vve shall finde that they can nether keepe that hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for the poore, vvhiche vvas vvont, nor spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the leases, copieholdes, and other offalles of Ecclesiasticall lyuinges, to helpe other men, as in times past vvas accustomed: and muche lesse builde Colledges, Churches, and other suche monumentes of pietie, vvhiche their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours haue donne. Nay if the minister dye not, and leaue often a packe of orphanes vppon the poore parishe, it is more tollerable. So that vve see, that the mariage of the clergie men, dyuers vvayes spoileth the poore commonaltie and consequentlye impayrethe greatlye the vvealpublique.</p>
            <p>Sixthlye our religion prohibiteth landlor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to rayse their rentes, or anye other vvaie to <note place="margin">6 Raysinge of rentes.</note> presse their tenantes, except it vvere vppon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me greate cause and vvithe greate moderation, knovven and allovved of by spirituall men &amp; learned diuines, and if they do it rashelie and immoderatlie, our Churche dothe solemly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce a yere accurse them. VVhiche vvas the cause

that our good forefathers in tymes past, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie <note place="margin">In the bulle de caena do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mini, solem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye recited by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe euerye yere on ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Seuenthlye our religion holdeth tovvchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the state of mariage, that vvho so euer is on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce lavvfullye contracted in vvedlocke to an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other, albeit they maie be vppon cause deuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from compaininge one vvithe an other: yet can the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of mariage neuer be so broken, as either partye maie marye againe, duringe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers naturall lyfe. And therfore they must ether reconcyle them selues together againe, or els lyue chast. VVhiche is a brydell to manye mischeefes that must nedes ensevv vppon our aduersaries contrarie doctrine and practise in this matter, vvho allovve the diuorced to marye againe, the other partie yet lyuinge. VVhiche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie layed open to maryed people, geuethe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of easie mislyke and diuorce betvvixt them, vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hope to marye agayne vvhere they like better, to the greate disturbance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealthes in processe of tyme.</p>
            <p>Eightlie, our religion teachethe a pointe <note place="margin">8 Of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to magistrates</note> abovvt magistrates, vvhich greatlie concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the common vvealthe, and the contrarye doctrine of our aduersaries, is very muche hurt full and daungeruose vnto the same.

In this pointe ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, Catholique religion more vpholdethe the vvealepublique, then that of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>Ninthlye it is of no small importance vnto a Christian common vvealthe, (vvhose end is <note place="margin">Of synne &amp; concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.</note> to keepe men vvithin the limites of vertue and honestie) that vvhiche our religion teachethe of the difference of synnes, and of the nature of concupiscence. For tovv chinge the first, as vve holde, that as some synnes are greeuons and mortall: so some are lighter, called veniall, that is, suche as of their nature and by rigour of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, deserue not eternall damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and expell <note place="margin">Iaco. 1. 15.</note> not alvvaye grace, but may stande vvithe the same.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not.</p>
            <p>Our aduersaries holde that all synnes, be they neuer so litle, are mortall of their ovvne <note place="margin">Caluin. in antid. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Tri.</note> natures, and of them selues do deserue damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondlye tovv chinge concupiscence, vve holde, that in the regenerate, that is, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians after baptisme, the naturall inclination of lustinge, lefte in man, <hi>ad agonem,</hi> as the auncient fathers doe terme it, that is, to stryue vvithall, is <note place="margin">Augu. li. 2. cont.

Our aduersaries holde that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18081:11"/>
verye motion it selffe though no consent be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto it, is syn.</p>
            <p>Of this diuersitie of doctrine flovvethe greate diuersitie of effectes into the common vvealthe. For ovvt of our doctrine ensuethe this, that seinge the naturall motion of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence in me to euill, is not syn, except I yealde vnto it: I vvill striue against it, and not yelde consent, for sauinge of my soule. Againe, seinge there is a difference of synne, yf I should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried avvaye a litle further then I ought: yet vvill I at least, striue to refrayne mortall syn vvithe all diligence, consideringe that this synne, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth damnation.</p>
            <p>But out of our aduersaries contrarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne, ensevveth in contraryvvise, that seinge concupiscence mouethe one vvhether he vvill or no, to matters vnlavvfull, as to adulterie, theft, murther, and the like: and seinge vvhether he consent or no, he hathe alredye synned by the verye naturall motion: againe, seinge all sinnes are mortall and none veniall: vvhat shall let him to consent to the motion, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe the same, at least in desire, seinge he can but syn mortallie, if he doe it, and so hathe he don alredye by the verie motion it selfe, vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is not in his povver to staye. And by this meanes, seinge he must needes syn mortally vvhether he consent or not consent to the syn: vvho vvill not rather consent to the lust, vvithe pleasure, then stryue against the same vvithe greate payne, and yet to sinne neuer the lesse. And so this openethe an infinite gapp to syn &amp; all levvd lyfe: for that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvill stryue aboute
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18081:12"/>
that vvhiche he can not auoide, that is, abovve the resistance of mortall synne.</p>
            <p>Tenthlie tovvchinge the revvarde of euill <note place="margin">10. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard of good, and euill and paynes for synne in this lyfe.</note> and good lyfe in the next vvorlde, and tovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge expiation of syn in this lyfe, our religion teacheth, that a mortall syn, beinge once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after baptisme, is not so soone dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched agayne, but besides faithe, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red first, hartie sorovv vvithe full purpose neuer to commit the same againe. Then humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">Contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of the same to the priest. Thirdlye, after the guylie of the synne remitted by the vertue <note place="margin">Confession</note> of Christes passion in the Sacrament of absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is required some temporall punissh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and penance, for satisfaction of gods iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: the vvhiche if a man fulfill not in this lyfe, he must paye it in the next vvith muche more payne.</p>
            <p>After this, vvhen he commethe to heauen, <note place="margin">Purgatorie</note> vve holde, that he shall receaue his degree of glorye accordinge to his perfection of life in this vvorlde, as also accordinge to his demerite and measure of vvickednes, he shall receaue the quantitie of his tormentes in hell, if he go thither. VVherof follovvethe bothe feare to commit syn, seinge a man must take suche paynes for the release of the same in this vvorlde: as also diligence in all the three vvorkes satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, to vvitt, prayers, almes, and affliction of our ovvne bodies, for preuentinge the paynes of purgatorie. Also zeale of perfection in good men, seinge their degree in glorye shalbe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to their life heere. And finallye, some staye from ovvtrage in vvicked men, consideringe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18081:12"/>
that their tormentes in hell shalbe but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the measure of their vvickednes.</p>
            <p>But our aduersaries teachinge first, that there is no more payne to be taken for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of synne committed after baptisme, but onlie to beleeue, vvhich is a verie easie poynte, especiallie to euerie man that vvill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvade him selfe that he beleeuethe vvell: also teachinge that there is no place of purgation in the next lyfe, and that no vvorkes of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are heere needfull on our behalfe: thirdly teachinge, that all glorye is equall to all that are there, and all paine in hell as muche to the least offender as to the greatest: must needes open a gapp to an infinite sea of vvickednes, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousenes in the common vvealthe. For euerye man persvvadinge him selfe, that hovv euill so euer he liue, yet if he holde a faithe in Christ, and beleeue he shall most certainelie be faued: that he, vvithout all paines ether in this life or in the life to come, shall presentlye goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and there be in as greate glorye as Peter &amp; Paule and other Sainctes, vvhiche led the strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test lyfe in this vvorlde. vvho vvill not let stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the painefull life of vertue, and take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, vvhiche naturall concupiscence inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh hym vnto, consideringe that he maie be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as vvell vvithe them as vvithout? Againe vvhoe vvil spare (beinge once ouer the shoes) to runne in to any extremitie vvhat soeuer of vvickednes, vvhen he thinkethe that if he be damned, he must haue equall punishment vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the vvoorst?</p>
            <p>Eleuenthlie as thes opinions of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18081:13"/>
are greate fovvntaines in deede to all kinde of libertie and loose behauiour, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe <note place="margin">11: VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.

For vvheras vve teache that albeit, all sainctes of God be predestinate before the vvoorldes vvere layed: yet that extinguishethe not the libertie of mans freevvill, but that he maie (beinge preuented and assisted by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce <note place="margin">Eccl. 15:</note> of god) doe anie good vvoorkes or refuse <note place="margin">Luc: 13.</note> them at his pleasure. VVhiche good vvoorkes <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> beinge don for the loue of god, by a man that is in the state of grace, haue their revvarde and merit, euen to the least cuppe of vvater that a man can geeue, vvhiche is a greate pricke to <note place="margin">Math. 5. &amp; 10. &amp; 12.</note> incite men to the same, vsed by the holye Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures them selues. <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But our aduersaries teachinge first that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hathe no free vvill to thes thinges, and secondlie that if he doe them he shall haue no revvarde for them in heauen: mustes needes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie discourage all men from the doinge of good vvoorckes. For vvhoe vvill studie aboute a thinge that is nether in his povver, nor yet necessarie or profitable vnto him: especiallye vvhen the thinge is bothe harde of it selfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant, and muche repugninge to our sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie? vvho vvill geeue his goodes to the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re? his landes from his ovvne kinred, to builde hospitals and colledges for straungers? vvhoe

vvill afflict his bodie vvithe fastinge and praier, vvhen he knovveth that he shall recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no revvarde therfore in heauen? and that vvithout doinge the same he maye be saued by onlye faithe?</p>
            <p>Tvvelfthlie and lastlie (for I vvill tovvche no more,) our Catholique religion teacheth <note place="margin">12. Priuate confession.</note> priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our sinnes vnto the pryest vvhich thinge is the verie hedge and vvall of all vertuous life, and the cheefest brydle of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnes in a common vvealthe. For by this, infinite enormities are redressed, vvhiche by publique lavves can not be remedied. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">Vtilities of confession:</note> manye seruantes are made trustie to their masters, vviche before vvere false, and they are caused to make priuie restitution of manie thinges, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their masters thynke not of it. Manye greate breaches betvvixt frindes, as vvife and husbande, father and sonne, and the like, are salued. Manye greate mischifes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ether against the magistrate, priuate perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or the common vvealthe, are staied. Many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvde harte plucked dovvne and abated vvithe the exaggarations of his synnes to his face, by his ghostlye father. Many greatte synners bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught to hartie repentance, and full purpose of amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and to promise also, and sometimes and in some cases to svveare, neuer to commit vvittinglye and vvillninglye the like enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities againe. Many afflicted persons comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvithe particuler helpes for their greefes: manye desperate folckes mollified, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the vvayes of a nevv life. Manye Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lordes and superiours, brought to deale more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18081:14"/>
mildly vvithe their subiectes, and manye subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, to behaue them selues more obedientlie and devvtifullie tovvards their superiours: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny restitutions made, many vvronges recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, many quarels ended: finallie, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to number vpp the infinite and singuler greate commodities vvhiche doe come to mans life, and consequentlye to the common vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, by this spirituall courte &amp; tribunall of God in earthe, that is, by confession.</p>
            <p>The vvhiche beinge taken avvaye, as it is novv by our aduersaries in Englande, (albeit Lutherans in Germanie yet vse it,) there must needes follovve in successe of tyme, intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inconueniences. For vvhat vvaye is there novv to deale vvithe the conscience of a childe if he be disobedient to his parentes? Or vvithe a seruant, if he be false or prodigall to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? if you accuse him, he vvill denye it: if you vrge him, he vvill fall out vvithe you for it: but if him selfe shoulde confesse it to you, as he vvas vvonte to doe to his ghostlie father, askin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge absolution at his handes, and pardon at Gods for the same: there is offered bothe fitt place &amp; occasion, to entreate vvithe him for it: and he in disposition to heare good councell.</p>
            <p>So if a prince or greate personage, abuse him selffe in life, vvho vvill dare to tell him uerye fault in particuler, or rebuke him for the same? If a man (for examples sake) doe exceede in apparell, or other vanitie, vvho vvill goe and reprehende him for it, or vvithe vvhat hope of amendment? To conclude, this holye exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of confession beinge taken avvaie, the verye

            <p>VVherfore seinge a man may not alvvayes depende safelye of the seculer magistrate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor make repose of his sovvle, vppon the fovvndation of a temporall lavv: vve are in iustice to craue pardon of your honours, for not conforminge our opinions to yours in this matter: vve can not doe it vvithout dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and most greeuouse remorse of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusinge conscience.

            <p>Our desyre vve haue to be rightlye infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, may appeare, not only by our often and earnest petitions of lavvfull tryall in poyntes of controuersie: but also by this, that vve require not anye longe or tediouse satisfaction in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but onlye a demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stration of one necessarye pointe, vvherof our resolution in other thinges vvoolde soone ensevve.</p>
            <p>And this pointe is, that seinge the religion of Christ and his Apostles, vvas (by all partyes confession) the verie trevv religion for vvhich vve stryue, and vvherby vve must be saued, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18081:17"/>
so for a hundred or tvvo hundred yeres after, vvithout contradiction of either partie, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vvas pure vvhich vvas deliuered by the Christian churche ouer all the vvolde: lett de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration be made, vvhich of our religions beganne sence that tyme (for that must needes be false, hauinge not his beginninge from Christ and his Apostles,) and this maie be don (as it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vs) bothe easely, apparentlye, and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye in this manner.</p>
            <p>VVhen anie religion is once publiquelye planted and receaued, as the trevv religion vvas by our aduersaries confession, in the first tvvo <note place="margin">An easye, short, and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie offered of tryall:</note> or three hundred yeres after Christ: it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to bringe in a nevv religion contrary to that, or any articles of faithe repugnant to these before, vvithout some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction or resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them that then lyued, possessed in the former religion.

This (I saye) is impossible in common reason. For if one citie vvould receaue it, yet an other vvould not: if one countrye or kyngdome vvould allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve it, yet an other vvoulde make resistance, at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>least vvise for a tyme. And if no Citie nor coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trye nor kyngdome had controlled it, yet some good man or other vvould haue donne it in the vvorlde abrode. Secondlye the same appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe <note place="margin">experience</note>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:18081:17"/>
by experience, for that there vvas neuer yet heresie or error that rose against any one clause or iote of the truethe before receaued, but it vvas controlled presently and resisted by voices and vvritinges of infinite men. And in Englande beinge but a litle corner in respect of the vvhole vvorlde there coulde neuer yet appeare anye one opinion contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine before receaued, but it vvas straight vvaie noted and rebuked: as the religion of Cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uine, by the Catholiques before in possession: after that, the fansie of the puritane by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant: after that, the deuise of the familie of loue, by bothe protestant and puritane: and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally there vvas neuer yet heresye offered to the church, or to any peece of the same, but that it vvas straight vvaie knovven, vvhoe vvere the beginners therof, at vvhat tyme, vvhat multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de first left the former religion and followed the same, vvhoe resisted, vvhoe spake and vvro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te against it, and the like: and this is a trevvth more cleare than the Sonne it selfe.</p>
            <p>This then beinge so, the issevv vvhiche vve <note place="margin">A verye reasonable issue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> desyre to ioyne, is euident and plaine: to vvitt that of these articles vvherin vve dissent from them and vvhiche they call heresyes, as inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vs sence the Apostles tyme: as the reall presence, the sacrifice of the masse, purgatorye, prayer for the dead, intercession of sayntes, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt of good vvoorckes, grace inherent, fyue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes denyed by them, and the like: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shevve by anie one father, historiographer, or other aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticall testimonie, vvhen any of these pointes vvere brought first into the churche
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18081:18"/>
and resisted by them that then lyued, (as they must needes be if they vvere contrary to the vniuersall doctrine then receaued in christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) and vve remayne satisfied vvithout any furder particuler tryall.</p>
            <p>This is a most reasonable demaunde, so one aunsvvered if the trevvth be vvith our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. For vve take vppon vs to shevv all thes particulers before recited in euery pointe of doctrine vvherin they dissent from vs: that is, vvhen it began to be first knovve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church by vvhat man, vvho first controlled it, and the like: but let them doe the same by vs, and the matter is ended.</p>
            <p>But if they can finde no one booke extant in the vvorlde against anie article of our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce from them, at the first commynge of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me into the church, nor can finde recorde of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye man that ether reprehended or controlled it vvhen it vvas first inuented (as they saye) by our forefathers, but that it vvas receaued vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the silence and approbation, not onlye in one countrye, but thoroughovvt the vvorlde, not in one pointe, but in many, and they most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: as for example, the fayninge of fyue sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes together, (although vve holde in our doctrine that none but Christ can institute a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, no not the vvhole churche together, nor all the Apostles vvhen they vvere alyue), if (I saie) they can finde no recorde at all, that any man resisted or controlled thes horrible &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous poyntes at their first entringe into the churche, (if it be trevv that they entred in since the Apostles tyme) then must thei thincke that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18081:18"/>
men vvere senseles and madd at that time, that vvoolde suffer so manye, so grosse, &amp; so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant heresies, to passe vnchecked, and neuer to open their mouthes against them, vvheras at the verye same tyme, (that is, vvithin the first fyue hundred yeres after Christ, vvherin our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries graunte thes heresies to haue bene crept in to the churche) the fathers and doctors that then lyued, vvrote most diligentlye against eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other litle error that appeared. But novv vvhether it be reasonable to thinke so of those holye learned and vigilant men or els to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke our aduersaries some vvhat shameles, in char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginge them vvithe suche absurdities, I leaue to the indifferent reader to consider.</p>
            <p>And thus muche haue I bene bolde to laye dovvne to your vvisedomes, right honorable, both for the innocencie of our cause, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our demaunde, the reason of our offer, and the easie meanes of our satisfaction, if our aduersaries vvoolde agree to the same. VVhich all tendeth onlye to this end (as your honours right vvell can discerne) to mitigate the greate offence conceaued against vs, and consequentlie some parte of that extreame rigour vsed tovvar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des vs and our cause of later dayes, vvhich bein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge such, as in verie deed is intollerable: vve are constrained to make recourse to your honours to vvhome of devv our protection appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and to doe, as a certaine afflicted man did vvith an Emperour in times past, that is, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from your selues vnto your selues: from your selues, as offended by the instigation of our aduersaries: vnto your selues, mollified

vvith our iust defence and innocencie in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes obiected.</p>
            <p>If by the rackinges, stretchinges, vvrestin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and dreadfull tortures, vsed so often and to so many of our innocent afflicted brethren, and that in so rigourous &amp; mercilesse manner, there hath bene any one thinge vvrounge out from them, of treason, conspiracie, or practises against the state, vvhervvith our aduersaries, vvithout conscience, do vse dailye to accuse vs in their bookes and sermons, therby to sturre her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and your honours against vs: lett the partie guyltie be punished openly, vvith infamie also to our vvhole cause, albeit in this later, vve offer more than reason. But if after all this adoe, after all this fierse halinge, and pitifull pullinge of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in peeces, nothinge hath bene founde at all, no one act, no vvorde, no cogitation of suche matters, but onlye innocencie and Zeale of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the tormented: then is our case muche more hard at home, in our ovvne countrye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ovvne Soueraigne, than it could be any vvhere els vnder the extremest aduersaries of our religion in the vvorlde.</p>
            <p>For I knovv your honours can not but consider, that the greatest enimyes of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie this daie liuinge, as those of the secte of Mahomet, and many ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tles besydes, ar so far of, from tormentynge Catholiques, as they permit vnto them the libertie and exercise of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in respect of the antiquitie and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance therof. For vvhich cause also, the most of Christian princes, do tollerate vvithe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie levves: and suche as possesse the Indes and

other places, vvhere gentiles inhabite, neuer vse to moleste, and muche lesse to torment them for their consciences, vvheri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vvere borne and bredd vp: for that, faithe beinge the guifte of God, and comminge by hearinge (as the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note place="margin">Rom. 12:</note> saiethe) is not to be put in by tormentes &amp; persecution. <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Pitifull then and compassionable is our case (right honorable): if, of all other men, vve fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de lesse rest and most extremitie, and that also there, and from those, vvhere, and from vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, manie greate considerations shoulde yealde vs hope of fauoure and mercie.

            <p>Alas (my Lordes) vvhat impelleth your vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes (for of nature I can not thinckc you so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fiers &amp; pityles) to exercise suche extremitie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon poore people for that cause, vvherof your ovvne fathers vvere as guyltie as vve are, that is, for our conscience in the auncient religion? If you meane to vvi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therby to your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is the cleane contrarie course, as I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved.

I am sure it dothe greatlie increase it.</p>
            <p>Your honours haue procured libertie of conscience for those of your religion in some other countries, vvhich must proceede (as vve interpret from a mercifull disposition tovvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the afflicted, and that mens consciences are not to be constrained.</p>
            <p>VVe beseeche your Lordships then, that vve your poore afflicted subiectes, maye tast some parte of that your honorable disposition, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof straungers doe receaue so greate releefe and comforte.</p>

            <p>Remember (right honorable), that hovv different so euer our degrees be in this vvorlde, yet must vve all be equall before the common iudge, at the later daie, and all those afflicted persons, these torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, these imprisoned, these

And first of all that the matter may <note place="margin">The lavves of England against Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholiques.</note> the better be vnderstoode, and you the easier coniect of the trueth of that I saye, it semeth to me no euill methode, to laye downe first, the publique lawes which England (borne, &amp; instructed by Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, in Christianitie,) hath now for their Christian faithe, set furthe againste Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques. For by thes lawes may be ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued what Catholiques are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto, in respect of the power, malice, &amp; iniquitie of priuate aduersaries when they list, seinge that publique lawes do yelde so muche authoritie, to euerye ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almoste, that woold seeke a cauill or sclaunder against them.</p>
            <p>To beginne therfore with thes lawes, it is first to be knowen that there are two kinde of lawes at dyuers times set furth in dissauoure and punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique <note place="margin">Tvvo kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of lavves.</note> religion.

            <p>Amongest the penall lawes I will <note place="margin">Penall lavves.</note> put that as first, which was made amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the last, for the punishement of those whiche for conscience sake refuse to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to the protestants churches.

And yet verylie I doe not thinke, that anie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can haue so hard and yroned a harte (onlesse he haue lost bothe feelinge of hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manitie and faithe) but might be moued to compassion with theyse extremities, which oure poore Catholiques doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. <note place="margin">The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques doe stand in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note>

            <p>But now I omit to speake of the other outrages, whiche in this Tower of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don are perpetrated, and patientlie endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <note place="margin">The straite vvarde &amp; euell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques in the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver.</note> For thoughe they be manie and verie greuous: yet can they not easilie come to oure knowleige, by reason of that close and straite warde, wherein the sound of all speche, and mourninge of the afflicted is shutt vpp frome the eares of them that are abroade. Nay, oure aduersaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe no small diligence in this point: that the aflictions and torments whiche are there practised withein doores, be not browght to the knowleige of them that are witheoute: but buried rather in darknesse, and cleane hyd in blynde and obscure dungeons.

Yet at lengthe the truthe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to light, when maister Campian him selfe dyd vtter it in an open audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, &amp; in the hearinge of oure aduersaries: twit, (say de they) yt was a mery pastime: he was cramped or pulled a lytle, not in ernest, but in ieaste. After the same maner they Ieasted of others, whiche had bene racked before. So greate delite these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie conceited felowes doe take, in makin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge skosses and sports of the afflictions of forie poore men. <note place="margin">Oure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer saries accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to lie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But they haue yet an other stratage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or politike shyst, familiarlie acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this tower: that is, to surmise and forge what they lust of the prisonner, &amp; to publishe it to his shame, and for a trapp to beguile other Catholiques. The thing is euident, and hathe plenty of examples: but because I purpose to be breefe, I will touche but a few.</p>
            <p>VVhen maister Campian had bene afflicted wyth torments: it was reported that he had confessed what soeuer they had demaunded of him: specialie at who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se howses, &amp; in what places he had bene. And (to geue to the lie his right shape and perfection) it was further bruted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18081:45"/>
that he had promised a recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of I know not what. But that tale no man thowght to be probable: yet there were that doubted thereof, because the aduersaries had so earnestlye affirmed it. For many gentlemen, and some of the nobilitie were called vp to London, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me their owne howses, and charged with a supposed confession of maister Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And yet in verie truthe (as afterward it well appeared) he neuer yeelded one worde to his torments.</p>
            <p>A like shyft the lieutenant of the <note place="margin">In the guildhall at London</note> tower vsed, &amp; (of purpose to laye a bate to seduce others, by some example) affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med openlye at a common session, that there were no catholiks vnder his warde, whiche refused to goe to the churche of oure aduersaries: yet it was well knowen to all there, that euen they whome he ment of, went not willinglie to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, but vppon compulsion and drawne by violence had bene present at a few sermons, yet they allways openly spake against the same, called the preacher from his rayling speche, and chalenged hym to disputation, euen in the presence of the same lieutenant albeit angerlie he thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18081:46"/>
them often with heuy bolts &amp; shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. But it is harde by writing to discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se through all the particulers in euery kynde of affliction, whiche the prisoners in that tower doe endure: yet such as haue some tyme bene present vewers of the matter doe tell vs parte: vppon whose faithefull relation I will putt downe this one to geue a coniecture of the rest.</p>
            <p>Ther was a yonge man, of honest <note place="margin">Conper.</note> parentage, well entred in learninge for he had bene Scholar &amp; seruant to Doctor harpesfeild a verie lerned man, that dyed in pryson for christs cause. This yonge man, for religion and learning sake, had appointed a Iourney in to these parts: And being redie for it, made his repare to the hauen (with the wealthe that he had got together in money or other things) of purpose to passe ouer the sea. But by some chaunce the matter was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the yonge man was apprehended by an officer, and sent backe to London: where first he was spoiled of all his goods and caste in to the Tower of London: <note place="margin">Beaucha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p, tovver.</note> there he was verie straitelie kept in that part of the prison whiche, ys called Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheams Tower, destitute of all comforte

and consolation nedefull for man, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one sorie bedd, that his frindes sent, and yet hardlie coulde he be allowed to haue yt. VVithin a while after, this yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge man (beinge but of a weake comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and accustomed to open and cleare ayre) partlie throughe Hungar and colde, partlie through the filthie sauoure, and lothesomenesse of the place, and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the aire, dyd fall in to a sicknesse, and semed to be vexed with an ache, or giddinesse of his heade. The lieutenant <note place="margin">Nevv foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de phisick.</note> hearinge hereof, deuised a meruelouse straunge medicine for this disease. For he commaunded the bedd to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaye, that for the better recouerie of his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, he might lie vpon the bare floore. To be short: within fewe dayes the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyeth, sterued, wasted, &amp; pined awaie by extremitie of colde and Hungar: and thereof remained this euident testimonie and proofe, that when his clothes were to be taken of, that he might be buried: his flesh being putrified and rotten by cold, dyd sticke fast to his hose, and was with the hose pulled of from the bare bones, &amp; fell in gobbetts vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grownd: a pi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifull sight of a churlishe barbarousnesse
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18081:47"/>
and of an odd kynde of crueltie. Neuer thelesse there be men yet lyuinge whiche dyd see this with their eyes. And (were it not for their perill) I coulde name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>And because I am entred in to this kinde of talke: I will be some what more liberall than my promisse. And one other example I will laie downe, to let you see what good store I haue, yf I lyst to set it forthe to the showe.</p>
            <p>An other yong man not vnlike the <note place="margin">Shear vvoode. The ladie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tregonell.

This man dyd fume and freate in his mynde verie much for that he demed his mother had masse ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times in her house by this yong mans helpe and procurement. On a time therfore, as he by chaunce dyd mete the yong man in a strete in London: he crieth verie outragiouslie, O rebell and traiter: take holde on the traiter, for by this terme they name vs, to make vs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re odious: and with this kynde of moste vniust ignominie they vexe vs. The they of the citie hearing these woordes, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and rebell, leape forthe of their shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, laye hands on the man, and hale hym to the Iustices or commissioners. And at their next session when he came before them: the exclamer had nothing whereof to accuse the yong man, nothing where with to charge hym, saue onlie à bare su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of the Catholique religion: for he was not hable to conuince hym of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte. The commissioners not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge wolde not geue hym leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parte. For a presentment of religion is of all other moste adiouse. And yf the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter want sufficient matter: the present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is helped and set forwarde by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories and questions, to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered by the commissioners them selues.</p>
            <p>The Iustices therfore examine the yong man, what he dothe beleeue, or thinke touching the chefe points of faithe. And at last by way of argument they wreste oute, that he supposeth the byshopp of Rome ought to haue chefe authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall, yea, and in England allso. Vpon the hearing hereof: there fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a like sentence as was geuen in an other session of Iustices. <hi>VVhy require vve</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Then was he remoued ouer to the tower of London, &amp; there Layde vp in a priuye chamber neare to the place where the Ingines for torments do lie. In the meane season his chamber which he had in the citie, was ryfled and ransacked, and all his goods snatched vp, &amp; therewithall aboute thirtie pounds english more, (whiche he had taken vp of other men for debtes oweing to his moste miserablie afflicted father) were allso stolen &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away. VVell, the poore man in priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was sore afflicted with torments, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force hym to discouer the places where he had heard masse: for being but a laye man he coulde not hym selfe say masse. Then, after verie greuouse torments, which he endured with greate courage (for, so much an aduersarie that had bene there prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse:) he was throwen in to a verie obscure doungeon, that was bothe darke &amp; dredefull, withoute light, withoute bedding, withoute nedefull apparell. And of his dyet you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie coniecture, when he coulde not be allowed to haue anie peece or paringe of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18081:48"/>
his owne goods, no not for the necessarie sustentation of his owne lyfe: Nay, there is an other thing that doeth looth me to <note place="margin">M. vvillia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Roper.</note> tell. For when a certein deuoute and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable man being (vppon the common brute of this yong mans extreme calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) moued to compassion, had sent a Sum of money to be conueyed vnto this poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re man for his releefe, and by the mean of an other prisoner had deliuered the same to his vnder keper (for here eche priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hathe his vnder keper): the vnder ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per receiued the money, and brought it againe the next day to hym of whome he had yt, and tolde hym that the lieutenant of the tower wolde not suffer the poore man to enioy the benefit of that almes. And when the keper was verie earnestlie requested to take parte thereof &amp; besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we it in some thinge for the poore mans releefe he denyed to take yt, and sayd that he might not in anie wise take apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except it vvere six pence to bye hym stravve to lye vppon. So malitiouselie bent vvas that lieutenant against the selie poore man.</p>
            <p>In the ende after six moneths (as I thinke) vvere ouer passed in this moste
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18081:49"/>
greuouse kinde of Martirdome they draw hym forth along throughe the stretes on a hurdle, and hang hym vp a litle, let hym dovvne againe, and then as he is in reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, they afflict hym vvith the other kinde of tortures, vvhiche they vse to practise vppon suche as are traiters to the state, but in farre more terrible maner than they handle those traiters. For oure aduersaries are more rigourouse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholiques</note> mercylesse against vs, than they are againste anie sort of malefactors, howe vngratiouse naughtie so euer they be. For when these by order o flawe are to suffer the same kynde of deathe, they fynde suche fauoure, as either they are, by compassion and pitie of oure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, full deade before they be cut downe from the galowes: or in dede the execution is so handled according to the prescript rule of the lawe, as they are suffered to hang till they be halfe deade at the least, to dull the sense and felyng of payns in the torments foloweinge. But farre otherwise it is in the case of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. For they are no soner ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, than the hangman enforceth hym selfe in a furiouse maner of haste to cut the haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18081:49"/>
in sunder, &amp; whiles thei are yet aliue, and alyue lyke, yea and of perfect sense and felyng: he bringeth them to the other torments: and this oftentime he doeth so readilie, and with such dexteritie and nimblenesse: as not onlie their senses for moste parte are perfect, but they speake allso distinctlie and plainlie after their bowells be digged vp, yea and whiles the bouchars fyngars are scratchinge at their verie harts and intrailes.</p>
            <p>And yet this bloodie sight woorketh no compassion in the harts of oure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries: but they deride and skorne the sorie poore wights, yea and spitefullie raile against them, euen whiles they are yet in dyeing, and specially yf anie being ouercome with payne doe grone, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (whiche is verie rare) to make anie lamentable noyse. For thus a certein preacher of theirs (and not a mean one) in a printed booke doeth collect &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that oure verie Martyres, are not Martyres, because forsuthe (saith he) one <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> of them cried oute in his torments, and (that I may vse his owne woords) <hi>dyd yell and hovvle like a hell hovvnde.</hi> O good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sentence well besemyng suche a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.

            <p>A certein yong gentleman, of an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">M.

house, and kept hym selfe secret in London the yere last past. And there, by reason of his trauaile in flyeing awaye, and (as I think) through the intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, he fell in to a greuouse feuer. The aduersaries hearing hereof, doe runne vnto him by and by, and in all haste will nedes pull hym oute of the house, and throwe hym in to prison, euen as he then was, feble, faynt, and greuouslye si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cke. This semed to the beholders thereof to be a maner of dealing bothe churli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she &amp; detestable. They pray, they intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, they make intercession, they vse all the means they can, to moue the aduersarie to haue consideration of the sick, not to heape sorow vpon sorow, nor affliction vppon an extremely afflicted man, not to take away the lyfe of so comelie a yong gentleman: they proffer as sufficient assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for his forth coming, as his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries wolde demaund, and to vnder take for his appearance before the iustices immediatlie vpon the recouerie of his healthe: but it will not be accepted.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18081:51"/>
place in to the inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of a prison. All this is nothinge regarded: they layd hands on the sickeman, haled hym away, shut hym vp in priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; with in two days next after he dyed: they burie hym, and make no bones of the matter, nor scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or anie regarde at all.</p>

as euidentlie giltie of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme or Catholicque Religion, which they in contempt call papistrie. But this palsey sickeman appeared not. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he made his owne excuse verie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedlie by letters. Yet is it not accepted: for the superintendent hym selfe cometh with all spede to the diseased mans house, &amp; throwghlie veweth with his owne eyes the impotencie of the gentleman: but no motion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion entereth in to this snperintendents breeste: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth hym to be caried to the Iaile.

woman shortlye after (either vpon some greefe conceiued for this inhumane dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, or through terror of some further treacherie, or elles vpon some annoyance taken by the distemperature and lothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse of the place) is possessed with a verie greuouse sicknesse, and falleth into a manifest perill of her lyfe. And when yt <note place="margin">Greate in-humanitie</note> was looked for euerie houre that she wolde die: her sorowfull husbande made humble sute that she might be en larged alitle, &amp; remoued (yf it were but for one daye) forth of the prison, to some other place, where she might vse the helpe of skillfull women. But his sute wolde not be hearde. O harts of yron.</p>
            <p>I haue nowe bene long enoughe in prisons (my deare frinde Gerard,) &amp; my speche (perhaps) may seme to haue taried ouerlong in this kinde of discourse. But where (I pray you) shoulde I be with better will, than with oure owne fryndes? why do I saye oure owne fryndes? Nay rather with the moste deare fryndes of Christe oure God and Sauioure? for the lyfe of these fryndes is oure lyght: their constancie is oure example: theire forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is oure woorshipp and honoure: and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18081:53"/>
theire deathe is oure glorie. VVherfore, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that thoughe in bodye I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: yet in spirit I doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with them, &amp; they shall neuer slyppe oute of my mynde. For I preferre their bolts and shackles, I extoll their prisons, I exalte their reproches and contumelies farre aboue the riches, welthe, &amp; diademe of any Cresus, who so euer he be. Yet notwithstanding I wolde leaue these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiues for a time, and goe forthe to visit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are toiled &amp; turmoiled abroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, were it not that the fit occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this place admonisheth me (before I departe) to make mention of a certein bare shyft, or poore starting hole, whiche owre ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie (vpon the oportunite of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment) taketh hold of, and fortifieth: I meane that deceitfull pretence of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">A pretense to dispute.</note> whiche he wolde be thought to profer to captiues in prifon: but to suche as are at libertie he will not yelde the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, no not when he is requested, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called and chalenged there vnto: Nay, nor yelde therein to the selfe same captiues vpon any indifferent or reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or lawe.

aduersaries had expelled vs, before we were called to oure answere: and when thei were in full possession of oure rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes and habitations: then loe, (vpon a practise to geue a showe to the people, that they holde by Iustice that which they haue vsurped by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate, by way of writing, in the whole matter of controuersie.

            <p>Oure Catholiques moste willinglie take holde of the condition. Manie verie greate learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (though troubled with the discommodities of exile) dyd neuer thelesse write muche in the Englishe to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But when they on the other syde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them selues to be ouer reached by their owne cunnyng, &amp; in a maner beaten downe in this open co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate: then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised an other shyft, such a one in dede, as indesperate cases were necessarie, albeit no discrete nor skillfull meane for the safetie of their estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and credite.

And yf anie of these books happened to be found in a searche: it was (be ye assured) a matter sufficient for a greuouse presentment.

If one shoulde speake but a woorde in defense of such a booke: oh, that were a plain euidence, yea and a flat verdite of a traiterouse hart.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when oure men see them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues driuen in to these streicts and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they coulde not (withoute verie greate inconueniences and molestations) eyther write or speake in the defense of the cause of God, and of his churche vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall: what dyd they then think you? trulie (euen as it besemed good &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Christians to doe) as occasions of matters required, they submitted their bodies to prisons, their hands to giues &amp; manacles, their feete to bolts &amp; shackles, their goods to rauine and spoile, yea and their liues to perills of deathe. In the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18081:55"/>
meane season (leste they might seme to distrust their owne cause, and by sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to betray gods businesse) thei made a petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quietlie and calmelie, for to haue indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conferences with their aduersaries: and (with as muche submission &amp; earnest fute as might be) they humblie sued to euerie magistrate, that eyther publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, or at the least priuate confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Manie at home, and mani abrode dyd <note place="margin">The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sute of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques for libertie to dispute.</note> solicit this sute by way of petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: some applied it earnestlie by fauour of fryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: other pursued it by authoritie and credit as they might: and verie many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred yt by other wayes &amp; meanes. Oure men for theire parts (thoughe by the way of greate disaduauntages, yet leanyng to the woorde of the prince, and for truthe sake) offred them selues willinglie and gladlie to enter in to this combate, with this onlie hope and confidence, that they trusted, many sowles, which were rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the pretiouse bloode of oure sauiour Christe, &amp; now are defiledd with heresie, might with disceptation by gods

grace be recalled and recouered. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupon they gaue to the aduersaries the whole libertie and choyse, eyther to vse their owne homemates, or to call for others forthe of forraigne countries, for the defense of their cause: yea and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the day, to chose the place, to moue the question, to prescribe the order and forme, to beginne, to ende, and to doe all things after their owne will &amp; phantasie, so allwayes, and vpon such condition, as some lawe, rule, forme and order of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation might be obserued and kept. <note place="margin">Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts distrnst their ovv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne cause.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But (to make a short tale) the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie will none of these. For he did foresee (and not vnwiselye) that his partie wolde go to wracke, yf the matter were once to be tried by combate, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to hande in open fielde. And therfore he refused this open cooping at barriers in Scholes, as to lightsome a place for their dark dealings, and to famouse a triall of their deceit and guile, according to the sayeing of oure Saluioure: <hi>euerie one that doeth euill, hateth</hi>

               <hi>in god.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet in fine, two practises oure aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries (lest they might seme to doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing) dyd put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their more securitie and estimation sake. First, they sturre vp sharper persecution against all Catholiques, but speciallie against the more learned, and against suche as were thought able in this conflict to annoye them with reasonyng. Therfore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from london the Lorde bishopp of lincolne, &amp; the Lorde Abbot of west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, with others of sownd learning, profownd knowledge, verie muche gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, &amp; greate vertue, not a fewe. All these <note place="margin">The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell of vvisbiche.</note> they cast into an vplandisne dongeon, spoile them cleane of all their bookes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre them from all intercourse of talke and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference one with an other, (except at meale time) and shutt them vp close &amp; seuerallie in darke corners. And yf anie besydes of name and accompt were left oute, them allso they call vnto these Iron grates of prisons, that this waye, at the least, they may put all to silence.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, when they had contriued <note place="margin">The shift &amp; craft of ministers in their</note> all these things according to their owne desires: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they conuey them selues with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18081:56"/>
greate secrecie in to prisons. There they sett vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the captiue Catholiques sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">pretense to dispute.</note> ere they be aware, and call them in all haste to dispute of faithe, withoute anie time before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to thinke on the matter, or libertie to talke thereof among them selues, And leste they might help or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one an other, or testifie one for an other: they assaile them (for the moste parte) seuerallie, euery man alone by him selfe. And yfanie of oure partie dyd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect their vneauen dealing, or desire time to consider, bookes for studie, or speche with his companions for instruction, and other things requisite for his defense: and yf anie alleiged further (as some dyd) that there wanted an indifferente Iudge to geue the sentence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient auditorie to beare witnesse, and faithfull notaries to sett downe the arguments in writinge: then loe, oure aduersaries exclamed that we refuse the combate, that we stand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bare shyfts of woords, that we seke for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, and flye in to holes and corners: In so muche as manie on oure syde moued with the importunate clamoure of these felowes dyd yelde them selues to all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conditions that were offred, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18081:57"/>
their on lie confidence in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their cause.</p>
            <p>But what so euer oure men alleiged, yt serued to small purpose there. For either dyd oure aduersaries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumeliou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie reiect it, or odiouslie drawe and wrest it to treason, or else moste vniustlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue, peruert, and misreporte yt to the people. And thereof I haue many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: but here a fewe maye suffise.</p>
            <p>First yt fell oute of late, that after the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of deathe was pronounced against <note place="margin">Diuerse examples of cauills &amp; vntrue surmise of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> Maister hanse (the good priest) for the Catholique faith, and he nowe in prison preparing hym selfe to die: there came vnto hym a certein minister vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure of frindeshipp, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce setled and framed to an hipocrisie of holynesse, but the yssewe of the matter proued hym to be full of bitter malice, and of euerye subtile shyft to deceiue the poore man. For in speche betwene them two, this minister, besides many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochefull woords, dyd charge that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of Christe with treason against the Quenes persone: where vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me martyr had made this answere, that he had neuer offended against the Quenes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18081:57"/>
Maiestie, that he had but onelie made a profession of the Catholike faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whiche cannot betraie nor hurt the Maiestie of anie humane creature, for so muche as aboue all other things it mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste pleaseth the Maiestie of God. VVhen good maister hanse (I say) had spoken these and other like woords: and said fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he moste willinglie wolde embra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se this deathe, sithe he was then cleare in his conscience, that he had neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted anie haynouse crime against her maiestie: but rather (according to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) hade commended her to God in his prayers: and that this crime of treason against her maiestie, imputed vnto hym, by his aduersaries, is in truthe neyther anie crime of treason at all, nor any synn in the sight of God: Loe this goodlie gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller (as one that had catched plenty of matter, wherevpon to forge a malitious surmise) passeth forth of the prison, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth abrood to the people &amp; publisheth in a libell writen and printed, that hanse affirmed no treason to be a sinne before God: Maister hanse hauinge intelligence hereof, complained of this iniurie open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the people when he was brought
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18081:58"/>
to the place of execution: and there he opened his meaning towchinge his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer woords, and besought god to perdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the accuser, for so vniust, and so odious an vntruthe.</p>
            <p>Likewise two ministers for confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce sake came into a prison, to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Tripp &amp; Crovvley against M. Thomas pounde.</note> whiche had bene some tyme a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and then was become a prisoner, &amp; so had bene many yeres, for his faith. And when they had onerworne and waisted all their matter with contumeliouse and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed woords, and had wearied the gentle man with blasphemies (as he him selfe by letters complayned), and yet for their parts had not eyther concluded vpon any matter, or refuted any thinge by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: then this gentleman (lest their talke should haue bene alltogether ydle and vnprofitable) moued them at length to conclude vpon some certein principall points whervpon they might afterward procede to discusse the rest. And the poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was this: whether the priuate spirit of eche <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie.</note> particular persone, or the common spirit of the vniuersall churche ought to iudge of the sense of holie scripture? For when he had heard them alleige scripture oute
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18081:58"/>
of all places, and wrongfullie: he affirmed that in these matters of controuersie, a man shoulde not runne to the bare letter of scripture, in suche sense as euerie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler man lyst to take yt: (for by this <note place="margin">A necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> mean all heresies are defended:) but that we ought to resorte to the moste certein Iudgement of the churche vniuersall, at the least way moste auncient: which being directed by the spirit of God, doeth laye downe before vs the true &amp; naturall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of scriptures. And because the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters dyd not admitt this grownd, nor yet refell yt: but (as theyr fashion is) run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne into corners, creakes and starting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: he put downe in writing (being but a lay ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not muche trauailed in scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) six strong reasons to fortifie his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: whereunto he desired that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters wolde answere, &amp; there with all re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quested that it might be lawfull for him, by speche or penne to confute their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, yf they shoulde seme to hym ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent and doubtfull, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse weake and insufficient.</p>
            <p>VVell, when these ministers had got the writinge: thense they packe in haste, &amp; to the superinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they go: &amp; to

hym they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain of the mans pertinacie, how, notwithstanding their aduises and motions, he refused to be a Caluinian, yea and that he durst take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym to defend his opinion by writing. This superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (as in verie dede he is a fumish hasty man, and by nature cholerick) being ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragiouslie incensed with ire, desineth the gentleman by and by in his mynd to some speciall payne, purposing to punish hym throughlye: And thereupon he thrusteth him so delulie oute of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to a streicter kynde of imprisonment: he locketh hym <note place="margin">Strateford castell.</note> vp in an olde decayed castell, a raw, vnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unted and obscure place, vhere he could neyther haue the sight of the Sunne or other light, nor yet of men: he loadeth hym wyth yrons: and (not to recite all particulars) he afflicteth hym with cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities meruailouse &amp; withoute all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Now these ministers (being thus put owte of all doubt &amp; feare of their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie) do sett forth a booke, and make a kinde of answer to the reasons by hym before layde downe vnto them: and as in other things, so especiallie in this, they delt moste iniuriouslie with him: for they conceale and dissemble the verie state and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18081:59"/>
principall point of the question and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, charging hym to haue sayde that the scriptures are (in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) of lesse authoritie than the churche: where in truthe he talked not of the authoritie of suche scriptures as are euidentlie knowne to be diuine scriptures: but his talke was eyther touching the knoweing and discerning of such vncertein scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res as haue bene called in question and doubted of: or touching the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se &amp; true meaning of dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke &amp; obscure places of diuine scripture. <note place="margin">VValker.

Now, what can be sayd more fonde or more ridiculous than this? And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse yt was reported for certein and sure, that this mightie Hercules had ouerthrowen and beaten downe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques: albeit in verie dede he neuer vsed argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but onelie a bare brabling and contention in woords.</p>
            <p>There is allso among oure aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> one other odde minister, a bygge man in his owne opinion, yet in other mens iudgements he is but meane: how be yt in tongue not vnreadie, yet rashe and headlong, by reason that he knoweth not hym selfe. This felow not long agoe (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to pick owt some peece of estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by contending with greate perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages) crept, vnlooked for, into a priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where the aforesayde learned and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <note place="margin">vvisbiche castell.</note> fathers, the byshop of Lincoln and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Abbot of west minister with others of good accompt are imprisoned for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And at his first entree he gyueth in commaundement that they all appears personallie before hym: he telleth them

that he his come to conferre aboute the chefe litigiouse points of religion: and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth his will and pleasure, that they should beginne the dispision. But when those good fathers (as they are wise) dyd perceiue the man to doe all this wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoute warrant, and vvithoute anie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein order or forme of conference, but onlie vppon a rashe and vndiscrete hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of his owne, and meerlie for vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: they make smale accompt of him, but contemne such ridiculouse vanitie of the arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t yong felowe. And therfore when they had spoken something abowte the vnreasonable condition then offred, and of their want of bookes, tyme and other things: they leaue the man to his owne folies, &amp; (as best besemed their grauitie) they lett hym passe away, as one by them conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, rather than vexed. But yet the yong peacocke (as his maner is) aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vp his tayle triumphed abroode with all brauerye, and publisheth a pamphlet of his great conquests and victories ouer captiues: In which pamphlet there are many vntruthes, very many friuolouse toyes, and nothing to serue his turne, nothing to make for his side, but mere

            <p>But when suche huddling &amp; shyfting of matters was knowne, so as manye euen of oure aduersaries, dyd mislike yt (for it had allmoste bredde a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon quarell, &amp; had wellnigh putt into the peoples hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des some suspition that theire cause was ouer throwen:) Some there were which (to salue this sore and to take away the infamie) made a certaine promise that within shorte space there should be a disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s very indifferent and verie reasonable.

of lesse reading (for such as were of more abilitie &amp; experience were all sent away from London as I told yow before): yet with a certein good assurance, trust and confidence in their cause, doe vnder take the charge: And therfore they close vp certain conclusions in writing, subscribe theire names, and send them awaye to the knight Marshall with greate thanks. But the conclusions please not oure aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: they appoint others accordinge to their owne phantasie &amp; send them back. Theese oure men doe allowe: the day for the disputation is appointed: greate is the expectation thereof. But what folowed? Forsothe, in the day (as I think) next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should dispute, the aforesayde defendants on oure syde were remoued from the prison of the Marshallsei, and conueyed to the tower of London to be racked: that sithe they wolde not be taught nor persuaded with reasons fett from authoritie, they might there be trayned vp and exercised with argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deriued from the rack and torture.</p>
            <p>But yet all this coulde not terrefye oure Catholiks fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their sute touching a disputation to be had with an indifferent

            <p>And at the last vp riseth a minister <note place="margin">Adam Squier.</note> from the benche, and (with verie great commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his associates before) downe he goeth as smothelie as may be among the prisoners, &amp; offreth hym selfe to be oure spokesman, and to pleade oure cause.

            <p>And these are all in a maner, that can be sayde of the disputations or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with ministers in matters of learning. For I doe not remember, that oure aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries euer yeelded to graunt any dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Catholiques, besides these whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che here I haue mentioned: sauyng onlie <note place="margin">The dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the father Campian.</note> the late disputation whiche they graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to maister Campian, being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, &amp; twise before that tyme racked, destitute of bookes, and vnprouided of <note place="margin">And once again ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked syns the tyme here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</note> all things, sauing onlie of a good cause, &amp; of a well willing mynde.

forced to mistrust any thing, beyt neuer so vnliklie, towching the indirect dealing of timourous and falseharted men in a naughtie cause.

And yf anie thing happen to be fownd that maye woorke some dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or may brede anie blame, or minister matter of surmise: as siluer chalices, patens, candlesticks, crosses, books, vestments, &amp; other orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are called churche stuffe: these they snatche away, by a priuiledge of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, and by the prerogatiue of their gospell: for other lawe thei haue none to mainteine these their doeings.

            <p>This is the peace and rest which oure Catholiques do finde at home in their owne houses. Lett vs see alitle what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinment they doe fynde abroade. I haue tolde you howe these pursyuants lyke theuysh night fyendes do runne withe deadelie hatred to doe displeasures in howses: we maye add herevnto hovv <note place="margin">Psalm. 99.</note> they besett the common wayes and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se stretes with ambushements lyke noo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne daye deuills.

And to be short, there is extant an edict and lawe, not <note place="margin">In Nouem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber 1580.</note> long a goe published, wherby euery man hathe power and authoritie to present, appeache, or accuse anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who so euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he be, vpon euerie leaste circumstance,

By mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne whereof, manye synce that tyme haue bene apprehended, and verie manie haue bene afflicted with diuerse vexations &amp; aduersities.</p>
            <p>But there is one maner of roughe dealing (for I vvill not vse a more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse terme) vvhich afflictetth more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the rest: I meane that, vvhiche oure men doe finde and feele in sutes of lavve, in triall and Iudgements before iustices, in priuate businesses; and in the common conuersation and entercourses of lyuing to gether one vvith an other. For this is a matter vvhiche in dede toucheth the verie veines and sinevves of the naturall societie of mankinde, that are nourished and preserued by Iustice &amp; humanitie or gentle behauioure: &amp;, doe detest all cruell barbarousnes. But for my parte, I doe neyther complaine, nor thinke it mete to complain, yf neyther fauour be shevved vnto oure persones, nor pitie nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to oure estate and condition, be yt neuer so afflicted or miserable, (for I can be content, sithe they will nedes haue yt soe, that such humanitie and ciuile cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie

no people i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>structed with Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawes &amp; customes, was euer eyther better framed to courtesie and humanitie, more dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to beneficence and fryndelie behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure, more inclined to the loue of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, more bent to pitie and mercie, than this English people and nation was, befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re suche time as this vnluckye, detestable and pestiferous heresie had hardened the hart, and intrailes of loue, infecting them with deadelie poysons of malice. For this is she that hathe shaken in sunder the bolts and bares of right and equitie: this is she that hathe dissolued the bonds of loue and amitie: this is she that hath blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vpp the fowndations of mercie and beneficence: this is she that hath cutt in su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the veines &amp; sinewes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon societie of men, and with a fyendelie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and tempestuous violence hath kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked together the membres thereof and beaten them one against an other into miserable disorder &amp; confusion.</p>

and lamentable, as in truth it can not but vehemently trouble yow (I think) whils youe are reding it, seing yt woorketh suche passions in my selfe in writing it, as some times I can not refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weping, whiles I considre, eyther what I haue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or what I haue omitted.

            <p>Now these things whiche I haue tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de may suffice to minister matter, eyther for sorow and heuines, or for a lesson and example. For oure calamitie ought to be a perpetuall lesson, not onlie to oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and oure posteritie but to all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques allso through the woorlde: howe terrible a thing it is (as the Apostle sayeth (, <hi>to fall in to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the liueing god:</hi> And to refuse <hi>to doe the vvoorthie vvoorkes</hi>

And yf a woorde, yea a peece of a woorde slipp forth of a mans mouthe at vnwares, or that he happen to geue but a wink with his eie, or a nod with his heade, whereby anie suspition may arise, that he fauoureth oure cause: there

is then matter enough, wherupon eyther to accuse hym, or to cast hym in prison. As of late (by report) some were put in prison for speaching afew words in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation of Catholiques touching the late disputations.</p>
            <p>But beholde a more strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge practise putt <note place="margin">In August. 1581.</note> in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by oure aduersaries, not many dayes a goe.

Nowe I praye yowe looke well in to this deuise. This matter of suspecting, how farr dothe yt reache think yow? howe easilie is it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnder the cloke of dissimulation? how redily dothe yt attend vpon hatred and enuie? what licentiouse scope doeth it geue to ambition? how much force dothe it bring to yll will &amp; malice? &amp; how shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe spurre is it to pricke forwarde euerie kind of reuenge?

this depe deuise. A minister forsoothe did accuse one vpon suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romaine religion. The persone accused dyd aske the minister what he had for hym to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that suspition: because (sayd the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister) I doe not see yow resorte so much to sermons, as yow wolde doe, yf yovv <note place="margin">A folish surmise of a minister.</note> vvere feruent in the zeale of oure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. How weightie and strong is this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, to enforce an accusation?

            <p>And because I am talking here of that pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptnesse, facilitie and rashe dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to accuse, whereby oure aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vsuallie do charge vs with offenses, and do surmise slaunderous tales, &amp; mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cauills against vs, and that vpon moste friuolous and impertinent occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: And albeit for hast I thought to haue omitted this point: yet one example I will leaue for this place: whereby youe maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that we are not onele accused for small and tryfeling matters, but blamed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18081:72"/>
and punished oftentimes for the benefits whiche we bestowe vpon them. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie is notably well knowne, pleasant allso, and yt will geue to youre Italians there (beside matter to maruaille at) some patern allso of the estate and condition of oure affairs and troubles. And thus it is.</p>
            <p>A courtlike gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good vvelth, <note place="margin">An histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching resti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tution.</note> that had liued in much brauerie, hapened to fall sick. And vvhiles he vvas lyeing in great pain: he dyd fall (as at that tyme ytt happeneth often to the most rechelesse) in to a vehement cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; depe studie of the lyfe to come. VVherevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called for a priest (for in mynde and opinion he vvas Catholique) that by his aduise and counsaile he might learne to dye vvell. The priest (according to his deutie, and the custome of the Catholique churche) admonished the sickman amonge other things that yf he had anie vvaye hurt or iniured any man, or vniustlie possessed other mens goods: he shoulde go aboute by and by to make restitution accordinge to his abilitie. The sick man dyd agree to doe so, and called to remembrance that he had taken awaie somewhat from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Caluinian vnder colour and pretense
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18081:73"/>
of law in dede, but not vnder anie goode assurance for a Catholique conscience to trust vnto: therfore he tooke order for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution to be made, &amp; died. The widow, his wyfe being verie desirous to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish her husbands will, and affraied to committ the matter to an heretique, was in verie greate perplexitie of mynde, and coulde not ridd her selfe out of it. Now whiles she was thus intangled in the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of dowbtfullnesse: by good happ a priest cometh to her she declared her <note place="margin">M. Alvvai.</note> greefe vnto hym, and besecheth hym for gods sake to helpe her, eyther with his tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaille or with his counsaile.</p>
            <p>Now the good man, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perfectlie vnderstoode the deuoute and holie desire of the gentlevvoman, being hymself a verie zelouse and charitable man, vvillin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glie profered to put hym selfe in all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill that might befall in doeing the thing which she desired, persuading hym selfe that no man wold be so cruell and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as of a benefit to desire reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Therfore first he commended the matter <note place="margin">The thyrd day in Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster vveke.</note> to God, then he mounted on horseback &amp; awaye he goethe on his Iourney. And when he came to the towne vvhere the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18081:73"/>
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyd dwell to vvhome the monie vvas to be deliuered: he setteth vp his horse in the next Inne, that he might be readier at hand, for scaping immediatlie after his <note place="margin">Fisher of vvarvvick</note> businesse vvere dispatched: he goeth hym selfe to the creditors house, he calleth the man forth alone, taketh hym by the hand, and leadeth hym a side from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">Tvventie pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</note> of others. Then he declareth that he hath money for hym, vvhiche he vvolde delyuer to hym vvith this condition, that he inquire no further, eyther vvho sent yt, vvho bringeth yt, or vvhat the cause or matter is, but onlie receiue the money, and vse yt as his ovvne. The olde felovv promiseth faire, and with a good will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his woorde faithfulli to doe so and with many thanks he dimisseth the man, and sendeth hym away.</p>
            <p>The good priest with all the speede he was able to make hastneth to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes house, for to catche holde of his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se &amp; flie away: but all in vaine. For forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">Tvvo of the sayd fy shers bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> the deceitfull old felowe betrayed the priest, and sent men after to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hym. And first to begynn with all, they made this surmise against hym, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sothe he is not a man but a deuill, whiche
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18081:74"/>
had brought money of his owne making <note place="margin">He is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a deuill vvhich ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ill gotten goods.</note> to bewitch the olde man. And for a proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe there of, they vsed this argument among others, that he had a blacke horse. And this horse they dyd obserue &amp; wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che diligentlye whether he dyd eate haye as other horses eate or no. And as for the priest, they put a horse lock aboute his legg, shutt hym vp close in a strong cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and appointed a felow to be with hym continually bothe day and night, which shoulde watche yfhe dyd put offe his bootes at any time, &amp; if his feete were like horsefete, or that he were cloue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: or had fete flytand forked as beasts haue. For this they affirmed to be a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall marke whereby to know the deuill, vvhen he lyeth lurking vnder the shape and likenesse of a man. Then the people assembled aboute the house in greate nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, and profered money largelie that they might see this monstre vvith their ovvn eyes. For by this time, the people are persuaded that he is in dede an yll spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or a verie deuill. For vvhat man vvas euer heard of (say they) vvhiche (yfhe had the mynde, vnderstanding and sense of a man) vvoolde of his ovvn volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18081:74"/>
vvill and vvithoute anie respect or consideration at all geue or proffer suche a summe of money to a man vtterlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovven, of no acquaintance vvith hym, and a mere straunger of an other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
            <p>Novv vvhen they had thus contumeliou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie vexed Christs seruant a vvhile: they pretended to sett the man at libertie, and licenced hym to depart and goe avvay vvhether he vvolde: yet all vvas but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull practise to vvork him more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and iniurie. For loe, the vngratefull &amp; <note place="margin">The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the said fisher</note> churlishe Caluinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhiche had receiued the monei, sent oute priuilie a suborned felow to stay the good priest as he vvas goeing forth: to with holde him from es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping away: and to accuse hym of high treason. This was no sooner done than the man was all ryfled, and spoyled: his horse ridden and vsed as pleased them, his money all taken from hym, sauing a litle portion to serue for his expenses to the citie of London, whether shortly after they sent hym as a prisoner with a strong and curiouse garde, And when he came thither, and had opened the matter to her maiesties Councell (or rather to one of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18081:75"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the matter might not be vttered abroade to the reproche of the deade:) he was by them casten of, and put ouer to the Superintendent of London, and by hym throwne, first into one prison, then in to an other, and thyrdlie in to the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <note place="margin">That is, first in to his ovvne porters lodge: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in to the gate house at vvestmi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nster.</note> of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhere the space wellnigh of a quarter of a yere (hardlie escaping the racke and tortures) he was sore puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for that heinouse offence (forsuthe) of restitution.</p>
            <p>And here the recitall of this historie putteth me in remembrance of that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and wanton maner of chatting of oure aduersaries (as oure moste auncient enemies were wont to doe) in slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Catholiques to be of familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance vvith deuills. And I might sooner lacke time tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matter, yf I should recken vpp all the surmises, and fables w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiche they haue forged, touching this point.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18081:75"/>
that it was done by Iuglings and coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings practised by Catholiques.

I speake not of tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se principall persones of honor or woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp, whiche are in prison for religion: who (I deny not) haue libertie to vse their ovvn goods. But I speake of the great multitude of most miserable poore captiues, and speciallie of priests, vvho at this daye are kept so straitlie, as no man hathe accesse vnto them: and vvho so euer desireth accesse, he is called in suspition: and except he can purge hym selfe, he is apprehended by and by. So Maister hanse of late, vvhen he desired to speak vvith some prisoners (bicause he had almes to delyuer to them) vvas attached as suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for religion, and in short space after hanged on the galovves.

            <p>Now, sithe oure aduersaries by this cunnyng deuise haue brought this to passe, that none dare geue almes, nor anye dare carie to a prison the almes whiche is geuen: yt must medes hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folow (as plainlie with oure eyes we see haith fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) that oure Catholiques in prison through penurie, nedynesse, and want of necessaries must languish &amp; weare away, and at the last for verie pinyng hungar &amp; nakednesse pitifullie perishe in prison I suppose yow haue heard of a certein nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Yf I wolde recite the bitter affliction and inhumanitie which Catholiques in that prison at york the yeres by past haue felt and suffred, or at this tyme do fele and suffer more than euer before: I should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make ende.

leane vnto, but that all was on oure side, and that, with out all doubt. The zealouse yong man could not stopp the conceiued light of truthe, nor suppresse the flame thereof burning within his brest. VVhen this was knowne abroad to the worlde oure aduersaries apprehend the man, they seke by threathinges to putt him in feare: But he for all that is not terryfied: they sett vpon hym vvith arguments, but he was to hard for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they vvold vvynne hym vvith faier vvoords, but he is not allured. VVhat then? they thrust hym in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison, they handle hym sharplie: yet is he nothing relented.

For I thought it to be muche auailable to the common estate of Christendome, that this so notable a persecution of Catholiques in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland should be not onlie communicated to the knovvleige of this present age, but put ouer allso to the mynde and memorie of oure poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the printing of this epistle last rehearsed, I haue heard that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof vvas one Maister Bria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vvho latelie suffered (as is sayd) vvith Maister Campian, and Maister Shervvyn, three moste blessed and fortunate men: vvhose happ hathe bene after so many torments and tortures suffred for gods cause, to seale vvith their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, the truthe, vvhiche they taught vvith so much payn and daungers before. Novv Maister bria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hathe more than his desire, being ioyned i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> societie vvith Iesus hym selfe, to vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se holie name he so muche coueted to dedicate his lyfe in this vvorlde, as appeareth by this his epistle. And I dovvbt not, but that it vvas a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort vnto hym to suffer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of good father Campian, so rare a man of that Societie, vvhereof he desired so greatlie to be a member vvhiles he liued.</p>
            <p>Hovv farr all treason, and other disorder of lyfe, vvas from the harts, hands, and vvoords of these Innocent men, and the rest vvhich vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re condemned vvith them, all they can testifye vvhiche euer knevv them, or liued vvith them: for that their vvoords and exhortations, vvere allvvays to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarye, in detestation of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and in commendation of vertuouse lyfe, vvith contempt of the vvorld, and humbly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring all troubles and persecutions for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste his sake, adding alvvayes, that Catholiques must rather loue, &amp; hartilie praye for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
<pb facs="tcp:18081:91"/>
than seeke any vvay to hurt them, or to reuenge theire selues vpon them, if it lay in their povver. This haue I hearde, and so haue thovvsands moo in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d besydes me, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuinge (I knovv) dyd euer heare from their movvthes the contrarie. Their lyues allso vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re suche in all secret austeritie of discipline to them selues: as he that had knovvne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvolde litle beleeue, that they vvere men to attempt suche matters, as they vvere charged vvithall.</p>
            <p>Yf these men had bene guiltie of suche horrible treasons: they should neuer haue bene so dallied vvithe all, first in disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che lesse should they haue had lyfe, libertie, and fauour offred them, for onelie yeelding to goe to churche, as maister Campian ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie affirmed that they often had, and amongest many, named one of some accompt there present (as it vvas crediblie told me) vvhich had offered the same to hym vvith terrible threates, not onelie of deathe, but allso of renting of his nayles from his fyngars vvith pynnes, yf he yeelded not thervnto.</p>
            <p>Again, their ioyfull acceptation of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thankes geuing to God for the same, vvith their seuerall and moste vehement prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, there made at the barre, after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, doeth declare sufficientlie the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arenesse of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. For then, and there, Maister Campian protested before God and his angells, heauen and earthe, the vvorld and that Iudgement Seate there present, vvhiche (as he trulie sayde) vvas but a litle figure of the moste dredefull Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t seat of God, before vvhich
<pb facs="tcp:18081:92"/>
he to his greate ioye expected shortlie to be presented: he protested (I say vpon eternall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Soule, that he vvas moste innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, guiltlesse, and vnvvitting of all and singular the matters in that inditement alleiged, and of euerie part and parcell thereof. Maister Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvyn protested vvith like vehemencie, that yf euer his heade did imagin, or his hart co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued, or his tongue vttered, or his hand atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, any thing against his soueraigne ladie Quene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, or against any of her honorable Councell, or against the common vvealthe, or realme of England: he renounced there his portion in heauen, and desired God, as a iust Iudge to da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne hym bothe in bodie and sovvle to the eternall darknesse and torments of hell fire And vvhen he had done, he cried oute: O happie and blessed day that euer he vvas borne. The like dyd the rest, vvhich vvere condemned vvith hym, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing openlie their false accusars there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and prayeing to God for them.</p>
            <p>Novv lett anie man shevv to me, that euer traitour dyed so, or that a guiltie conscience, dothe yelde suche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, vvhen they knevv novv that there vvas no vvaye vvith them but deathe.</p>
            <p>VVell, God be blessed for them: and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie his holye name hathe bene greatlie glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by them.</p>
            <p>VVhat straunge torments and other extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myties they haue suffred before they came to die, he alone knovveth, and vve heare onlie of some part thereof, for vve see they vvere not men to complain of euery thing done to them,
<pb facs="tcp:18081:92"/>
but vvere content to put it vp in secret, vvith hope to receiue theire revvarde at his hand.</p>
            <p>Yet yf vve had not heard of their seuerall &amp; often rackings: maister Campian his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the barre vvith his handes folden in lynnen clothe, and vvith that feblenesse, as he vvas neyther able to pluck of his ovvne mytton of freése nor lyft a cupp of drink to his mouthe vvithoute helpe, may vvell shevv hovv he had bene handled. Oure sorde shevv his tourmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours more mercie at the day of his Iudgement, than they haue shevved hym. Hovv mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re had bene able to beare ovvte so great rigour &amp; extremities, as they haue passed, (except Gods holie grace had bene ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull vnto them) I doe not see. And that oure lorde dyd concurr vvith extraordinarie comfort, in their torments, it may appeare in this epistle goinge before of Maister Briant: vvhom Maister Norton the Rackem aister (yf he be not misreported) vaunted in the court to haue pulled one good foote longer than euer God made hym and yet in the myddes of all he semed to care nothing, and therfore ovvte of dovvbt (sayth he) he had a deuill vvithein hym. But vvhether it be a more propertie to the deuill to suffer patiently, or to torment other men mercyleslie, maister Briant and maister Norton shall dispute the matter one day, vvhen deuills shall be at hand to beare vvitnesse, and the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge bothe of deuills and deuelish men, shall be at hand to geue sentence. In the meane space I beseche God to accept the Innocent bloode of his vertuouse preests, for some part of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb facs="tcp:18081:93"/>
of his vvrathe tovvards vs, and tovvards oure persecutors, that they hauing the miste of errour taken from their eyes, may see the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of Christs Catholique religion, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing vvhere of, they afflict vs so gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie as he seeth, to vvhose eyes al iniuries do lye open, and to vvhose onelye Iudgement, vve leaue oure cause and doeings to be tryed and discerned, vvhen it shall seme moste conuenient to his diuine maiestie. Amen.</p>
