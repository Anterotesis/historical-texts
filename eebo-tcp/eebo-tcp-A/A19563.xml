         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Thinke it good gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, here in the begynnyng to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thee of certaine wordes &amp; kyndes of speaches, which I do vse sometyme in this myne aunswere to the late By<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shop of Winchesters book, least in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakyng, thou doe as it were stumble at them.</p>
            <p>First this word <hi>(Sacrament</hi>) I doe sometymes vse (as it is many tymes taken among writers and holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours) for the Sacramentall bread,<note place="margin">Sacrament.</note> water, or wine, as when they say, that <hi>Sacramentum est sacrae rei signum,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is the signe of an holy thyng. But where I vse to speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes (as the old Authors do) that Christ is in the Sacramentes, I mean the same as they did vnderstand the matter, that is to say, not of Christes carnall presence in the outward Sacrament, but sometymes of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall presence. And sometyme by this word <hi>(Sacrament)</hi> I meane the whole ministration and receiuyng of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, either of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, or of the Lordes Supper, and so the old writers many tymes doe say, that Christ and the holy Ghost be present in the Sacramentes, not meanyng by that maner of speach, that Christ and the holy Ghost be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the water, bread, or wine (which be onely the outward visible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes (but that in the due ministration of the Sacramentes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to Christes ordinaunce and institution, Christ and his holy spirite be truely and in deede present by their mightie and sanctifiyng power, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and grace, in all them that worthely receiue the same.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when I say and repeat many tymes in my book, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of Christ is present in them that worthely receaue the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Christes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiuer.</note> least any man should mystake my woordes, and thinke that I meane, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ be not corporally in the outward visible signes, yet hee is corporally in the persons that duely receiue them, this is to aduertise the Reader, that I meane no such thyng, but my meanyng is, that the force, the grace, the vertue and benefite of Christes body that was Crucified for vs, and of his bloud that was shed for vs, be really, and effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with all them that duely receaue the Sacramentes, but all this I vnderstand of his spirituall presence, of the which he sayth, I will be with you vntill the worldes ende. And wheresoeuer two or three be gathered together in my name, there am I in the myddest of them.<note place="margin">Math. 6. Math. 18.</note> And hee that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him. Nor no more truely is he corporally or really present in the due ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lordes Supper,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> than hee is in the due ministration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: That is to say, in both spiritually by grace. And wheresoeuer in the Scripture it is sayd that Christ, God or the holy Ghost is in any man, the same is vnderstand spiritually by grace.</p>
            <p>The thyrd thyng to admonish the Reader of is this, that when I name
<pb facs="tcp:7682:3"/>
Doctour Stephen Gardiner Byshop of Winchester,<note place="margin">The naming of the late Bishop of Winchester.</note> I meane not that he is so now, but forasmuch as he was Byshop of Winchester at the tyme when he wrote his booke agaynst me, therfore I aunswere his booke as written by the Byshop of Winchester, whiche els needed greatly none aunswere for any great learnyng or substaunce of matter that is in it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Chryst should proue no Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of the bread and wine.</note>The last admonition to the Reader is this, where the sayd late Byshop thinketh that he hath sufficiently proued Transubstantiation, (that is to say, that the substaunce of bread and wine can not be in the Sacrament, if the body and bloud of Christ were there) bycause two bodyes can not be togethers in one place, although the truth be, that in the Sacrament of Christes bodye, there is corporallye but the substaunce of bread onelye, and in the Sacrament of the bloud, the substaunce of wine onelye, yet how farre hee is deceiued, and doth vary from the doctrine of other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, and also from the principles of Philosophy (whiche he taketh for the foundation of his doctrine in this point) the Reader hereby may ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue. For if we speake of Gods power, the Papistes affirme, that by Gods power, two bodyes may be together in one place, and then why may not Christes bloud be with the wyne in the cup, and his fleshe in the same place where the substaunce of the bread is? And if we consider the cause wherfore two bodyes can not be together in one place by the rules of nature, it shall euidently appeare, that the body of Christ may rather be in one place with the substaunce of the bread, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the accidents ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and so likewise his bloud with the wine. For the naturall cause wherfore two bodyes can not be together in one place (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers say) is their accidentes, their bignes, and thicknes, and not their substaunces. And then by the very order of nature it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth more y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ should be present w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes of bread, and his bloud with the accidentes of wyne, then with the substaunces either of bread or wyne. This shall suffice for the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the Reader, ioynyng thereto the Preface in my first booke, whiche is this:</p>

            <p>OVr Sauiour Christ Iesus, according to the will of his eternall Father,<note place="margin">The great mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy &amp; benefits of God towards vs.</note> when the time thereto was fully complished, taking our nature vpon him came into this world from the high throne of hys Father, to declare vnto miserable sinners, good newes, to heale them that were sicke, to make the blinde to see, the deafe to heare, and the dumbe to speake, to set prisoners at liberty, to shew that the time of grace and mercy was come, to giue light to them that were in darknes and in the shadow of death, and to preach and geue pardon and full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne to all his elected. And to performe the same he made a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and oblation of his owne body vpon the crosse, which was a full redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, satisfaction and propitiation for the sinnes of the whole world. And to commend this his sacrifice vnto all his faythfull people, and to confirme their fayth and hope of eternall saluation in the same, he hath ordayned a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all memory of his sayd sacrifice, dayly to be vsed in the Church to his perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all laud and prayse, and to our synguler comfort and consolation, That is to say the celebration of his holy supper, wherein he doth not cease to geue himselfe, with all his benefites to all those that duely receiue the same supper, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his blessed ordinaunce.<note place="margin">The erronious doctrine of the papists obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same.</note> But the Romish Antichrist, to deface this great benefite of Christ, hatht that his sacrifice vpon the crosse is not sufficient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, without any other sacrifice deuised by him, and made by the priest, or els without Indulgences, Beades, Pardons, Pilgrimages, and such other Pelfray, to to supply Christes imperfection. And that Christen people cannot applye to themselues the benefytes of Christes passion, but that the same is in the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Byshop of Rome, or els that by Christ we haue no full remission but be deliuered onely from sinne, and yet remaineth temporall payne in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory due for the same, to be remitted after this life by the Romish Antichrist and his ministers, who take vpon them to do for vs that thing, which Christ ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not, or could not do. O haynous blasphemy &amp; most detestable iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against Christ. O wicked abhomination in the temple of God.

For he that taketh vpon him to supply that thing which he pretendeth to be vnperfect in Christ, must nedes make himself aboue Christ, &amp; so very Antichrist. For what is this els, but to be agaynst Christ, and to bring him in contempt, as one that either for lack of charity would not, or for lack of power he could not, with all his bloudshedding and death, cleerely deliuer his faythfull, and geue them full remission of their sinnes, but that the full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof must be had at the handes of Antichrist of Rome and his ministers?

I know in what office God hath placed me, and to what purpose, that is to say, to set forth hys word truely vnto his people, to the vttermost of my power, without respect of person, or regard of thing in the world, but of him alone.

            <p>Now as concernyng his behauiour and trade of lyfe towardes God and the world, beyng entered into his sayd dignitie: True it is, that he was so throughly furnished withall properties, qualities, and conditions belongyng to a true Byshop, as that it shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be very hard in these straunge dayes to finde many,<note place="margin">1.

               </gap>estatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refused, hopyng that his Maiestie in processe of time would reuoke them agayne: but also after the Parlament was finished, the kyng perceiuyng the zealous affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Archb. bare towardes the defence of his cause, which many wayes by Scriptures and manifold authorities and reasons he had substauntially confirmed and defended, sent the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> then Uicegerent,<note place="margin">Of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the <hi>I.

He most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanked the kynges Maiestie of his great goodnesse towardes him, and them all for their paynes, saying: I hope in God, that hereafter my allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; authorities shall take place to the glory of God and the commoditie of the Realme, in the meane tyme I will satisfie my selfe with the honorable consent of your honours and the whole Parlament.</p>
            <p>Here is to be noted, that this mans stoute and godly defence of the truth herein, so bound the Princes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, that he would not permit the truth in that man to be cleane ouerthrowen with authoritie and power, and therfore this way God workyng in the Princes mynde, a playne token was declared hereby that all thyngs were not so sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled in the confirmation of the sayd vi.

Now in the end this Archbyshops constancie was such towardes Gods cause, that he confirmed all his doynges by bitter death in the fire, with out respect of any worldly treasure or pleasure. And as touchyng his stoutnesse in his Princes cause, the contrary resistaunce of the Duke of Northumberland agaynst him proued right well his good minde that way:<note place="margin">Archb. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer</hi> in displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey landes.</note> which chaunced by reason that he would not consent to the dissoluyng of Chauntreys vntill the kyng came of age, to the intent that they might then better serue to furnish his royall estate, then to haue so great treasure consumed in his noneage. Which his stoutnes ioyned with such simplicitie, surely was thought to diuers of the Counsaile, a thyng incredible, specially in such sort to contend with him who was so accounted in this Realme, as few or none would or durst gayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand hym.</p>
            <p>So deare was to him the cause of God, and of his Prince, that for the one he would not kéepe his conscience clogged, nor for the other lurke or hide his head. Otherwise (as it is sayd) his very enemies might easely intreate him in any cause reasonable: and such thyngs as he graunted, he did without any suspition of rebraidyng or méede therfore: So that he was altogethers voyde of the vice of the stubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To whom the Archbishop aunswering againe, saying: as I doe not deny my selfe to be the very Authour of that Bill or Letter, so must I confesse here vnto you, concerning the same Bill, that I am sorie that the sayd Bill went from me in such sort as it did. For when I had written it, <hi>M. Scory</hi> got the Copie of me, and is now come abroad, and as I vnderstand, the Citie is full of it. For whiche I am sorie, that it so passed my handes: for I had intended otherwise to haue made it in a more large and ample maner, &amp; myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue set it on Paules Church doore, and on the doores of all the Churches in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, with mine owne feele ioyned thereto.</p>
            <p>At whiche wordes when they saw the constantnesse of the man, they dismissed him, affirming they had no more at that present to say vnto him, but that shortly hee should heare further. The said Bishop declared afterward to one of <hi>Doct.

            <p>By this partly, and other like argumentes, the Archbishop began more and more to surmise what they went about. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because the day was not farre past, and the Lordes and Knightes that were looked for, were not yet come, there came to him the Spanish Frier, witnesse of his recantation, bringyng a paper with Articles, whiche <hi>Cranmer</hi>

But yet the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop beyng not ignoraunt whereunto their secret deuises tended, and thinking that the tyme was at hand, in which he could no longer dissemble the profession of his fayth with Christes people, he put secretly in his bosome his Prayer with his exhortation, written in an other paper, which he mynded to recite to the people, before he should make the last profession of his sayth, fearyng lest if they had heard the Confession of his fayth first, they would not afterward haue suffered him to exhort the people.</p>
            <p>Some after, about ix. of the clocke, the Lord <hi>Williams,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Bridges,</hi> Syr <hi>Iohn Browne,</hi> and the other Iustices with certaine other Noble men, that were sent of the Quéenes Counsell, came to Oxford with a great trayne of wayting men.

            <p>The lamentable case and sight of that man gaue a sorowfull spectacle to all Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyes that beheld him. He that late was Archbishop, Metropolitane, and Primate of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and the kynges priuie Counsellour, beyng now in a bare and ragged gowne, and ill fauoredly clothed, with an old square cap, exposed to the contempt of all men, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onely of his owne calamitie, but also of their state and fortune.

            <p>In this habite when hee had stoode a good space vpon the stage, turnyng to a piller neare adioyning thereunto, he lifted vp his handes to heauen, and prayed to God once or twise: till at the length <hi>Doct.

            <p>First, that beyng a traytour, he had dissolued the lawfull Matrimonie betwene the kyng her father and mother: besides the driuyng out of the Popes authoritie, while he was Metropolitane.</p>

            <p>Beside these, there were other iust &amp; weightie causes, which séemed to the Quéene &amp; the Counsell, whiche was not méete at that tyme to be opened to the common people.</p>
            <p>After this, turnyng his tale to the hearers, he bad all men beware by this mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that among men nothyng is so high, that can promise it selfe safetie on the earth, and that Gods vengeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is equally stretched agaynst all men, &amp; spareth none: therfore they should beware and learne to feare their Prince.<note place="margin">No state in this earth so hye nor so sure, but it may fall.</note> And seyng the Quéenes Maiestie would not spare so notable a man as this, much lesse in the like cause she would spare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, that no man should thinke to make thereby any defence of his errour, either in riches or any kynde of authoritie.

            <p>First, it is an heauie case to see that so many folke be so much doted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the loue of this false world, and so carefull for it, that of the loue of God, or the world to come, they seeme to care very litle or nothyng. Therefore this shalbe my first exhortation,<note place="margin">Exhortation to contempt of the world.</note> that you set not your myndes ouer much vpon this glosing world, but vpon God and vpon the world to come: and to learne to know what this lesson meaneth, whiche S.

               <note place="margin">Exhortation to brotherly loue.</note>The third exhortation is, that you loue altogether lyke brethren and sisters. For alas, pitie it is to see what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention and hatred one Christen man beareth to an other, not takyng ech other as brother and sister, but rather as straungers and mortall enemyes. But I pray you learne and beare well away this one lesson, to doe good vnto all men, asmuch as in you lyeth, &amp; to hurt no man, no more then you would hurt your owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall louyng brother or sister.

            <p>Briefly, it was a world to sée the Doctours beguiled of so great an hope. I thinke there was neuer crueltie more notably or better in tyme deluded and deceiued. For it is not to bee doubted but they looked for a glorious victorie and a perpetuall triumph by this mans retractation.

And when hee began to speake more of the Sacrament and of the Papacie, some of them began to cry out, yalpe, and baule, and and specially <hi>Cole</hi> cried out vpon him: stop the heretickes mouth, and take him away.</p>

                  <hi>HERE before the beginning of your</hi> booke, you haue prefixed a goodly title, but it agreeth with the argument and matter therof, as water agreeth with the fire. For your booke is so farre from an explication and assertion of the true catholike fayth in the matter of the sacrament, that it is but a crafty cauillation and subtile sophisticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to obscure the truth therof, and to hyde the same, that it should not appeare. And in your whole booke, the reader (if he marke it wel) shal easily perceiue, how little learning is shewed therin and how few authors you haue alleadged, other then such as I brought forth in my booke, and made aunswer vnto: but there is shewed what may be done by fine wit, and new deuises, to deceiue the reader, and by false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations to auoyde the plain wordes of scripture and of the old au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

                  <p>If you will aunswer (as you must nedes do) that the cause why that among those people the true teaching preuailed not, was by reason of the aboundant superstition &amp; idolatry that blinded their eies, you haue fully answered your own argument, and haue plainly declared the cause, why the true doctrine in this matter hath not preuailed these 500. yeares, the church of Rome (which all that time hath borne the chiefe swinge) being ouerflowen and drowned in all kind of superstition and idolatry, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might not abide to heare of the truth. And the true doctrine of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (which I haue set out plainly in my booke) was neuer condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by no councell, nor your false papisticall doctrine allowed, vntill the deuill caused Antichrist his sonne and heire Pope Nicholas the second, with his monkes and friers, to condemne the truth, and confirme these your heresies.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And where of Gamaliels wordes you make an argument of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successe in this matter, the scripture testifieth how Antichrist shall prosper and preuaile against saintes no short while, &amp; persecute the truth.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7682:21"/>
dayes to idolatry, hypocrisie and superstition, through traditions of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseis, and therfore he moued the rest of the Councell to beware, that they did not rashly and vnaduisedly condemne that doctrine &amp; religion which was approued by God, least in so doing they should not onely resist the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but God himselfe, which counsail if you had marked &amp; followed, you would not haue done so vnsoberly in many things as you haue done.</p>

And in the sacramentes you separate Christes body from his spirite, affirming that in Baptisme we receaue but his spirite, and in the communion but his flesh.

For they affirme not suche a grosse presence of Christes body, as expelleth the substance of bread, and is made by conuersion therof into the substance of Christes body, and is eaten with the mouth.

                  <p>It shalbe now to purpose to consider the scriptures touching the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the author pretending to bring forth faithfully as the maiesty therof requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: in the rehearsall of the wordes of Christ out of the gospel of S. Iohn: he beginneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a litle to low and passeth ouer that pertaineth to the matter, and therfore should haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a litle higher at this clause: and the bread which I shall geue you is my flesh, which I will geue for the life of the worlde. The Iewes therfore striued between themselues, saying: How can this man geue his flesh to be eaten? Iesus therfore sayd vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, verely, I say vnto you, except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp; drink his bloud ye haue no life in you, who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, &amp; I will rayse him vp at the last day. For my flesh is very meat, and my bloud very drink. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. As the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing father hath sent me, and I liue by the father: Euen so, he that eateth me, shall liue by me. This is the bread which came downe from heauen. Not as your fathers did eate Manna and are dead. He that eateth this bread, shall liue for euer.</p>
                  <p>Here is also a faulte in the translation of the text, which should be thus in one place. For my flesh is verely meate and my bloud is verely drinke. In which speach, the verbe that coupeleth the words (flesh) and (meate) together, knitteth them together in their proper signification, so as the flesh of Christ is verely meate, and not figuratiuely meate, as the author would perswade. And in these wordes of Christ may appeare plainly, how Christ taught the mistery of the food of his humanity which he promised to geue for food, euen the same flesh that he sayd he would geue for the life of the world, and so expresseth the first sentence of this scripture here by me wholy brought forth, that is to say, and the bread which I shall geue you is my flesh which I shall geue for the life of the world, and so is it plain that Christ spake of flesh in the same sence that S. Iohn speaketh in, saying: The word was made flesh, signifying by flesh the whol humanity. And so did Cyril agrée to Nestorius, when he vpon these textes, reasoned how this eating is to be vnderstanded of Christes humanitye, to which nature in Christes person, is properly attribute to be


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7682:25"/>
eaten as meat spiritually to nourish man, dispenced and geuen in the Sacrament. And betwéene Nestorius and Cyrill was this diuersitie in vnderstanding the misterye,<note place="margin">Cyrill and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>storius.</note> that Nestorius estéeming of ech nature in Christ a seuerall person, as it was obiected to him, and so dissoluinge the ineffable Unitie, did so repute the body of Christ to be eaten as the body of a man seperate. Cyrill maintayned the body of Christ to be eaten as a body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable vnited to the Godhead, and for the ineffable mistery of that Union, the same to be a flesh that geueth life. And then as Christ sayth. If we eate not the fleshe of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sonne of man, we haue not life in vs, because Christ hath ordered the Sacrament of his most precious body and bloud, to nourish such as be by his holy Spirite regenerate. And as in Baptisme we receaue the Spirite of Christe,<note place="margin">In baptisme we receaue Christs spirite to geue life, in the Lords Supper we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue his flesh &amp; bloud to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue life.</note> for the renuinge of our lyfe, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> doe wer in this Sacrament of Christes most precious body and bloud, receaue Christes very flesh, and drinke his very bloud, to continue and preserue, increase and augment, the life receaued.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the same forme of wordes Christ spake to Nichodemus of baptisme, that he speaketh here of the eating of his body, and drinking of his bloud, and in both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes geueth, dispenseth, and exhibiteth in déede, those celestiall giftes in sensible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementes, as Chrisostome sayth. And because the true faithfull beléeuing men doe only by fayth know the sonne of man to be in vnity of person the sonne of God, so as for the vnitie of the two natures in Christ, in one person, the flesh of the Sonne of man, is the proper flesh of the sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Saint Augustine sayd well when he noted these wordes of Christ: Uerely, verely, vnlesse ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. to be a figuratiue speach, because after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bare letter it séemeth vnprofitable, considering that flesh profiteth nothing in it self, este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the own nature alone, but as the same flesh in Christ is vnited to the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so is it as Christ sayd (after Cyrilles exposition) spirite and life, not chaunged into the diuine nature of the spirite, but for the ineffable vnion in the person of Christ therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: It is <hi>viuificatrix,</hi> (as Cyrill sayde) and as the holy Ephc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then to declare vnto vs, how in géeuinge this life to vs, Christe vseth the instrument of his very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne body: it followeth. For my flesh is verely meate, and my bloud is verely drinke. So like as Christ sanctifieth by his godly spirite, so doth he sanctifie vs by his godly flesh, and therefore repeteth agayn, to inculcate the celestiall thing of this mistery, and saieth: He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth to me and I in him, which is the naturall, and corporall vnion, betwéene vs and Christ. Whereupon followeth, that as Christ is naturally in his Father, and his Father in him, so he that eateth verely the fleshe of Christ, he is by nature in Christ, and Christ is naturally in him, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receauer hath life increase, augmented, and confirmed by the participation of the flesh of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And because of the ineffable vnion of the two natures, Christ sayd: This is the food that came downe from heauen, because God (whose proper flesh it is) came downe from heauen, and hath an other vertue then Manna had, because this geueth life to them that worthely receaue it: which Manna (being but a figure thereof) did not, but being in this foode Christes very flesh, inseparably vnited to the Godhead, the same is of such efficacye, as he that worthely eateth of it, shall liue for euer. And thus I haue declared the sence of Christes wordes brought forth out of the Gospel of S. John. Whereby appeareth how euidently they set forth the doctrine of the mistery of the eating of Christes flesh, &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> his bloud in the sacrament, which must néedes be vnderstanded of a corporal eating, as Christ did after order in the institution of the sayd Sacrament, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and doctrine here declared.</p>

consider the matter for the which I alleadge S. Iohn, he shal wel perceiue that I began at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right place where I ought to begin. For I doe not bring forth S.

But I bring saynt Iohn for the matter of eating Christes flesh and drinking his bloud, wherin I passed ouer nothing that pertaineth to the matter, but rehearse the whole fully and faithfully. And because the Reader may the better vnderstand the matter, and iudge between vs both, I shall rehearse the wordes of my former booke, which be these.</p>

Of some it hath beene vsed as a Sacrifice propiciatory for sinne: and otherwise superstitiouslye, far from the intent that Christ did first ordaine the same at the beginning, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein great wrong and iniury to his death and passion. And of other some it hath been very lightly estemed, or rather contemned and despiced as a thing of smal or of none effect. And thus betweene both the parties hath been much variance and contention in diuers partes of Christendome. Therefore to the intent that this holy Sacrament or Lords Supper may hereafter neither of the one party be contemned or lightly esteemed, nor of the other party be abused to any other purpose then Christ himselfe did first appoint &amp; ordain the same, and that so the contention on both parties may be quieted and ended the most sure and playn way is to cleaue vnto holye scripture. Wherein whatsoeuer is found, must be taken for a most sure ground, and an infallible truth, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer cannot be grounded vpon the same, touching our faith, is mans deuise changeable and vncertain. And therfore here are set forth the very words that Christ him selfe and his Apostle S. Paule spake, both of the eating and drinking of Christs body &amp; bloud, &amp; also of the eating &amp; drinking of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the same.

For my flesh is very meate, and my bloud is very drinke.

                  <p>Here haue I rehearsed the wordes of Christ faithfully and fully, so much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as pertayneth to the eating of Christes flesh, and drinking of his bloud.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And therfore to answere you plainly, the fattie fleshe that was geuen in Christes last Supper,<note place="margin">Christ is verely and truely geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritually.</note> was geuen also vpon the crosse, and is geuen daylye in the ministration of the Sacrament. But although it be one thinge, yet it was diuerslye geuen. For vpon the crosse, Christ was carnally geuen to suffer and to dye. At his last Supper he was spiritually geuen in a promise of his death: and in the Sacrament he is daily geuen in remembraunce of his death. And yet it is all but one Christ that was promysed to die, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in deede, and whose death is remembred, that is to say, the very same Christ, the eternall word that was made flesh. And the same flesh was also geuen to be spiritually eaten, and was eaten in deede before his supper, yea and before his incarnation also. Of which eating, and not of Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eating, he spake in the sixt of Iohn. My flesh is very meat, and my bloud is very drincke:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6,</note> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</p>
                  <p>And Cyrill (I graunt) agreed to Nestorius in the substance of the thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that was eaten (which is Christes very flesh,) but in the manner of eating, they varyed. For Nestorius imagined a carnall eating (as the papistes do) with mouth, and tearing with teeth. But Cyrill in the same place, sayeth:<note place="margin">Cyrill Lanathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matismo. 11.</note> that Christ is eaten onely by a pure faith, and not that he is eaten corporally with our mouthes; as other meates be.

For who euer sayd or taught before this time, that the Sacrament was the cause why Christ sayd: If we eate not the flesh of the sonne of man, we haue not life in vs.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6:</note> The spirituall eating of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> his flesh, and drincking of his bloud by faith, by digesting his death in our mindes, as our onely price, raunsome, and redemption from eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is the cause wherefore Christ sayd: That if we eate not his flesh, and drincke not his bloud, we haue not life in vs: and if we eate his fleshe, and drincke his bloud, we haue euerlasting life. And if Christ had neuer orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sacrament, yet should we haue eaten his flesh, and droncken his bloud, and haue had thereby euerlasting life, as al the faithfull did before the the Sacrament was ordeyned, and doe dayly when they receaue not the Sacrament. And so did the holy men that wandered in the wildernesse, and in all their life tune very seldome receaued the Sacrament, and many holy Martyres, either exyled, or kept in prison, did dayly feede of the foode of Christes body, and drancke dayly the bloud that sprange out of his side, or els they could not haue had euerlasting life, as Christ him selfe sayd in the gospell of S. Iohn, and yet they were not suffered with other Christen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to haue the vse of the Sacrament. And therefore your argument in this place, is but a, <hi>fallax a non causa, vt causa,</hi> which is another tricke of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils sophistry.</p>
                  <p>And that in the sixt of Iohn, Christ spake neither of corporall, nor sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> eating of his flesh, the time manifestly sheweth. For Christ spake of the same present time that was then, saying: The bread which I will geue is my flesh:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> And: He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and Im him, and hath euerlasting life. At which time the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread was not yet Christs flesh. For the Sacrament was not then yet ordayned, and yet at that time all that beléeued in Christ, did eate his flesh, and drinke hys bloude, or els they could not haue dwelled in Christe, nor Christ in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note>Moreouer, you say your selfe that in the sixt of S. Iohns gospell, when Christ sayd,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> the bread is my flesh. By the word (flesh) he ment his wholl hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7682:27"/>
(as is ment in this sentence: The word was made flesh,) which he ment not in the word (body) when he said of bread, this is my body. Where by he ment not his wholl humanitye, but his flesh onely, &amp; neither his bloud nor his soule. And in the vi. of Iohn, Christ made not bread his flesh, when he said, the bread is my flesh: but he expounded in those wordes, what bread it was that he ment of, when he promised them bread that should geue them eternall life. He declared in those wordes, that himselfe was the bread that should geue life, because they should not haue their fantasies of any bread made of corne. And so the eating of that heauenly bread could not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed of the Sacrament, nor of corporall eating with the mouth: but of spirituall eating by faith, as all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde authors do most cleerely expound and declare. And seeing that there is no corporall eating, but chawing with the teeth or swallowing (as all men doe know) if we eate Christ corporally, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you must confesse that we either swallow vp Christes flesh, or chaw &amp; teare it with our teeth (as pope Nicholas constrained Berengarius to confesse,) which S.

For I alledge S. Augustine iustly as he speaketh, adding nothing of my selfe. The wordes in my booke be these.</p>
                  <p>Of these wordes of Christ it is plain and manifest,<note place="margin">August. in 10 an. Tractat. 26.</note> that the eating of Christs body, and drincking of his bloud, is not like to the eating and drinking of other meates and drinkes. For although without meat and drinke man cannot liue yet it followeth not that he that eateth and drinketh shall liue for euer. But as touching this meate and drinke of the body and bloud of Christ it is true, both


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7682:28"/>
he that eateth and drinketh them, hath euerlasting life. And also he that eateth and drinketh them not,<note place="margin">Eodem tract. Aug. de Ciuit. lib. 21. cap. 25.</note> hath not euerlasting life. For to eate that meate, and drinke that drink, is to dwell in Christ, and to haue Christ dwelling in him, and therfore no man can say or think that he eateth the body of Christ or drinketh his bloud except he dwelleth in Christ, and haue Christ dwelling in him. Thus haue you heard of the eating and drinking of the very fleshe and bloud of our Sauiour Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus alleadge I S. Augustin truely, without adding any thing of mine own head, or taking any thing away. And what sleight I vsed, is easy to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> iudge: for I cite directly the places that euery man may see whether I say true or noe. And if it be not true, quarrell not with me but with S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, whose wordes I onely rehearse. And that which S. Augustine say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, spake before him S. Ciprian, and Christ himselfe also plainlye inough, vpon whose wordes I thought I might be as bold to build a true doctrine for the setting forth of Gods glory, as you may be to peruert both the words of Ciprian, and of Christ him selfe, to stablish a false doctrine to the high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of God, and the corruption of his most true word. For you adde this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> word (worthely) wherby you gather such an vnworthy meaning of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines wordes as you list your self.<note place="margin">worthely.</note> And the same you doe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very words of Christ him selfe, who speaketh absolutely and plainly without adding of any such word as you put thereto. What sophistry this is, you know well inough. Now if this be permitted vnto you to adde what you list, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound how you list, then you may say what you list without controlment of any man, which it seemeth you looke for.</p>
                  <p>And not of like sort, but of like euilnes doe you handle (in reprehending of my seconde vntruth as you call it) an other place of S. Augustine in his booke <hi>de doctrina Christiana,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August. de doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trina Christiana lib. 3. cap. 13.</note> where he sayth, that the eating and drinkinge of Christes flesh and bloud is a figuratiue speach: which place you expound so farre from S. Augustines meaning,<note place="margin">How Christes flesh is eaten.</note> that who soeuer looketh vpon his wordes, may by and by discern that you do not, or wil not vnderstand him. But it is most like (the words of him being so plain and easy) that purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will not vnderstand him, nor nothing els that is against your will, rather then you will goe from any part of your will and receaued opinion. For it is plain and cleare that S. Augustine in that place speaketh not one worde of the separation of the two natures in Christ, and although Christs flesh be neuer so surely and inseparably vnited vnto his Godhead (without which vnion it could profite nothing) yet being so ioyned, it is a very mans flesh, the eating wherof (after the proper speech of eating) is horrible and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable. Wherfore the eating of Christes flesh must needes be otherwise vnderstanded, then after the proper and common eatinge of other meates with the mouth, which eating after such sort could auayle nothing. And therefore S. Augustine in that place declareth the eating of Christes fleshe to be onely a figuratiue speach. And he openeth the figure so, as the eatinge must be ment with the minde, not with the mouth: that is to say, by chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and digesting in our mindes, to our great consolation and profite, that Christ dyed for vs. Thus doth S. Augustine open the figure and meaning of Christ when he spake of the eating of his flesh, and drinking of his bloud. And his flesh being thus eaten, it must also be ioyned vnto his diuinitie, or els it could not geue euerlasting life, as Cyrill and the councell Ephesin tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7682:28"/>
decreed. But S. Augustine declared the figuratiue speech of Christ to be in the eating, not in the vnion. And where as to shift of the playn words of Christ, spoken in the sixt of Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him: you say that dwelling in Christ is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the manducation. You say herein directly against S. Cyprian,<note place="margin">Cyprian. in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone de caena Domini.</note> who saith: <hi>quod mansio nostra in ipso, sit manducatio,</hi> that our dwelling in him, is the eating. And also against S. Augustine,<note place="margin">August. in Ioan. tra. 26.</note> whose wordes be these: <hi>Hoc est er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go manducare escam illam, &amp; illum bibere potum, in Christo manere, &amp; illum manentem in se habere</hi>: This is to eat that meat, and drinke that drinke, to dwell in Christ, &amp; to haue Christ dwelling in him. And although the eating and drinking of Christ, be here defined by the effect (for the very eating is the beleeuing) yet where so euer the eating is, the effect must be also, if the definition of S. Augustine be truely geuen. And therfore although good &amp; bad eate carnally with their teeth bread, being the Sacrament of Christes body, yet no man eateth his very flesh, which is spiritually eaten, but he that dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him.</p>
                  <p>And where in the end you referre the Reader to the declaration of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wordes, it is an euill sequele, you declare Christes wordes thus: Ergo, they be so ment. For by like reason might Nestorius haue preuayled against Cyrill, Arrius agaynst Alexander, and the Pope against Christ. For they al proue their errors by the doctrine of Christ after their own declarations, as you doe here in your corporall manducation. But of the manducation of Christs flesh, I haue spoken more fully in my fourth booke, the second, third and fourth chapters.</p>

                     <p>By these wordes of Christ, rehearsed of the Euangelistes, and by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine also of Saint Paule, which he confesseth that he receaued of Christ, two thinges specially are to be noted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note>First, that our Sauiour Christ called the materiall bread which he brake, his body: &amp; the wine which was the fruit of the vine, his bloud. And yet he spake not this to the intent that men should thinke that the material bread is his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body, or that his very body is materiall bread:<note place="margin">Christ called the materiall bread his body.</note> Neither that wine made of grapes is his very bloud, or that his very bloud is wine made of grapes. But to signifie vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> as S. Paul sayth, that the cuppe is a communion of Christes bloud that was shed for vs, and the bread is a communion of his flesh that was crucified for vs. So that although in the truth of his humain nature, Christ be in heauen,<note place="margin">Marck. vii.</note> and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father, yet whosoeuer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the bread in the Supper of the Lord, according to Christes institution and ordinaunce, is assured of Christes own promise and testament, that he is a member of his body, and receaueth the benefites of his passion, which he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for vs vpon the crosse. And likewise he that drinketh of that holy cuppe in the Supper of the Lord, according to Christes institution, is certified by Christes legacy and testament, that he is made partaker of the bloud of Christ


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7682:29"/>
which was shed for vs. And this ment S. Paule, when he sayth, is not the cup of blessing which we blesse, a communion of the bloud of Christ? Is not the can bread, which we breake, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Christ so that no man conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne or lightly esteeme this holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except he conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne also Christs body and bloud, and passe not whether he haue any felowship with him or no. And of those men S. Paule saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> that they eate and drink their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, because they esteme not the body of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The second thing which may be learned of the forsaid wordes of Christe and S. Paule is this:<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> that although none eateth the body of Christ and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hys bloud, but they haue eternall life (as apereth by the wordes before recited of S. Iohn) yet both the good and the bad doe eate and drynke the bread and wine, which be the Sacramentes of the same.<note place="margin">Euill men do eat the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but not the body of Christ.</note> But beside the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the good eate euerlasting life, the euill euerlasting death. Therfore S. Paule sayth: Who soeuer shall eate of the bread, or drinke of the cup of the Lord vnworthely, he shalbe gilty of the body and bloud of the Lord. Here S. paul saith not, that he that eateth the bread,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> or drinketh the cup of the Lord vn worthely, eateth &amp; drinketh the body &amp; bloud of the Lord: but is gilty of the body &amp; bloud of the Lord. But what he eateth &amp; drynketh S. Paul declareth saying: he that eateth &amp; drinketh vnworthely, eateth &amp; drinketh his own da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thus is declared the sum of al that scripture speketh of the eating &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king, both of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; also of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the same.</p>
                     <p>And as these thinges be most certaynly true,<note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> because they be spoken by Christ hym selfe, the auctor of all truth, and by hys holy Apostle S. Paule as he receaued them of Christ, so all doctrines contrary to the same, be moste certaynly false and vntrue, and of al Christen men to be eschued, because they be contrary to Gods word. And all doctrine concerning this matter, that is more then this, which is not grounded vpon Gods word, is of no necessity, neither ought the peoples heads to be busied, or their consciences troubled with the same.<note place="margin">These thinges suffice for a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mans faith concerning this Sacrament.</note> So that thinges spoken and done by Christ, and written by the holy Euangelists and S, Paule, ought to suffice the fayth of Christian people, as touching the doctrine of the Lordes Supper, and holy communion or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his body and bloud.</p>
                     <p>Which thing being well considered and wayed, shall be a iust occasion to pacifie and agree both parties, as well them that hetherto haue contemned or lightly esteemed it, as also them which haue hetherto for lacke of knowledge or otherwise, vngodly abused it.</p>
                     <p>Christ ordeyned the Sacrament to moue and stirre all men to frendshippe,<note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> loue, and concord, and to put away all hatred, variance, and discord, and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie a brotherly and vnfained loue between all them that be the members of Christ:<note place="margin">The Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to make loue and concord is turned into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and discord</note> But the deuil, the enemy of Christ and of all his members, hath so craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely iugled herein, that of nothing riseth so much contention, as of this holy Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>God graunt that al contention set aside, both the parties may come to this holy communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with such a liuely faith in Christ, and such an vnfained loue to all Christes members, that as they carnallye eate with their mouthes this Sacramentall bread, and drink the wine, so spiritually they may eate and drink the very flesh and bloud of Christ which is in heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of his father. And that finally by his meanes, they may enioy with him the glory and kingdome of heauen, Amen.</p>

                  <p>Now let vs consider the tertes of the Euangelistes, and S. Paul, which be brought in by the Author as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note>When they were eating, Iesus tooke bread, and when he had geuen thankes he brake it, gaue it to his disciples, and sayd: Take, eate, this is my body. And he tooke the cuppe, and when he had geuen thanks, he gaue it to them, saying: Drinke ye all of this, for this is my bloud of the new testament, that is shed for many for the remission of sinnes: But I say vnto you, I will not drinke henceforth of this fruite of the vine, vntill that day when I shall drinke it new with you in my fathers kingdome.</p>
                  <p>As they did eate, Iesus tooke bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gaue it to them,<note place="margin">Mark. 14.</note> and said: Take, eate, this is my body. And taking the cup, when he had geuen thankes, he gaue it to them, and they all dranke of it, and he said vnto them: This is my bloud of the new testament, which is shed for many. Uerely, I say vnto you, I wil drink no more of the fruite of the vine, vntill that day, that I drinke it new in the kingedome of God.</p>
                  <p>When the houre was come, he sate downe and the twelue Apostles with him, and he sayd vnto them: I haue greatly desired to eate this Pascha with you, before I suffer: for I say vnto you,<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> henceforth I wil not eate of it any more, vntill it be fulfilled in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And he tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and sayd: Take this, and deuide it among you, for I say vnto you, I wil not drinke of the fruit of the vine, vntil the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God come. And he tooke bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it, and gaue it vnto them, saying: This is my body, whith is geuen for you, this doe in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. Likewise also when he had supped, he tooke the cup, saying: This cuppe is the new testament in my bloud, which is shed for you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note>Is not the cup of blessing, which we blesse, a communion of the bloud of Christ? Is not the bread which we break, a communion of the body of Christ? We being many, are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of one bread, and of one cup.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note>That which I deliuered vnto you, I receaued of the Lord. For the Lord Iesus, the same night in the which he was betrayed, tooke bread, and when he had geuen thanks, he brake it, and sayd: Take, eate, this is my body, which is broaken for you, doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. Likewise also he tooke the cup when supper was done, saying: This cup is the new testament in my bloud: Doe this as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me, for as often as you shall eate this bread, and drinke of this cup ye shew forth the Lordes death till he come: wherefore who soeuer shall eat of this bread, or drinke of this cup vnworthely, shall be gilty of the body and bloud of the Lord. But let a man examine himselfe, and so eate of the bread, and drink of the cup. For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, because he maketh no difference of the Lordes body: For this cause, many are weake and sicke among you, and many doe sléepe.</p>
                  <p>After these tertes brought in, the author doth in the 4. chap. begin to trauers Christes intent,<note place="margin">The 4. vntruth that by these words <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> Christ ment not to make the bread his body.</note> that he intended not by these wordes (this is my body) to make the bread his body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but to signifie that such as receaue that worthely, be members of Christes body. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick church acknowledging Christ to be very God and very man, hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of these textes of scripture confessed truely Christes intent, and effectuall miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worke to make the bread his body, and the wine his bloud, to be verely meate, and verely drinke, vsing therin his humanitie, wherewith to féede vs, as he vsed the same,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wherewith to redéeme vs, and as he doth sanctifie vs by his holy spirite, so to sanctifie vs by his holy diuine flesh and bloud, and as life is renued in vs by the gift of Christes holy spirite, so life to be increased in vs by the gift of his holy flesh. So as he that beléeueth in Christ, and receaueth the Sacrament of beliefe, which is Baptisme, receaueth really Christes spirite: And likewise he that hauing Christes spirite, receaueth also the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christes body and bloud: Doth really receaue in the same, and also effectually, Christes very body and bloud. And therfore Christ in the institution of this Sacrament sayd, deliuering that he consecrated: This is my body. &amp;c. And likewise of the cuppe: This is my bloud. &amp;c. And although to mannes reason it séemeth straunge, that Christ standing, or sitting at the table, should deliuer them his body to be eaten: Yet when we


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7682:30"/>
remember Christ to be very God, we must graunt him omnipotent, and by reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> represse in our thoughtes all imaginations how it might be, and consider Christes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by his will, preached vnto vs by Scriptures, and beleued vniuersally in his church. But if it may now be thought séemely for vs to be so bold, in so high a mistery, to begin to discusse Christes intent: What should moue vs to thinke that Christ would vse so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wordes, without effectuall and reall signification, as be rehearsed touching the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>First, in the sixt of Iohn, when Christ had taught of the eating of him, being the bread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> descended from heauen, and declaring that eating to signifie beleeuing, whereat was no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> murmuring, that then he should enter to speak of geuing of his flesh to be eaten, and his bloud to be dronken, and to say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would geue a bread, that is, his flesh which he would geue for the life of the world. In which wordes Christ maketh mention of two giftes. and therfore as he is truth, must needes intend to fulfill them both. And therefore as we beleeue the gift of his flesh to the Iewes to be crucified: so we must beléeue the gift of his flesh to be eaten, and of that gifte, liuery, and seisme (as we say) to be made of him, that is in his promises faithfull (as Christ is) to be made in both. And therefore when he sayd in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> his Supper: Take, eate, this is my body, he must néedes intend plainly as his words of promise required: And these wordes in his Supper purporte to geue as really then his body to be eaten of vs, as he gaue his body in deede to be crucified for vs, aptly neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and conueniently for ech effect, and therefore in maner of geuing diuersly, but in the substance of the same geuen, to be as his wordes beare witnes, the same, and therefore sayd: this is my body y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shalbe betraied for you, expressing also the vse, when he said: take, eate, which words, in deliuering of material bread, had béen superfluous: for what should men doe with bread when they take it, but eate it, specially when it is broaken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> But as Cyrill sayth: Christ opened there vnto them the practise of that doctrine hée spake of in the sixt of S. Iohn, and because he sayd he would geue his flesh for food, which he would geue for the life of the world, he for fulfilling of his promise, sayd: Take, eate, this is my body, which wordes haue béen taught and beléeued to be of effect, and operato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Christ vnder the forme of bread to haue béen his very body. According whereunto S. Paule noteth the receauer to be gilty, when he doth not estéeme it our Lordes body, wherewith it pleaseth Christ to féede such as be in him regenerate, to the intent that as man was redéemed by Christ, suffering in the nature of his humanitie: so to purchase for man the kingdome of heauen, lost by Adams fall. Euen likewise in the nature of the same humanitye, geuing it to be eaten, he ordayned it to nourish man, and make him strong to walke, and continue his iorney, to enioy that kingdome. And therefore to set forth liuely vnto vs the communication of the substance of Christes most precious body in the Sacrament, and the same to be in déede deliuered, Christ vsed playn wordes, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Euangelistes. Saint Paule also rehearsed the same wordes in the same plain termes in the eleuenth to the Corinthians, and in the tenth, geuing (as it were) an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the effect, vseth the same proper wordes, declaring the effect to be the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christes body and bloud. And one thing is notable touching the Scripture, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="01"/> in such notable spéeches vttered by Christ, as might haue an ambiguity, the Euangelists by some circumstance declared it, or sometime opened it by playn interpretation: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ sayd he would dissolue the temple, and within thrée dayes build it agayne. The Euangelist by and by addeth for interpretation: This he sayd of the temple of his body. And when Christ sayd, he is Helias, and I am the true vine: The circumstaunce of the texte openeth the ambiguity.</p>
                  <p>But to shew that Christ should not mean of his very body when he so spake.<note place="margin">Neither Saint Paul. nor the Euangelistes, adde any words wherby to take away the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of bread and wine.</note> Neither S. Paule after, ne the Euangelistes in the place, adde any wordes or circumstaunces, whereby to take away the proper signification of the wordes (body) and (bloud) so as the same might seeme not in déede geuen (as the catholicke faith teacheth) but in signification as the author would haue it.

This is my body, this you graunt, but Smith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth it. And because all Smithes buildinges cleerely fall downe, if this his chiefe foundation be ouerthrowen, therfore must I first proue against Smith,<note place="margin">Against Smith</note> that Christ called the materiall bread his body, &amp; the wine which was the fruite of the vine,<note place="margin">Christ called bread his body,</note> his bloud. For why did you not prooue this my Lord (sayth Smith) would you that men should take you for a prophet, or for one that could not erre in his sayinges?</p>
                  <p>First I alleadge against Smithes negation, your affirmation, which, as it is more true in this point then his negation, so for your estimation it is able to counteruail his saying, if there were nothing els: &amp; yet if Smith had well pondered what I haue written in the second chap. of my second booke, and in the 7. and 8. chapters of my third book, he should haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this matter so fully prooued, that he neither is, nor neuer shalbe able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thereto. For I haue alleadged the scripture, I haue alleadged the consent of the old writers, holy fathers, and martirs, to prooue that Christ called bread his body, and wine his bloud. For the Euangelistes speaking of the Lords supper,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. Mark. 14. Luke. 22.</note> say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he took bread, blessed it, brake it, &amp; gaue it to his disciples, saying: This is my body: and of the wine he sayd: Take this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it among you, &amp; drinke it: this is my bloud. I haue alleadged Irene,<note place="margin">Ireneus.</note> saying that <hi>Christ confessed bread to be his body, and the cup to be his bloud</hi> I haue cyted Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who sayth in many places,<note place="margin">Tertullianus.</note> that <hi>Christ called bread his body.</hi> I haue brought in for the same purpose Cyprian,<note place="margin">Cyprianus.</note> who sayth that <hi>Christ called such bread as is made of many cornes ioyned together, his body: and such wine he named his bloud, as is pressed out of many grapes.</hi> I haue written the wordes of Epiphanius,<note place="margin">Epiphanius.</note> which be these, that <hi>Christ speakinge of a loafe which is round in fashion, and can neither see, heare, nor feele, said of it: This is my body.</hi> And S.

he called his bloud.</hi> All these Authors I alleadged, to prooue that Christ called bread his body, and wine his bloud.</p>
                  <p>Which because they speak the thinge so plainly as nothing can be more, and Smith seeth that he can deuise nothinge to answere these Authors, like a wily fox, he stealeth away by them softly, as he had a flea in his eare saying nothing to all these authors, but that they proue not my purpose. If this be a sufficient answere let the Reader be iudge, for in such sort I could make a short answere to Smithes whol booke in this one sentence that nothing that he sayth proueth his purpose. And as for proofes of his saying, Smith hath vtterly none but onely this fond reason: That if Christ had called bread his body, then should bread haue been crucified for vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ added these words: this is my body, which shalbe geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death for you. If such wise reason shall take place, a man may not take a loafe in his hand made of wheate that came out of Danske, and say this is wheate that grew in Danske, but it must follow, that the loafe grew in Danske. And if the wife shall say: this is butter of my own cow, Smith shall proue by this speach that her mayd milked butter. But to this fantasticall or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frantike reason, I haue spoaken more in mine aunswere to Smithes preface.</p>
                  <p>How be it, you haue taken a wiser way then this, graunting that Christ called bread his body, and wine his bloud: but adding thereto, that Christs calling was making. Yet here may they that be wise, learn by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way how euil fauoredly you and Smith agree among your selues.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as Smith hath not made answere vnto the Authors by me alleadged in this parte, I may iustly require that for lacke of answere in time and place where he ought to haue answered, he may be condemned as one that standeth mute. And being condemned in this his chiefe demur, he hath after nothing to answere at al. For this foundation being ouerthrown all the rest falleth down withall.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore now will I returne to aunswere you in this matter, which is the last of the euident, and manyfest vntruthes, wherof you appeach me.</p>
                  <p>I perceaue here how vntoward you be to learn the truth, being brought vp all your life in Papisticall errors. If you could forget your law, which hath been your chief profession and study from your youth, and specially the Canon law which purposely corrupteth the truth of Gods word you should be much more apte to vnderstand and receaue the secretes of holy scripture. But before those scales fall from your sawlish eyes, you neither can, nor will perceaue the true doctrine of this holy sacrament of Christes body &amp; bloud. But yet I shall doe as much as lyeth in me, to teach and instruct you, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion shall serue, so that the fault shall be either in your euill bringing vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in popery, or in your dulnes, or frowardnes, if you attaine not true vnderstanding of this matter.</p>

                  <p>And so the true confession and beleefe of the vniuersall Church, from the

beginning, is not such as you many times affirme,<note place="margin">Imuty to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> but neuer can proue: for the Catholicke church acknowledgeth no such diuision betweene Christes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> holy flesh and his spirite, that life is renued in vs by his holy spirite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by his holy flesh, but the true fayth confesseth that both be done by his holy spirite and flesh iointly together, as well the renouation, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace of our life. Wherfore you diminish here the effect of baptisme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not geuen only Christes spirite, but wholl Christ. And herein I will ioyne an issue with you.<note place="margin">Mine issue.</note> And you shall finde, that although you thinke I lacke law where with to follow my plea, yet I doubt not but I shall haue helpe of Gods word inough, to make al men perceiue that you be but a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diuine, so that for lacke of your proofes, I doubt not but the sentence shall be geuen vpon my side by all learned and indifferent iudges that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the matter which is in controuersy betweene vs.</p>
                  <p>And where you say that we must represse our thoughtes and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and by reason of Christes omnipotency,<note place="margin">Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</note> iudge his intent by his wil, it is a most certayne truth that Gods absolute and determinate wil is the chiefe gouernour of all thinges, and the rule wherby all things must be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and therto obey. But where (I pray you) haue you any such will of Christ, that he is really, carnally, corporally, &amp; naturally, vnder the formes of bread and wine: There is no such will of Christ set forth in the scripture as you pretend by a false vnderstanding of these wordes, this is my body. Why take you then so boldly vpon you, to say that this is Christs will and intent, when you haue no warrant in scripture to beare you?</p>
                  <p>It is not a sufficient proofe in Scripture, to say, God doth it, because he can doe it.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> For hee can doe many thinges which hee neither doth, nor will doe. He could haue sent moe then twelue Legions of Angels to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Christ from the wicked Iewes,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and yet he would not doe it. He could haue created the world and all thinges therin, in one moment of time, and yet his pleasure was to doe it in sixe dayes.</p>
                  <p>In all matters of our christen faith, written in holy Scripture, for our instruction and doctrin, how farre so euer they seeme discrepant from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, we must represse our imaginations, and consider Gods pleasure and will, and yeald therto, beleeuing him to be omnipotent: And that by his omnipotent power, such thinges are verelye so as holy scripture teacheth. Like as we beleeue that Christ was borne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessed virgin Mary, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out company of man: that our Sauyour Christ the third day rose agayn from death: that he in his humanity ascended into heauen: that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes at the day of iudgement shall rise agayne, and many other such like thinges, which we all that be true christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, do beleeue firmely, because we finde these thinges written iu Scripture. And therfore we (knowing Gods omnipotency) doe beleue that he hath brought some of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said things to passe already, and those things that are yet to come, he will by the same omnipotency without doubt likewise bring to passe.</p>
                  <p>Now if you can proue that your transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your fleshly presence of Christes body and bloud, your carnall eating and drinking of the same, your propitiatory sacrifice of the masse, are taught vs as plainly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the sayd articles of our faith be, then I will beleeue that it is so in deede. Otherwise, neither I nor any man that is in his right wittes, will beleeue your said articles, because God is omnipotent, and can make it so.


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7682:32"/>
For you might so vnder pretence of Gods omnipotency, make as many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith as you list if such arguments might take place, that God by his omnipotent power, can conuert the substance of bread and wine, in to the substance of his flesh and bloud: ergo he doth so in deede.</p>

                  <p>And here by this one place the Reader may gather of your own wordes, your intent and meaning in this your booke, if that be true which you sayd before, that euer where contention is, on what parte the Reader seeth in any one point an open manifest lye, there he may consider (whatsoeuer excuse be made of truth) yet the victory of truth not to be there intended.</p>

                  <p>But what you mean by these wordes, that Christ gaue in his supper, his body as really to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs, as he did to be crucified for vs, I vnderstand not, except you would haue Christ so really eaten of his Apostles at his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with their teeth, as he was after crucified, whipped, and thrust to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> hart with a speare.

                  <p>And so likewise when Christ brake the bread, and commaunded his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to eate it, and sayd: This is my body: and of the wine he said: Deuide it among you, drinke it, this is my bloud. No man that was there present was so fond, but he knew well that the bread was not Christes body, nor the wine his bloud. And therfore they might well know that Christ called the bread his body, and the wine his bloud for some figure, similitude, and property of the bread and wine vnto his flesh and bloud: For as bread and wine be foodes to nourish our bodies, so is the flesh and bloud of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyour Christ, (being annexed vnto his Deity,) the euerlasting food of our soules.</p>
                  <p>And although the Euangelistes in that place doe not fully expresse the words in this sence, yet adioyning the sixt chapter of Iohn (speaking of the spirituall manduratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ) to the circumstances of the text in the three Euangelistes, (reciting Christs last Supper) the wholl matter is fully ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered as olde authors of the Church haue declared. For doe not the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the texte, both before and after the eating and drinking, declare that there is very bread and wine? Is not that which is broken and eaten, bread? And that which is deuided, dronken? And the fruit of the vine, is it not very wine? And doth not the nature of Sacramentes require that the sensible elements should remain in their proper nature, to signifie an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mistery, and secret working of God inwardly, as the sensible elementes

be ministred outwardly? And is not the visible and corporall feeding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread and wine, a conuenient and apte figure and similitude to put vs in remembraunce, and to admonish vs how we be fedde inuisibly and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by the flesh and bloud of Christ, God, and man? And is not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment taken away, when the element is taken away? Or can the accidents of the element be the Sacrament of substanciall feeding? Or did euer any olde author say, that the accidentes were the Sacramentall signes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the substances?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for the conclusion of your matter, here I would wish that you would once truely vnderstand me. For I doe not say that Christes body &amp; bloud be geuen to vs in signification, and not in deed. But I doe as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speake as I can, that Christes body and bloud, be geuen to vs in deede, yet not corporally, and carnally, but spiritually, and effectually, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your selfe within twelue lines after.</p>

                  <p>The Author vttereth a great many wordes, from the eyght to the seuententh chapiter of the fyrst booke, declaryng spirituall hunger and thirst, and the releuing of the same by spyrituall feeding in Christe, and of Christe, as we constantly beleue in him, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of whiche beliefe, the author would haue the Sacramentes of Baptisme, and of the body and bloud of Christ, to be adminicles as it were, &amp; that we by them be preached vnto, as in water, breade and wyne, and by them all our sinnes (as it were) spoken vnto, or properly touched, which matter in the grosse, although there be some wordes by the way not tollerable, yet if those wordes set apart, the same were in the summe graunted, to be good teachyng and holsome exhortation, it contayneth so no more but good matter, not well applyed. For the Catholicke churche that professeth the truth of the presence of Christes body in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, would therewith vse that declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hunger of Christ, and that spirituall refreshing in Christ, with theffect of Christes passion and death, and the same to be the onely meane of mans regeneratio, and feeding also, with the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of that feeding, from bodilye feeding, for continuing thys earthly lyfe. But thys toucheth not the principal poynt that should be intreated. Whether Christ so ordered to feede such as be regenerate in him, to geue to them in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the same his body, that he gaue to be crucified for vs. The good man is fed by fayth, and by merites of Christes passion, being the mean of the gift of that fayth, and other giftes also, and by the suffering of the body of Christ, and shedding of his most precious bloud on the altar of the Crosse: which worke and passion of Christ is preached vnto vs, by wordes aud Sacramentes, and the same doctrine receaued of vs by fayth, and theffect of it also. And thus farre goeth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this author.</p>
                  <p>But the Catholicke teaching, by the scriptures, goeth further, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing Christ to feed such as be regenerate in him, not onely by his body and bloud, but also with his body and bloud, deliuered in this Sacrament, by hym in deede to vs which the faythfull, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, receaue with their faith and with their mouth also, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those special deinties, be fed specially at Christs table: And so God doth not onely preach in his Sacraments, but also worketh in them, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, and in sensible thinges geueth celestiall giftes, after the doctrine of eche Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as in baptisme the spirite of Christ, and in the Sacrament of the altar, the very body and bloud of Christ, accordinge to the playne sence of his wordes whiche he spake: This is my body. &amp;c.

                  <p>And because this may the more euidently appeare to the reader, I shall rehearse my wordes heare agayne.</p>
                  <p>Although in this treatie of the Sacrament of the body &amp; bloud of our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ,<note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> I haue already sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared the institution &amp; meaning of the same, according to the very wordes of the Gospell and of saint Paule, yet it shall not be in vayne somwhat more at large to declare the same, according to the minde, as well of holy scripture, as of olde auncient authours, and that so sincerely &amp; plainly, without doubts, ambiguities, or vain questions, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry simple and vnlearned people, may easily vnderstand the same, and be edified thereby.</p>
                  <p>And this by Gods grace is myne only intent and desire, that the flocke of Christ dispersed in this Realme (among whome I am appointed a speciall pastour) may no longer lacke the commodite and fruite, whiche springeth of this heauenly knowledge. For the more clerely it is vnderstood the more swet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fruite, comfort, and edification it bringeth to the godly receauers therof. And to the clere vnderstandyng of this Sacrament, diuers thinges must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
                  <p>First, that as all men of them selues be sinners, and through sinne be in gods wrath,<note place="margin">Cap. 9. The spirituall hunger &amp; thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the soul.</note> banished farre away from him, condemned to hell and euerlasting da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and none is clerely innocent, but Christ alone: so euery soule inspired by god, is desirous to be deliuered from sinne and hell, and to obteine at Gods handes, mercy, fauour, righteousnes, and euerlasting saluation.</p>
                  <p>And this earnest and great desire is called in scripture, The hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger and thirst of the soule:<note place="margin">Eph. 2. Rom. 3:</note> with which kinde of hunger Dauid was taken, when he sayde: As an hart longeth for springes of water, so doth <hi>my soule long</hi> for thee O God. <hi>My soule thyrsteth</hi> after God,<note place="margin">Psal. 41. Psal. 62.</note> who is the well of lyfe. <hi>My soule thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth</hi> for thee, my flesh wisheth for thee.</p>
                  <p>And this hunger the seely poore sinfull soule is driuen vnto, by meanes of the law, which sheweth vnto her the horriblenes of sinne, the terror of Gods indignation, and the horror of death and euerlasting damnation.</p>
                  <p>And when she seeth nothing but damnation for her offences,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. Rom. 7.</note> by iustice and accusation of the law, and this damnation is euer before her eies, then in this great distresse the soule being pressed with heuinesse and sorrow, seeketh for some comfort,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and desireth some remedy for her miserable and sorowfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. And this felyng of her damnable condition, and greedy desire of refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, is the spirituall hunger of the soule.</p>
                  <p>And who so euer hath this godly hunger,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> is blessed of God, and shall haue meate and drinke inough, as Christ himselfe sayd: Blessed be they that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger &amp; thyrst for righteousnes, for they shalbe filled ful. And on the other side, they that see not their owne sinfull and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable estate, but thinke themselues holy inough, and in good case and condition inough, as they haue no spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hunger, so shall they not be fed of God with any spirituall foode. For as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God feedeth them that be hungry,<note place="margin">Luke. 1.</note> so doth he send away empty all that be not hungry.</p>
                  <p>But this hunger and thyrst is not easily perceiued of the carnall man. For when he heareth the holy ghost speake of meate and drinke, his mynde is by


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7682:35"/>
and by in the kytchen and buttery, and he thinketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his dishes and pottes, his mouth and his belly.</p>
                  <p>But the Scripture in sundry places vseth speciall wordes, whereby to draw our grosse mindes from the phantasying of our teeth and belly, and from this carnall and fleshly imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the Apostles, and Disciples of Christ, when they were yet carnall, knew not what was ment by this kinde of hunger, and meate, and therfore when they desired him to eate, (to withdraw their minds from carnall meat) he sayd vnto them: I haue other meate to eate which you know not.<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> And why knew they it not? Forsooth because their mindes were grosse as yet, and had not receaued the fulnes of the Spirite. And therfore our Sauyour Christ minding to draw them from this grossenes, tolde them of an other kinde of meate then they fantasied (as it were) rebuking them, for that they perceiued not that there was any other kinde of eating and drinking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that eating and drinking which is with the mouth and throate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note>Likewise when he said to the woman of Samaria: Who soeuer shall drink of that water that I shal geue him, shal neuer be thirsty again. They that heard him speak those words, might well perceiue that he went about to make them well acquainted with an other kinde of drinking, then is the drinking with the mouth and throate. For there is no such kinde of drinke, that with once drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can quench the thirst of a mans body for euer. Wherefore, in saying he shall neuer be thirsty agayn: he did draw their mindes from drinking with the mouth, vnto another kinde of drinking wherof they knew not, and vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of thirsting, wherewith as yet they were not acquainted. And also when our Sauyour Christ said, he that commeth to me shall not hunger,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> and he that beleeueth on me shall neuer be thirsty: he gaue them a plain watche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worde, that there was another kinde of meate and drinke, then that wherwith he fed them at the other syde of the water, and an other kynde of hungryng and thirstyng, then was the hungryng and thyrstyng, of the bodye. By these wordes therfore he droue the people to vnderstand an other kynde of eatyng and drynking, of hungring and thirsting, then that whiche belongeth onely for the preseruation of temporall life.</p>
                  <p>Now then as the thing that comforteth the body, is called meate and drink, of a lyke sorte the scripture calleth the same thinge that comforteth the soule, meate and drinke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 10.</note>Wherfore as here before in the first note is declared the hunger &amp; drought of the soule,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. The spirituall foode of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule.</note> so is it nowe secondly to be noted, what is the meate, drinke and foode of the soule.</p>
                  <p>The meate, drinke, foode and refreshing of the soule, is our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.</note> as he sayd himselfe: Come vnto me all you that trauaile and be laden, and I will refresh you. And, If any man be dry (sayth he) let him come to me and drinke. He that beleueth in me,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> floudes of water of life shall flowe out of hys bellye. And, I am the bread of life (saith Christe,) he that commeth to me, shall not be hungry: and he that beleeueth in me, shall neuer be dry. For as meate and drinke do comfort the hungry body, so doth the death of Christes body and the shedding of his bloud comforte the soule, when she is after her sorte, hungry. What thinge is it that comforteth and nourisheth the body. Forsooth meate and drinke. By what names then shall we call the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ (which do comfort and nourish the hungry soule) but by the names of meate and drynke? And this symilitude caused our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7682:35"/>
to say: my flesh is very meate, and my bloud is very drinke. For there is no kinde of meate that is comfortable to the soule, but only the death of Christes blessed body. Nor no kinde of drinke that can quench her thirst, but only the bloudsheading of our Sauyour Christ, which was shed for her offences. For as there is a carnall generation, and a carnall feeding and nourishment, so is there also a spirituall generation, and a spirituall feeding.</p>
                  <p>And as euery man by carnall generation of father and mother, is carnally begotten and borne vnto this mortall life: so is euery good christian spiritually borne by Christ vnto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>And as euery man is carnally fedde and nourished in his body by meat and drinke, euen so is euery good christian man spiritually fed and nourished in his soule, by the flesh and bloud of our Sauyour Christ.</p>
                  <p>And this Christ hymselfe teacheth vs in thys syxt of Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> saying: Verely verely I say vnto you, excepte ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drynke hys bloud, you haue no life in you. <hi>Who so eateth my flesh and drynketh my bloude, hath eternall life, and I will rayse him vp at the last daye:</hi> For <hi>my flesh is very meate, and my bloud is very drynke.</hi> He that eateth my fleshe, and drynketh my bloude dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, and I in hym, As the liuing father hath sent me, and I liue by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen so <hi>he that eateth me, shall lyue by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this S. Paul confessed him selfe: saying: That I haue life, I haue it by faith in the Sonne of God. And now it is not I that liue,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> but Christ liueth in me.</p>
                  <p>The thyrd thyng to be noted is this, that although our Sauiour Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth hys fleshe and bloud to meate and drynke,<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> yet he farre passeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all corporall meates and drynkes: For although eorporall meates and drynkes do nourish and continue our life here in this world,<note place="margin">Christ farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall foode.</note> yet they begin not our life. For the beginning of our lyfe, we haue of our fathers and mothers and the meate after we be begotten, doth feede and nourish vs, and so preserueth vs for a tyme. But our sauiour Christ is both the first beginner of our spirituall lyfe, (who first begetteth vs vnto God his father) and also afterward he is our lyuely foode and nourishment.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer meate and drynke doe feede and nourishe onely our bodyes, but CHRISTE is the true and perfect nourishment both of body and soule. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, bodely foode preserueth the lyfe but for a tyme, but Christ is such a spirituall and perfect foode, that he preserueth both body and soule for euer: as he sayde vnto Martha: I am a resurrection and lyfe. He that beleueth in me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he dye yet shall he lyue. And hee that lyueth and beleeueth in me,<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.</note> shal not dye for euer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly it is to be noted, that the true knowledge of these things, is the true knowledge of Christ,<note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> and to teache these thinges, is to teache Christ. and the beleuing and feelyng of these thinges,<note place="margin">The sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were ordayned to confirme our faith.</note> is the beleuyng and feelyng of Christ in our hartes. And the more clearely we see, vnderstand and beleue these thinges, the more clearely we see and vnderstand Christ, and haue more fully our fayth and comfort in hym.</p>
                  <p>And although our carnal generation and our carnal nourishment, be known to all men by dayly experyence, and by our common senses, yet this our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall generation and our spirituall nutrition, be so obscure and hyd vnto vs, that we cannot attayne to the true and perfect knowledge and feelyng of them, but onely by fayth, which must be grounded vpon Goddes most holy worde and sacramentes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7682:36"/>And for this consideration our Sauiour Christ hath not only set forth these thyngs most playnly in his holy word, that we may heare them with our eares, but he hath also ordayned one visible sacrament of spirituall regeneration in water, and an other visible sacrament of spirituall nourishment, in bread and wine, to the intent, that as much as is possible for man, we may see Christ with our eyes, smell hym at our nose, taste hym with our mouthes, grope hym with our handes, and perceiue hym with all our senses. For as the word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, putteth Christ into our eares, so likewise these elementes of water, bread and wyne, ioyned to Gods word, do after a sacramentall maner, put Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our eyes, mouthes, handes, and all our senses.</p>
                  <p>And for this cause Christ ordeyned baptisme in water, that as surely as we se, feele and touch water with our bodyes, and be washed with water, so assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought we to beleue, when we be baptised, that Christ is veryly present with vs, and that by him we be newly borne agayne spiritually, and wafhed from our sinnes, and grafted in the stocke of Christes owne body, and be apparailed, clothed, and harnessed with hym, in such wise, that as the deuill hath no power agaynst Chryst, so hath he none agaynst vs, so long as we remayne, grafted in that stocke, and be clothed with that apparell, and harnessed with that armour. So that the washing in water of baptisme, is as it were shewing of Christ before our eyes, and a sensible touching, feelyng and gropyng of hym, to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the inwarde fayth, which we haue in hym.</p>
                  <p>And in like maner Christ ordeined the sacrament of hys bodye and bloud in bread and wine, to preach vnto vs, that as our bodyes be fed, nourished and preserued with meate and drynke (so as touching our spirituall life towardes God) we be fed, nourished and preserued by the body and bloud of our Sauiour Christ, and also that he is such a preseruation vnto vs, that neither the deuils of hell, nor eternall death, nor sinne, can be able to preuayle agaynst vs, so long as by true and constant faith, we be fed and nourished with that meate and drynk. And for this cause Christ ordeined this sacrament in bread and wine (whiche we eate and drynke,<note place="margin">Hugo de S. vict. de Sacramentis tractat. 6. cap. 3.</note> and be chiefe nutrimentes of our body (to thintent, that as surely as we see the bread and wine, with our eyes, smell them with our noses, touch them with our handes, and taste them with our mouthes, so assuredlye ought we to beleue, that Christ is a spirituall lyfe and sustinaunce of our soules, like as the sayd bread and wine is the foode and sustinance of our bodyes. And no lesse ought we to doubt, that our soules be fed and liue by Christ, then that our bodies be fed and liue by meate and drinke. Thus our sauiour Christ, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs to be in this world (as it were) but babes and weakelinges in fayth, hath ordeyned sensible signes and tokens, whereby to allure and drawe vs to more strength and more constant fayth in hym. So that the eatyng and drynkyng of thys sacramentall bread and wine, is as it were shewing of Christe before our eies, a smellyng of hym with our noses, felyng and gropyng of hym with our handes, and an eatyng, chawing, digestyng and feedyng vpon hym to our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall strength and perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note>Fiftely it is to be noted, that although there be many kindes of meates and drinkes, which feede the body, yet our Sauiour Christ (as many auncyent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors write) ordayned this sacrament of our spiritual feding in bread and wine,<note place="margin">Wherfore this sacrament was ordayned in bred and wine.</note> rather then in other meates and drynkes, because that bread and wine doe most liuely represent vnto vs the spirituall vnion and knot of all faythful people, as well vnto Christ, as also amonges them selues.

                  <p>Sixtly it is to be noted, that as the bread and wine whiche we doe eate,<note place="margin">Cap. 14.</note> be turned into our fleshe and bloud, and be made our very fleshe and very bloud, and so be ioyned and myxed with our fleshe and bloud,<note place="margin">The vnity of Christes misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body.</note> that they be made one whole body togither: euen so be all faythfull christians, spiritually turned into the body of Christ, and so be ioyned vnto Christe, and also togither amonge them selues, that they doe make but one misticall body of Christe, as S.

And as the branches of a tree, or member of a body, if they be dead; or cut of, they neither liue, nor receaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nourishment, or sustinance of the body, or tree: so likewise vngodly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people, which be cut of from Christes misticall body, or be dead members of the same, doe not spiritually feede vpon Christes body and bloud, nor haue any life, strength, or sustentation thereby.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Cap. 14.

For when we be made all partakers of this one table, what ought we to thinke, but that we be all members of one spirituall body, wherof Christ is the head, that we be ioyned together in one Christ, as a great number of graynes of corne be ioyned together in one loafe. Surely, they haue very hard and stony hartes, which with these thinges be not moued: and more cruell and vnreasonable be they then bruit beastes, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perswaded to be good to their christen brethren and neighboures, for whom Christ suffered death, when in this Sacrament they be put in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that the Sonne of God bestowed his life for his enemies. For we see by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that eating and drinking together maketh frendes, and continueth frendshippe: much more then ought the table of Christ to moue vs so to doe. Wilde beastes and birdes be made gentile by geuing them meate and drinke, why then should not christen men waxe meeke and gentle with this heauenly meate of Christ? Hereunto we be stirred, and moued, as well by the bread, and wine in this holy Supper, as by the wordes of holy Scripture, recited in the same. Wherefore, whose hart soeuer this holy Sacrament, Communion, and Supper of Christ, wil not kindle with loue vnto his neighboures, and cause him to put out of his hart, all enuy, hatred, and malice, and to graue in the same all amity, frendshippe, and concord, he deceaueth him selfe, if he thinke that he hath the spirite of Christ dwelling within him.</p>

For seeing that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was ordeyned in bread and wine (which be foodes for the body) to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and declare vnto vs our spirituall foode by Christ, then if our corporal fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the bread and wine, be but fantasticall (so that there is no bread, nor wine there in deede to feede vpon, although they appeare there to be) then it doth vs to vnderstand, that our spirituall feeding in Christ, is also fantastical, and that in deede we feede not of him: which sophistry is so deuilish and wicked, and so much iniurious to Christ, that it could not come from any other person, but only from the Deuill himselfe, and from his specyall minister Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>The eight thing that is to be noted, is, that this spiritual meat of Christs body and bloud,<note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> is not receaued in the mouth, and digested in the stomack (as corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meates and drinkes commonly be) but it is receaued with a pure hart, and a sincere fayth.<note place="margin">The spirituall eating in with the hart, not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the teeth.</note> And the true eating and drinking of the said body and bloud of Christ, is with a constant, and liuely faith to beleeue, that Christ gaue his body, and shed his bloud vpon the crosse for vs, and that he doth so ioyne, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate him selfe to vs, that he is our head, and we his members, and flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, hauing him dwelling in vs, &amp; we in him. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in standeth the wholl effecte and strength of this Sacrament. And this faith God worketh inwardly in our hartes by his holy Spirit, &amp; confirmeth the same outwardly to our eares, by hearing of his worde: and to our other sences, by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking of the Sacramentall bread and wine in his holy Supper.</p>
                  <p>What thing then can be more comfortable to vs, then to eate this meate, &amp; drinke this drinke? whereby Christ certifieth vs, that we be spiritually, &amp; truely, fed and nourished by him, and that we dwell in him, and he in vs. Can this be shewed vnto vs more plainly, then when he sayth him selfe: He that eateth me, shall liue by me?<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, who so euer doth not contemne the euerlasting life, how can he but highly esteeme this Sacrament? how can he but imbrace it, as a sure pledge of his saluation? And when he seeth godly people deuoutly receaue the same, how can he but be desirous oftentimes to receaue it with them? Surely no man that well vnderstandeth, and diligently wayeth these thinges, can be without a great desire to come to this holy Supper.</p>
                  <p>All men desire to haue Gods fauour, and when they know the contrary, that they be in his indignation, and cast out of his fauour, what thing can comfort them? how be their minds vexed? what trouble is in their consciences? all Gods creatures seeme to be against them, and doe make them afrayd, as thinges being ministers of Gods wrath and indignation towardes them, and rest or comforte can they finde none, neither within them, nor without them. And in this case they doe hate as well God, as the Deuill. God, as an vnmercifull and extreeme Iudge, and the Deuill as a most malicious and cruell tormentor.</p>
                  <p>And in this sorrowfull heauines, holy Scripture teacheth them, that our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father can by no meanes be pleased with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again, but by the Sacrifice, and death of his only begotten Sonne, whereby God hath made a perpetuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and peace with vs, doth pardon the sinnes of them that beleue in him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them his children, and geueth them to his first begotten Sonne Christ, to be incorporate into him, to be saued by him, and to be made heires of heauen

with him. And in the receauing of the holy Supper of our Lord, we be put in remembrance of this his death, and of the wholl mistery of our redemption. In the which Supper, is made mention of his testament, and of the aforesaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of vs with Christ, and of the remission of our sinnes, by his Sacrifice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore in this Sacrament, (if it be rightly receaued with a true faith) we be assured that our sinnes be forgiuen, and the league of peace and the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is confirmed betwene him and vs, so that who so euer by a true fayth doth eate Christs flesh and drink his bloud, hath euerlasting life by him. Which thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we feele in our hartes, at the receauing of the Lords supper, what thing can be more ioyfull, more pleasaunt, or more comfortable vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>All this to be true, is most certayne by the wordes of Christ him selfe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did first institute his holy Supper, the night before hys death, as it appeareth as well by the wordes of the Euangelistes, as of S. Paule. Do this (sayth Christ) as often as you drinke it,<note place="margin">Luke. 21.</note> in remembraunce of me. And S. Paule sayth: As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as you eate this bread and drinke this cup,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. Mat. 26. Luke. 22. Mark. 14.</note> you shall shew the Lordes death vntill he come. And agayne Christ sayd: This cup is a newe testament in myne own bloud, which shall be shed for the remission of sinnes.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine here recyted, may suffice for all that be humble and Godlye, and seeke nothing that is superfluous, but that is necessary and profitable. And therfore vnto such persons may be made here an ende of this booke. But vnto them that be contentious Papistes and Idolaters, nothing is inough.

                     <note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note>But these thinges cannot manifestly appeare to the reader, except the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall poyntes be first set our, wherein the Papistes vary from the truth of gods word,<note n="4" place="margin">principall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes.</note> which be chiefly fower.</p>
                  <p>First the Papistes say, that in the supper of the Lord, after the wordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration (as they call it) there is none other substaunce remaining, but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of Christes flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">The first is of the presence of Christ.</note> so that there remaineth neither bread to be eaten, nor wine to be dronken. And although there be the colour of bread and wine, the sauour, the smell, the bignesse, the fashion, and all other (as they call them) accidentes, or qualities and quantitees of bread and wine, yet (say they) there is no very bread nor wine, but they be turned into the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ. And this conuersion they call transubstantiation, that is to say, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of one substance into an other substance. And although all the accidentes, both of the bread and wine, remaine still, yet (say they) the same accidentes, be in no maner of thing, but hang alone in the ayre, without any thing to stay them vpon. For in the body and bloud of Christ (say they) these accidentes cannot be, nor yet in the ayre, for the body and bloud of Christ and the ayre, be neither of that bignesse, fashion, smell, nor colour, that the bread and wine be. Nor in the bread and wine (say they) these accidentes can not be, for the substance of bread and wine (as they affirm) be clean gone. And so there remaineth white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but nothing is white: there remaineth colours, but nothing is colored ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: there remaineth roundnes, but nothing is round: and there is bignes, and yet nothing is bigge: there is sweetenes, without any sweet thing: softnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any soft thing: breaking, without any thing broaken: diuision, without any thing deuided: and so other qualities and quantities, without any thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them. And this doctrine they teach as a necessary article of our faith.</p>
                  <p>But it is not the doctrine of Christ, but the subtile inuention of Antichrist, first decreed by Innocent the third,<note place="margin">Innocent. 3.</note> and after more at large set forth by schoole authors, whose study was euer to defend and set abroad to the world, all such matters,<note place="margin">De summa trin. &amp; fide catholica firmiter, paragra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pho. vna.</note> as the bishoppe of Rome had once decreed. And the Deuill by his minister Antichrist, had so daseled the eyes of a great multitude of christian people in these latter dayes, that they sought not for their faith at the cleere light of Gods word, but at the Romish Antichrist, beleeuing what so euer he prescribed vnto them, yea though it were against all reason, al sences, &amp; Gods most holy word also. For els he could not haue been very Antichrist in deede, except he had been so repugnant vnto Christ, whose doctrine is clean contrary to this doctrin of Antichrist. For Christ teacheth that we receaue very bread, and wine, in the most blessed Supper of the Lord, as Sacraments to admonish vs, that as we be fedde with bread and wine bodely, so we be fedde with the


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7682:38"/>
body and bloud of our sauiour Christ spirituallye. As in our baptisme we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue very water, to signify vnto vs that as water is an eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to wash the body outwardly, so be our soules washed by the holy ghost inwardly.</p>
                  <p>The second principall thinge,<note place="margin">The second is of the presence of Christ in the Sacrament.</note> wherein the Papistes vary from the truth of gods worde, is this: They say, that the very naturall fleshe and bloud of Christ, which suffred for vs vpon the crosse, &amp; sitteth at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen, is also really, substancially, corporally, &amp; naturally, in or vnder the accidents of the sacramental bread &amp; wine, which they call the fourmes of bread and wine. And yet here they vary not a litle among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, for some say, that the very naturall body of Christ is there, but not naturally, nor sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly. And other say, that it is there naturally and sensibly, and of the same bignes and fashion that it is in heauen, and as the same was borne of the blessed virgine Mary, and that is there broken and torne in peces with our teeth. And this appeareth partly by the schole authors, &amp; partely by the confession of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius,<note place="margin">De co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secra, dist. 1.

But the true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith, grounded vpon Gods most infallible word, teacheth vs, that our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ (as concerning his mans nature and bodily presence) is gone vp vnto heauen,<note place="margin">Christ is not corporally in earth.</note> and sitteth at the right hand of his father, and there shall he tary vntill the worldes ende, at what time he shall come againe to iudge both the quick and the dead, as he saith him self in many Scriptures. I forsake the world (saith he) and goe to my Father.<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> And in another place he saith: You shal euer haue poore men among you, but me shall not you euer haue.<note place="margin">Math. 26. Mark. 24.</note> And againe hee saith: Many hereafter shall come and say, looke here is Christ, or looke there he is, but beleeue them not. And S. Peter saith in the Actes, that heauen must receaue Christ,<note place="margin">Actes. 3.</note> vntill the time that all thinges shall be restored. And S. Paule writing to the Colossians,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3.</note> agreeth hereto saying: Seeke for thinges that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboue, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of the Father. And Saint Paul speaking of the very Sacrament,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> saith: As often as you shall eate this bread, and drinke this cuppe, shew forth the Lordes death vntill he come. Till he come, saith Saint. Paule, signifying, that he is not there corporally present. For what speech were this? or who vseth of him that is already present, to say: vntill he come? For, vntill he come, signifieth that he is not yet present. This is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke faith, which we learne from our youth, in our common Creede, and which Christ taught, the Apostles followed, and the Martirs confirmed with their bloud.</p>
                  <p>And although Christ in his humain nature, substantially, really, corporally, naturally, and sensibly, be present with his Father in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet Sacramentally, and Spiritually, he is here present. For in water, bread, and wine, he is present, as in signes and Sacramentes: but he is in deede Spiritually in those faithfull, christian people, which according to Christes ordinaunce be baptized, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the holy communion, or vnfainedlye beleeue in him. Thus haue you heard the second principall article, wherein the Papistes vary from the truth of Gods word, and from the Catholick faith. Now the third thing, wherein they vary, is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7682:39"/>The Papistes say, that euill and vngodly men, receaue in this Sacrament, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> very body and bloud of Christ, and eate and drinke the self same thing, that the good and godly men doe.<note place="margin">The third is, that euill men eate and drinke the very body and bloud of Christ.</note> But the truth of Gods word is contrary, that all those that be godly members of Christ, as they corporally eate the bread, and drinke the wine, so spiritually they eate and drinke Christes very flesh and bloud. And as for the wicked members of the Deuill, they eate the Sacramental bread, and drinke the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall wine, but they doe not spiritually eate Christs flesh, nor drinke his bloud, but they eate and drinke their own damnation.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing,<note place="margin">The fourth, is of the dayly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ.</note> wherein the Popish priestes dissent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manifest word of God, is this. They say that they offer Christ euery day for remission of sinne, and distribute by their Masses, the merits of Christs passion. But the Prophets, Apostles, and Euangelists, doe say that Christ himselfe in his own person made a sacrifice for our sinnes vpon the Crosse, by whose woundes all our diseases were healed, and our sinnes pardoned, and so did neuer no priest, man nor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, but he, nor he dyd the same neuer more then once. And the benefit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is in no mannes power to gyue vnto any other, but euery man must receaue it at Christes handes himselfe,<note place="margin">Ibacuk. 2.</note> by his own fayth and beliefe, as the Prophet sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Here Smith findeth him selfe much greeued at two false reports, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he saith that I vntruely charge the Papists. One when I write that some say, that the very naturall body of Christ is in the Sacrament natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,<note place="margin">D. Smith. Some say that Christ in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and sensibly, which thing Smith vtterly denieth any of them to say, and that I falsely lay this vnto their charge. And moreouer it is very false, (saith he) that you lay vnto our charges, that we say, that Christes body is in the Sacrament as it was borne of the virgin, and that it is broken, and torne in peeces with our teeth. This also Smith saith is a false report of me.</p>
                  <p>But whether I haue made any vntrue report or no, let the bookes be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. As touching the first, the Bishop writeth thus in his booke of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils sophistry, the 14. leafe. Good men were neuer offended with breaking of the hoost, which they daily saw, being also perswaded Christes body to be present in the Sacrament naturally, and really. And in the 18. leafe he saith these words, Christ, God and man, is naturally present in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in ten, or twelue places of this his last booke, he saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is present in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>naturally, corporally, sensibly, and carnally,</hi> as shall appeare euidently in the reading therof.

if coniectures may haue place, I think the Bishop himselfe would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to altar the booke in the printing, and then set it forth with this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that it was the same booke that was exhibited by his own hand for his defence, to the kinges maiesties commissioners at Lamhith.</p>
                  <p>And I thinke the Printer, being a French man, would not haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised so false a deed of his own head, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he should haue no thanks at all, but be accused of the Author as a falsifier of his booke.</p>
                  <p>Now for as much as it is not like, that either the Bishop, or the Printer, would play any such pranks, it must then be some other, that was of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in the printing of the booke, which being printed in Fraunce, (whether you be now fled from your own natiue countrey) what person is more like to haue done such a noble acte, then you? who being so full of craft and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in your own countrey, shew your selfe to be no changeling, where so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you become. And the rather it seemeth to me to be you, then any other person, because that the booke is altred in this word (naturally) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which word standeth the reproofe of your saying. For he saith, that Christ is in the Sacrament naturally, and you deny that any man so saith, but that Christ is there supernaturally. Who is more like therefore to change in his booke (naturally) into supernaturall, then you whom the matter toucheth, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els? but whether my coniectures be good in this matter, I will not determine, but referre it to the iudgement of the indifferent Reader.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the second vntrue report, which I should make of the Papistes,<note place="margin">Some say that Christ is rent and torne with teeth in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> I haue alleadged the wordes of Berengarius recantation, appointed by Pope Nicholas the 2. and written <hi>De consecrat dist. 2.</hi> which be these, that not only the Sacraments of bread and wine, but also the very flesh and bloud of our Lord Iesu Christ, <hi>are sensibly handeled of the Priest in the Altar, broaken, and torne with the teeth of the faithfull people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Reader may see, that I misreport not the Papists, nor charge them with any other words then they doe write, that is to say, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ is naturally, and sensibly, in the Sacrament, and broken, and torne in peeces with our teeth.</p>
                  <p>But (saith Smith) the meaning of Berengarius in his recantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was otherwise, that the formes of bread and wine are broaken, and torne with our teeth, but Christ is receaued wholly, without breaking of his body, or tearing with our teeth. Well, what so euer the meaninge of Berengarius was, his wordes be as I report, so that I make no false report of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, nor vntruely charge them with that they say not. But how should men know what the Papists meane, when they say one thing, and meane another? For Berengarius said, that not only the Sacramentes be broken and torne with our teeth (and you say he ment contrary, that only the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes be broken and torne with our teeth.) Berengarius said, that also the very flesh and bloud of Christ be broken and torne, (and you say, he ment clean contrary, that the flesh and bloud of Christ be not broaken, and torne.) Well, then would I faine learne, how it may be knowen what the Papists meane, if they mean yea, when they say nay, and mean nay, when they say yea.</p>
                  <p>And as for S. Iohn Chrisostom, and other old authors, by whom you would excuse this manner of speech, they helpe you herein nothing at all. For not one of them speake after this sorte, that Berengarius doth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7682:40"/>
though they say sometimes that we see Christ, touch him, and breake him, (vnderstanding that speech not of Christ him selfe, but of the Sacraments which represent him) yet they vse no such forme of speech, as was prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Berengarius, that we see, feele, and break, not only the sacraments, but also Christ him selfe.</p>
                  <p>And likewise of Loth, Abraham, Iacob, Iosue, Mary Magdalen, and the Apostles (whom you bring forth in this matter) there is no such speeche in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture, as Berengarius vseth. So that all these things be brought out in vame, hauing no colour to serue for your purpose, sauing that same thing you must say to make out your booke.</p>
                  <p>And as for al the rest that you say in this proces, concerning the presence of Christ visible, and inuisible, nedeth no answere at all, because you prooue nothing of all that you say in that matter: which may easely therfore be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by as good authoritie, as you affirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. And yet all the olde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that speake of the diuersity of Christes substantiall presence, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, declare this diuersitie to be in the diuersity of his two natures, (that in the nature of his humanitie he is gone hence, and present in the nature of his diuinitie) and not that in diuers respectes and qualities of one nature, he is both present and absent, which I haue proued in my third booke, the fifth chapter.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as you haue not brought one author for the proofe of your saying, but your own bare wordes, nor haue aunswered to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities alleadged by me in the forsaid place of my third booke, reason would that my proofes should stand, and haue place, vntill such time as you haue proued your sayings, or brought some euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter to improue mine. And this (I trust,) shall suffice to any indifferent Reader, for the defence of my first booke.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Why the order of my booke was changed by the Bishop.</note>BUt now to returne to the conclusion of the Bishops booke. As it began with a marueilous sleight and suttlety, so doth he conclude the same, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a like notable suttlety, changing the order of my bookes, not answering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such order as I wrote them, nor as the nature of the thinges requireth. For seeing that by all mennes confessions, there is bread and wine before the consecration, the first thing to be discussed in this matter, is, whether the same bread and wine remain still after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Sacraments of Christs most precious body and bloud. And next, by order of nature, and reason, is to be discussed, whether the body and bloud of Christ, represented by those Sacramentes, be present also with the said Sacramentes. And what manner of presence Christ hath, both in the Sacraments, and in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that receiue the Sacramentes.</p>
                  <p>But for what intent the Bishoppe changed this order, it is easie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. For he saw the matter of Transubstantiation, so flat &amp; plain against


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7682:40"/>
him, that it was hard for him to deuise an answere in that matter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> should haue any apparance of truth, but all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world should euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly see him cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowen, at the first onset. Wherefore he thought, that although the matter of the reall presence hath no truth in it at all, yet for as much as it seemed to him, to haue some more apparaunce of truth, then the matter of Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath, he thought best to beginne with that first, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so to iuggle in the matter, and to dasell the eyes of them that be simple, and ignorant, and specially of such as were alredy perswaded in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they should not well see, nor perceiue his lieger de main. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had won credite with them in that matter, by making them to wonder at his crafty iuggeling, then thought he, it should be a fitte and meete time, for him to bring in the matter of Transubstantiation. For when men be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mased, they doe wonder, rather then iudge: And when they be muffeled, and blindfolded, they cannot finde the right way, though they seek it neuer so fast, nor yet follow it, if it chaunce them to finde it, but geue vp cleerely their own iudgement, and follow whom so euer they take to be their guid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> And so shall they lightly follow me in this matter of Transubstantiation, (thought the bishop) if I can first perswade them, and get their good willes in the reall presence. This sleight and suttlety, thou maist iudge certainly, good Reader, to be the cause, and none other, wherefore the order of my booke is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged without ground, or reason.</p>

               <head>THE CONFVTATION OF THE THIRD BOOKE.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of the third booke, the author hath thought good to note certain differences, which I wil also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly consider. It followeth in him thus.</p>
               <p>They teach that Christ is in the bread and wine: But we say according to the truth, that he is in them that worthely eate and drinke the bread and wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Untrue report.</note>Note here (Reader) euen in the entry of the comparison of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> these differences, how vntruly the true faith of the Church is reported, which doth not teach that Christ is in the bread and wine (which was the doctrine of Luther) but the true faith is, that Christes most precious body and bloud, is by the might of his word, and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will, which he declareth by his word, in his holy Supper present vnder forme of bread and wine. The substance of which natures of bread and wine, is conuerted into his most precious body &amp; bloud, as it is truely beleeued &amp; taught in the Catholick church, of which teaching this Author cannot be ignorant. So as the Author of this booke repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an vntruth wittingly against his conscience, to say they teach (calling them papists) that Christ is in the bread and wine, but they agrée in forme of teaching with that, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Church of England teacheth at this day,<note place="margin">The teaching hetherto euen at this day of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land agreeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that this author calleth papistes.</note> in the distribution of the holy Communion, in that it is there said, the body and bloud of Christ to be vnder the forme of bread and wine. And thus much serueth for declaration of the wrong, &amp; vntrue report, of the faith of the Catholick Church, made of this Author, in the setting forth of this difference on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> parte, which it pleaseth him to name Papistes.</p>
               <p>And now to speake of the other parte of the difference on the Authors side, when he would tell what he and his say, he conueyeth a sence craftely in wordes to serue for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,<note place="margin">Crafty conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of spech by this Author.</note> such as no Catholick man would deny. For euery Catholick teacher graunteth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that no man can receaue worthely Christes body and bloud in the Sacrament, vnles he hath by faith and charity, Christ dwelling in him: For otherwise, such one as hath not Christ in him, receaueth Christs body in the Sacrament vnworthely, to his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Christ cannot be receued worthely,<note place="margin">Worthy recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Christs precious body &amp; bloud.</note> but into his own temple, which be ye (S. Paul saith) and yet he that hath not Christes Spirite in him, is not his. As for calling it bread and wine, a Catholick man forbeareth not that name, signifiyng what those creatures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> were before the consecration in substance. Wherefore appeareth, how the Author of this booke,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> in the lieu and place of a difference, which he pretendeth he would shew, bringeth in that vnder a (<hi>But</hi>) which euery Catholick man must néedes confesse, that Christ is in them who worthely eate and drinke the Sacrament of his body and bloud, or the bread, and wine, as this Author speaketh.</p>
               <p>But as this Author would haue speaken plainly, and compared truely the difference of the two teachinges,<note place="margin">A difference should be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> he should in the second parte haue said from what contrary to that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the Catholick Church teacheth, which he doth not, and therfore as he sheweth vntruth in the first report, so he sheweth a sleight, and shifte in the declaration of the second parte, to say that repugneth not to the first matter, and that no Catholicke man will deny, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the said two teachinges be not of one matter, nor shoote not (as one might say) to one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> marke. For the first parte is of the substance of the Sacrament to be receaued, where it is truth, Christ to be present, God and man. The second parte is of Christes Spirituall presence in the man that receaueth, which in déede must be in him before he receaue the Sacrament, or he cannot receaue the Sacrament worthely, as before is sayd, which two partes may stand well together without any repugnancy, &amp; so both the differences thus taught, make but one Catholick doctrine.

indifferent Reader, to iudge whether it be of the same sort or no. But before I make further answere, I shall rehearse the wordes of mine owne thirde boke, which you atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt next, (out of order) to impugne. My words be these.</p>
                  <p>Now this matter of Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being (as I trust) sufficiently resolued,<note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> which is the first part before rehearsed, wherein the Papisticall doctrine varieth from the Catholick truth,<note place="margin">The presence of Christ in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> order requireth, next to intreate of the second part which is of the manner of the presence of the body and bloud of our Sauiour Christ in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereof, wherin is no lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the first part.</p>
                  <p>For a plain explication whereof, it is not vnknowen to all true faithfull chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people, that our Sauiour Christ (being perfecte God, and in all thinges equall, and coeternall with his Father) for our sakes became also a perfect man, taking flesh and bloud of his blessed mother, and virgin Mary, &amp; (sauing sinne) being in all thinges like vnto vs, adioyning vnto his diuinity, a most perfect soul of man: And his body being made of very flesh and bones, not onely hauing all members of a perfect mannes body, in due order and proportion, but also being subiect to hunger, thirst, labour, sweate, werines, cold, heate, and all other like infirmities, and passions of a manne, and vnto death also, and that the most vile and painfull vpon the crosse, and after his death he rose againe, with the self same visible, and palpable body, and appeared therewith, and shewed the same vnto his Apostles, and specially to Thomas, making him to put his handes into his side, and to feele his woundes. And with the selfe same body he forsooke this world, and ascended into heauen, (the Apostles seeing,<note place="margin">Christ corporal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly is ascended into heauen. Act. 3.</note> and beholding his body when it ascended) and now sitteth at the right hand of his Father, &amp; there shall remaine vntill the last day, when he shall come to iudge the quick &amp; dead.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Catholick faith which the Scripture teacheth, and the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church of Christ hath euer beleeued from the beginning, vntill within these 4. or 5. hundreth yeares last passed, that the Bishop of Rome, with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Papistes, hath set vp a new faith, and beleefe of their own deuising, that the same body, really, corporally, naturally, and sensibly, is in this worlde still, and that in an hundred thousand places at one time, being inclosed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pixe, and bread consecrated.</p>
                  <p>And although we doe affirme (according to Gods word) that Christ is in all persons that truly beleeue in him,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> in such sort, that with his flesh and bloud he doth spiritually nourish and feede them, and geueth them euerlasting life, &amp; doth assure them thereof, as well by the promise of his word, as by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental bread and wine in his holy supper, which he did institute for the same purpose, yet we doe not a little vary from the hainous errors of the Papists. For they teach that Christ is in the bread and wine, but we say, (according to the truth) that he is in them that worthely eate and drink the bread &amp; wine.<note place="margin">The difference betwene the true and papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall doctrine concerning the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it pleaseth you to passe ouer all the rest of my sayinges, and to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere onely to the difference betweene the Papists and the true Catholicke faith. Where,<note place="margin">The first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> in the first ye finde fault that I haue vntruely reported the Papisticall faith (which you call the faith of the Church) which teacheth not (say you) that Christ is in the bread and wine, but vnder the formes of bread and wine. But to aunswere you, I say, that the Papists do teach, that Christ is in the visible signes, and whether they list to call them bread and wine, or the formes of bread and wine, all is one to me, for the truth is, that he is neither corporally in the bread and wine, nor in or vnder the formes &amp; figures of them, but is corporally in heauen, and spiritually in his liuelye


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7682:42"/>
members which be his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples where he inhabiteth. And what vntrue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte is this,<note place="margin">Misreport of bread and wine for the formes &amp; figures of them.</note> when I speake of bread and wine to the Papistes, to speak of them in the fame sence that the Papistes meane, taking bread and wine for the formes and accidences of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>And your selfe also doe teach, to vnderstand by the bread and wine, not their substances, but accidentes. And what haue I offended then, in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to you after your own ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of speach, which your self doth approue and allow by and by after, saying these wordes. As for calling it bread and wine, a Catholick man forbeareth not that name: If a Catholick man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth not that name, and Catholick men be true men, then true men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare not that name. And why then charge you me with an vntruth, for vsing that name, which you vse your selfe, and affirme Catholicke men to vse? But that you be geuen altogether to finde faultes rather in other, then to amend your own, and to reprehend that in me, which you allow in your selfe and other, and purposely will not vnderstand my meaning, because ye would seeke occasion to carpe and controll.</p>
                  <p>For els what man is so simple that readeth my booke, but he may know well, that I meane not to charge you for affirming of Christ to be in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bread and wine. For I know that you say ther is nether bread nor wine (although you say vntruely therein) but yet for as much as the accidents of bread and wine, you call bread and wine, and say that in them is Christ, therfore I reporte of you, that you say Christ is in the bread and wine, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as you take bread and wine) the accidentes thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Smyth.</note>Yet D. Smith was a more indifferent Reader of my booke then you, in this place, who vnderstoode my wordes as I meante, and as the Papistes vse, and therefore would not purposely calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niate, and reprehend that was well spoaken. But there is no man so dull, as he that will not vnderstand. For men know that your witte is of as good capacitie, as D. Smithes is, if your will agreed to the same.</p>
                  <p>But as for any vntrue reporte made by me herein willingly against my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conscience (as you vntruely report of me) by that time I haue ioyned with you throughout your booke, you shall right well perceiue, (I trust) that I haue sayd nothing wittingly, but that my conscience shall be able to defend at the great day, in the sight of the euerliuing God, and that I am able be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any learned and indifferent iudges, to iustifie by holy Scriptures, and the auncient Doctors of Christes church, as I will appeale the consciences of all godly men, that be any thing indifferent, &amp; ready to yealde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, when they reade and consider my booke.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part.</note>Now for the second parte of the difference, you graunt that our doctrine is true, that Christ is in them that worthely eate and drunke the bread and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> wine, and if it differ not from youres, then let it passe as a thing agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by both partes.

And if a Catholick man call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine (as you say in the second parte of the difference) what ment you then in the first parte of this difference to charge me with so hainous a crime, (with a note to the Reader) as though I had sinned against the holy Ghost, because I said that the Papistes doe teach that Christ is in the bread and wine: doe not you affirme here yourselfe the same that I reporte? that the Papistes, (which you call the Catholickes) doe not forbeare to call the Sacrament (wherein they put the reall and corporall presence) bread and wine? Let the Reader now iudge, whether you be caught in your own snare or no. But such is the successe of them that study to wrangle in wordes, without any respecte of opening the truth.</p>
                  <p>But letting that matter passe, yet we vary from you in this difference. For we say not (as you doe) that the body of Christ is corporally, naturally, and carnally, either in the bread and wine, or formes of bread and wine, or in them that eate and drinke thereof. But we say that he is corporally in heauen onely, and spiritually in them that worthely eate and drink y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread, and wine. But you make an article of the faith, which the olde Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeued nor heard of.</p>
                  <p>And where you note in this second parte of the difference, a sleight and crafte: as you note an vntruth in the first, euen as much crafte is in the one, as vntruth in the other, being neither sleight nor vntruth in either of both. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But this sleight (say you) I vse, putting that for a difference, wherein is no difference at all, but euery Catholick man must needes confesse, Yet once againe, there is no man so deafe, as he that will not heare, nor so blinde, as he that will not see, nor so dul, as he that wil not vnderstand. But if you had indifferent eares, indifferent eyes, and indifferent iudgement, you might well gather of my wordes, a plain and manifest difference, although it be not in such tearmes as contenteth your mind. But because you shall see that I meane no sleight, nor crafte, but goe plainly to worke, I shall set out the difference truely as I ment, and in such your own tearmes as I trust shall content you, if it be possible. Let this therfore be the difference.</p>
                  <p>They say that Christ is corporally vnder,<note place="margin">The difference.</note> or in the formes of bread and wine: We say, that Christ is not there, neither corporally, nor spiritually, but in them that worthely eate and drinke the bread and wine, he is spiritually, and corporally in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Here I trust I haue satisfied, as well the vntrue report wittingly made, (as you say) in the first parte of the difference against my conscience, as the crafte and sleight, vsed in the second parte. But what be you eased now by this? We say as the scripture teacheth, that Christ is corporally ascended in to heauen, and neuerthelesse he is so in them that worthely eate the bread, &amp; drinke the wine, geuen, and distributed at his holy Supper, that he feedeth and nourisheth them with his flesh and bloud vnto eternal life. But we say not (as you doe, cleerely without ground of Scripture) that he is corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder the formes of bread and wine, where his presence should be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profite or commoditie, either to vs, or to the bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>And here in this difference,<note place="margin">Repugnaunce.</note> it seemeth that you haue either cleerely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or negligently ouershotte yourselfe, vttering that thing vnwares, which is contrary is your wholl booke. For the first parte (which is of the being of Christ in the Sacramentall bread and wine) is of the substance of


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7682:43"/>
the Sacrament to be receaued, (say you) where it is true, Christ to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God and man: the second part (say you) which is of the being of Christ in them that worthely eat and drink the bread and wine, is of Christs spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual presence. Of your which words I se nothing to be gathered, but that as concerning his substancial presence, Christ is receaued into the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental bread and wine, and as for them that worthely receaue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is in them none otherwise then after a Spirituall presence: For els why should ye say that the second parte is of Christes spirituall presence, if it be as well of his corporall, as of his spirituall presence? Wherefore by your own words, this difference should be vnderstanded of two different beings of Christ, that in the Sacrament he is by his substance, and in the worthy receauers spiritually, and not by his substance, for els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> differences repugne not, as you obiect against me. Wherfore either you write one thing, &amp; mean another, or els (as you write of other) God so blindeth the aduersaries of the truth, that in one place or other, they confesse the truth vnwares.

Which doing, in rude speach would be called otherwise then I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will tearme it. Truth it is (as S.

But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to say that the church teacheth how we receaue Christ at our mouth, and he goeth into our stomacke and no further, is a reporte which by the iust iudgement of God, is suffered to come out of the mouth of them that fight against the truth in this most high mistery.</p>

                  <p>And I say not that the Church teacheth so (as you fayne me to say) but that the Papistes say so. Wherfore I should wish you to reporte my words as I say, and not as you imagine me to say, least you heare agayne (as you haue heard heretofore) of your wonderfull learning, and practise in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils Sophistrye.</p>

We must vnderstand his wordes in the institution of his Sacramentes, without figure in the substance of the celestiall thing of them, and therefore when be ordered his most precious body and bloud to be eaten and druken of vs, vnder the formes of bread and wine: we professe and beléeue, that truely he gaue vs his most precious body in the Sacrament, for a celestiall foode, to comforte and strengthen vs in this miserable life.<note place="margin">Really that is in deede.</note> And for certainty of the truth of his worke therein, we professe he geueth vs his body really, that is to say: in déed his body the thing it selfe, which is the heauenly parte of the Sacrament, called <hi>(Eucharistia)</hi> hauing the visible forme of bread and wine, and contayning inuisibly the very body and bloud of our Sauyour Christ, which was not wonte to be reserued other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but to be ready for such as in daunger of death call for it, and the same so long as it

And then I pray you declare what comfort and benefitte we haue by this carnall presence which by and by is absent, and taryeth not with vs?

This is in the Author no whisperyng, but playnely rayling, wherein if he had remembred himselfe well, he would not haue spoken of all Christian men in the receypt of that he entendeth to disproue. And if he would say he spake it by an Irony or skorne, yet it implyeth that all had receyued that he thus mocketh, which after the sort he writeth, was neuer deuised by Papist, or other to be so taught, otherwyse then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> as this Author might read it, as an ydle argument, to shew absurditie in reason. For in Gods workes, as the sacramentes hée, we must think all semelynesse in déed without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, euen as we beleue al Gods iudgements iust and true, although reason conclude in them euident iniquitie. Mans reason when it séemeth most gallant,<note place="margin">What is receued of all christen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath therein a manifest token in truth.</note> is full of spottes and folly. Gods workes be all séemelynesse, without confusion, monsier, or any such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditée, as this Author supposeth. Although I can not in the Sacrament with the eye of my reason, locally distinct Christs head from his foote, his legs from his arme. And where in the booke of common prayer, it is truely said, in ech part of the bread consecrate broken to be Christes whole body, if one of curiositee would question with me, and I of folly would aunswere him,<note place="margin">It is a folly to answere a cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demaunder.</note> first where is Christes head? I should say, here (poynting with my finger) he would thinke it first a little head.

If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that I poynted before the same for the head, might not the third a catholicke man, that stood by, (trow you) wisely call vs both madde, to go about to discusse that wée must grant we se not, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith we know only the being preset of Christs most precious body, then by blynd reason, to discusse the manner of being in the situation of such partes, as we do not see?

And to commend further his deuise vnto vs, would percase tell how many absurdities as he thinketh and inconueniences might be auoyded by it. This fourth man I speak of, making himselfe a mediatour, but in déede vnmete therfore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> because he hath no participation with sayth: yet if our religion and fayth were mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, as that of Numa Pompilius was, he should not vtter this his conceit all ydelly.

And as the holy ghost doth not only come to vs in Baptisme, and Christ doth there eloth vs, but they doe the same to vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually so long as we dwell in Christ, so likewise doth Christ feed vs so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as we dwell in him and he in vs, and not only when we receaue the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that as touching Christ himself, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence is all one, the clothing all one, &amp; the feeding al one, although the one for the more comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, haue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t added to it, and the other be without the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The rest that is here spoken, is contentious wrangling to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>But now commeth in Smith with his 5. egs,<note place="margin">Smyth.</note> saying that I haue made hete 5. lyes in these comparisons. The first lie is (saith he) that the Papists doe say, that good men do eat and drink Christs body and bloud only when they receaue the sacrament, which thing Smyth saith the Papists do not say, but that they then onely do eat Christs body, and drinke his bloud cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, which sufficeth for my purpose. For I mean no other thing, but that the Papistes teach such a corporall eating of Christes body as indureth not, but vanisheth away, and ceaseth at the furthest within few houres after the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is receaued. But for as much as Smith agreeth here with you, the answere made before to you, wil serue for him also. And yet Smith here shall serue me in good stede against you, who haue imputed vnto me so many impudent lyes made against the Papistes in the comparisons before rehearsed: and Smith saith that this is the first lye, which is in the 8. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison. And so shal Smith (being mine aduersary and your frend) be such a witnes for me, as you cannot except against, to prooue that those thinges which before you said were impudent lies, be no lies at all. For this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first lye saith Smith, and then my sayinges before must be all true, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lies. Now to the ninth comparison.</p>
                  <p>They say that the body of Christ that is in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, hath his own proper forme and quantitie. We say that Christ is there Sacramentally and spiritually, without forme or quantitye.</p>

And what maner of spech had this ben, to say of Christes diuine nature, that it is in the sacrament without quantity, which hath in it no manner of quantitie where so euer it be? And where I set foorth these comparysons to shew wherein we vary from the Papists, what variance had ben in this comparison, if I had vnderstanded the first part of Christs humanitie, and the second of his diuinitie?</p>
                  <p>The reader by this one place among many other, may easyly discerne, how captious you be to reprehend what so euer I say, and to peruert euery thing into a wrong sense: So that in respect of you, Smith is a very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent taker of my wordes,<note place="margin">D.

                     <note place="margin">Whether in the Sacrament. Christes body hath his proper forme and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</note>But to come directly to the matter, if it be true that you say, that in the sacrament Christes body hath all the formes and quantities of a naturall body, why say you then that his body is not there present after the manner of quantitie? Declare what difference is betweene forme and quantitie, &amp; the manner of quantitie? And if Christes body in the Sacrament haue the same quantitie, that is to say, the same length, breadth, and thicknes, and the same forme, that is to say, the same due order, and proportion of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and partes of his body, that he had when he was crucified, and hath now in heauen (as he hath by your saying here in this place) then I pray


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7682:53"/>
you declare further, how the length, bredth, and thicknes of a man, should be conteined in quantitie, within the compasse of a peece of bread, no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger nor broader then one or two inches, nor much thicker then one leafe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

How length and roundnes shall agree in one proportion: and a thicke and thin thing be both of one thicknes: which you must warrant to be brought to passe, if the forme and quantitie of Christes body be conteined vnder the forme and quantity of such bread and wine as we now vse.</p>
                  <p>But as Smyth in the last comparison did me good seruice against you,<note place="margin">D. Smith.</note> so shall you in this comparison do me good seruice against him. For among the fiue lyes, wherewith he chargeth me in these comparisons, he accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this for one, that I report of the Papists, that Christes body in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath his proper forme and quantity, which you say is a truth. And therefore if I make a lye herein (as Smyth saith I doe) yet I lie not alone, but haue you to beare me company. And yet once again more may the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here note, how the Papists vary among them selues.</p>
                  <p>And it is vntrue that you say, that good men beleeue vpon the credit of Christ, that there is truely in the Sacrament, the very true body of Christ. For Christ called bread his body and wine his bloud (which as the old au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors say, must needs be vnderstanded figuratiuely) but he neuer sayd that his true body is truely in the Sacrament, as you here report of him.</p>
                  <p>And the manner of his presence you call so high a mistery, that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man can not reach it. And in deed as you fayne, the matter it is so high a mistery, that neuer man could reach it, but your selfe alone. For you make the manner of Christes being in the Sacrament so spirituall, that you say his flesh, bloud and bones be there really and carnally, and yet you confesse in your booke, that you neuer red any old author that so said. And this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling of so pure a mistery, is neither godly foolishnes nor world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but rather a meere fransy and madnesse.</p>
                  <p>And although the scripture speak of Christes body to be eaten of vs, yet that is vnderstanded of spiritual and not of corporall eating, and of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all not of corporall presence. The scripture sayth,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. Mark. 16 Luke. 24.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where you thinke that this manner of speech was neuer red, that Christ is present in the Sacrament without forme or quantity, I am sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that it was neuer red in any approued author, that Christ hath his proper forme and quantitie in the sacrament. And Duns saith, that his quantitie is in heauen, and not in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And when I say that Christ is in the Sacrament Sacramentally and without forme and quantitie, who would thinke any man so captious, so ignorant, or so full of sophistry, to draw my wordes to the forme of Christs diuinitie, which I speake most plainly of the forme and quantity of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and humanitie? as I haue before declared. And although some other might be so farre ouerseen, yet specially you ought not so to take my words.

                  <p>And where of this word (<hi>there</hi>) you would conclude repugnaunce in my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> doctrine,<note place="margin">There.</note> that where in other places I haue written, that Christ is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally present in them that receaue the sacrament, and not in the sacramentes of bread and wine, and now it should seeme that I teach contrary; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is spiritually present in the very bread and wine, if you pleased to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my wordes rightly, there is no repugnaunce in my words at al.

                  <p>Which my saying varyeth from no doctrine that I haue taught in any part of my booke. Now followeth the tenth comparyson.</p>
                  <p>They say, that the fathers, and Prophets of the old Testament did not eat the body, or drink the bloud of Christ. We say, that they did eat his body and drink his bloud, although he was not yet borne nor incarnated.</p>

They had a certayn promyse, and we a certayne present payment: they did eat Christ spiritually, beleeuing in him that was to come, but they did not eat Christes body present in the Sacrament, sacramentally and spiritually, as we do.

                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note>And S.

Augustine expounding sayth: What is to eat the same meat: but that they did eate the same which wee doe. Who so euer in Manna vnderstood Christ, did eat the same spirituall meat that we do, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, that meat which was receaued with fayth and not with bodyes. Therefore to them that vnderstood and beleued, it was the same meat and the same drinke. So that to such as vnderstoode not, the meate was onely Manna, and the drinke, onely water, but to such as vnderstood, it was the same that is now. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Christ to come, who is now come. To come and is come, be diuers wordes, but it is the same Christ. These be S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines sayings.</p>
                  <p>And because you say, that it is more agreable to the scripture, to say, that the fathers before Christs natiuity did not eat the body and drink the bloud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Christ: I pray you shew me one scripture that so saith. And shew me also one approued author that disalowed S. Augustines mind by me here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, because you say, that all doe not agree to his vnderstanding. And in the 77.<note place="margin">August. in psal. 77.</note> Psalme S. Augustine saith also: The stone was Christ. Therefore the same was the meat &amp; drinke of the fathers in the mistery, wich is ours, but in significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same, not in outward forme. For it is one Christ him selfe, that to them was figured in the stone, and to vs manyfestly appeared in flesh.<note place="margin">August. in Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Tract. 26.</note> And saint Augustine sayth playnely, that both Manna and our Sacrament signifieth Christ, and that although the Sacraments were dyuers, yet in the thing by them ment and vnderstand, they were both like. And so after the mynd of S. Augustine it is cleare, that the same thinges were geuen to the faithfull receiuers in the Sacraments of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that be geuen in the new: the same to them was circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that to vs is baptisme: and to them by Manna was geuen the same thing, that now is geuen to vs in the sacramentall bread.</p>
                  <p>And if I would graunt for your pleasure, that in theyr sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Christ was promised, and that in ours, he is really geuen, doth it not then followe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

aswell that Christ is geuen in the sacrament of Baptisme, as that he is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Sacrament of his flesh and bloud? And S. Augustin <hi>contra Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,</hi>

                     </gap>ntion is solemnly put in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory by the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And the thing which you say S. Augustine noteth to be geuen in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new testament,<note place="margin">August. in psal. 73.</note> and to be promised in the sacramentes of the olde, S. Augustine expresseth the thing which he ment, that is to say, saluation and eternall lyfe by Christ. And yet in thys mortall lyfe we haue not eternall lyfe in possession, but in promise, as the prophets had. But S. Augustine sayth, that we haue the promise, because we haue Christ all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come, which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets was promised before that he should come, &amp; therefore S. Iohn the Baptist was called more then a Prophet, because he said:<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> Here is the lamb of God already preset, which the Prophets taught vs to looke for, vntill he came.</p>
                  <p>The effect therfore of S. Augustins words plainly to be expressed, was this, that the prophets in the old testament Promised a sauiour to come, &amp; redeem the world, (which the sacraments of that tyme testified vntill hys comming): but now he is already come, and hath by his death performed that was promised, which our sacramentes testifie vnto vs, as S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine declareth more playnely in his booke <hi>De fide ad Petrum,</hi> the xix. chapter. So that S. Augustine speaketh of the geuing of Christ to death,<note place="margin">August. de fide ad Pet. cap. 19.</note> (which the sacraments of the old testament, testified to come, and ours testify to be done) and not of the geuing of him in the sacraments.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as S. Augustine spake generally of all the sacraments, therefore if you will by his words proue, that Christ is corporally in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the holy communion, you may aswell proue, that he is corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in baptisme. For saint Augustine speaketh no more of the one then of the other. But where saint Augustin speaketh generally of al the sacraments, you restrayne the matter particularly to the sacrament of the Lords supper onely, that the ignoraunt reader should thinke, that saynt Augustine spake of the corporall presence of Christ in the sacramentes, and that onely in the sacraments of bread and wine, where as saynt Augustine himself speaketh onely of our saluation by Christ, and of the sacraments in generall.</p>
                  <p>And neuerthelesse as the fathers had the same Christ and mediator that we haue (as you here confesse) so did they spiritually eat his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This besides saynt Augustine is plainely set out by Bertrame aboue 6. hundreth yeares passed,<note place="margin">Bertram.</note> whose iudgement in this matter of the sacrament, although you allow not (because it vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth your doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) yet forasmuch as hytherto his teaching was neuer reproued by none, but by you alone, and that he is comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of other, as an excellent learned man in holy scripture, and a notable famous man, aswell in liuing as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> among his excellent works this one is specially praised, which

he wrot of the matter of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body and bloud of our Lord, therfore I shall reherse his teaching in this point, how the holy fathers and Prophets before the comming of Christ did eat Christes flesh and drink his bloud: So that although Bertrams saying be not estemed with you, yet the indifferent reader may see what was written in this matter, before your doctrine was inuented. And although his authority be not receiued of you, yet his words may serue against Smyth,<note place="margin">Smyth.</note> who herein more learnedly, and with more iudgement then you, approueth this author. This is Bertrams doctrine S. Paule saith, that all the old fathers did eat the same spirituall meat, and drinke the same spiritual drink. But peraduenture thou wilt ask, Which the same? Euen the very same that christen people do daily eat and drinke in the church. For we may not vnderstand diuers things, when it is one and the self same Christ, which in times past did feed with his flesh, and made to drink of his bloud, the people that were baptised in the cloude and sea, in the wildernes, and which doth now in the church feed christen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the bread of his body, and giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to drink the floud of his bloud. When he had not yet taken mans nature vpon him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted death for the saluation of the world, not redemed vs with his bloud, neuertheles euen then our forefathers by spiritual meat and inuisible drink did eat his body in the wildernes and drink his bloud, as the Apostle bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witnesse, saying: The same spiritual meat, the same spiritual drink. For he that now in the church by his omnipotent power doth spiritually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert bread &amp; wine into the flesh of his body, and into the floud of his owne bloud, he did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuisibly so worke, that Manna which came from heauen was his body, and the water his bloud. Now by the thinges here by me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, it euidently appereth, that this is no nouelty of speech to say, that the holy fathers and Prophets did eat Christes flesh and drink his bloud. For both the scripture and old authors vse so to speake, how much soeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spech mislike them, that like no fashion but their own.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ione of Kent.</note>And what doth this further y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pestilent heresy of Ione of Kent? Is this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> a good argument? The fathers did eat Christes flesh and drinke his bloud spiritually before he was borne, ergo after he was not corporally borne of his mother? Or because he was corporally borne, is he not therefore dayly eaten spiritually of his faithfull people? Because he dwelt in the world cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally from his incarnation vnto his ascention, did he not therfore spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dwell in his holy members before that tyme, and hath so done euer si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and will do to the worldes end? Or if he be eaten in a figure, can you induce thereof that he was not borne without a figure? Do not such kynde of argumentes fauour the errour of Ione of Kent? Yea do they not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly approue her pestiferous heresy, if they were to be alowed? What man that meaneth the trueth, would bring in such manner of resoning to deface the truth? And yet it is not to be denied, but that Christ is truely eaten, as he was truly born, but the one corporally and without figure, and the other spiritually, and with a figure.

And therfore in the book of the holy communion we do not pray absolutely, that the bread and wine may be made the body and bloud of Christ, but that vnto vs in that holy mistery they may be so, that is to say,<note place="margin">Domin. 3. post Trin.

                  <p>And where you say, it was neuer taught as I say,<note place="margin">Whether the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of Christ be made of bread.</note> that Christs body is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> made of the matter of bread, you knowingly and willingly misreport me. For I say not, of the matter of bread, but of bread, which when you deny that the Papists so say, it semeth you be now ashamed of the doctrin; which the Papistes haue taught thys 4. or 5. hundred yeres. For is it not playnely written of all the Papists, both lawyers and scholl authors, that the body of Christ in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made of bread, and his bloud of wine? And they say not that his body is made present of bread &amp; wine, but is made of bread and wine. Be not their books in print ready to be shewed? Do they not say,


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7682:57"/>
that the substance of the bread neither remaineth still nor is turned into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but into the body of Christ? And do not your selfe also say here in this place, that the substance of bread is conuerted into Christes precious body? And what is that els, but the body of Christ to be made of bread, and to be made of a new matter? For if the bread doe not vanish away into nothing, but be turned into Christes body, then is Christs body made of it, and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it must needes follow that Christes body is made of new, and of an orher substance then it was made of in his mothers wombe. For there it was made of her flesh and bloud, and here it is made of bread and wine. And the Papistes say not (as you now would shift of the matter) that Christes body is made present of bread, but they say plainly without addition, that it is made of bread. Can you deny that this is the plain doctrine of the Papists <hi>Ex pane fit Corpus Christi, of bread is made the body of Christ,</hi> and that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread is turned into the substance therof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> And what reason, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or english, could be in this saying, Christes body is made present of bread? Marye to be present in bread might be some sentence, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> speeche will you in no wise admitte.</p>
                  <p>And this your saying here (if the reader mark it wel) turneth ouer quite and cleane all the wholl Papisticall doctrine in this matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Pugnat cum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijs Papistis.</note> as well touching transubstantiation, as also the carnall presence. For their doctrine with one whol consent and agreement is this. That the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread remaineth not, but is turned into the substance of Christes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> body, and so the body of Christ is made of it. But this is false (say you) and not tollerable to be by a scoffer deuised in a place, to supply when his fellow had forgotten his part. And so the wholl doctrine of the papists, which they haue taught these 4. or 5. hundreth yeares, doe you condemne with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne reproches, as a teaching intollerable, not to be deuised by a scoffer in a play. Why doe you then take vpon you to defend the Papistical doctrine, if it be so intollerable? Why doe you not forsake those scoffers and players, which haue iugled with the world so long, and embrace the most certayne truth, that Christs body is not made of bread? And seeing that you embrace it here in this one place, why stand you not constantly therin but goe from it againe in all the rest of your booke, defending the Papisticall doctrine cleane contrary to yours in this pointe, in that they teach that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is made of bread.</p>
                  <p>And you varry so much from your selfe herein, that although you deny the Papistes sayinges in wordes, that Christes body is made of bread, yet in effect you graunt and maintayn the same, which you say is intollerable, and not to be deuised by a scoffer in a play. For you say, that Christ calleth bread his body, and that his calling is making. And then if he make bread his body, it must needes follow that he maketh his body of the bread: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer you say,<note place="margin">Making by con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersion.</note> that Christes body is made present by conuersion, or turning of the substance of bread, into the substance of his precious bodye, where of must follow, that his body is made of bread. For when so euer one substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is turned into another, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the second is made of the first. As, because earth was turned into the body of Adam,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> we say that Adam was made of earth and that Eue was made of Adams ribbe: And the wine in Galily made of water,<note place="margin">Iohn. 2.</note> because the water was turned into wine, and the ribbe of Adames side into the body of Eue. If the water had beene put out of the pottes, and


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7682:57"/>
wine put in for the water, we might haue saide that the wine had been made present there, where the water was before: But then we might not haue said that the wine had been made of the water, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water was emptied out, and not turned into wine. But when Christ turned the water into the wine, then by reason of that turning, we say that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine was made of the water. So likewise if the bread be turned into the substance of Christ his body, we must not only say that the body of Christ is present, where the bread was before, but also that it is made of the bread, because that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the bread is conuerted and turned into the substaunce of his bodye. Which thing the papists saw must needes follow, and therfore they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confessed, that the body of Christ was made of bread, which doctrine (as you truely say in this place) is intollerable, and not to be deuised by a scoffer in a play, when his fellow had forgotten his parte. And yet you so far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your selfe in this booke, that throughout the same (what so euer you say here) you defend the same intollerable doctrin, not to be deuised by a scoffer.</p>
                  <p>And where Smith accounteth here my fourth lye, that I say,<note place="margin">D. Smith.</note> that the Papistes say, that Christes body is made of bread and wine. Here Smith and you agree both together in one lye. For it is truth and no lye, that the Papistes so say and teach, as Smith in other parts of his booke saith, that Christes body is made of bread, and that priestes doe make Christes body. My 12. comparison is this.</p>
                  <p>They say that the masse is a Sacrifice satisfactory for sinne, by the deuotion of the Priest that offreth, and not by the thing that is offered. But we say that their saying is a most haynous, yea and detestable error against the glory of Christ: for the satisfaction for our sinnes, is not the deuotion nor offering of the Priest, but the only host and satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for all the sinnes of the world, is the death of Christ, and the oblation of his body vpon the Crosse, that is to say: The oblation that Christ him selfe offred once vpon the crosse, and neuer but once, not neuer any but he. And therfore that oblation which the Priestes make dayly in their papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall masses, cannot be a satisfaction for other mennes sinnes by the Priests de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: but it is a mere illusion, and suttle crafte of the Deuil, wherby Antichrist hath many yeares blinded and deceiued the world.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This comparison is out of the matter of the presence of Christes most precious body in the Sacrament, which presence this author (in the first part of his comparison) semeth by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> implication to graunt, when he findeth fault that the priestes deuotion should be a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice satisfactory, and not the thing that is offered, which maner of doctrine I neuer read, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I thinke my selfe it ought to be improued, if any such there be to make the deuotion of the Priest a satisfaction.

Wherein was perfited the willing Sacrifice that he made of him selfe to God the Father for vs, of whom it was written in the beginning of the booke, that he should lie the body and perfectt accomplishment of all Sacrifices, as of whom all other sacrifices before, were shadowes and figures.</p>

be noted, who suffered because he would. Which S. Paul setteth forth in declaration of Christes humility. And although that willing obedience was ended and perfected on the crosse, to the which it continued from the beginning, by reason wherof the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in S. Paules spéech attributed thereunto: Yet as in the Sacrifice of Abraham when he offered Isaac, the earnest will of offering was accounted for the offering in déede, whereupon it is said in Scripture that Abraham offered Isaac, and the declaration of the will of Abraham <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is called the offering. So the declaration of Christes will in his last Supper, was an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him to God the Father, assuring there his Apostles of his will and determination and by them all the world, that his body should be betrayed for them and vs, and his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud shed for remission of sinne. which his word he confirmed then, with the gifte of his precious body to be eaten, and his precious bloud to be dronken. In which mistery, he declared his body and bloud to be the wery Sacrifice of the world, by him offered to God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, by the same will that he said hid body should be betrayed for vs. And thereby ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vs that to be in him willing, that the Iewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s on the crosse séemed to execute by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force against his will. And therfore as Christ offred himself on the crosse, in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> execution of the worke of his will: so he offered himself in his Supper, in declaration of his will, wherby we might be the more assured of the effect of his death, which he suffered willingly and determinately for the redemption of the world, with a most perfect oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and satisfaction for the sinnes of the world, exhibited and offered by him to God the father, for the reconciliation of mannes nature to Gods fauor and grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Christes once offering.</note>And this I write because this author speaketh so precisely, how Christ offred himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> neuer but once. Wherby, if he mean by once offering the hole action of our redemption, which was consummate and perfected vpon the crosse: All must confesse the substaunce of that worke of redemption, by the oblation of Christ on the crosse, to haue béene absolutely finished, and so once offered for all. But there is no Scripture whereupon we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that Christ did in this mortall life, but in one particular moment of time offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his Father. For S.

And that this obedience to God, in humilitie is called offering, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> by S. Paule when he exhorted vs to offer our bodies, which meaneth a continuall obedience in the obseruation of Gods will, and he calleth (<hi>oblationem gentium</hi>) to bringe them to the faith.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> And Abrahams willing obedience ready at Gods commaundement to offer Isaac, is called the offering of Isaac, and is in very deede a true offering: And euery man offereth himself to God when he yealdeth to Gods calling, and presenteth himselfe ready to doe Gods will and commaundement, who then may be said to offer his seruice, (that is to say,) to place his seruice in sight, and before him, before whom it should be done. And because our Sauiour Christ by the decrée of the wholl Trinity, tooke mannes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> nature vpon him, to suffer death for our redemption: which death (in his last Supper) he declared plainly he would suffer.</p>
                  <p>We reade in S. Ciprian how Christ offered himselfe in his supper, fulfilling the figure of Melchisedech, who by the offring of bread &amp; wine, signified that high mistery of Christs Supper, in which Christ (vnder the forme of bread and wine) gaue his very body &amp; bloud to be eaten and dronken, and in the geuing therof declared the determination of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous passion, and the fruit and effect therof. Which doing was a swéete and pleasant obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God the Father, conteyning a most perfect obedience to Gods will and pleasure. And in the mistery of this Supper was written, made, and sealed, a most perfect testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for an effectuall memory of Christes offering of him selfe to his Father, &amp; of his death and passion, with the fruite therof. And therfore Christ ordayned this Supper to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and continued for a memory of his comming: So as we that saw not with our bodely eyes Christes death and passion, may in the celebration of the Supper, be most surely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayned of the truth, out of Christes own mouth, who still speaketh in the person of the minister of the church: This is my body that is betrayed for you: This is my bloud that is shead for you in remission of sinne: and therewith maketh his very body, and his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud truely present, to be taken of vs, eaten, and dronken: Whereby we be assured that Christ is the same to vs that he was to them, and vseth vs as familiarly as he did them, offereth himselfe to his Father for vs as well as for them, declareth his will in the


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7682:58"/>
fruite of his death, to pertayne as well to vs as to them. Of which death we be assured by his own mouth, that he suffred the same to the effect he spake of, and the continuall feding in this high mistery of the same very body that suffred, and féeding of it without consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being continually exhibited vnto vs a liuing body, and a liuely bloud, not onely our soule is specially and spiritually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, &amp; our body therby reduced to more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable obedience to the soule, but also we by the participation of this most precious body &amp; bloud be ascertained of the resurrection and regeneration of our bodies and flesh, to be by Gods power made incorruptible and immortall, to liue, and haue fruition in God, with our soules for euer.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore hauing this mistery of Christes Supper, so many truthes in it, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath celebrate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, and knowledged them all, of one certainty in truth, not as figures,<note place="margin">Truthes linked together.</note> but really and in déede, that is to say, as our bodies shalbe in the generall resurrection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in déede: so we beléeue we feede here of Christes body in deede. And as it is true that Christes body in déede is betrayed for vs: so it is true that he geueth vs to eate his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body in déede. And as it is true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ was in earth, &amp; did celebrate this Supper: so it is true that he commaunded it to be celebrated by vs till he come. And as it is true that Christ was very God omnipotent, and very man: so it is true that he could doe that he affirmed by his word him selfe to doe. And as he is most sincéere truth: so may we be truly assured, that he would, and did, as he said. And as it is true that he is most iust: so it is true that he assisteth the doing of his commaundement in the celebration of the holy Supper. And therfore as he is author of this most holy Sacrament of his precious body and bloud: so is he the maker of it, and is the inuisible priest, who as Emissene saith by his secret po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Emissenus,</hi> Christ is the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uisible priest. 1. Cor. 4.</note> with his word, changeth the visible creatures, into the substance of his body &amp; bloud. Wherin man, the visible priest and minister by order of the church is onely a dispencer of the mistery, doing and saying as the holy ghost hath taught the church to doe and say.</p>
                  <p>Finally, as we be taught by faith all these to be true: so when wanton reason (faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aslepe) goeth about by curiositie to empaire any one of these truthes, the chain is broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the linkes sparckle abroad, and all is brought in danger to be scattered and scambled at. Truthes haue béene abused, but yet they be true, as they were before, for no man can make that is true, false: and abuse is mannes fault, not the thinges. Scripture in spéeche, geueth to man as Gods minister, the name of that action which God specially worketh in that mistery. So it pleaseth God to honor the ministery of man in his Church, by whom it also pleaseth him to worke effectually. And Christ said, they that beleue in me,<note place="margin">Errors. One offering of Christ, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> shall doe the workes that I doe, and greater. When all this honor is geuen to man, as spiritually to regenerate, when the minister saith (I baptise thée) and to remitte sinne to such as fall after, to be also a minister in consecration of Christes most precious body, with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of other Sacramentes, benediction, and prayer. If man should then waxe proud,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> and glory as of him selfe, and extoll his own deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in these ministeries, such men should bewray their own naughty hipocrisie, &amp; yet therby empayr not the very dignity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, ne the very true fruit and effect therof. And therfore when the Church by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and with the minister prayeth that the creatures of bread and wine, set on the aultar (as the booke of common prayer in this Realme hath ordred) may be vnto vs the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ, we require then the celebration of the same Supper, which Christ made to his Apostles, for to be the continuall memory of his death, with all fruite and effect, such as the same had in the first institution.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore when the minister pronounceth Christes wordes, as spoaken of his mouth, it is to be beléeued, that Christ doth now, as he did then. And it is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although in the Sacrament of Baptisme, the minister saith (I baptise thée,) yet in the celebration of his Supper, the wordes be spoaken in Christes person, as saying him selfe, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is broaken for you, which is to vs not onely a memory, but an effectuall memory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> with the very presence of Christes body and bloud, our very Sacrifice. Who doing now, as he did then, offreth him selfe to his Father as he did then, not to renue that offering, as though it were imperfecte, but continually to refresh vs, that daily fall and decay. And as S. Iohn saith, Christ is our aduocate and intreateth for vs, or pleadeth for vs, not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any want on Gods behalfe, but to relieue our wantes in edification, wherein the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Church trauaileth to bring man to perfection in Christ, which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7682:59"/>
doth assist, and absolutely performe in his Church, his misticall body. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue Christes body thus present in the celebration of the holy Supper, and by Christes mouth present vnto vs, saying, this is my body which is betraied for you. Then haue we Christes body recommended vnto vs as our Sacrifice, and a Sacrifice propitiatory for all the sinnes of the world, being the onely Sacrifice of Christes Church, the pure and cleane Sacrifice wherof the Prophet Malachie spake,<note place="margin">Mala. 1.</note> and wherof the Fathers in Christs church haue since the beginning continually written, the very true presence whereof, most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beléeued, hath encreased from time to time such ceremonies as haue béene vsed in the celebration of that Supper, in which by Christes own mouth we be ascertained of his most glorious death and passion, and the selfe same body that suffred, deliuered vnto vs in mistery to be eaten of vs, and therefore so to be worshipped and acknowledged of vs, as our very onely Sacrifice, in whom, by whom, and for whom, our other priuate giftes and Sacrifices be acceptable, and no otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Errors.</note>And therfore as Christ declareth in the Supper himselfe an offering, and Sacrifice for our sinne: offering himselfe to his Father as our Mediator, and so therewith recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to his Father the Church his body, for which he suffreth: so the Church at the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Supper in their offering of laudes and thankes,<note place="margin">The whole church by the minister the priest offereth Christ present as a sacrifice propitiatory, wherin is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed our Lords death.</note> with such other giftes as they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued from God, ioyne them selues with their head Christ, presenting, and offering him, as one by whom, for whom, and in whom, all that by Gods grace man can doe well, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable, and acceptable, and without whom, nothing by vs done, can be pleasaunt in the sight of God. Wherupon this perswasion hath béen truely conceiued, which is also in the booke of common prayer, in the celebration of the holy supper retained, that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable at that time, when the memory of Christes death is solemnized, to remember with prayer all estates of the Church, and to recommend them to God, which S. Paule to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, séemeth to require. At which time as Christ signifieth vnto vs the certainty of his death, and geueth vs to be eaten, as it were in pledge, the same his precious body that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: So we for declaration of our confidence in the death and Sacrifice, doe kindely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with thankes his speciall giftes: and charitably remember the rest of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Christes church with praier, and as we are able, should with our bodely goodes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at that time specyally to reléeue such as haue néede by pouerty.</p>
                  <p>And againe, as Christ putteth vs in remembraunce of his great benefite, so we should throughly remember him for our parte, with the true confession of this mistery, wherin is recapitulate a memoriall of all giftes and misteries that God in Christ hath wrought for vs. In the consideration and estimation wherof, as there hath been a fault in the securitie of such, as so their names were remembred in this holy time of memory, they cared not how much they forgat themselues: So there may be a fault in such, as neglecting it, care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> not whether they be remembred there at all, &amp; therfore would haue it nothing but a plain eating and drinking. How much the remembrance in prayer may auaile, no man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, but that it auaileth euery christen man must confesse. Man may nothing arrogate to his deuotion.<note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> But S. Iames said truely (<hi>Multum valet oratio iusti assidua.</hi>) It is to be abhorred to haue hipocrites that counterfaite deuotion, but true deuotion is to be wished of God and prayed for, which is Gods gifte, not to obscure his glory, but to set it forth, not that we should then trust in mennes merites and prayers, but laude and glorifie God in them (<hi>Qui talem potestatem dedit hominibus</hi>) one to be iudged able to reléeue another with his prayer, referring all to procéede from God, by the mediation of our Sauiour and redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iesus Christ.</p>

And so Christes blessed passion (which he most obediently and willingly suffered for our saluation vpon the crosse,) was not the onely and sufficient sacrifice for remission of our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>The onely will (I graunt) both in good thinges and euill, is accepted, or reiected before God, and sometime hath the name of the facte, as the will of Abraham to offer his sonne, is called the oblation of his sonne:<note place="margin">The declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christes will to die, was not a sacrifice propiciatory for sinne.</note> and Christ called him an adulterer, in his hart that desireth another mannes wife, although there be no fact committed in deede.</p>

And Abraham himselfe (commanding hys seruauntes to tary at the foot of the hill) caryed the fire and sword wherwith he entended (as God had commaunded) to kill his own sonne whom he so deerely loued. And by the way as they went, his sonne sayd vnto his father: Father, see, here is fire and wood, but where is the sacrifice that must be killed? How these wordes of the sonne pearced the fathers hart, euery louinge father may iudge by the affection which he beareth to his own children. For what man would not haue been abashed and stayed at these wordes? thinking thus within him selfe: Alas sweete sonne, thou doest aske me where the sacrifice is, thy self art the same sacrifice that must be slayn, &amp; thou (poore innocent) caryest thine own death vpon thy backe, and the wood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thy self must be brent.

But nothing could altar Abrahams hart, or moue him to disobey God, but forth on he goeth with his sonne to the place which God had appointed, and there he made an altar, and layd the wood vpon it, and bound his sonne, &amp; layd him vpon the heape of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woode in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and tooke the sword in his hand, and lifted vp his arme to strike, and kill his sonne, and would haue done so in deede if the angell of God had not letted him, commaunding him in the stede of his sonne to take a ram, that was fast by the hornes in the bryars. This obedience of Abraham vnto Gods commaundement in offering of his sonne, declared by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actes and circumstances, is called in the Scripture the offering of his sonne, and not the will onely.</p>
                  <p>Nor the scripture calleth not the declaration of Christes will in his last supper to suffer death, by the name of a sacrifice satisfactory for sinne, nor saith not that he was there offered in deede.

And by those sacrifices al christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to God, but they offer not Christ again for sin, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did neuer creature but Christ him self alone: nor he neuer but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good Fryday. For although he did institute the night before a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of his death, vnder the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of bread &amp; wine, yet he made not at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time the sacrifice of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; satisfaction for our sinnes, but the next day following. And the declaration of Christ at his last supper, that he would suffer death, was not the cause wherfore Ciprian sayd that Christ offered himselfe in his supper. For I reade not in any place of Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,<note place="margin">Cyprianus lib. 2. epi. 3.</note> to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, any such wordes that Christ offered himselfe in his supper, but he saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ offered the fame thing whiche Melchisedech offered. And if Ciprian say in any place, that Christ offered himself in his supper, yet he sayd not, that Christ did so for this cause, that in his supper he declared his death. And therfore here you make a deceitful <hi>fallax</hi> in sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, pretending to shew that thing to be a cause, which is not the true cause in deede. For the cause why Ciprian, and other olde authors, say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ made an oblation, and offering of him selfe in his last supper, was not that he declared there, that he would suffer death, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had declared many times before, but the cause was that there he ordained a perpetuall memory of his death, which he would all faithfull christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people to obserue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, remembring his death, with thankes for his benefites, vntill his comming again. And therfore the memoriall of the true sacrifice made v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the crosse (as S. Augustine saith) is called by the name of a sacrifice,<note place="margin">August. ad Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacium epist. 23.</note> as a thing that signifyeth an other thing, is called by the name of the thing which it signifyeth, although in very deede it be not the same.</p>
                  <p>And the long discourse that you make of Christes true presence, and


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7682:61"/>
of the true eating of him, and of his true assisting vs in our doing of his commaundement, all these be true. For Christes flesh &amp; bloud be in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> truely present, but spiritually and sacramentally, not carnally, and corporally. And as he is truely present, so is he truely eaten and dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and assisteth vs. And he is the same to vs, that he was to them that saw him with their bodely eyes.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite: For neither is Christes body verely, and corporally, present in the celebration of his holy supper, but spiritually. Nor his body is not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sacrifice, but the thing wherof the sacrifice was made: and the very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was the crucifying of his body, and the effusion of his bloud vnto death. Wherfore of his body was not made a sacrifice propitiatory for all the sinnes of the world at his supper, but the next day after vpon the cros. Therfore sayth the Prophet that we were made whole by his wounds: <hi>Liuore eius sanati sumus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay. 53.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor that sacrifice of Christ in the celebration of the supper, is not the only sacrifice of the church, but all the workes that christen people doe to the glory of God, be sacrifices of the church, smelling sweetly before God. And they be also the pure and clean sacrifice, wherof the Prophet Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy did speake. For the Prophet Malachy spake of no such sacrifices as onely priestes make, but of such sacrifice as all christen people make both day and night, at all times, and in all places.</p>
                  <p>Nor Christ doth not now as he did at his last Supper which he had with his Apostles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for then (as you say) he declared his will, that he would dye for vs. And if he do now as he did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he now declare that he will dye for vs againe.</p>
                  <p>But as for offering him self now as he did then, this speech may haue a true sence, being like to that which sometime was vsed at the admission of vnlearned fryers and monkes vnto their degrees in the Uniuersities: where the Doctor that presented them, deposed that they were meete for the sayd degrees, as well in learning as in vertue. And yet that depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one sence was true, when in deede they were meete neither in the one nor in the other. So likewise, in that sence Christ offereth himself now, as well as he did in his supper, for in deede he offered himself a sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciatory for remission of sinne in neither of both, but onely vpon the cros, making there a sacrifice full and perfect for our redemption, and yet by that sufficient offering made only at that time, he is a daily intercessor for vs to his father for euer. Finally, it is not true that the offering in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the supper, is not renued againe.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> For the same offering that is made in one Supper, is daily renued and made againe in euery supper, and is called the daily Sacrifice of the church.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue I broaken your chaine, and scattered your linkes, which may be called the very chaine of Belzebub, able to draw into hell as many as come within the compasse therof. And how would you require that men should geue you credite, who within so few lines, knitte together so many manifest lyes. It is another vntruth also which you say after, that Christ declared in the Supper him self an offering and sacrifice for sinne, for he declared in his Supper, not that he was then a sacrifice, but that a sacrifice should be made of his body, which was done the next day after, by the voluntary effusion of his bloud: &amp; of any other sacrificing of Christ for sinne, the Scripture speaketh not. For although the Scripture sayeth that our Sauiour Christ is a continual intercessor for vs vnto his father, yet no Scripture calleth that intercession, a sacrifice for sinne, but onely


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7682:62"/>
the effusion of his bloud, which it seemeth you make him to doe still, when you say that he suffereth, and so by your imagination he should now still be crucified, if he now suffer as you say he doth. But it seemeth you passe not greatly what you say, so that you may multiply many gallant wordes to the admiration of the hearers. But for as much as you say, that Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth him selfe in the celebration of the Supper, and also that the church offereth him, here I would haue you declare how the Church offereth Christ, and how he offereth him selfe, and wherein those offeringes stand, in wordes, deedes, or thoughtes, that we may know what you meane by your daily offering of Christ. Of offering our selues vnto God in all our actes and deedes, with laudes and thankes geuing, the scripture maketh mention in many places: But that Christ himself in the holy communion, or that the priests make any other oblation then all christen people doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these be papisticall inuentions without Scripture, I require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reason of you, that you should so plainly set out these deuised of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes, that men might plainly vnderstand what they be, and wherein they rest. Now in this comparyson, truth it is (as you say) that you haue spent many words: but vtterly in vayne, not to declare, but to darcken the matter. But if you would haue followed the plaine words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you needed not to haue taryed so long, and yet should you haue made the matter more cleere a great deale.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth my last comparison.</p>
                  <p>They say that Christ is corporally in many places at one time, affirming that his body is corporally,<note place="margin">The 13. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paryson.</note> and really present in as many places, as there be hostes consecrated. We say that as the sonne corporally is euer in heauen, &amp; no where els, and yet by his operation and vertue, the sonne is heare in earth, by whose influence and vertue all thinges in the world be corporally regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, increased, and grow to their perfect state: So likewise our sauiour Christ bodely and corporally is in heauen, sitting at the right hand of his Father, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though spiritually he hath promysed to be present with vs vpon earth, vnto the worldes end. And when soeuer two or three be gathered together in his name, he is there in the middest among them, by whose supernall grace, all godly men be first by him spiritually regenerated, and after increase and grow to their spirituall perfection in God, spiritually by faith eating his flesh, and drinking his bloud, although the same corporally be in heauen, farre distant from our sight.</p>

In this matter of similitudes, it is to be taken for a truth vndoubted, that there is no creature by similitude, ne any language of man able to expresse God and hys myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes. For and thinges that be sene or herd, might throughly expresse Gods inuisible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes, the nature wherof is that they can not throughly be expressed, they were no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and yet it is true, that of thinges visible, wherein God worketh wonderfully, there may be great resemblances, some shadowes, and as it were inductions, to make a man astonied, in consideration of thinges inuisible, when he séeth thinges visible so wonderfully wrought, and to haue so maruaylous effectes. And diuers good catholicke deuoute men haue by diuers naturall things gone about to open vnto vs the mistery of the trinitie, partely by the sonne, as the author doth in the Sacrament, partely by fyre, partely by the soule of man, by the Musitians science, the arte, the touch with the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fingers, and the sound of the cord, wherein wil hath all trauailed the matter, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth darke, ne can not be throughly set forth by any similitude.

For because I will not of my selfe begin the contention with this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: of the naturall worke of the Sonne, I will bryng forth the saying of Martin Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer<note place="margin">Bucerus.</note> now resident at Cambridge, who vehemently and for so much truly, affirmeth the trew reall presence of Christes body in the Sacrament: For he sayth, Christ sayd not, This is my spirite, this is my vertue, but, This is my body: Wherefore he sayth we must beleue Christes body to be there, the same that did hang vpon the crosse, our Lord hym selfe, whiche in some parte to declare, he vseth the similitude of the sonne for hys purpose, to proue Christes body present really and substancially in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where this author vseth the same similitude to proue the body of Christ really absent.

Verbo Domini simpliciter inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum est, &amp; debet fides sensuum de fectui praebere supplimentum.</hi> Which is thus much in English. As the sonne is truely placed determinately in one place of the visible heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet is truely and substantially present by meanes of hys beames els where in the world abroad: So our Lord although he be comprehended in one place of the secrete and diuine heauen, that is to say, the glory of hys father, yet neuerthelesse by hys word and holy tokens, he is exhibite present truly, whole God and man, and therfore in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in his holy supper, which presence mans mind geuing credite to his words and tokens with no lesse certaintie acknowlegeth, then our eyes see, and haue the sonne presente exhibited and shewed with his corporally lyght. This is a deep secrete matter and of the new testament, and a matter of fayth, and therfore herein thoughtes be not to be receiued of such a presentation of the body, as consisteth in the manner of thys life transitorie and subiect to suffer. We must simply cleaue to the word of Christ, and fayth must releue the default of our sences.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath Bucer expressed his minde, whereunto because the similitude of the sonne doth not aunswere in all partes, he noteth wisely in thende, howe this is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7682:63"/>
of faith, and therefore vpon the foundation of faith, we must speake of it, thereby to supply where our sences fayle. For the presence of Christ, and whole Christe God and man is true, although we can not thinke of the maner (how.) The chiefe cause why I bring in Bucer is this, to shew how in hys iudgement we haue not onely in earth the operation and vertue of the sonne, but also the substance of the sonne, by incane of the sonne beames, which be of the same substaunce with the sonne, and can not be deuided in substance from it, and therfore we haue in earth the substantiall presence of the sonne not onely the operation and vertue. And howsoeuer the sonne aboue in the distaunce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth vnto vs of an other sort, yet the beames that touch the earth, be of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce with it as clerkes say, or at the lest as Bucer sayth, whom I neuer harde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted Papiste, and yet for the reall and substantiall presence of Christes very body in the Sacrament, wryteth pithely and playnly, and here encountreth this auctor with his similitude of the sonne directly, whereby may appeare howe muche soeuer Bucer is estemed otherwise, he is not with this auctor regarded in the truth of the sacrament,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>, which is one of the high misteries in our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this may suffice for that point of the similitude where this auctor woulde haue Christe none otherwise present in the Sacrament, then he promised to be in thassemble of such as be gathered together in hys name, it is a playne abolition of the mistery of the sacrament, in the wordes whereof Christes humayne body is exhibite and made present with hys very fleshe to féede vs, and to that singuler and speciall effect the other presence of Christ in thassemble made in in hys name, is not spoken of, and it hath no apparaunce of learning in scriptures, to conclude vnder one consideration a specialitie, &amp; a generalitie. And therfore it was well answered of hym that sayd:<note place="margin">August serm. de tempore 159.</note> If I could tell reason, there were no fayth: If I could shew the like, it wer not singuler. Which doth be notable in this sacrament where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yning all reason, good men both constantly beleue that Christe sitteth on the right hand of hys father very God and man, and also without chaunge of place, doth neuerthelesse make himselfe by hys power present, both God and man vnder the forme of bread and wine, at the prayer of the Churche and by the ministery of the same, to geue life to suche as with fayth do according to his institution in hys holy supper worthely receyue hym, and to the condemnation of such as do unworthely presume to receaue hym there. For the worthy receyuing of whom we must come indued with Christ, and clothed with hym <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> semely in that garment, to receiue his most precious body and bloud, Christe whole God and man, wherby he then dwelleth in vs more aboundantly, confirming in vs the effectes of hys Passion &amp; establishing our hope of resurrection, then to enioy the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our body with a full redemption of body and soule, to lyue with God in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for euer.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for you be almost right hartely welcome home, and I pray you let vs shake handes together. For we be agreed (as me seemeth) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christs body is present, and the same body that suffered: and we be agreed also of the manner of his presence. For you say that the body of Christ is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but after a spirituall maner, and so say I also. And if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene vs two, it is but a little and in this point only: That I say, that Christ is but spiritually in the ministration of the Sacrament, and you say, that he is but after a spiritual maner in the Sacrament. And yet you say, that he is corporally in the Sacrament, as who should say, that there were a difference betweene spiritually, and a spirituall maner: And that it were not all one, to say that Christ is there onely after a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall maner, and not onely spiritually.</p>
                  <p>But if the substance of the Sonne be here corporally present with vs vpon earth,<note place="margin">The presence of the Sonne.</note> then I graunt that Christes body is so likewise. So that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of vs two that erreth in the one, let him be taken for a vaine man, and to


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7682:63"/>
erre also in the other. Therfore I am content that the reader iudge indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently betweene you and me, in the corporal presence of the sonne, and he that is found to erre, and to be a foose therin, let him be iudged to erre also in the corporall presence of Christes body.</p>

And although he was neuer your frend, yet exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your charity to helpe him in his necessity. But maister Bucer saith not so much as you do: and yet if you both said that the beames of the sonne, be of the same substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the sonne, who would beleue either of you both? Is the light of the candle the substance of the candle? or the light of the fire the substance of the fire? Or is the beames of the sonne any thing but the cleere light of the sonne? Now as you said euen now of me, if you erre so farre from the true iudgement of natuarll thinges, that all men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your error, what maruaile is it if you erre in heauenly thinges?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And why should you be offended with this my saying, that Christ is spiritually present in the assembly of such as be gathered together in his name: And how can you conclude hereof, that this is a plaine abolitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mistery of the Sacrament, because that in the celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I say that Christ is spiritually present? Haue not you confessed your self, that Christ is in the Sacrament but after a spirituall manner? And after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner he is also among them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be assembled together in his name. And if they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> say so, doe abolish the mistery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then do you abolish it your selfe, by saying that Christ is but after a spirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the sacrament, after which maner you say also that he is in them that be gathered together in his name, as well as I doe, that say hee is spiritually in both. But he that is disposed to pick quarrels, and to calumi ate all thinges: what can be spoken so plainly, or ment so sinceerely, but he will wrast it into a wrong sence. I say that Chist is speritually and by grace in his supper, as he is when two or three be gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name, meaning that with both he is spiritually, and with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporally, and yet I say not that there is no difference. For this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is, that with the one he is sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally, and with the other not sacramentally, except they be gathered together in his name to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Sacrament. Neuerthelesse the selfe same Christ is present in both, nourisheth and feedeth both, if the Sacrament be rightly receiued But that is onely Spiritually, (as I say) and onely after a Spirituall maner, as you say.</p>
                  <p>And you say further, that before we receiue the Sacrament, we must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> come indued with Christ, and seemely cloathed with him. But whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is indued and cloathed with Christ, hath Christ present with him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a spirituall maner, and hath receaued Christ whole both God &amp; man or els he could not haue euerlasting life. And therfore is Christ present as well in Baptisme, as in the Lordes Supper.

                  <p>YOu haue so perused these differences, that you haue made more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then euer was before: for where before there were no more but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> two partes, the true catholick doctrine, and the papisticall doctrine, now come you in with your new fantasticall inuentions, agreeing with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, but to make a song of three partes,<note place="margin">Thre partes made of two.</note> you haue deuised a new vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary descant, so farre out of tune, that it agreeth neither with the tenor, nor mean, but maketh such a shamefull iarre, that godly eares abhorre to heare it. For you haue taught such a doctrine, as neuer was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, aud vttered therein so many vntruthes, and so many strange sayinges, that euery indifferent Reader may easely discern, that the true christen faith in this matter is not to be sought at your handes. And yet in your own writinges appeareth some thing to confirme the truth, quite against your own enterprise, which maketh me haue some hope, that after my answere heard, we shall in the principall matter no more striue for the child, seeing that your selfe haue confessed that Christ is but after a spirituall maner present with vs. And there is good hope that God shall prosper this child to liue many yeares, seeing that now I trust you will help to foster and nourish it vp as well as I.</p>
                  <p>And yet if diuisyon may shew a stepmother, then be not you the true mother of the child,<note place="margin">The true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the childe.</note> which in the Sacrament make so many diuisions.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For you deuide the substances of bread and wine, from their proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences: the substances also of Christes flesh and bloud, from their own accidences, and Christes very flesh Sacramentally from his very bloud, although you ioyne them again <hi>per concomitantiam,</hi> and you deuide the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament so, that the priest receaueth both the Sacrament of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of his bloud: and the lay people (as you call them) receiue no more but the sacrament of his body, as though the sacrament of his bloud, and of our redemption, pertayned onely to the priestes. And the cause of our eternall life aud saluation you deuide in such sort betweene Christ and the priest, that you attribute the beginning therof to the sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse, and the continuance therof you attribute to the sacrifice of the priest in the masse, as you doe write plainly in your last booke. Oh wicked Stepmothers, that so deuide Christ, his Sacramentes, and his people.</p>
                  <p>After the differences followeth the 3.4.5. and 6. chapters of my book which you binde as it were all together in one fardel, and cast them quite away, by the figure which you call reiection, not answering one word to

any Scripture, or olde wryter, which I haue there alleadged for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the truth. But because the Reader may see the matter plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, I shall heare rehearse my words againe, and ioyne thereto your answere. My wordes be these.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne to the principall matter, lest it might be thought a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of vs, that Christ, as concerning his body and his humaine nature, is in heauen and not in earth: therefore by Gods grace it shalbe euidently proued, that this is no new deuised matter, but that it was euer the olde fayth of the catholicke Church, vntill the Papistes inuented a new fayth, that Christ real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, corporally,<note place="margin">Cap. 3. <hi>Christ corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is in hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen &amp; not in earth.</hi>
                     </note> naturally, and sensibly is here still with vs in earth, shutte vp in a boxe or within the compasse of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>This needeth no better nor stronger proofe, then that which the olde au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors bryng for the same, that is to say, the generall profession of all Christen people in the common creede,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The proofe thereof by our profession in our commune Creede.</hi>
                     </note> wherein as concerning Christes humanitye, they be taught to beleeue after this sort: That he was conceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary: That he suffered vnder Pontius Pilate: Was crucified, dead aud buried: that he decended into hel and rose againe the third day That he ascended into heauen; and sitteth at the right hand of his almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty Father: And from thence shal come to iudge the quick and dead.</p>
                  <p>This hath beene euer the catholick faith of Christen people, that Christ (as concerning his body and his manhode) is in heauen, and shall there conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nue vntill he come down at the last iudgement.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as the Creede maketh so expresse mention of the Article of his ascention, and departing hence from vs, if it had been an other article of our faith, that his body taryeth also here with vs in earth, surely in this place of the Creede was so vrgent an occasion geuen to make some mention thereof, that doubtlesse it would not haue been passed ouer in our Creede with silence. For if Christ (as concerning his humanity) be both here, and gone hence, and both those two be articles of our faith, when mention was made of the one in the Creede, it was necessary to make mention of the other, least by professing the one we should be disswaded from beleeuing the other, being so contrary the one to the other.</p>
                  <p>To this article of our Creed accordeth holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Cap. 4. <hi>The profe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Ioh. 16. Mat. 16. Mat. 24.</note> and all the old aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent doctors of Christes church, for Christ him self sayd, I leaue the world, and goe to my father. And also he sayd: you shall euer haue poore folkes with you, but you shall not euer haue me with you. And he gaue warning of this error before hand, saying that the time would come, when many deceauers should be in the world, and say: Here is Christ, and there is Christ, but beleue them not, said Christ. And S. Mark wryteth in the last chapter of his gospell,<note place="margin">Mar. vl.</note> that the Lord Iesus was taken vp into heauen, and sitteth at the right hand of his father. And S. Paul exhorteth all men to seeke for thinges that be aboue in heauen, where Christ (saith he) sitteth at the right hand of God his father.<note place="margin">Colos. 3.</note> Also he saith, that we haue such a bishoppe,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note> that sitteth in heauen at the right hand of the throne of Gods maiesty.

And hereunto consent all the olde doctors of the church.</p>

If he be here among vs still, how can he be gone hence as a straunger departed into another countrey? wherunto he answereth,<note place="margin">Origen. in Nath. ho. 33.</note> that Christ is both God and man, hauing in him two natures. And as a man he is not with vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worldes end, nor is present with all his faihtfull that be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name. But his diuine power and spirite is euer with vs. Paule (saith he) was absent from the Corinthes in his body, when he was present with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his spirite: So is Christ (sayth he) gone hence, and absent in his humanitie, which in his diuine nature is euery where. And in this saying (sayth Origen) we diuide not his humanitie `(for S. Iohn writeth, that no spirite that deuideth Iesus can be of God) but we reserue to both his natures, their own properties.</p>
                  <p>In these wordes Origen, hath playnly declared his mynd, that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not both present here with vs, and also gone hence and estranged from vs. For that were to make two natures of one body, and to deuide the body of Iesus, forasmuch as one nature can not at one tyme be both with vs, and abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from vs. And therefore sayth Origen: that the presence must be vnderstanded of his diuinitie, and the absence of his humanitie.</p>
                  <p>And according hereunto S. Austine writeth thus in a pistle <hi>Ad dardanum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August. ad Dar. dan. epist. 57.</note> Doubt not but Iesus Christ as concerning the nature of his manhood is now there, from whence he shall come. And remember well and beleeue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a christian man, that he rose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death ascended into heauen, sitteth at the right hand of his father, and from that place and none other, shall he come to iudge the quicke and the dead. And he shall come (as the Aungels sayd) as he was seene go into heauen, that is to say, in the same forme and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, vnto the which he gaue immortallytie, but chaunged not nature. After this forme (sayth he, meaning his mans nature, we may not thynke that he is euery wher. For we must beware, that we doe not so stablish his diuinity, that we take away the veritie of his body. These be S. Augustines playne wordes. And by and by after he addeth these wordes. The Lord Iesus as God, is euery where, and as man is in heauen. And finally he concludeth this matter in these few wordes. Doubt not but our Lord Iesus Christ is euery where as God, and as a dweller he is in man that is the temple of God, and he is in a certain place in heauen, because of the measure of a very body.</p>
                  <p>And agayne S. Augustin) writeth vpon the Gospel of S. Iohn.<note place="margin">In Iohan. Tract. 30.</note> Our sauiour Iesus Christ (sayth S. Augustine) is aboue, but yet his truth is here. His body wherein he arose is in one place, but his truth is spred euery where.</p>
                  <p>And in an other place of the same booke S. Augustine expounding these wordes of Christ. (You shall euer haue poore men with you,<note place="margin">Tracta. 50.</note> but me you shall not euer haue) saith: that Christ spake these words of the presence of his body. For (saith he) as concerning his diuine maiesty, as concerning his prouidence as concerning his infallible and inuisible grace, these words be fulfilled which he spake: I am with you vnto the worldes ende. But as concerning the fleshe which he tooke in his carnation, as concerning that which was borne of the virgine: as concerning that which was apprehended by the Iewes, and crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon a tree, and taken downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse, lapped in linnen clothes and buried, and rose againe, and appered after his resurrection, as concerning that flesh, he sayd: You shall not euer haue me with you. Wherefore senig that as


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7682:65"/>
concerning his flesh, he was conuersant with his disciples forty dayes, and they accompanying, seeing, and not following him, he went vp into heauen, both he is not here (for he sitteth at the right hand of his father) and yet he is here, for he departed not hence as concerning the presence of his diuine Maiesty. As concerning the presence of his Maiesty, we haue Christ euer with vs, but as concerning the presence of his flesh he said truely to his disciples, ye shall not euer haue me with you. For as concerning the presence of his flesh, the church had Christ but a few dayes, yet now it holdeth him fast by faith, though it see him not with eyes. All these be S. Augustines wordes.</p>
                  <p>Also in an other booke, intitled to S. Augustine, is written thus:<note place="margin">De essentia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitatis.</note> 
                     <hi>We must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and confesse, that the Sonne of God (as concerning his diuinitie) is inuisible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body, immortall, and in circumscriptible: but as concerning his humanitie, we ought to beleeue and confesse that he is visible, hath a body, and it contayned in a certayn place, and hath truely all the members of a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of these wordes of S. Augustine, it is most cleere that the profession of the catholick faith is, that Christ (as concerning his bodely substance and nature of man) is in heauen, and not present here with vs in earth. For the nature and property of a very body, is to be in one place, and to occupy one place, and not to be euery where, or in many places at one time. And though the body of Christ (after his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ascention) was made immortall, yet this na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture was not taken away, for then (as S. Augustine saith) it were no very body. And further S. August. sheweth both the maner &amp; fourme how Christ is here present with vs in earth, &amp; how he is absent, saying that he is present by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature and maiesty, by his prouidence, &amp; by grace: But by his humain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and very body, he is absent from this world, and present in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Cyrillus likewise vpon the gospell of S. Iohn,<note place="margin">Cyrillus in Iohan. li. 6 cap. 14.</note> agreeth fully with S. Augustin saying: Although Christ tooke away from hence the presence of his body, yet in Maiestie of hys Godhead he is euer here, as he promised to his disciples at his departing: saying: I am with you euer vnto the worldes end.</p>
                  <p>And in an other place of the same booke,<note place="margin">Libro. 6. cap. 11.</note> saynct Cyrill sayth thus: Christian people must beleeue, that although Christ be absent from vs, as concerning hys body, yet by his power he gouerneth vs, and all thinges, and is present with all them that loue hym. Therfore he sayd: Truely, truely I say vnto you, where so euer there be two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the middes of them. For lyke as when he was conuersant here in earth as a man, yet then he filled heauen, and did not leaue the company of angelles: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so beyng now in heauen with hys flesh, yet he filleth the earth, and is in them that loue hym. And it is to be marked, that although Christ should go away onely as concerning hys flesh, (for he is euer present in the power of hys diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:) yet for a little time he sayd he would be with hys disciples. These be the wordes of Saynct Cyrill.</p>
                  <p>Sainct Ambrose also sayth,<note place="margin">Ambrosius in Lucam. li. 12. ca. 24.</note> that we must not seeke Christ vpon earth, <hi>nor in earth, but in heauen, where he sitteth at the right hand of hys father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And likewise saynct Gregory writeth thus.<note place="margin">Gregorius in Ho. Paschatis.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is not here by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of hys flesh, and yet he is absent no where by the presence of hys Maiesty.</hi>

                  <p>What subtilty thinkest thou (good reader) can the Papistes now imagin, to defend their pernitious errour, that Christ his humayn nature is bodyly here in earth, in the consecrated bread and wine: seeing that all the olde Churche of Christ beleued the contrary, and all the old authors wrote the contrary?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:7682:66"/>For they all affirmed and beleued, that Christ being but one person, hath neuerthelesse in him two natures or substances, that is to sav, the nature of his Godhead, and the nature of his manhood. They saye furthermore, that Christ is both gone hence from vs vnto heauen, and is also here with vs in earth, but not in his humaine nature, (as the Papistes would haue vs to beleue) but the olde authors say, that he is in heauen, as concerning his manhode, and neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles both here and there, and euery where, as concerning his Godhead. For although his diuinitie be such, that it is infinite, without measure, compasse, or place, so that as concerning that nature, he is circumscribed with no place, but is euery where, and filleth all the worlde: yet as concerning his humaine nature, he hath measure, compasse, and place, so that when he was here vpon earth, he was not at the same tyme in heauen: and now that he is ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, as concerning that nature, he hath now forsaken the earth, and is onely in heauen. For one nature that is circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scribed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed, &amp; measured, can not be in diuers places at one time.

                  </p>
                  <p>If than the nature of the Godhead must needes be circumscribed, if it were a body, much more must the nature of Christes manhood be circumscribed, and contayned within the compasse of a certaine place.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The same affirmeth Sainct Basil,<note place="margin">Basilius de spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu sancto ca. 22</note> That the Angell which was with Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, was not at the same tyme with Phillip, nor the Angell which spake to Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary in the altare, was not the same tyme in his proper place in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>But the holy Ghost was at one tyme in Abacuck, and in Daniell in Babilon, and with Ieremy in prison, and with Ezechiell in Chober, whereby he proueth, that the holy ghost is God.</hi>

left heauen when he came from heauen, nor he left not the earth, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen: which may be knowen by the most certain word of Christ himself, who to shew the placing of his humanitie, said to his disciples: I ascend vp to my father, and your father, to my God, and your God. Also when he had sayd of Lazarus that he was dead, he added, saying: I am glad for your sakes, that you may beleeue, for I was not there. But to shew the vnmeasurable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of his diuinitie, he sayd to his disciples: behold I am with you alwayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worldes end. Now how did he goe vp into heauen, but because he is a very man, conteined within a place? Or how is he present with faithful people but because he is very God, being without measure?</p>
                  <p>Of these words of Fulgentius it is declared most certainly, that Christ is not here with vs in earth but by his Godhead, and that his humanitie is in heauen onely, and absent from vs.</p>
                  <p>Yet the same is more plainly shewed (if more plainly can be spoken) by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius a bishoppe and an holy martyr.<note place="margin">Vigilius contra Eutycche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lib. 1.</note> He writeth thus against the heretick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utyches, which denyed the humanitie of Christ, holding opinion that he was only God, and not man. Whose error Vigilius confuting, proueth that Christ had in him two natures ioyned together in one person, the nature of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the nature of his manhoode. Thus he wryteth.</p>
                  <p>Christ sayd to his disciples: if you loued me you would be glad,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> for I go vnto my father. And again he sayd: It is expedient for you that I go, for if I goe not,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> the comforter shall not come vnto you. And yet surely the eternall word of God, the vertue of God, the wisdome of God, was euer with his Father, and in his Father, yea euen at the same time when he was with vs, aud in vs. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did mercifully dwell in this world, he left not his habitation in heauen, for he is euery where wholl with his Father, equall in diuinitie, whom no place can containe, for the Sonne filleth all thinges, and there is no place that lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the presence of his diuinitie. From whence then, and whether did he say he would goe? Or how did he say, that he went to his Father, from whom doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he neuer departed? But that to goe to his Father, and from vs, was to take from this world that nature which he receaued of vs. Thou seest therfore that it was the propertie of that nature to be taken away and goe from vs, which in the end of the world shall be rendered again to vs, as the angels witnessed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: This Iesus which is taken from you,<note place="margin">Actu. 1.</note> shall come agayn like as you saw him going vp into heauen. For looke vpon the miracle, looke vpon the mistery of both the natnres: the Sonne of God (as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his humanitie) went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as concerning his diuinity, he said vnto vs: Behold, I am with you all the dayes vnto the worldes end.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre haue I rehearsed the wordes of Vigilius,<note place="margin">Math. vl.</note> and by and by he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth thus. He is with vs, and not with vs. For those whom he left, and went from them, as concerning his humanitie, those he left not, nor forsooke them not, as touching his diuinitie. For as touching the forme of a seruaunt (which he tooke away from vs into heauen) he is absent from vs, but by the forme of God (which goeth not from vs) he is present with vs in earth, and neuertheles, both present and absent, he is all one Christ.</p>
                  <p>Hetherto you haue heard Vigilius speake, that Christ (as concerning his bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dely presence and the nature of his manhode) is gone from vs, taken from vs, is gone vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is not with vs, hath left vs, hath forsaken vs. But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the other nature of his Deitie, he is still with vs, so that he is both with


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7682:67"/>
vs, and not with vs, with vs in the nature of his Deitye, and not with vs in the nature of his humanity. And yet more cleerely doth the same Vigilius declare the same thing in another place,<note place="margin">Contra Eutice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lib. 4.</note> saying.</p>
                  <p>If the word and the flesh were both of one nature, seeyng that the word is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, why is not the flesh then euery where? For <hi>when it was in earth, then verely it was not in heauen: and now when it is in heauen, it is not surely in earth. And it is so sure that it is not in earth, that as concerning it, we loke for him to come from heauen, whom as concerning his eternall word: we beleue to be with vs in earth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by your doctrine (saith Vigilius vnto Eutiches, who defended that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity and humanity in Christ was but one nature) either the word is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a place with his flesh: or els the flesh is euery where with the word. For <hi>one nature cannot receiue in it selfe two diuers and contrary thinges.</hi> But these two thinges be diuers and farre vnlike, that is to say, to be conteyned in a place, aud to be euery where. Therfore in as much as the word is euery where, and the flesh is not euery where, it appeareth plainly, that one Christ himselfe hath in him two natures. And that by his diuine nature he is euery where, and by his humain nature he is contayned in a place, that he is created, and hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that he is subiect to death, and cannot dy. Wherof one he hath by the nature of his word (wherby he is God) and the other he hath hy the nature of his flesh, wherby the same God is man also. Therfore one sonne of God, the selfe same was made the sonne of man, and he hath a beginning by the nature of his flesh, and no beginning by the nature of his Godhead. He is created by the nature of his flesh, and not created by the nature of his Godhead. <hi>He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in a place by the nature of his flesh, and not comprehended in a place by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Godhead.</hi> He is inferior to angels in the nature of his flesh, and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to his Father in the nature of his Godhead. He dyed by the nature of his flesh, and dyed not by the nature of his Godhead. This is the faith and catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick confession, which the Apostles taught, the Martirs did corroborate, and faithfull people keepe vnto this day.</p>
                  <p>Al these be the sayinges of Vigilius, who according to al the other authors before rehearsed, and to the faith and catholick confession of the Apostles, Martyrs, &amp; all faithfull people vnto his time) saith, that as concerning Christs humanitie, when he was here on earth, he was not in heauen, and now when he is in heauen, he is not in earth. for one nature cannot be both conteined in a place in heauen, and be also here in earth at one time. And for as much as Christ is here with vs in earth, and also is conteined in a place in heauen, he proueth therby, that Christ hath two natures in him, the nature of a man, wherby he is gone from vs, and ascended into heauen, and the nature of his Godhead, wherby he is here with vs in earth. So that it is not one nature that is here with vs, and that is gone from vs, that is ascended into heauen and there conteined, and that is permanent here with vs in earth. Wherfore the papists (which now of late yeares haue made a new faith, that Christes naturall body is really and naturally present both with vs both here in earth, &amp; sitteth at the right hand of his Father in heauen) doe erre in two very horrible heresies.</p>
                  <p>The one, that they confound his two natures, his Godhead and his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode attributing vnto his humanitie, that thing which appertaineth onely to his diuinity, that is to say, to be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, earth, and in many places at one time. The other is, that they deuide and seperate his humain nature or his body, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of one body of Christ, two bodies and two natures, one which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7682:67"/>
visible and palpaple, hauing all members and proportions of a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect naturall man: and an other which they say is in earth here with vs, in euery bread and wine that is consecrated, hauing no distinction, forme, nor propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of members, which contrarieties and diuersities (as this holy Martyr Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius saith) cannot be together in one nature.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7682:68"/>
other Authors by me alleadged, he maketh this brief answere in generall, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatsoeuer those authors say, they meane no more, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is not here in earth visibly, naturally, &amp; by circumscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet neuerthelesse he is in the sacrament aboue nature, inuisibly, and without circumscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This suttle distinction hath Smith deuised (or rather followeth other Papistes therin) to answere the Authors which I haue alleadged. And yet of Smithes own distinction it followeth, that Christ is not in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament carnally and corporally.<note place="margin">Smithes vaine distinction.</note> For if Christ be in the Sacrament but supernaturally, inuisibly, &amp; without circumscription, then he is not there carnally, and corporally, as S. Augustine reasoneth <hi>ad Dardanum.</hi> But yet Smith onely saith that the Authors so meant, and proueth not one word of his saying, supposing that the old holy writers be like to the Papistes, which write one thing, and when they list not, or cannot defend it, they say they meane another.</p>
                  <p>For those Authors make no such distinction as Smith speaketh of, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming diuers and contrary things to be in one nature of Christ in diuers respectes, but their distinction is of the two natures in Christ, that is to say, the nature of his Godhead, and the nature of his manhode. And they affirme plainly that the diuersity wherof they spake, cannot be in one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as you say it is) but must needes argue &amp; proue diuersity of natures. And therfore by that diuersity and instinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christ, they proue against the heretickes, that Christ hath two natures in him, which were vtterly no proofe at all, if one nature in diuers respectes might haue that diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the heretickes should haue had a ready answere at hand, that such diuersitie proueth not that Christ had two natures, for one nature may haue such diuersity (if it be true that Smith saith.) And so Smith, with other papists which saith as he doth putteth a sword in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hereticks hands, to fight against the catholick faith. This (good Reader) thou shalt easely perceiue if thou doe no more but read the authors which I haue in this place alleadged.</p>
                  <p>And yet for thy more ready instruction, I shall make a brief rehearsal of the chief effect of them, as concerning this matter.<note place="margin">How both these sayinges may be true, that Christ is with vs, and also gone from vs.</note> To aunswere this question how it can be sayd that Christ is a stranger, and gone hence into heauen, and yet is also here with vs in earth, Smith and other Papistes resolue this matter by diuers respectes in one nature of Christ, but the old catholick wryters which I alleadged, resolue the matter by two natures in Christ,<note place="margin">The sume of thold authors wryting in this matter.</note> affirming most certainly that such two diuers thinges can not haue place both in one nature. And therfore say they that Christ is gone hence, and is absent in his humanitie, who in his Deity is still here with vs. They say also that as concerning his mannes nature, the Catholicke profession in our Creede, teacheth vs to beleeue that he hath made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, but not changed the nature of a very mannes body, for his body is in heauen, and in one certain place of heauen, because that so requireth the measure and compasse of a very mannes body.</p>
                  <p>It is also (say they) visible, and hath all the members of a perfecte mannes body. And further they say, that if Christes body were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned within the compasse of a place, it were no body, in so much that if the Godhead were a body, it must needes be in a place, and haue quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, bignes, and circumscription. For all creatures (say they) visible, and


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7682:68"/>
inuisible, be circumscribed, and conteyned within a certain compas, ether locally within one place (as corporall and visible thinges be) or els with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the property of their own substance (as angels and inuisible creatures be.) And this is one strong argument, whereby they proue that the holy Ghost is God, because he is in many places at one time, which no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be as they teach. And yet they say moreouer, that Christ did not ascend into heauen, but by hys humanitie, nor is not heare in earth but by hys diuinitie, which hath no compasse nor measure. And finally they say that to go to hys father from vs, was to take from vs that nature which he receaued of vs: and therfore when hys body was in earth, then surely it was not in heauen, and now when it is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, surely it is not in earth For one nature can not haue in it selfe two sundry and contrary thinges.</p>
                  <p>All things here rehearsed be written by the old auncient authors which I haue alleadged, and they conclude the whole matter in this wise that this is the fayth and Catholique confession, which the Apostles taught, the Martyres did corroborate, and faythfull people keepe vnto this day. Wherby it appeareth euidently, that the doctrine of Smyth and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, at that day was not yet sprong, nor had taken no roote.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore diligently ponder and way (I besech thee gentle reader) the sayinges of these authors, and see whether they say, that one nature in Christ may be both in heauen and in earth, both here with vs, and absent from vs at one tyme, and whether they resolue this matter of Christs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heauen and in earth (as Smith doth) to be vnderstand of his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hoode in diuersitie of these respectes visible and inuisible. And when thou hast well considered the authors sayinges, then geue credite to Smith as thou shalt see cause.</p>
                  <p>But this allegation of these authors hath made the matter so hote, that the Bishop of Winchester durste not once touch it, and Smith as soone as he had touched it, felt it so scawlding hote, that he durst not abyde it, but shranke away by and by for feare of burning his fingers. Now here what followeth further in my booke.</p>
                  <p>But now seeing that it is so euident a matter,<note place="margin">Cap. 7. <hi>An aunswere to the Papists, alleaging for them these wordes, This is my body.</hi>
                     </note> both by the expresse words of Scripture, and also by all the old authors of the same, that our Sauiour Christ (as concerning his bodely presence) is ascended into heauen, and is not here in earth. And seeing that this hath been the true confession of the Catholicke faith, euer since Christes ascention, it is now to be considered what mooued the Papistes to make a new and contrary faith, and what Scriptures haue they for their purpose. What moued them I know not but their own iniquitie, or the nature and condition of the sea of Rome, which is of al other most contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Christ, and therfore most worthy to be called the sea of Antichrist. And as for Scripture they alleadge none but onely one, and that not truely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, but to serue their purpose wrested out of tune, wherby they make it to iarre, and sound contrary to all other Scriptures pertaining to the matter.</p>
                  <p>Christ toke bread (say they) blessed, &amp; brake it, &amp; gaue it to his disciples, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: This is my body: These words they euer still repeate and beate vpon,<note place="margin">The argumet of the Papists.</note> that Christ sayd this is my body. And this saying they make their shooteanker, to proue therby as well the reall and naturall presence of Christs body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as their imagined Transubstantiation. For these words of Christ, say


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7682:69"/>
they, be most plain, and most true. Then for as much as he said, This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it must needes be true that that thing which the Priest holdeth is his hands is Christs body. And if it be Christes body, then can it not be bread. Whereof they gather by their reasoning, that there is Christes body really present, and noe bread.</p>

                  <p>That bread (I say) that is one of the creatures here in earth among vs, and that groweth out of the earth, and is made of many graynes of corne beaten into flower, and mixed with water, and so baken aud made into bread, of such sort as other our bread is, that hath neither sence nor reason, and finally that feedeth and nourisheth our bodies, such bread Christ called his body, when he sayd, This is my body, And such wine as is made of grapes pressed togither and thereof is made drinke, whiche nourishe the body, such wine he called his bloud.</p>
                  <p>This is the true doctrine, confirmed as well by the holy scripture, as by all auncient authours of Christes Church, both Greekes and Latines, that is to say, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Sauiour Christ gaue bread and wine to his disciples, &amp; spake these words, This is my body, This is my bloud, it is very bread &amp; wine which he called his body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>Now let the Papistes shew some authority for their opinion, either of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of some aunciant author. And let them not constrayne all men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their fond deuises, only because they say, It is so, without any other grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or authoritie, but their owne bare wordes. For in such wise credite is to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Gods word only, and not to the word of any man.

not bread his body, nor wine his bloud, when he sayd, This is my body, This is my bloud. And yet in expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding these wordes, they vary among them selues: which is a token that they be vncertaine of their own doctrine.</p>
                  <p>For some of them say, that by this pronoune demonstratiue (this) Christe vnderstoode not the bread and wine, but his body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>And other some say, that by the pronoune (this) he ment neither the bread nor wine, not his body nor bloud, but that he ment a particuler thyng vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which they call <hi>Indiuiduum vagum,</hi> or <hi>Indiuiduum in genere,</hi> I trowe some Mathematicall quiditee, they can not tell what.</p>

                  <p>Cypryan saith according hereunto hows bread is by Gods omnipotency made fleshe, whereupon also this spech (bread is flesh) is as much to say as made flesh, not that bread beyng bread is flesh, but that was bread is flesh by Gods omnipotency, and so this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor entreating this matter as he doth, hath partly opened the fayth of transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Therefore I haue not here partly opened the faith of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as you say of me) but you haue here manifestly opened the wisedome of the Papisticall doctrine, which is more foolish, then were to be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a scoffer in a play.</p>
                  <p>But what neede I much to contend with you in this place, seing that you graunt the thing for the whiche I cyted all these authors, that is to say that Christ called bread his body,<note place="margin">Whether Christ called bread his body.</note> when he said, This is my body?</p>
                  <p>And in your detection of the Deuils sophestrie (as you call it) you say <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that Christ spake plainly, This is my body, making demonstration of the bread, when he said, This is my body. But it seemeth you be sory that you haue graunted so much, and that you spake those wordes vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, before you knew what the Papistes had written in this matter: and now when you perceaue how farre you varie from them, you would fain call your wordes backe agayn, and prepare away for the same, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus: When Christ said (This is my body) there is no necessitie, that the demonstratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (this) should be referred to the outward visible matter, but may be referred to the inuisible substaunce. In these your wordes it semeth you begin to doubt in that thing which before you certainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme without all doubt.</p>
                  <p>And when you haue confessed the whole matter that I do here proue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which is onely this, that Christ called bread his body &amp; wine his bloud. when he sayd, This is my body, This is my bloud: yet you conclude your aunswere with an issue of mine ignoraunce, that it is so great, that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not what I say, if my knowledge be no better, then is vttered here in my pen. And yet my wordes be so playne, that the least chyld (as they say) in the town, may vnderstand them. For all my study is to speak plain, that the truth may be known, and not with darke speches (as you do) to hide the truth. But when I had made a plaine issue against all the Papists in general, it had bene your part to haue ioyned in the sayd issue and not to deuise new issues.</p>
                  <p>But because neither you nor Smith dare ioyne with me in mine issue I shall repete mine issue againe,<note place="margin">Smyth.</note> and take it for confessed of you both, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

neither of you dare say the contrary, &amp; ioyne an issue with mee ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. My issue is this,<note place="margin">Mine Issue.</note> 
                     <hi>Let all the Papists together shew any one authority, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of scripture or of auncient author, either Greeke or Latine, that sayth as they say, that Christ called not bread and wine his body and bloud, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduum vagum, and for my part I shall giue them place, and confesse that they say true. And if they can shew nothing for them of antiquitie, but onely their owne bare wordes, then it is reason that they geue place to the truth, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by so many authorities both of scripture and of auncient writers, which is, that Christ called very materiall bread his body, and very wine made of grapes, his bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it shall not be much amisse, to examine here the wise deuise of M. Smith,<note place="margin">Smyth.</note> what he can say to this matter, that the opinion of diuers Doctours may be knowen, as well of Doctour Smith, as of Doctour Gardyner. It is very false (sayth Smith to me) that you do say, that as these wordes (This is my body) do lye, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be gathered of them none other sence, but that bread is Christes body, and that Christes body is bread. For there can no such thing be gathered of those wordes, but onely that Christ gaue his disciples his very body to eat, into which he had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bread, when he spake those wordes. First, Smith vseth here a great and manifest falsehead in reciting of my sentence, leauing out those wordes which should declare the truth of my saying. For I say that by this maner of speache playnly vnderstand without any figure, there can be gathered none other sence, but that bread is Christes body. In which my sentence he leaueth out these wordes (by this maner of spech playnly vnderstand without any figure) which wordes be so materiall, that in them resteth the pith and triall of the whole sentence.</p>
                  <p>When Christ tooke the v. loaues and ij. fishes,<note place="margin">Math. 14. Marc. 6. Luc. 9. Iohn. 6.</note> and looking vp into heauen blessed them, and brake them, and gaue them vnto his disciples, that they should distribute them vnto the people, if he had then said, Eate, this is meate, which shall satisfie your hunger: by this maner of speach playnly vnderstand without any figure, could any other sence haue been gathered, but that the bread and fishes which he gaue them was meate? And if at the same tyme he had blessed wine, and commaunding them to drinke therof, had sayd: This is drinke, which shall quench your thirst: what could haue been gathered of those wordes playnly vnderstand without any figure, but that he called wine drinke? So lykewise when he blessed bread and wine, and gaue them to his disciples, saying: Eate, thys is my body: Drinke, this is my bloud: what can be gathered of this maner of speach playnly vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without any figure, but that he called the bread his body, &amp; wine his bloud? For Christ spake not one word there of any changyng or turning of the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread, no more then he did when he gaue the loaues &amp; fishes. And therfore the maner of speach is all one, and the changing of the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces can no more be proued by the phrase and fashion of speach, to be in the one then in the other, whatsoeuer you Papistes dreame of your owne heades without Scripture, that the substaunce of the bread is turned into the substaunce of Christes body.</p>
                  <p>But Smith bringeth here newes, vsing such strange and noueltie of speache,<note place="margin">Smith.</note> as other Papistes vse not, which he doth either of ignoraunce of his Grammar, or els that he dissenteth farre from other Papistes in


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7682:72"/>
iudgement. For he sayth, that Christ had turned the bread when he spake these wordes, This is my body. And if Smith remember his Accidence, the preterpluperfect tence signifieth the tyme that is more than perfectly past, so that if Christ had turned the bread when he spake those wordes, then was the turning done before and already past, when he spake those wordes, which the other Papistes say was done after, or in the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the wordes. And therfore they vse to speake after this sort, that when he had spoken the wordes, the bread was turned, and not that he had turned the bread when he spake the wordes.</p>
                  <p>An other noueltie of speach Smith vseth in the same place, saying that Christ called his body bread, bycause he turned bread into it, it semeth and appeareth still to be it, it hath the qualitie and quantitie of bread, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the foode of the soule as corporall meate is of the body. These be Smithes wordes: which if he vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the outward forme of bread, it is a noueltie to say, that it is the foode of the soule: and if he meane of the very body of Christ, it is a more strange noueltie to say, that it hath the quantitie and qualitie of bread. For there was neuer man (I trow) that vsed that maner of speach, to say that the body of Christ hath the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie and qualitie of bread, although the Papistes vse this spech, that the body of Christ is conteined vnder the forme, that is to say, vnder the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tities and qualities of bread.</p>
                  <p>Now when Smith should come to make a direct answere vnto the authorities of the old writers, which I haue brought forth to proue that Christ called bread his body when he sayd, This is my body: Smith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth no more but this: the Doctors which you my Lord alledge here for you, proue not your purpose. Forsoth a substantiall answer, and well proued, that the Doctours by me alledged proue not my purpose, for Smith sayth so. I looked here that Smith should haue brought forth a great number of authors to approue his saying, and to reproue mine, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seing that I offered fayre play to him, and to all the Papists, ioyned with him in one trowpe.</p>
                  <p>For after that I had alledged for the proofe of my purpose, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of old authors, both Greekes and Latines, I prouoked the Papistes to say what they could to the contrary. Let all the Papistes together (sayd I) shew any one authoritie for them, either of Scripture or auncient Author, eyther Greeke or Latin, and for my part I shall giue them place. And if they can shew nothing for them of antiquitie, then is it reason that they giue place to the truth, confirmed by so many autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, both of Scripture and of auncient writers, which is, that Christ called very materiall bread his body, and very wine made of grapes, his bloud.</p>
                  <p>Now I referre to thy iudgement, indifferent reader, whether I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Papistes reason or no? and whether they ought not, if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to shew, to haue brought it forth here? And for as much as they haue brought nothing, (being thus prouoked with all their counsayle) whether thou oughtest not to iudge, that they haue nothing in deede to shew, which if they had, without doubt we should haue hard of it in this place. But we heare nothing at all, but these their bare wordes, not one of all these Doctors sayth as ye do, my Lord, Which I put in thy discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7682:72"/>
indifferent Reader, to vew the Doctours wordes by me alleaged and so to iudge.</p>
                  <p>But they say not that there is onely bread in the Sacrament (sayth Smith) and not Christes body: what then? What is that to purpose here in this place, I pray you? For I goe not about in this place to proue that onely bread is in the sacrament, and not Christes body: but in this place I proue onely, that it was very bread, which Christ called his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and very wine which he called his bloud, when he sayd, This is my body: This is my bloud. Which Smith with all his rablement of the Papistes deny, and yet all the old Authors affirme it with Doctor Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Gardiner, late Bishope of Winchester also, who sayth that Christ made demonstration vpon the bread, when he sayd, This is my body. And as all the old Authors be able to counteruayle the Papistes: so is the late Bishope able to matche Smith in this mater, so that we haue at the least a Rowland for an Oliuer. But shortly to comprehend the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of Smith: where I haue proued my sayinges, a dosen leaues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by the authoritie of Scripture and old catholike writers, is this a sufficient aunswer, onely to say without any proofe, that al my trauayl is lost? and that all that I haue alleadged is nothing to the purpose? Iudge indifferently gentle Reader, whether I might not by the same reason cast away all Smithes whole booke, and reiect it quite &amp; cleane with one word, saying, All his labore is lost and to no purpose. Thus Smith and Gardiner being aunswered, I will returne agayne to my booke, where it followeth thus.</p>
                  <p>Now this being fully proued, it must needes folow consequently, that this manner of speaking is a figuratiue speach.<note place="margin">Cap. 9. <hi>Bread to my body. Wyne to my bloud, be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                     </note> For in playne, and proper speach, it is not true, to say that bread is Christes body, or wine his bloud. For Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body hath a soule, lyfe, sence, and reason: but bread hath neither soule, lyfe sence, nor reason.</p>
                  <p>Lykewise in playne speche it is not true, that we eate Christes body, and drinke his bloud. For eating &amp; drinking in their proper and vsuall significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is with the tongue, teeth, and lyppes, to swallow, diuide, and chawe in peeces: which thinge to do to the flesh and bloud of Christ, is horrible to be heard of any Christian.</p>
                  <p>So that these speaches, To eate Christes body and drinke his bloud,<note place="margin">Cha. 10. <hi>To eate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes flesh and drinke his bloud be figuratiue speaches.</hi>
                     </note> to call bread his body, and wine his bloud, be speches not taken in the proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of euery worde, but by translation of these wordes, (eating, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,) from the signification of a corporall thing, to signifie a spirituall thing: and by calling a thing that signifieth, by the name of the thing which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby. Which is no rare nor straunge thing, but an vsuall manner, and phrase in common speech. And yet least this faulte should be imputed vnto vs, that we do fayne thinges of our owne heades without auctoritie, (as the papistes be accustomed to do,) here shall be cited sufficient authoritye, as well of Scriptures, as of olde auncient authors, to approue the same.</p>
                  <p>First when our Sauiour Christ in the sixt of Iohn sayd, that he was the bread of lyfe, which who so euer did eate, should not dye, but liue for euer: and that the bread which he would geue vs, was his flesh: and therefore who so euer should eate his flesh, and drinke his bloud, should haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting lyfe: and they that should not eate his flesh, and drinke his bloud, should not haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7682:73"/>
lyfe. When Christ had spoken these wordes, with many moe, of the eating of his flesh, and drinking of his bloud, both the Iewes, and many also of his disciples were offended with his wordes, and sayd: This is an hard saying. For howe can hee geue vs his flesh to be eaten? Christ perceiuing their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring hartes (because they knew none other eating of his flesh, but by chawing, and swallowing) to declare, that they should not eate his body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that sort, nor that he ment of any such carnall eating, he sayd thus vnto them: What yf you see the sonne of man ascend vp where he was before? It is the spirite that geueth life, the flesh auaileth nothing: the words which I spake vnto you, be spirite and lyfe.</p>
                  <p>These wordes our Sauiour Christ spake, to lift vp their mindes from earth to heauen, and from carnall to spirituall eating, that they should not phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, that they should with their teeth eate him present here in earth: for his flesh so eaten (sayth he,) should nothing profite them. And yet so they should not eate him, for he would take his body away from them, and ascend with it into heauen: and there by fayth, and not with teeth, they should spiritually eate him sitting at the right hand of his father. And therefore (sayth he,) The wordes which I do speake, be spirite and lyfe: That is to say, are not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that we shall eate Christ with our teeth, grossely, and carnally, but that we shall spiritually, and gostly with our fayth, eate him, being carnally absent from vs in heauen. And in such wise, as Abraham and other holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eate him, many yeares before he was incarnated, and borne, as Saint Paule sayth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 20.</note> that all they did eate the same spirituall meate that we doo, and drinke the same spirituall drinke: that is to say, Christ. For they spiritually by their fayth, were fed and nourished with Christes body and bloud, and had eternall lyfe by him, before he was borne, as we haue now, that come after his ascention.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue you heard the declaration of Christ himselfe, and of Saint Paul that the eating, and drinking of Christes fleshe, and bloud, is not taken in the common signification, with mouth, and teeth, to eate, and chaw a thing being present, but by a liuely fayth in hart and minde, to chaw, and digest a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent, either ascended hence into heauen, or els not yet borne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth.</p>

                  <p>In the lx. leaf the auctor entreateth whether it be a plaine spéech of Christ to say (eate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and drincke) speaking of his body and bloud. I answer, the spéech of it selfe is propre: commaunding them present to eate and drincke that is proponed for them: and yet it is not requisite that the nature of man should with like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon effect worke, in eating and drinking that heauenly meate &amp; drincke, as it doth in earthly and carnall meates. In this mistery man doth as Christ ordeined, that is to say, receyue with his mouth, that is ordered to be receiued with his mouth, graunting it neuerthelesse of that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and estimation, that Christes wordes affirms: and whether he so doth or no, Christes ordinaunce is as it is in the substaunce of it selfe alone, whereof no good man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> iudgeth carnally or grosely, ne discusseth the vnfaythfull question (how) which he can not conceiue, but leaueth the déepenes thereof, and doth as he is bidden.

in speaking of this high mystery. Wherein I will make the issue with this author, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> no catholike teaching is so framed with such termes, as though we should eate Christs most precious body grossely, carnally, ioyning those wordes so together. For els (car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) alone may haue a good signification, as Hillary vseth it: but contrariwise spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Catholique teaching of the maner of Christes presence, they call it a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall maner of presence, and yet there is present by gods power the very true naturall body and bloud of Christ, whole God &amp; man, without leauing his place in heauen: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> in the holy supper men vse their mouthes, and téeth, following Christes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the receiuing of that holy Sacrament, being in fayth sufficiently instruct, that they can not ne do not teare, consume, or violate that most precious body and bloud, but vnworthely receiuing it, are cause of their owne iudgement and condemnation.</p>

                  <p>Now I will touch shortly what may be sayd to the particular authorities brought in by this author.<note place="margin">Origenes.</note> Origen is noted (among other writers of the church) to draw the text to all egories, who doth not therby meane to destroy the truth of the letter, and therefore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he speaketh of a figure, sayth not there is onely a figure, which exclusiue (only) being away, (as it is not found by any author Catholick taught that the spéech of Christ of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eating of his flesh to be onely a figure) this author had nothing aduanced his purpose. As for spiritual vnderstanding meaneth not any destruction of the letter wher the same may stand with the rules of our faith. All Christes words be life and spirit, contayning in the letter many tymes that is aboue our capacity, as specially in this place of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his flesh, to discusse the particularities of (how) &amp; yet we must beleue to be true that Christ sayth (although we can not tell how:) For when we go about to discusse of Gods mistery (how,) then we fall from fayth, and waxe carnall men, and would haue

                  <p>HEre may euery man that readeth the words of Origen plainly see, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you seek in this waighty matter nothing by shifts and cauillatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For you haue nothing aunswered directly to Origen although he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writeth agaynst your doctrine. For you say that the eating of Chrstes flesh is taken in the proper signification without a fygure. Origen sayth there is a figure. And Origen sayth further, that it is onely a figuratiue spech, although not adding this word (onely) yet adding other words of the same effect. For he sayth, that we may not vnderstand the words as the letter soundeth. And sayth further, that if we vnderstand the words of Christ in this place, as the letter soundeth, the letter killeth. Now who knoweth not, that to say these words (not as the letter soundeth, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> letter killeth) be as much to say, as onely spiritually, and only otherwise then the letter soundeth? Wherfore you must spit vpon your hands, aud take better hold, or els you can not be able to plucke Origen so shortly from me. And I maruayle that you be not ashamed, thus to trifle with the auncient authors in so serious a matter, and such places, where the reader onely looking vpon the authors wordes, may see your dealing.</p>
                  <p>The next is Chrysostome, whom I cite thus.</p>

                  <p>And yet most planely of all other,<note place="margin">Augustine</note> S. Augustine dooth declare this matter

in his booke <hi>De doctrina christiana,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">de doctrina Christ. li. 3.</note> in which book he instructeth christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how they should vnderstand those places of Scripture, which seem hard and obscure.</p>
                  <p>Seldome (sayth he) is any difficulty in proper words, but either the circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance of the place, or the conferring of diuers translations, or els the originall toung wherin it was written, will make the sence playn. But in words that be altered from their proper signification, there is great diligence and hede to be taken. And <hi>specially we must beware, that we take not litterally any thing that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken figuratiuely.</hi> Nor contrary wise we must not take for a figure any thing, that is spoken properly. Therfore must be declared (sayth S. Augustine) the maner <hi>how to discerne a proper spech from a figuratiue.</hi> Wherin (sayth he) must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this rule, that if the thing which is spoken, be to the furtherance of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then it is a proper spech and no figure. So that if it be a commaundement, that forbiddeth any euill or wicked act, or commaundeth any good or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall thing, then it is no figure. But <hi>if it commaund any ill or wicked thing, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth any thing that is good and beneficiall, then it is a figuratiue spech.</hi> Now <hi>this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ: (Except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you) seemeth to commaund an haynons and wicked thing, therfore it is a figure,</hi> commaunding vs to be partakers of Christes passion, keeping in our mindes to our great comfort and profite, that his flesh was crucified and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for vs. This is briefly the sentence of S. Augustine in his booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the like he writeth in his book <hi>De catechisandis rudibus</hi>:<note place="margin">De catech. rudi. ca. 26.

                  <p>For if I should reherse all the authorityes of S. Augustine and other which make mention of this matter, it would weary the reader to much.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore to all them that by any reasonable meanes will be satisfied, these things before rehearsed are sufficient to proue that the eating of Christs flesh and drinking of his bloud, is not to be vnderstanded simply and playnly (as the words do properly signify) that we do eat and drinke him with our mouthes: but it is a figuratiue spech spiritually to be vnderstanded, that we must deeply print and fruitfully beleue in our harts, that his flesh was crucified, and his bloud shed for our redemption. And this our beliefe in him, is to eat his flesh and drink his bloud, although they be not present here with vs, but be asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded into heauen.

                     <note place="margin">Augustinus.</note>Sainct Augustine according to his rules of a figuratiue and proper spéech, taketh this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> spéech, Except ye eat &amp;c. for a figuratiue spéech, because it semeth to commaund in the letter carnally vnderstanded, an hainous and wicked thing to eat the flesh of a man, as mans carnal imagination conceiueth it: as appered by the Capharnaites, who murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at it. And therfore because onely faythful men can by fayth vnderstand this mistery of the eatyng of Christes flesh in the Sacrament, in which we eat not the carnall flesh of a common man as the letter soundeth, but the very spiritual flesh of Christ, God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as fayth teacheth: It is in that respect well noted for a figuratiue spéech, for that it hath such a sence in the letter as is hidden from the vnfaythfull. So as the same letter being to faythfull men spirite and life (who in humility of fayth vnderstandeth the same) is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to the faythfull a figure, as contayning such a mistery as by the outward barke of the


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7682:75"/>
letter they vnderstand not: vpon which consideration it semeth probable that the other fathers also signifiyng a great secrecie in this mistery of the Sacrament, wherein is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> worke of God ineffable, such, as the Ethnike eares could not abide, they termed it a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not therby to deminish the truth of the mistery, as the proper and special name of a figure doth: but by the name of a figure, reuerently to couer so great a secrecy, apt only to be vnderstanded of men beleuing: and therefore the sayd fathers in some part of theyr works, in playn words expresse and declare the truth of the mistery &amp; the plain doctrine therof according to the Catholick fayth, and in the other part passe it ouer with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of a figure, which consideration in S. Augustines writings may be euidently gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for in some place no man more playnly openeth the substance of the Sacrament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then he doth, speaking expressely of the very body and bloud of Christ contayned in it: &amp; yet therwith in other places noteth in those words a figure, not thereby to contrary his other playne sayings and doctrine, but meaning by the word figure, to signify a secret déep mistery hidden from carnall vnderstanding. For auoyding and expelling of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> carnallity, he geueth this doctrine here of this text: Except ye eat &amp;c. which (as I sayd before) in the bare litterall sence implyeth to carnal iudgement other carnall circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to attayne the same flesh to be eaten, which in that carnall sence can not be but by wickednes. But what is this to the obeying of Christes commaundement in the institu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of his supper, when he himself deliuereth his body and bloud in these misteryes, &amp; biddeth, Eat and drink? there can be no offence to do as Christ biddeth, and therefore S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Augustins rule pertaineth not to Christs supper, wherin when Christ willeth vs to vse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> our mouth, we ought to dare do as he biddeth for that is spirituall vnderstandyng,<note place="margin">Contrary.</note> to do as is commaunded without carnall thought or murmuring in our sensuall deuise how it can be so.

                  <p>IF thou takest not very good heed, reader, thou shalt not perceiue where the cuttill becometh. He wrappeth himself so about in darcknesse, and he commeth not neere the net by a myle, for feare he should be taken. But I will draw my net nearer to him, that he shall not escape. I say that the words which Christ spake of the eating of his flesh and drinking of his bloud were spoken by a figure, and he would auoyd the matter, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that those words haue a spirituall mistery in them, which is most true, and nothing contrary to my saying, but confirmeth the same. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of eating and drinking be figuratiue speches, because they haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a secret and hid spirituall mistery in them, and cannot be taken otherwise then in that spiritual mistery, which is a figure. And moreouer you plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly here confesse, that to eat Christes flesh and to drinke his bloud be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue speches. But you trauesse the cause wherfore they be figuratiue spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, which is not materiall in this place, where my processe is onely to proue, that they be figuratiue speches. Aud forasmuch as you grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t here all that I take vpon me to proue (which is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be figuratiue speches) what needeth all this superfluous multiplication of words, when we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the matter, which is here in question?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as for the cause of the figure, you declare it far otherwise, then S. Augustine dooth, as the words of S. Augustine do playnely shew to eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry indifferent reader. For the cause (say you) is this, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we eat not the carnal flesh of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man (as the letter soundeth) but the very spiritual flesh of Christ, God and man, and in that respect it is well noted for a figuratiue spech.</p>
                  <p>In which one sentence be three notable errors or vntruthes. The first is, that you say the letter soundeth than we eat the carnall flesh of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7682:76"/>
man: which your saying the playne words of the gospell do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly reproue. For Christ seperating himself in that spech from all other men, spake onely of himself, saying, My flesh is very meat,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> and my blood is very drink: He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. The second is, that you call the flesh of Christ a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flesh, as before you sayd that he is spiritually eaten. And so by your doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine his flesh is spirituall, and is spiritually eaten, and all is spirituall: which hath need of a fauorable interpretation, if it should be counted a sound and Catholick teaching. And if all be spirituall, &amp; done spiritually, what meaneth it then, that in other places you make so often mention, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is present and eaten carnally, corporally, and naturally?</p>
                  <p>The third is, that you say the spech of Christ is noted figuratiue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the eating of the flesh of a common man, which is vtterly vntrue. For the authors note not the figuratiue spech in that respect: but as christ spake of his owne flesh ioyned vnto his diuinity (wherby it geueth lyfe) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so do the authors note a figuratiue spech in respect of Christes owne flesh, and say therof, that the letter can not be true without a figure. For although Christ be both God and man, yet his flesh is a very mans flesh, and his bloud is truely mans blond (as is the flesh &amp; bloud of his blessed mother) and therfore can not be eaten and drunken properly, but by a figure. For he is not meat and drink of the body, to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corporally with mouth and teeth, and to be dygested in the stomack: but he is the meat of the soule, to be receaued spiritually in our harts &amp; minds, and to be chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and digested by fayth.</p>
                  <p>And it is vntrue that you here say, that the proper and speciall name of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a figure, diminisheth the truth of the mistery. For then Christ in vayne did ordayne the figures, if they diminish the misteries.</p>
                  <p>And the Authors terme it here a figure, not therby to couer the mistery but to open the mistery, which was in deed in Christs words by fygura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speches vnderstand. And with the figuratiue spech were the Ethnik and carnall eares offended, not with the mistery which they vnderstood not. And not to the Ethnik and carnall, but to the faythfull and spirituall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> eares, the wordes of Christ be figuratiue, and to them the truth of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures be playnely opened and declared by the Fathers: wherin the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be worthy much commendation, because they trauayled to open playnly vnto vs the obscure and figuratiue speches of Christ. And yet in their sayd declarations, they taught vs, that these words of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eating of his flesh and drinking of his bloud, are not to be vnderstanded plainly (as the words properly signify) but by a figuratiue speech.</p>
                  <p>Nor S. Augustine neuer wrote in all his long works as you do, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Christ is in the sacrament corporally, carnally, or naturally, or that he is so eaten, nor, I dare boldly say he neuer thought it. For if he had, he would not haue written so playnly (as he doth in the places by me alleadged) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we must beware, that we take not litterally, any thing that is spoken fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely. And specially he would not haue expressed by name y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of eating Christes flesh and drinking his bloud, and haue sayd, that they be figuratiue speches. But S. Augustine dooth not onely tell how we may not take those words, but also he declareth how we ought to take


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7682:76"/>
and vnderstand the eating of Christes flesh and drinking of his bloud, which (as he sayth) is this, To keep in our mindes to our great comfort &amp; profite, that Christ was crucified and shed his bloud for vs, and so to be partakers of his passion. This sayth S. Augustine is to eat his flesh and to drinke his bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And S. Augustine sayth not as you do, that Christes words be figura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue to the vnfaythfull, for they be figuratiue rather to the faythfull then to the vnfaythfull. For the vnfaythfull take them for no figure or mistery at all, but rather carnally, as the Caparnaites did. And there is in deede no mistery nor figure in eatyng with the mouth (as you say Christes flesh is eaten) but in eating with the soule &amp; spirite is the figure &amp; mistery. For the eating, and drinking with the mouth is all one to the faythful and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull, to the carnall and spirituall, &amp; both vnderstand in like, what is eating and drinking with the mouth. And therfore in no place do the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors declare, that there is a figure or mistery in eating &amp; drinkyng of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes body with our mouthes, or that there is any truth in that mistery, but they say cleane contrary, that he is not eaten and drunken with our mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. And if in any place any old author write, that there is a figure or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in eating and drinking of Christ with our mouthes, shew the place if you will haue any credite. S. Augustine specially (whom you do here alleadge for your purpose) sayth directly agaynst you, <hi>Nolite par are fauces sed cor,</hi> Prepare not your mouth or iawes, but your hart.<note place="margin">August de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis domini serm 33.</note> And in an other place he sayth, <hi>Quid paras ventrem &amp; dentem? Crede &amp; manducasti,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Io. tract. 25.</note> Why doost thou prepare thy belly and teeth? Beleue, and thou hast eaten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> But to auoyde the saying of Saynt Augustine by me alleadged, you say, that Saynt Augustines rule perteyneth not to Christes supper: which your sayeng is so strange, that you be the first that euer excluded the words of Christ from his Supper. And Saynt Augustine ment as well at the supper, as at all other tymes, that the eating of Christes flesh is not to be vnderstanded carnally with our teeth, (as the letter signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) but spiritually with our mindes, as he in the same place declareth. And how can it be that Saynt Augustins rule perteineth not to Christs supper, when by the rule he expoundeth Christes wordes in the sixt of Ihon, which you say Christ spake of his supper? Dyd Christ speak of his supper, and Saynt Augustines wordes expounding the same, perteyn not to the supper? You make Saynt Augustine an expositor lyke your selfe, that commonly vse to expounde both doctours and scripturs cleane from the purpose, eyther for that by lacke of exercise in the Scriptures and Doctours you vnderstand them not, or els that for very frowardnes you will not vnderstand any thing that misliketh you. And where you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> say, that we must do as Christ commaunded vs, without carnall thought or sensuall deuise, Is not this a carnall thought and sensuall deuise, which you teach, that we eat Christ corporally without teeth? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which you sayd before, that Christs body in the sacrament is a spirituall body, and eaten onely spiritually? Now how the teeth can eat a thing spiritually, I pray you tell me.</p>
                  <p>Now thou seest, good reader, what auayle all those gloses, of carnall flesh and spirituall flesh, of the flesh of Christ, and the flesh of a common man, of a figure to the vnfaythfull, and not to the faythfull, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tearmed it a figure, bycause els the Ethnike eares could not abyd


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7682:77"/>

And when none of these shiftes will serue, he runneth to his shotte anker, that Saynt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins rule perteineth nothing to Christes supper. Thus mayst thou se with what sinceritie he handleth the ould writers. And yet he myght right well haue spared all his long talke in this matter, seing that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth fully with me in the state of the whole cause, that to eat Christes flesh and to drincke his bloud, be figuratiue speaches.

                        <hi>Tertulianus.</hi> The author had left out (the same)</note>Tertullian speaking of the representation of Christes very body, in which place he termeth (the same body) speaketh catholiquely in such phrase as S. Hierom speaketh: and then Tertullian sayth afterward as this author therin truely bringeth hym forth that Christ made the bread his body, which bread was in the mouth of the prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a figure of his body. Wherfore it followeth by Tertullians confession whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ made the bread his body, that Christ ended the figure, and made it the trueth, making now his body that was before the figure of his body. For if Christ did no more but make it a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> figure still, then did he not make it his body, as Tertullian himselfe saith he did. And Tertullian therfore being red thus, as apeareth to me most probable, that <hi>(that is to say in Tertullian)</hi> should be onely referred to the explicacion of the first <hi>(this:)</hi> as when Tertullian had alleged Christes wordes saying <hi>(this is my body)</hi> and putteth to of his owne <hi>(that is to say the figure of my body,)</hi> these wordes <hi>(that is to say)</hi> should serue to declare the demonstration <hi>(this,)</hi> in this wise <hi>(that is to say, this)</hi> which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure of the body, is now my body. And so Tertulian sayd before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chryst had made bread his body, which bread was a figure of his body with the Prophet, and now endeth in the very trueth, being made his body by conuersion as (Cyprian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> sheweth) of the nature of bread into his body. Tertullian reasoned against the Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onistes: and because a figure in the prophet signifieth a certayn vnfayned truth of that is signified, seing Christes body was figured by bread in the prophet Hieremy, it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Christ had a true body. And that the bread was of Christ aproued for a figure he made now his very body. And this may be sayd euidently to Tertullian, who reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning agaynst heretikes vseth the commoditie of arguing, and giueth no doctrine of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the sacrament to further this authors purpose. And what aduantage should the here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiques haue of Tertulian if he should meane, that these words, This is my body, had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> onely this sence, this is the figure of my body, hauing himselfe sayd before, that Christ made bread his body. If so playne speach, to make bread his body, conteyneth no more

certayntie in vnderstanding but the figure of a body? Why should not they say, that a body in Christ should euer be spoken of a body in a figure, and so no certayntie of any trew body in Christ by Tertullianes wordes? This place of Tertullian is no secret poynt of learning, and hath bene of Decolampadius and other alleadged and by ether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Catholique men aunswered vnto it, wherof this author may not think now as vpon a wrangling argument, to satisfie a coniecture deuised, therby to confirme a new teaching. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Finally Tertullian termeth it not an onely figure, which this author must proue, or els he doth nothing.</p>

                  <p>ON what a wrangling and wrasting is here made? What crookes be cast?<note place="margin">Tertullian saith not, an only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</note> what leaping about is here, to auoyde a foyle? And yet I refer to any indifferent man that shall reade the place of Tertullain, to iudge whether you haue truely expounded him, or in the wrastling with him be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> quite ouerthrowen, and haue a flat fall vpon your backe. For Tertullian sayth not, that the bread was a figure of Christs body only in the prophet. (as you expound Tertullian) but sayth, that bred and wine were figures in the old testament, and so taken in the prophets, and now be figures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new testament, &amp; so vsed of Christ himself in his last supper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where Tertullian sayth, that Christ made bread his body, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth him self how Christ made bread his body, adding by and by these wordes, That is to say, a figure of his body. But if thou caust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear good reader (when thou readest the fond handling of Tertullian by this ignorant and subtill lawyer) I pray thee laugh not, for it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be laughed at, but to be sorowed, that the most auncient authors of Christes church should thus be eluded in so weighty causes. O Lord, what shall these men answer to thee at the last day, whan no cauilations shall haue place? These be Tertullians words. <hi>Iesus taking bread, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his disciples, made it his body, saying: This is my body, that is to say a figure of my body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heare Tertullian expoundeth not the saying of the Prophet, but the saying of Christ, this is my body. And where Tertullian hath but once the word (This) you say (the first this). And so you make a wise speach to say (the first,) where is but one. And Tertullian speaketh of (this) in Christes wordes, when he sayd, This is my body, and you referre them to the Prophets wordes, which be not there, but the spoken of long after. And if you had not forgotten your gramer, and all kind of speach, or els hurled away altogether purposely to serue your owne wilfull deuise, you would haue referred the demonstration of his antecedent before, and not to a thing that in order commeth long after. And bread in the prophet was but a figuratiue speach, but in Christes wordes was not onely a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue speach, but also a figuratiue thing, that is to say, very materiall bread, which by a figuratiue speach Christ ordeyned to be a figure and a sacrament of his body. For as the Prophet by this word (bread) figured Christes body so did Christ himsef institute very materiall bread, to be a figure of his body in the sacrament. But you referre (this) to the bread in the Prophet, which Christ spake (as Tertullian sayth) of the bread in the gospell. And Christes wordes must needes be vnderstanded of the bread which he gaue to his Apostles, in the time of the gospell after he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the supper of the law. And if Christ made the bread in the prophet his


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7682:78"/>
very body, which was no materiall bread, but this word, (bread) then did Christ make this word bread his body, and conuerted this word bread in to the substaunce of his body. This is the conclusion of your subtell so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistication of Tertullians wordes.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning Saynt Ciprian (whome you here alledge) he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> spake of a sacramentall and not of a corporall and carnall conuersion, as shall be playnly declared, when I come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of Ciprian, and partely I haue declared alredy in myne other booke.</p>
                  <p>And Tertullian proued not in that place the veritie of Christes body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by the figure of the Prophet: but by the figure which Christ ordeyned of his body in his last supper. For he went not about to proue that Christ should haue a body, but that he had then a true body, because he ordeined a figure therof, which could haue had no figure (as Tertullian sayth) if it had ben but a phantasticall body, and no true body in deed.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore this which you say in aunswering to the playn wordes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Tertullian, may be sayd of them that care not what they say, but it can not be sayd euidently, that is spoken so sophistically.</p>
                  <p>But if so playne speech of Tertullian (say you) that Christ made bread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> his body, conteyne no more certayntie in vnderstanding but the figure of a body, why should not the body of Christ euer be taken for a figure? and so no certayntie of any true body to be in Christ? This reason had been more fitte to be made by a man that had lost both his witte and reason. For in this place Tertullian must needes be so vnderstand that by the body of Christ is vnderstand the figure of his body, because Tertullian so expoundeth it him selfe. And must it be always so, bicause it is here so? Must euer Christes body be taken for a figure, bicause it is here taken for a figure, as Tertullian sayth? Haue you so forgotten your Logike, that you will make a good argument, <hi>à particulari ad vniuersale?</hi> By your owne manner of argumentation, bicause you make a naughty argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t here in this place, shall I conclude that you neuer make none good? Surely this place of Tertullian (as you haue handled it) is neither secret nor manifest poynt, eyther of learning, witte, or reason, but a meere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistication, if it be no worse.</p>
                  <p>What other papistes haue aunswered to this place of Tertullian, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> am not ignoraunt, nor I am sure you be not so ignoraunt, but you know, that neuer none aunswered as you do. But your answer varieth as much from all other papists, as yours &amp; theyrs also do varie from the truth.</p>
                  <p>Here the reader may note by the way, how many fowle shiftes you make to auoyd the saying of Tertullian. First you say, that bread was a figure in the prophets mouth, but not in Christes wordes. Second, that the thing which the prophet spake of, was not that which Christ spake of. Third, that other haue aunswered this place of Tertullian before. Forth, that you call this matter but a wrangling argument. Fift, that if Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian call bread a figure, yet he termeth it not, onely figure. These be your shiftes. Now let the reader looke vpon Tertullians playn wordes, whyche I haue rehearsed in my booke, and then let him iudge, whether you meane to declare Tertullians mynd truely or no.</p>
                  <p>And it is not requiset for my purpose, to proue that bread is onely a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> for I take vpon me there to proue no more, but that the bread is a


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7682:78"/>
figure representing Christes body, and the wine his bloud. And if breade be a figure, and not onely a figure, than must you make bread, both the figure, and the truth of the figure.</p>
                  <p>Now heare what other authors I do here alleadge.</p>
                  <p>And saynt Ciprian the holy marter sayth of this matter,<note place="margin">Ciprianus. lib. 2. Epistola. 3.</note> that Christs bloud <hi>is shewed</hi> in the wine, and the people in the water, that is mixt with the wine: so that <hi>the mixture of the water to the wine, signifieth the spirituall commixtion and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of vs vnto Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which similitude Ciprian ment not, that the bloud of Christ is wine, or the people water, but as the water doeth signifie and represent the people, so doeth the wine signify and represent Christs bloud: and the vniting of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and wine together, signifieth the vniting of Christian people vnto Christ himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And the same saynt Ciprian in an other place, writing here of sayth,<note place="margin">De vnction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the manner he straight wayes declareth thus, that those things which do signifye, and those thinges which be signified by them, may be both called by one name.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it is certain, by saynt Ciprians mind, wherfore and in what wise bread is called Christes flesh, and wine his bloud, that is to say, because that euery thing that representeth and signifieth an other thing, may be called by the name of thing which it signifieth.</p>
                  <p>And therfore Saynt Iohn Chrisostom sayth that <q>Christ ordayned the table of his holy supper for this purpose,<note place="margin">Chris in.

                  </p>
                  <p>Saynt Hierom likewise sayth vpon the gospell of Mathew,<note place="margin">Iero. in Mat. 26.</note> 
                     <q>that Christ took bread, which comforteth mans hart, that he mght represent thereby his very body and bloud.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also Saynt Ambrose (if the booke be his that is intituled <hi>De his qui misterijs initianter)</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Ambros de his qui misterijs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiantur. cap. vlt.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And in his booke <hi>De sacramentis</hi> (if that be also his) he writeth thus.<note place="margin">De sacramentis lib. 6. cap. 3.</note>

                  <p>And receiuing the bread, in that foode thou art partaker of his godly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce.

                  </p>
                  <p>And vpon the epistle of Saynt Paule to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> he sayth <q>that in eating and drinking the bread and wine, we doe signifie the flesh and bloud, which were offered for vs. And the olde tastament (he sayeth) was instituted in bloud because that bloud was a witnes of gods benefite, <hi>in signification and

And so it is called that day, which is not that day in dede, but by the course of the yeare it is a like day. And such thinges be sayd to be done that day, for the solemne celebration of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which thinges indede were not done that day, but long before. Was Christ offered any more but once? And he offered him selfe, and yet in a sacrament or representation, not onely euery solemne feast of Easter, but euery day he is offered to the people, so that he doth not lye, that sayth, He is euery day offered. For if sacramentes had no some similitude or likenes of those thinges, whereof they be Sacramentes, they could in no wise be sacramentes. And for their similitude and likenes, commonly they haue the name of the thinges, wherof they be sacramentes. Therfore as <hi>after a certayne maner of speach, the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christes body, is Christs body: the sacrament of Christes bloud, is Christes bloud:</hi> so likewise the sacrament of fayth, is fayth. And to beleue is nothing els, but to haue fayth, And therfore when we answer for yong children in their baptisme, that they beleue, which haue not yet the minde to beleue, we answer that they haue fayth, bicause they haue the sacrament of fayth. And we say also that they tourne vnto God, because of the sacrament of conuersion vnto God, for that answer pertayneth to the celebration of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And likewise speaketh the Apostle of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, saying: that by Baptisme we be buryed with him into death: <hi>he sayth not that we signifie buriall, but he sayth playnly, that we be buried.</hi> So that the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of so great a thing, is not called but by the name of the thing it selfe. </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I haue rehersed the answer of S. Augustine vnto Boniface a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bishop, who asked of him, how the parentes and frendes could answer for a yong babe in baptisme, and say in his person that he beleueth &amp; conuerteth vnto God, when the child can neither do, nor think any such thinges.</p>
                  <p>Wherunto the answer of S. Augustine is this: that for as much as baptisme is the sacrament of the profession of our fayth, and of our conuersion vnto God, it becometh vs so to answer for yong children comming therunto, as to the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t apertayneth, although the children indeed haue no knowledge of such thinges.</p>
                  <p>And yet in our sayd answers we ought not to be reprehended as vayn men or lyers, forasmuch as in common speach we vse dayly to call sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and figures by the names of the thinges that be signified by them, although they be not the same thing indede. As euery Goodfriday (as often as it returneth from yeare to yeare) we call it the day of Christes passion: and euery Easter


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7682:80"/>
day, we call the day of his resurrection: and euery day in the yeare, we say that Christ is offered: and the sacrament of his body, we call it his body: and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his bloud, we call it his bloud: and our baptisme S. Paul calleth our buriall with Christ. And yet in very dede Christ neuer suffered but once, neuer arose but once, neuer was offered but once, nor in very dede in baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we be not buried, nor the sacrament of Christes body is not his body, nor the sacrament of his bloud is not his bloud. But so they be called, bicause they be figures, sacramentes, and representations of the thinges them selfe which they signifie, and whereof they beare the names. Thus doth saynt Augustine most playnly open this matter in his epistle to Bonifacius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Of this maner of speach (wherin a signe is called by the name of the thing, which it signifieth) speaketh S. Augustine also right largely in his questions <hi>super Leuiticum,</hi>

And <hi>contra Adamantium</hi> he writeth much like,<note place="margin">Contra adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium cap. 12.</note> saying: In such wise is bloud the soule, as <hi>the stone was Christ,</hi> and yet <hi>the Apostle sayth not, that the stone signified Christ, but sayth it was Christ.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Leuit. 17.</note> And this sentence, <hi>Bloud is the soule,</hi> may be vnderstand to be spoken in a signe or figure, for <hi>Christ did not stick to say, this is my body, when he gaue the signe of his body.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here .S Augustine rehearsing diuers sentences, which were spoken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, that is to say, when one thing was called by the name of an other, and yet was not the other in substance, but in signification: As the bloud is the soule: vij. kyne be vij. yeares: vij. eares be vij. yeares, the stone was Christ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such maner of speaches, he reherseth those wordes which Christ spake at his last supper, this is my body.<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> Which declareth playnly Saynt Augustines mind, that Christ spake those wordes figuratiuely, not meaning that the bread was his body by substance, but by signification.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Contra Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. li. 3. cap. 22</note>And therfore S. Augustine sayth <hi>contra Maximinum,</hi> that in the sacramentes we must not consider what they be, but what they signifie. for they be signes of thinges, being one thing and signifiyng another.
Which he doeth shew specially of this sacrament, saying,<q> 
                        <hi>the heauenly bread which is Christes flesh, by some maner of speach is called Christes body,</hi>

Domini, idem passim scribit.</hi> These wordes of Bucer may be thus englished.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And I neuer sayd, that Christ is vtterly absent, but I euer affirmed,<note place="margin">The trew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense of Christ.</note> that he is truly and spiritually present, and truly and spiritually exhibited vnto the godly receiuours: but corporally is he neither in the receiuors, nor in or vnder the fourmes of bread or wine, as you do teach, clearly with out the consent of master Bucer, who writeth no such thing.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And where I alleadge of Saynt Augustine, that the sacrament of Christes body is called Christes body, after a certayn maner of speach, and you deny that saynt Augustine ment of a certayne maner of speach, but sayth onely, after a certayne maner: Read the place of saynt Augustin who will, and he shall find, that he speaketh of the maner of speach, and that of such a maner of speach, as calleth one thing by the name of an other, where it is not the very thing in dede. For of the maner of speach is all the processe there, as apeareth by these his wordes: a day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Friday, we vse in common speach to say: to morowe, or this day two dayes, Christ suffered. &amp;c. Likewise vppon Easter day we say: this day Christ rose. And why do no men reproue vs as lyars, whan we speake in this sort? And we call those dayes so by a similitude. &amp;c. And so it is called that day which is not that day in dede. And sacramentes commonly haue the name of the thinges wherof they be sacramentes. Therfore as after a certayne manner the sacrament of Christes body, is Christes body: so likewise the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of fayth is fayth. And likewise sayth Saynt Paule, that in baptisme we be buried, he sayth not, that we signifie buriall, but he sayth playnly, that we be buried: So that the


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7682:81"/>
sacrament of so great a thing, is called by the name of the thing. All these be S. Augustines wordes, shewing how in the common vse of speach, one thing may haue the name of another. Wherfore when Doctor Gardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner sayth, that S. Augustine spake not of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner of speach, thou mayst beleue him hereafter as thou shalt see cause, but if thou trust his wordes to much, thou shalt soone be deceiued.</p>
                  <p>As for the reall presence of Christ in the sacrament, I graunt that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is really present,<note place="margin">Really.</note> after such sort as you expound really in this place, that is to say, indede, and yet but spiritually. For you say your selfe, that he is but after a spirituall maner there, and so is he spiritually honored, as S Augustine sayth.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning heat of disputation, marke well the wordes of S. Augustine, good reader, cited in my booke, and thou shalt see clerely, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all this multiplication of wordes is rather a iugling, then a direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. For saynt Augustine writeth not in heate of disputation, but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly and grauely, to a learned Bishop his deare frend, who demanded a question of him. And if Saynt Augustine had aunswered in heate of disputation, or for any other respect, otherwise then the truth, he had not done the part of a friend, nor of a learned and godly Bishop. And who so euer iudgeth so of Saynt Augustine, hath small estimation of him, and sheweth him selfe to haue litle knowledge of Saynt Augustine.</p>
                  <p>But in this your answer to saynt Augustine, you vtter where you learned a good part of your diuinitie, that is, of Albertus Pighius,<note place="margin">Albertus Pighi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> who is the father of this shift, and with this fleight eludeth Saynt Augustin when he could no otherwise answer. As you do now shake of the same Saynt Augustine, resembling as it were in that poynt the liuely coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your father Pighius. Next in my booke foloweth Theodoret</p>
                  <p>And to this purpose it is both pleasaunt, comfortable, and profitable to read Theodoretus in his Dialogs,<note place="margin">Theodoretus in dialogis.</note> where he disputeth and sheweth at length, how the names of things be chaunged in scripture, and yet thinges remayne still. And for example he proueth that the flesh of Christ is in the scripture some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time called a vayle or coueryng, sometime a cloth, sometyme a vestment, and sometyme a stole: &amp; the bloud of the grape is called Christes bloud, and the names of bread and wine, and of his flesh and bloud, Christ doth so chaunge, that sometyme he calleth his body, corne or bread, and sometime contrary, he calleth bread his body. And likewise his bloud sometime he calleth wine, and sometime contrary he calleth wine his bloud.</p>
                  <p>For the more playne vnderstanding wherof, it shall not be amisse to recite his owne sayings in his foresayd dialogs, touching this matter of the holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Christes flesh and bloud.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their images to the paterne, and thou shalt see them like. For figure must be like to the thing it selfe. For <hi>Christes body hath his former fashion, figure, and bignesse,</hi> and to speake at one word, the same substance of his body: but after his resurrection, it was made immortall, and of such power, that no cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption nor death could come vnto it: and it was exalted vnto that dignity, that it was sette at the right hand of the father, and honoured of all creatures, as the body of him that is the Lord of nature.</p>

                     <speaker>Eran.</speaker>
                     <p>But <hi>the sacramentall token chaungeth his former name,</hi> for it is no more called as it was before, but <hi>is called Christes body.</hi> Therfore must his body after his ascention be called God, and not a body.</p>

                     <speaker>Orth.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou semest to me ignorant: for <hi>it is not called his body onely but also the bread of lyfe,</hi> as the Lord called it. So the body of Christ we call a godly body, a body that giueth life, Gods body, the Lordes body, our masters body, name ning that it is not a common body, as other mennes bodies be, but that it is the body of our Lord Iesu Christ, both God and man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>This haue I rehersed of the great clerke and holy byshop Theodoretus, whom some of the Papists perceiuing to make so playnly agaynst them, haue defamed, saying that he was infected with the errour of Nestorius.</p>
                  <p>Here the Papistes shewe their old accustomed nature and condition which is euen in a manifest matter, rather to lie without shame, than to giue place vnto the truth, and confesse their owne errour. And although his aduersaries falsely bruted such a fame agaynst him, whan he was yet a liue, neuerthelesse he was purged therof by the whole Councell of Calcedon, about a leuen hundred yeares agoe.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore in his booke which he wrote agaynst heresies, he speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally condemneth Nestorius by name. And also all his iij. bookes of his dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues before rehersed, he wrot chiefly agaynst Nestorius, and was neuer here in noted of error this thousand yeare, but hath euer bene reputed and taken for an holy Byshop, a great learned man, and a graue author, vntill now at this present tyme, whan the Papistes haue nothing to answer vnto him, they begin in excusing of them selues, to defame him.</p>
                  <p>Thus much haue I spoken for Theodoretus, which I pray thee be not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to read (good reader) but often and with delectation, deliberation, and good aduertisement to read. For it conteineth playnly and breefly the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of a Christian man, concerning the matter, which in this booke we treate vpon.</p>
                  <p>First, that our sauiour Christ in his last supper, whan he gaue bread and wine to his apostles (saying: This is my body, This is my bloud) it was bread which he called his body and wine mixed in the cup which he called his bloud: so that he changed the names of the bread and wine (which were the misteries, sacramentes, fignes, figures, and tokens of Christes flesh and bloud,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7682:83"/>
and called them by the names of the thinges, which they did represent and signifie, that is to say, the bread he called by the name of his very flesh, and the wine by the name of his bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second, that although the names of bread and wine were changed after sanctification, yet neuertheles the thinges them selues remayned the selfe same, that they were before the sanctification, that is to say, the same bread and wine in nature, substance, form, and fashion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The thyrd, seing that the substance of the bread and wine be not changed, why be then their names changed, and the bread called Christes flesh, and the wine his bloud? Theodoretus sheweth, that the cause therof was this, that we should not haue so much respect to the bread and wyne (which we see with our eyes, and tast with our mouthes) as we should haue to Christ him selfe, in whome we beleue with our hartes, and fele and tast him by our faith, and with whose flesh and bloud (by his grace) we beleue that we be spiritually fedde and norished.</p>
                  <p>These thinges we ought to remember the reuolue in our myndes, and to lift vp our hartes from the bread and wine vnto Christ that sitteth aboue. And bicause we should so do, therfore after the consecration they be no more cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bread and wine, but the body and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The forth, It is in these sacramentes of bread and wine, as it is in the very body of Christ. For as the body of Christ before his resurrection and after is al one in nature, substance, bignes, forme and fashion, and yet it is not called as an other common body, but with addition, for the dignitie of his exaltation, it is called a heauenly, a godly, an immortall, and the lordes body: so likewise the bread and wine before the consecration and after, is all one in nature, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, bignes, form, and fashion, and yet it is not called as other common bread, but for the dignitie, wherunto it is taken, it is called with addition, Heauenly bread, The bread of life, and the bread of thankes giueng.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fift, that no man ought to be so arrogant and presumptuous to affirme for a certayne truth in religion any thing, which is not spoken of in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this is spoken to the great and vtter condemnation of the Papistes, which make and vnmake newe articles of our fayth from tyme to tyme, at their pleasure, without any scripture at all, yea quite and clean contrary to scripture. And yet wyll they haue all men bound to beleue what soeuer they inuent, vpon perill of damnation and euerlasting fyre.</p>
                  <p>And yet wil they constrayne with fyre and fagot all men to consent (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the manifest wordes of God) to these their errours in this matter of the holy sacrament of Christes body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>First that there remayneth no bread nor wine after the consecration, but that Christes flesh and bloud is made of them.</p>
                  <p>Second, that Christes body is really, corporally, substantially, sensibly, and naturally in the bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that wicked persons do eat and drincke Christes very body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that priestes offer Christ euery day, and make of him a new sacrifice propiciatory for sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thus for shortnes of tyme I doe make an end of Theodoretus, with other old auncient writers, which do most clearly affirme, that to eat Christes body and to drink his bloud, be figuratiue speaches. And so be these sentenses like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

Lo thou art new caught in the same nette which thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sette to catche me in. For those same misticall signes do not depart away out of their owne proper nature after the hallowing of them. For they remayne still in their former substance, and their former shape, and their former kind, and are euen as well seene and felte, as they were afore. But the thinges that are done, are vnderstanded, and are beleued, and are worshiped, euen as though they were in very deede the thinges that are beleued. This is the common translation into English of Peter Marters booke translated, which this author doth translate after his fashion, thus. Thou art taken with thine owne nette,, for the sacramentall signes go not from their owne nature after the sanctification, but continue in their former substance, forme and figure, and be seen, and touched as well as before. Yet in our mindes we do consider what they be made, and do repute and esteme them, and haue them in reuerence according to the same thinges, that they be taken for. Thus is the translation of this author. Myne English of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is thus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art taken with the same nettes thou diddest lay forth.
<q>For the misticall tokens after the sanctification go not away, out of their proper nature. For they abide in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> former substance, shape and forme and so far forth, that they may be seene and felt as they might before.</q>
But they be vnderstanded that they be made, and are beleued, and are worshiped, as being the same thinges, which he beleued. This is my translation, who in the first sentence meane not to vary from the other translations touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne of substance, shape, forme, or figure, I will vse all these names. But in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond parte where Theodoret speaketh of our beleefe what the tokens be made, and where he sayth those tokens be worshiped, as being the same thinges, which he beleued, thou mayst see reader how this author flieth the wordes (<hi>beleue</hi>) and (<hi>worship</hi>) which the common translation in english doth playnly and truly expresse, how soeuer the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator swarued by colour of the word (<hi>tanquam</hi>) which there, after the greeke, signifieth the truth and not the similitude onely: like as saynt Paule (<hi>Vocat ea quae non sunt, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sint</hi>) which is to make to be indeed, not as though they were. And the greeke is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And it were an absurditie, to beleue thinges other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they be, as though they were, and very Idolatrie to worship wittingly that is not, as though it were in dede. And therfore in these two words that they beleued, that they be made and be worshiped, is declared by Theodoret, his fayth of the very true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence of Christs glorious flesh, wherunto the Deitie is vnited. Which fleshe, S. Augustine, consonantly to this Theodoret, sayd must be worshiped before it be receiued. The word worshiping put here in english is to expresse the word (<hi>Adorantur</hi>) put by Peter in latine, signifieng adoring, being the verbe in Greke of such signification, as is vsed to expresse godly worship with bowing of the knée. Now reader, what should I say by this author, that conueieth these two wordes, of beleuing, and worshiping, and in stede of them, cometh in with reuerence, taking, reputing, and esteming, wherof


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7682:84"/>
thou mayst esteme how this place of Theodoret pinched this author, who could not but see that adoring of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t signifieth the presence of the body of Christ to be adored, which els were an absurditie: and therfore the author toke payne to ease it with other wordes of calling, beleuing, reputing, and esteming, and for adoration, reuerence. Consider what prayse this author geueth Theodoret, which prayse condemneth this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor sore. For Theodoret in his doctrine would haue vs beleue the mistery,<note place="margin">Adoration of the sacrament.</note> and adore the sacrament, where this author after in his doctrine professeth there is nothing to be worshiped at all. If one should now say to me, Yea syr, but this Theodoret semeth to condemne transubstantiation, bicause he speaketh so of the bread. Therunto shall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered when I speake of transubstantiation, which shallbe after the iij. and iiij. booke discussed. For before the truth of the presence of the substance of Christes body may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, what should we talke of transubstantiation? I will trauayle no more in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, but leaue it to thy iudgment reader, what credite this author ought to haue that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> handleth the mater after this sorte.</p>

He serueth vnder a signe (sayth August<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine) who worketh or worshipeth any signe, not knowing what it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. But he that worketh or worshipeth a profitable signe ordayned of God, the strength and signification wherof he vnderstandeth, he worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not that which is seene and is transitory, but rather that thing,


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7682:84"/>
wherto all such signes ought to be referred.
And anon after he sayth further. <q>At this tyme when our Lord Iesus Christ is risen, we haue a most manifest argument of our fredome, and be not burdeined with the heauy yoke of signes, which we vnderstand not: but the Lord and the teaching of his Apostles hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs a few signes for many, and those most ease to be done, most exellent in vnderstanding, and in performing most pure: as the sacrament of baptisme, and the celebration of the body and bloud of our Lord: which euery man when he receiueth, knoweth wherunto they be referred, being taught, that he worship not them with a carnall bondage, but rather with a spirituall fredom. And as it is a vile bondage to follow the letter, and to take the signes for the thinges signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them: so to interpret the signes to no profit, is an errour that shewdly spreadeth abroad.</q> These wordes of Saynt Augustine being conferred with the wordes of Theodoret, may declare playnly what Theodoretes meaning was. For where he sayth that we may not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with a carnall bondage the visible signes, (meaning of water in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and of bread and wine in the holy communion) when we receaue the same, but rather ought to worship the thinges wherunto they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, he ment that although those signes or sacraments, of water, bread and wine ought highly to be estemed, and not to be taken as other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water, bakers bread, or wine in the tauern, but as signes dedicated, consecrated, and referred to an holy vse: and by those erthly thinges to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present thinges celestiall, yet the very true honor and worship, ought to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> celestial things, which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> visible signes be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; not to the visible signes themselues. And neuertheles both S. Augustine and Theodoret count it a certayn kind of worshiping the signes, the reuerent esteming of them aboue other common &amp; prophane things, &amp; yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same principally to be referred to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> celestial thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs represented by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signs: and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore sayeth S. Augustin (<hi>potius</hi>) rathar. And this worship is as wel in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of baptisme, as in the sacrament of Christs body and bloud. And therfore although whosoeuer is baptised vnto Christ, or eateth his flesh, &amp; drinketh his bloud in his holy supper do first honor him, yet is he corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and carnally neither in the supper, nor in baptisme, but spiritually and effectually.</p>

                  <p>After the same sort the mistery of our redemption, and the passion of our sauiour Christ vpon the crosse, as well in the new, as in the ould testament, is expressed and declared by many figures and figuratiue speaches.</p>

                  <p>And as almightie God passing through Egypt killed all the Egiptians heires in euery house and left not one aliue, and neuerthelesse he passed by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israels houses, where he sawe the Lambes bloud vpon the dores, and hurted none of them, but saued them all by the meanes of the Lambes bloud: so likewise at the last iudgement of the whole world, none shall be passed ouer and saued, but that shall be found marked with the bloud of the most pure and immaculat lambe Iesus Christ. And for as much as the shedding of that lambes bloud was a token and figure of the shedding of Christes bloud than to come:<note place="margin">The Lords supper.</note> and for as much also as all the sacramentes and figures of the olde testament, ceased and had an end in Christ: least by our great vnkindnes we should peraduenture be forgetfull of the great benefite of Christ, therfore at his last supper (when he toke his leaue of his Apostles to depart out of the


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7682:85"/>
world) he did make a new will and testament, wherin he bequethed vnto vs cleane remission of all our sinnes, and the euerlasting inheritaunce of heauen. And the same he confirmed the next day with his owne bloud and death.</p>
                  <p>And least we should forget the same, he ordayned not a yearly memory (as the Pascall lambe was eaten but once euery year) but a dayly remembrance he ordeined therof in bread and wine, sanctified and dedicated to that purpose saying: This is my body, This cuppe is my bloud, which is shed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes: Do this in remembrance of me.<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> Admonishing vs by these wordes, spoken at the making of his last will and testament, and at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the world (bicause they should be the better remembred) that whensoeuer we do eat the bread in his holy supper; and drinke of that cuppe, we should remember how much Christ hath done for vs, and how he dyed for our sakes. Therfore sayth S. Paule: As often as ye shall eat this bread,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11</note> and drinke the cuppe, you shall shewe forth the Lordes death vntill he come.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as this holy bread broken, and the wine deuided, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto vs the death of Christ now passed as the killing of the Pascall Lambe did represent the same yet to come: therfore our sauiour Christ vsed the same manner of speach of bread and wine, as God before vsed the Paschall Lambe.</p>
                  <p>For as in the old testament God sayd: this is the Lordes passeby, or passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:<note place="margin">Exod. 12. Math. 26.</note> euen so sayth Christ in the new Testament, This is my body, This is my bloud. But in the old mistery and sacrament, the Lambe was not the Lordes very Passeouer or passing by, but it was a figure which represented his passing by: So likewise in the new Testament the bread and wine be not Christes very body and bloud, but they be figures, which by Christes institution be vnto the godly receauers therof, Sacramentes, tokens, significations, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his very flesh and bloud: instructing their fayth, that as the bread and wine fede them corporally, and continue this temporall lyfe, so the very flesh and bloud of Christ feedeth them spiritually, and giueth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting lyfe.</p>
                  <p>And why should any man think it strange to admit a figure in these speches,<note place="margin">What figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speaches were vsed at Christes last supper. Math 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.</note> This is my body, This is my bloud, seing that the communication the same night, by the Papistes owne confessions, was so full of figuratiue speaches. For the Apostles spake figuratiuely when they asked Christ, where he would eat his passeouer or passeby. And Christ him selfe vsed the same figure, when he sayd: I haue much desired to eate this passeouer with you.</p>
                  <p>Also, to eat Christes body and to drink his bloud, I am sure they will not say that it is taken properly, to eate and drink, as we doe eate other meates and drinkes.</p>
                  <p>And when Christ sayd: This cup is a new testament in my bloud: here in one sentence be two figures: one in this word, cup, which is not taken for the cup it selfe, but for the thing conteined in the cup: an other is in this word, testament: for neither the cup, nor the wine contayned in the cup, is Christes testament, but is a token, signe, and figure, wherby is represented vnto vs his testament, confirmed by his bloud.</p>
                  <p>And if the Papistes will say (as they say in deed) that by this cup is neither me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the cup, nor the wine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in the cup, but that thereby is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christs bloud contayned in the cup, yet must they nedes graunt, that there is a figure. For Christes bloud is not in proper speach the new testament, but it is the


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7682:86"/>
thing that confirmed the new Testament. And yet by this strange interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Papistes make a very strange speach, more strange then any figuratiue speach is. For this they make the sentence: this bloud is a new Testament in my bloud. Which saying is so fond and so far from all reason, that the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof is euident to euery man.</p>

And S. Augustine giueth a playne rule, how we may know when Gods comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be giuen in figuratiue speches, &amp; yet shal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth be subuerted, nor our religion reduced to significations. And how can it be but that in the vnderstanding of Gods ordinances &amp; commaundements, figures must needes be often receaued (contrary to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Melancthons saying) if it be true that you say, that there is no spech so playne and simple, but it hath some peece of a figuratiue speech. But now be all speches figuratiue, when it pleaseth you. What need I then to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile any more to proue that Christ in his supper vsed figuratiue speches, seyng that all that he spake was spoken in figures by your saying?</p>
                  <p>And these wordes (This is my body) spoken of the bread, and (This is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> my bloud) spoken of the cuppe, expresse no playne comon vnderstanding, wherby the common vse of these figures should be equall with plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per speches, or cause them to be taken as common proper speches: for you say your felf, that these speches in letter haue an absurdity in reason. And as they haue absurdity in reason, so haue they absurdity in fayth. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any reason, fayth, myracle, nor truth, to say that materiall bread is Christes body. For then it must be true that his body is material


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7682:86"/>
bread, a <hi>conuersa ad conuertentem,</hi> for of the materiall bread, spake Christ, those words by your confession. And why haue not these words of Christ (This is my body) an absurdity both in fayth and reason, aswell as these words, (This cup is the new Testament) seyng that these wordes were spoken by Christ, as well as the other, and the credite of him is all one whatsoeuer he sayth?</p>
                  <p>But if you will needes vnderstand these wordes of Christ (This is my body) as the playn wordes signify in their proper sence (as in the end you seeme to do, repugning therein to your owne former saying) you shall see how farre you go, not onely from reason, but also from the true profession of the christian fayth.</p>
                  <p>Christ spake of bread (say you) This is my body: appoynting by this word (this) the bread: whereof followeth (as I sayd before) If bread be his body, that his body is bread: And if his body be bread, it is a creature without sence and reason, hauing neither life nor soule: which is horrible of any christian man to be heard or spoken. Heare now what followeth further in my booke.</p>
                  <p>Now forasmuch as it is playnly declared &amp; manifestly proued, that Christ called bread his body, and wine his bloud, and that these sentences be figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speches, and that Christ, as concerning his humanity &amp; bodily presence, is ascended into heauen with his whole flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">Cap. 15. <hi>Answere to the authorities and arguments of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists.</hi>
                     </note> and is not here vpon earth, and that the substance of bread and wine do remayne still, and be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the sacrament, and that although they remayne, yet they haue changed their names, so that the bread is called Christs body, and the wine his bloud, and that the cause why their names be changed is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should list vp our harts &amp; minds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the things which we se vnto the things which we beleue &amp; be aboue in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine haue the names, although they be not the vey same things in deed: these things well considered and wayed, all the authorities and arguments, which the Papists fayn to serue for their pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose, be clean wiped away.</p>
                  <p>For whether the authors (which they alleadge) say that we do eat Christes flesh and drink his bloud,<note place="margin">Cap. 14. One brief an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to all.</note> or that the bread and wine is conuerted into the sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance of his flesh and bloud, or that we be turned into his flesh, or that in the Lordes supper we do receiue his very flesh and bloud, or that in the bread and wine is receiued that which did hang vpon the crosse, or that Christ hath left his flesh with vs, or that Christ is in vs and we in him, or that he is whole here and whole in heauen, or that the same thing is in the Chalice, which flowed out of his side, or that the same thing is receiued with out mouth, which is be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leued with our faith, or that the bread and wine after the Consecration be the body and bloud of Christ, or that we be nourished with the body and bloud of Christ or that Christ is both gone hence and is still here, or that Christ at his last supper, bare himselfe in his owne hands.</p>
                  <p>These and all other like sentences may be vnderstanded of Christes humani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, litterally &amp; carnally, as the words in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spech do properly signifye (for so dooth no man eat Christs flesh, nor drinke his bloud, nor so is not the bread and wine after the consecration his flesh and bloud, nor so is not his flesh and bloud whole here in earth, eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with our mouthes nor so did not Christ take, him selfe in his own hands:) But these and all other like sentences which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

                  <p>This briefe aunswere will suffice for all that the papists can bryng for their purpose, if it be aptly applyed.

                  <p>In the lxxiiii, leaf this author goeth about to geue a generall solution to all that may be sayd of Christes beyng in earth, in heauen, or in the sacrament: and geueth iustructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how these wordes of Christs diuine nature, figuratiuely, spiritually, really, carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, corporally, may be placed: and thus he sayth: Christ in his diuine nature may be sayed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be in the earth, figuratiuely in the sacrament, spiritually in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man that receiueth, but really, carnally, corporally, only in heauen.

And when Christ is spiritually in good men by grace, is not Christ in them really by grace? but in fantasy and imagination? And therfore what soeuer this au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor sayth, the word really may not haue such restraint to be referred onely to heauen, vnles the author would deny that substance of the godhead, which as it comprehendeth all being incomprensible, &amp; is euery where without limitation of place, so as it is, truely it is, in déed is, and therfore really is, and therfore of Christ must be sayd, wheresoeuer he is in his diuine nature by power or grace, he is there really, whether we speak of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or earth.</p>

And our resurrection, S. Augustine sayeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it shall be of our true flesh, yet it shall not be carnally. And when this author had defamed as it were the termes carnally and corporally, as tearmes of grossenes, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vsed alwayes to put as an aduersatiue, the terme spiritually, as though carnally, and spiritually might not agrée in one.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> where is no carnallyty but all the maner of being, spirituall, where is no grossenes at all the secrecie of the manner of which life is hidden from vs, and such as eye hath not séen, or eare heard, or ascended into the hart and thought of man.</p>
                  <p>I know these termes carnally and corporally may haue a good vnderstanding out of the mouth of him that had not defamed them with grossenes, or made them aduersaries to spirituall:<note place="margin">Now Christ may be sayd to be corporally &amp; carnally in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> and a man may say Christ is corporally in heauen, because the truth of his body is there, and carnally in heauen, because his flesh is truly there, but in this vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing both the wordes carnally and corporally, may be coupled with the word Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, which is agaynst this authors teaching, who appointeth the word spiritually to be spoken of Christes presence in the man that receiued the sacrament worthely which spech I do not disalow, but as Christ is spiritually in the man that dooth receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

And in those termes in that signification the fathers haue spoken of the effect of the eating of Christ in the sacrament, as in the perticuler solutions to the authors here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> after shall appear. Mary as touching the vse of the word figuratiuely, to say that Christ is figuratiuely in the bread and wine, is a saying which this author hath not proued at all, but is a doctrine before this diuerse times reproued, and now by this author in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land renewed.</p>

                  <p>For what indifferent reader would haue gathered of my words, that Christ in his diuine nature is not really in heauen?

playne and manifest scriptures agaynst you, that I will take you for no christian man, except that you reuoke that error.

                  <p>Marry as for any other grosenes, as of eating, drinking, and grose auoyding of the same, with such other like corruptible grosenes, it is for grose heades to imagine or think eyther of Christ, or of any body glorified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Augustinus.</note>And although S. Augustine may say, that Christ reigneth not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in heauen, yet he sayth playnly, that his body is of such sort, that it is circumscribed and conteined in one place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Nazianzenus.</note>And Gregory Nazianzene ment, that Christ should not com at the last iudgement in a corruptible and mortall flesh, as he had before his resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as we haue in this mortall lyfe, (for such grosenes is not to be attributed to bodyes glorified) but yet shal he come with with such a body,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as he hath since his resurrection, absolute and perfect in all partes and members of a mans bodye, hauing handes, feete, head, mouth, syde and woundes, and all other partes of a man visible and sensible, like as we shall all appeare before him at the same last day, with this same flesh in substance that we now haue, and with these same eyes shall we see God our Sauiour.

                  <p>But see you not how much this saying of S. Augustin (that our resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not be carnally) maketh agaynst your self? For if we shal not rise carnally, then is not Christ risen carnally nor is not in heauen carnally.

I wondred all this while, that you were so ready to graunt, that Christ is but after a spirituall manner in the sacrament: and now I wonder no more at that, seyng that you say, he is but after a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall maner in heauen. And by this meanes we may say, that he hath but a spirituall manhod, as you say that he hath in the sacrament but a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all body. And yet some carnall thing and grossenes he hath in him, for he hath flesh and bones, which spirites lack, except that to all this impietye


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7682:88"/>
you will adde, that his flesh and bones also be spirituall thinges &amp; not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. And it is not without some strange prognosticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that you be now waxed altogither so spirituall.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the word (figuratiuely)<note place="margin">Figuratiuely.</note> what need this any profe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that christ is in the sacraments figuratiuely? which is no more to say but sacramentally. And you graunt your selfe fol. 28. that Christ vnder the figure of visible creatures gaue inuisibly his pretious body. And fol. 80. you say, that Christ sayd, This is my body, vsing the outward signes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> visible creatures. And this doctrine was neuer reproued of any catholick man, but hath at al times and of al men bene allowed without contraditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, sauing now of you allone. Now followeth my answere to the authors particularly. And first to Saynt Clement.</p>
                  <p>My wordes be these.</p>
                  <p>They alleadge S. Clement,<note place="margin">Cap. 15. <hi>The answere to</hi> Clement. Episto. 2.</note> whose wordes be these as they report. The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods secrets are committed to three degrees: to a Priest, a Deacon, and a minister: which with feare and trembling ought to kep <hi>the leauings of the broken peces of the Lordes body,</hi> that no corruption be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the holy place, least by negligence great iniury be done to <hi>the portion of the Lordes body.</hi> And by and by followeth: <hi>So many hostes must be offered in the altar, as will suffice for the people.</hi> And if any remayne, <hi>they must not be kept vntill the morning,</hi> but be spent and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed of the clearkes, with feare and trembling. And they that consume <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sidue of the Lords body,</hi> may not by and by take other common meates, least they should mixte that holy portion, with the meat which is digested by the belly, and auoyded by the fundement. Therefore if <hi>the Lordes portion</hi> be eaten in the morning, the ministers that consume it, must fast vnto sixe of the clocke: and if they doe take it at three or foure of the clocke, the minister must fast vntill the euening.</p>
                  <p>Thus much writeth Clement of this matter: if the Epistle which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, were Clements (as in deed it is not, but they haue fayned many things in other mens names, thereby to stablish their fayned purposes) neuertheles whose soeuer the Epistle was, if it be thoroughly considered, it maketh much more agaynst the Papistes, then for theyr purpose. For by the same Epistle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth euidently three speciall thynges agaynst the erroures of the Papists.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that the bread in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is called the Lords body: and the peces of the broken bread, be called the peces and fragments of the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, which can not be vnderstand, but figuratiuely.</p>
                  <p>The second is, that the bread ought not to be reserued and hanged vp, as the Papistes euery where do vse.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that the priests ought not to receiue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alone (as the Papists commonly doe, making a sayle therof vnto the people) but they ought to communicate with the people.</p>
                  <p>And here is diligently to be noted, that we ought not vnreuerently and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedly to approche vnto this meat of the Lordes table, as we doe to other common meates and drinkes, but with great feare and dread, least we should come to that holy table vnworthely, wherin is not onely represented, but also spiritually geuen vnto vs very Christ himself.</p>
                  <p>And therfore we ought to come to that bord of the Lord with all reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fayth, loue, and charity, feare and dread, according to the same.</p>

But this I may say, if this epistle were fayned of the Papistes, then do they shew themself fooles, that could fayne no better but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> so as this author might of theyr fayned Epistle gather thrée notes agaynst them. This authors notes be these: First that the bread in the sacrament is called the Lordes body, and that the broken bread be called the peces and fragments of the Lordes body. Marke,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> well reader this note that speaketh so much of bread, where the wordes of the Epistle, in the part here alleadged name no bread at all. If this author hath red so much mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bread in an other part of the Epistle, why bringeth he not that forth to fortifye his note? I haue red after the same Epistle <hi>(pams sanctuary)</hi> but they would not helpe this authors note, and yet for the other matter ioyned with them, they would slaunder an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther way. And therfore seing this author hath left them out, I will goe no further then is here alleadged.</p>
                  <p>The calling of bread by enunciation for a name is not material, because it signifieth that was, but in that is here alleadged is no mention of bread to proue the note: and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> faythfull men the wordes of the Epistle, reuerently expresse the remayne of the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in which when manye hostes bee offered in the altar, according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that should communicate, those many hostes, after consecration, be not many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Christ, but of many breades one body of Christ. And yet as we teach in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d now, in the booke of common prayer, in euery part of that is broken, is the whole body of our Sauiour Christ. Mans words can not suffice to expresse Gods misteries, nor can vtter them so, as froward reason shall not finde matter to wrangle. And yet to stay rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, may suffice, that as in one loafe of bread broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euery péece broken, is a péece of that bread: and euery pece of the bread broken, is in it self a whole pece of bread, and so whol bread, for euery pece hath an whole substance of bread in it: So we truely speake of the host consecrated to auoyd the fantasy of multiplication of Christes body, which in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hostes, and all the partes of the hostes is but one not broken, nor distribute by pieces, &amp; yet in a spech to tell, and signifie that is broken, called in name the leauing peces of the body, portion of the body, residue of the body, in which neuertheles ech one pece is Christes whole body.</p>
                  <p>So as this speach hauing a figure, hath it of necessity, to auoyd the absurdity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to signify a multitude of bodyes, which is not so, and the sound of the speach christen eares do abhorre. But this I aske, where is the matter of this authors note, that bread is called Christes body? where there is no word of bread in the wordes alleadged, and if there were, as there is not, it were worthy no note at all. For that name is not abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the catholicke fayth teacheth that the fraction is in the outward signe, and not in the body of Christ, inuisibly present, and signified so to be present by that visible signe. The second note of this author is, touching reseruing, which Clement might seme to deny, because he ordered the remayne, to be receiued of the clerkes, thinking so best: not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> declaring expressely that nothing might be reserued to the vse of them that be absent. The contrary wherof, appereth by Iustine the Martire,<note place="margin">Iustin. apol. 2.</note>, who testifieth a reseruation to be sent to them that were sicke, who and they dwell farre from the church, as they do in some places, it may by chaunce in the way, or trouble in the sick man, tary till the mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning or it be receiued. And Cyrill writeth expresly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrillus ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losyrium.</hi> Linnehood wrot a commet of the constituti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons prouinceall of England.</note> that in case it so doth, the mistical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> (by which termes he calleth the sacrament) remayneth still in force. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this author findeth fault at hangyng vp of the sacrament, he blameth onely his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the Iles hereabout, which fault Linnehood, after he had trauayled other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys found here, beyng the manner of custody in reseruation otherwise vsed then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parties. But one thing this author should haue noted of Clements wordes, when he speketh of fearing and trembling, which and the bread were neuer the holier, as this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> author teacheth, and but onely a signification, why should any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fear or tremble more


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7682:89"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> in theyr presence, then he doth when he heareth of Christes supper, the gospell red, or himself or an other saying his Crede, which in words signify as much as the bread doth if it be but a signification? And Peter Martyr sayth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> A marueilous spech of Peter Martyr vnles he be a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he speaketh like himselfe.</note> that wordes signify more clerely then these signes do, and sayth further in his disputation with Chedsay, that we receiue the body of Christ no lesse by wordes, then by the Sacramentall signes, which teaching if it were true, why should this Sacrament be trembled at? But because this author no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth the Epistle of Clement to be fayned, I will not make with him any foundation of it, but note to the reader the third note, gathered by this author of Clementes wordes, which is, that Priestes ought not to receiue alone, which the words of the epistle proue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> not. It sheweth in déed what was done, and how the feast is indéed prepared for the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, as well as the Priest.</p>
                  <p>And I neuer red any thing of order in law or ceremony forbidding the people to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Priest, but all the old prayers and ceremonies sounded as the people did communicate with the Priest. And when the people is prepared for, and then come not, but fearyng and tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling forbeare to come, that then the Priest might not receiue his part alone, the words of this epistle shew not. And Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in that he speaketh so of leauings, semeth to thinke of that case of disappointment of the people that should come prouiding in that case the clearkes to receiue the residue, whereby should appeare, if ther we no store of clerkes, but onely one clearke, as some poore churches haue no mo, then a man might rather make a note of clements mind, that in that case one Priest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> myght receiue all allone, and so vpon a chaunce kepe the feast allone. But what soeuer we may gather, that note of this author remayneth vnproued, that the priest ought not to receiue alone.</p>
                  <p>And here I dare therefore ioyne an issue with this author,<note place="margin">An issue.</note> that none of his thrée fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> notes is grounded of any wordes of this, that he noteth a fayned Epistle, taking on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wordes that he alleageth here. This author vpon occasion of this epistle, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> fayned, speaketh more reuerently of the Sacrament then he doth in other places, which me think worthy to be noted of me. Here he sayth that very Christ himselfe is not onely represented, but also spiritually geuen vnto vs in this table: for so I vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stand the word (wherein.) And then if very Christ himselfe be represented and geuen in the table, the author meaneth not the materiall table, but by the word (table) the meat vpon the table: as the word, <hi>Mensa,</hi> a table doth signify in the xvi. of the artes, &amp; the x. of the Corinth.<note place="margin">Act. 6. 1. Cor. 10.</note> Now if very Christ himself be geuen in the meat, then is he prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the meat to be geuen. So as by this teaching very Christ himself is not onely figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely in the table, that is to say, the meat of the table, which this author now calleth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting, but is also spiritually geuen in the table as these wordes sound to me. But whether this author wil say very Christ himself is geuen spiritually in the meat, or by the meat, or with the meat, what scripture hath he to proue that he sayth, if the wordes of Christ be onely a figuratiue spech, and the bread onely signify Christes body? For if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> the wordes of the institution be but in figure, man cannot adde of his diuise any other substance or effect then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of christ purport, &amp; so this supper, after this authors tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching in other places of his book, where he would haue it but a signification, shall be a bare memory of Christs death, and signify onely such communication of Christ, as we haue otherwise by fayth in that benefite of his passion, without any speciall communica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the substaunce of his flesh in this Sacrament, beyng the same onely a figure, if it were true that this author would persuade in the conclusion of this booke, although by the way he saith otherwise, for fear percase and trembling, that he conceiueth euen of an Epistle, which he himself saith is fayned.</p>

                  <p>IT is no maruayle though this Epistle fayned by the Papistes many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yeres passed, doe vary from the Papistes in these latter dayes. For the Papisticall church at the beginning was not so corrupt as it was after, but from time to tyme encreased in errours and corruption more &amp; more,


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7682:90"/>
and still dooth, acording to S. Paules saying:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> Euill men and deceiuers waxe euer worse, both leading other into errour, and erring them selues. For at the first beginning they had no priuate Masses, no pardons in pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gatory, no reseruation of the bread, they knew no masses of <hi>Scala coeli,</hi> no Lady psalters, no transubstantiation: but of latter dayes all these, and an infinite number of errors besides, wer inuented and deuised without any aucthority of Gods word. As your selfe haue newly inuented a great sort of new deuises contrary to the Papists before your tyme, as that Christ is in the sacrament carnally and naturally: that the demonstration was made vpon the bread when Christ sayd, This is my body: that the word (satisfactorie) signifyeth no more, but the Priest to do his duety, with ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other things, which here for shortnes of tyme, I will omit at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, purposing to speake of them more hereafter. And the epistles of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were fayned before the Papistes had run so far in errors as they be now. For yet at that tyme was not inuented (as I sayd) the error of transubstantiation, nor the reseruation of the sacrament, nor the priestes did not communicate alone without the people. But that the sayd epistle of Clement was fayned,<note place="margin">Clements epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles fayned.</note> be many most certayne arguments. For there be v. epistles of Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so knit together, and referring one to an other, that if one be fayned, all must needes be fayned.</p>
                  <p>Now neither Eusebius in <hi>Ecclesiastica historia,</hi> nor S. Hierom, nor Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, nor any other old writer maketh any me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion of those epistles, which authors in rehersing what workes Clement wrotte, (not leauing out so much as one epistle of his) would surely haue made some mention of the v. Epistles which the papistes long before our tyme fayned in his name, if there had ben any such in their time.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer those Epistles make mention, that Clement at Iames re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest wrot vnto him the maner of Peters death, but how could that be, seyng that Iames was dead vii. yeres before Peter? For Iames died y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vii. yere. And Peter the xiiii. yere of Nero the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is contayned in the same epistles, that Peter made Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his successor, which could not be true, forasmuch as next to Peter succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Linus, as all the histories tel.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the author of those Epistles sayth, that he made the booke called <hi>Itenerarium Clementis,</hi> which was but fayned in Clements name, as it is declared dist. 15. <hi>Sancta.</hi> And then it followeth likewise of the other Epistles.</p>
                  <p>Fiftely, the author of those Epistles taketh vpon him to instruct S. Iames in the sacraments, and in all manner fashion how he should vse himself in his vocation, as he should say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iames (who learned of Christ himself) knew not how to vse himselfe in the necessary poynts of Christes religion, except Clement must teach him.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, there be few things in those epistles, that either be obserued at this day, or were at any tyme obserued sithens Christes religion fyrst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, a great number of scriptures in those Epistles be so far wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted from the true sence thereof, that they haue an euill opinion of Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that thinke that he would do such iniury to Gods word.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, those epistles spake of Palles, and Archdeacons, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7682:90"/>
orders, which is not like that those things began so soone, but (as the histories) were inuented many yeres after Peters tyme.</p>
                  <p>And finally, in one of those epistles is contayned a most pernicious he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, that al things ought to be common, and wives also, which could not be the doctrine of Clement, being the most pestilent errour of the Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laites, whom the holy ghost doth hate, as he testifieth in the Apocalips.<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Now all these things considered, who hauing either wit or good opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the Apostles and their disciples, can thinke that they should write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such epistles?</p>
                  <p>But the Epistle of S. Clement (say you) speaketh not of bread,<note place="margin">Clement spake of bread.</note> what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was it then I pray you that he ment, when he spake of the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peces in the Lords supper? Yf it were not bread, it must be some other thing which Christ did eat at that supper. Paradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture you will say (as some stick not to say now a dayes) that Christ had some other meat at that supper then bred as if he fared daintely (which we neuer read) you might imagine he had capon, partrich, or fesaunt, or if he fared hardly, at the least you would say he had cheese to eat with his bread, because you will defend that he did not eat dry bread alone. Such vayne phantasies men may haue, that will speak without Gods word, which maketh mention in that holy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of nothing, but of bread and wine. But let it be that Christ had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dishes as you can deuise, yet I trust you will not say, that he called all those his body, but onely the bread. And so S. Clement speaking of the bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken peeces of the Lords body, of the residue and fragments of the Lords body, of the portion and leauing of the Lords body, must needes speak all this of bread. And thus is if manifest false that you say, that the epistle of Clement speaketh nothing of bread.</p>
                  <p>And then forasmuch as he calleth the leauings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lords body, and the fragments and portion therof, he calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fragments and portion of the Lordes body, he sheweth that the bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth, and that the calling therof the lords body is a figuratiue speech. The body of Christ hath no fragments nor broken peces, and therfore the calling here is so materiall,<note place="margin">Calling of bread is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</note> that it proueth fully the matter, that to call bread Christs body, is a figuratiue speech. And although to auoid the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> you deuise subtill cauillatious, saying that calling is not materiall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it signifieth that was: Yet they that haue vnderstanding, may soon discerne what a vayne shift this is, imagined onely to blynd the ignorant readers eyes. But if that which is bread before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> consecration, be after no bread, and if it be agaynst the Christen fayth to think that it is still bread, what occasion of errour should this be, to call it still bread after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Ys not this a great occasion of errour to call it bread still, if it be not bread still?</p>
                  <p>And yet in this place of Clement the calling can in no wise signify that was before consecration, but must needes signify that is after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this place speaketh of fragments, broken peeces, and leauings, which can haue no true vnderstanding before consecration, at what time there be yet no broken peeces, fragments, nor leauings, but be all done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consecration.</p>
                  <p>But you wrangle so much in this matter to auoyd absurdities, that you snarle your self into so many and haynous absurdities, as you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7682:91"/>
be able to winde your selfe out. For you say that Christes body (which in all the hostes, and in all the partes of the hostes is but one, not broken,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> nor distributed) is called the leauing peeces of the body, portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body, residue of the body, &amp; yet euery peece is Christs whole body, which things to be spoken of Christes body, christian eares abhore for to heare. And if you will say, that your booke is false, that you meant al these leauing pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, portion, and residue, to be vnderstand of the hostes, and not of Christs body, then you confesse the hostes which be broken, to be called by name the leauings or peeces of Christs body, the portion of his body, the residue of his body, by a figuratiue spech, which is as much as I speake in my first note. And so appeareth how vaynely you haue traueled for the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my first note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of reseruation</note>Now as touching the second note: Clement declareth expressely, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> nothing might be reserued. For where he sayth, that if any thing remain, it must not be kept vntill the morning, but be spent and consumed of the clearkes: how could he declare more playnly, that nothing might be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then by those wordes?</p>
                  <p>And as for Iustine he speaketh not one word of sicke persons, as you report of hym.</p>
                  <p>And concerning Cirill <hi>ad Calosyrium,</hi> would to God that worke of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill might come abroad, (for I doubt not but it would clerely discusse this matter) but I feare that some Papistes will suppresse it, that it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come to light.

Think you that Symon Magus was not in as great damnation for the vnworthy receyuing of Baptisme, as Iudas was for the vnworthy receyuing of the Lordes supper? And yet you will not say, that Christ is really and corporally in the water, but that the washing in the water is an outward signification and figure, declaring what God worketh inwardly in them that truely be baptised. And likewise speaketh this Epistle of the holy communion. For euery good christian man ought to come to Christes sacraments, with great feare, humility, fayth, loue, and charitie.</p>

                     <hi>I ask this question of you brethren and sisterne (sayth S. Augustine:) aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer me, Whether you think greater, the word of God, or the body of Christ? If you will answer the truth, verely you ought to say thus: That the word of God is no lesse then the body of Christ. And therfore with what carefullnes we take heed when the body of Christ is ministred vnto vs, that no part therof fall out of our handes on the earth, with as great carefulnes let vs take heede, that the word of God which is ministred vnto vs, when we think or speake of vayne matters, perish not out of our hartes. For he that heareth the word of God negligently shall be giltie of no lesse fault, then he that suffereth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ to fall vpon the ground thorough his negligence.</hi> This is the mynd of S. Augustine. And as much we haue in Scripture for the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hearing and reading of God his holy word, or the neglecting therof, as we haue for the sacramentes.</p>
                  <p>But it semeth by your penne and vtteraunce of this matter,<note place="margin">The causes of feare &amp; tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> that you vnderstand not the ground and cause, wherupon should arise the great feare and trembling in their hartes, that come to receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacramentes: for you shew another consideration therof, than the scripture doth. For you seeme to driue all the cause of feare, to the dignitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, there corporally present and receaued, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture declareth the feare to ryse of the indignitie and vnworthines of the receauers. He that eateth and drinketh vnworthely (threatneth Gods word) eateth and drinketh his owne damnation.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Centurio</hi> considering his own vnworthines was abashed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue Christ into his house, saying:<note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder the couering of my house. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same thing made Peter afrayd to be neare vnto Christ, and to say:<note place="margin">Luc. 5.</note> Go from me O Lord, for I am a sinner. And all Christian men ought not to feare &amp; tremble onely whan they receaue the sacramentes, but when soeuer they heare Gods word, and threatninges pronounced agaynst sinners.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the third note, thou shalt see playnly good reader,<note place="margin">The people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priestes.</note> that here is nothing here aunswered directly, but meere cauilations sought, and shift to auoyde. For if all the old prayers and ceremonies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> sound, as the people did communicate with the priest (as you say they do, and so they do in dede, and that as well in the communion of drinking as eating) than eyther the people did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with them indeede, and receaued the Sacrament vnder both the kindes, or else the prayers had ben false, &amp; the ceremonies frustrate, and in vayne. And is it like, that the priests in that time would haue vsed vnto God such vntrue prayers, as should declare that the people did communicate with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if indeed none did communicate with them? as it should haue bene, by your imagined chances, and cases.</p>
                  <p>But it apeareth by the wordes of the Epistle, that the whole multitude of the people that was present, did communicate at those dayes, so that the priest could not communicate alone, except he would communicate whan no man was in the church. But by the aunswer of this sophister <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> here in this place, thou mayst see an experience, good reader, whether he be as redy to see those thinges that make agaynst him, as he is paynfull


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7682:92"/>
and studious to draw, as it were by force, all thinges to his purpose, to make them, at the least, to seme to make for him, although they be neuer so much agaynst him. As appeareth by all these his suppositions, that all the people which were prepared for, should in those dayes withdraw them selues from the communion, and not one of them come vnto it: that the clarkes should receaue all that was prouided for the people: that one clerke should receaue that which many clerkes ought to haue receaued. And so in conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by onely his fayned suppositions he would perswade, that the priest should receaue all alone.</p>
                  <p>By such prety cases, of the people disapoynting the priestes: and of lacke of store of clerkes, you might dayly finde cauilations with all godly ordenaunces. For where as God ordayned the pascall lambe to be eaten vp cleane in euery house:<note place="margin">The Paschall Lamb.</note> and where there were not inough in one house to eat vp the Lambe, they should call of their neighbours so many as should suffice to eate vp the hole Lambe, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing should remayne: Here you might bring in your (vpon a chance) that they that lacked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to eate vp a hole Lambe, dwelt alone far from other houses, and could not come together: or could not gette any such Lambe as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the feast, or if their neighbours lacked company also. And what if they had no spitte to rost the lambe? And where as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should be shooed, what if perchance they had no shooes? And if perchaunce a mans wife were not at home, and all his seruaunts falled sike of the sweat, or plague, and no man durst come to his house, then must he turne the spitte him selfe, and eate the Lambe all alone? Such chances you purposely deuise, to establishe your priuat Masse, that the priest may eate all alone. But by such a lyke reason as you make here, a man might proue, that the priest should preach or say mattens to him selfe alone, in case (as you say) that the people which should come, would disapoynt him. For what if the people disapoynt the priest (say you) and come not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> communion? What if the people disapoynt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest (say I) and come not to mattens nor sermon? shall he therfore say mattens and preach, whan no man is present but him selfe alone? But your imagined case hath such an absurditie in it, as is not tollerable to be thought to haue beene in Christian people in that tyme, when Clements Epistles were written, that when all the people should receaue the communion with the priest, yet not one would come, but all would disapoynt him. And yet in that case I doubt not, but the priest would haue absteined from mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration vnto more opportunitie and more accesse of Christian people, as he would haue done likewise in saying of mattens and preaching.

And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Decolampadius himselfe is not troubled so much with answering any other to shape any manner of euasion, as to answer Ireneus, in whome he notably stumbleth. And Peter Martyr in his work graunteth Irene to be specially alledged, to whome (when


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7682:93"/>
he goeth about to answer) a man may euidently see how he masketh him selfe. And this author bringeth in Clementes epistle, of which no great count is made, although it be not contemned: and passeth ouer Ireneus that speaketh euidently in the matter, and was as old as Clement or not much yonger. And bicause Ignatius was of that age, and is alleadged by Theodorete to haue written in his epistle <hi>ad Smirnenses,</hi> whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> may apeare his fayth of the mistery of the sacrament, it shall serue to good purpose, to write in the wordes of the same Ignatius here vpon the credite of the sayd Theodoret,<note place="margin">Theodoret. Dialogo. 3.</note> whome this author so much commendeth, the wordes of Ignatius be these: <hi>Eucharistias &amp; oblationes non admittunt, quod non confiteantur Eucharistiam esse carnem seruatoris nostri Iesu Christi, quae pro peccatis nostris passa est, quam pater sua benignitate suscitauit.</hi> Which wordes be thus much in english, they do not admitte (<hi>Eucharistias</hi> and oblations) by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not confesse <hi>Eucharistiam</hi> to be the flesh of our sauiour Iesu Christ: which flesh suffered for our sinnes, which flesh the father by his benignitie hath stirred vp. These be Ignatius wordes, which I haue not throughly englished, bicause the word <hi>Eucharistia</hi> can not be well englished, being a word of mistery, and signifieng (as Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus openeth) both the partes of the sacrament, heauenly and earthly, visible and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But in that Ignatius openeth his fayth, thus he taketh <hi>Eucharistia</hi> to be the flesh of our sauiour Christ that suffered for vs, he declareth the sence of Christes wordes. This is my body, not to be figuratiue onely, but to expresse the truth of the very flesh there giuen: and therfore (Ignatius sayth) <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> is the flesh of our sauior Christ, the same that suffered and the same that rose agayne. Which wordes of Ignatius so pithely open the matter, as they declare therwith the fayth also of Theodoret that doth alleage him, so as if the author would make so absolute a worke, as to peruse all the fathers sayinges, he should not thus leape ouer Ignatius, nor Irene neither, as I haue before declared.

was this that as the water in baptisme is called <hi>Aqua regenerans,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water that doth regenerate, and yet it doth not regenerate indeed, but is the Sacrament of regeneration wrought by the Holy Ghost, and called so to make it to be esteemed aboue other common waters: so Christ confessed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures of bread and wine ioyned vnto his wordes in his holy supper, &amp; there truely ministred, to be his body &amp; bloud: meaning thereby, that they ought not to be taken as common bread, or as bakers bread, and wine drunken in the tauern (as Smyth vntruely gesteth of me throughout his booke) but that they ought to be taken for bread &amp; wine,<note place="margin">Smyth.</note> wherin we geue thanks to God, and therfore be called <hi>Eucharistia corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini, the thanking of Christs body and bloud</hi> (as Irene termeth them:) or <hi>Miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini, the misteries of Christes flesh and bloud,</hi> as Dionysius calleth them: or <hi>Sacramenta corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christs flesh and bloud,</hi> as diuers other authours vse to call them. And when Christ called bread and wine his body and bloud, why do the the old Authours chaunge in many places that speech of Christ, and call them <hi>Eucharistia, misteria, &amp; sacramenta corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini? the thankes geuing, the misteries, and the sacraments of his flesh and bloud?</hi> but because they would clearely expound the meaning of Christes speech, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called the bread and wine his flesh and bloud, he ment to ordayne them to be the sacraments of his flesh and bloud? According to such a spech as S. Augustine expresseth, how the Sacramentes of Christes flesh and bloud be called his flesh and bloud, and yet in deede they be not his flesh &amp; bloud, but the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts therof, signifying vnto the godly receiuers, that as they corporally feed of the bread and wine (which comfort theyr harts and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this corruptible life for a seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) so spiritually they feed of Christs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flesh, &amp; drinke his very bloud. And we be in such sort vnited vnto him that his flesh is made our flesh, his holy spirite vnityng him and vs so toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. Ephe. 1. and 4.

And as fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nourishing, and life commeth from the head, and runneth into all partes of the body, so doth eternal nourishment and life come from Christ vnto vs completely and fully, as well into our bodyes as soules. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore if Christ our head be risen agayne, then shall we that be the members of his body surely rise also, forasmuch as the members can not be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the head:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> but seyng that as he is our head and eternall foode, we must needs by him liue with him for euer. This is the argument of Irene agaynst those heriticks which denyed the resurrection of our bodies. And these things the sacraments of bread and wine declare vnto vs: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the carnall presence, nor the carnall eating of Christes flesh maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things so to be, nor Irene ment no such thing. For then should all manner of persons that receaue the sacramentes, haue euerlasting life, and none but they.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thus haue I answered to Irene playnly and shortly, and Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius neded not to trouble himselfe greatly with aunswering this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:7682:94"/>The answere also is easely made to the place which you alleadge out of Ignatius, where he calleth <hi>Eucharistia</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of our sauior Iesus Christ.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For he meaneth no more, but that it is the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his flesh, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his flesh (or as Irene sayd) <hi>Eucharistia</hi> of his flesh, as euen now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in mine answere to Irene. And your long processe here may haue a short aunswere gathered of your owne wordes. This word <hi>Eucharistia</hi> (say you) can not be well Englished, but the body of Christ is good and playne English, &amp; then if <hi>Eucharistia</hi> be such a thing as cannot be well Englished, it can not be called the body of Christ, but by a figuratiue speech. And how can you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conclude of Ignatius words, that this is my body, is no figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue speech? It semeth rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cleane contrary may be concluded. For if these. ii. speeches be like &amp; of one sence (<hi>Eucharistia</hi> is Christs body, and this is my body) &amp; the first be a declaration of the second, is this a good ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument?

And that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the first: because the declaration should be a more playne speech then that which is declared by it.</p>
                  <p>And as for your coulor of Rhetorick which you cal Reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with your self, that you vse it commonly in your booke, when I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage any author or speake any thing that you can not answere vnto.</p>
                  <p>And yet one thing is necessary to admonish the reader, that Ignatius in this epistle entreateth not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manner of the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christ in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but of the maner of his very body, as he was borne of his mother, crucified, and rose agayn, appeared vnto his Apostles, and ascended into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which things diuers hereticks sayd were not done verily in deed, but apparantly to mens sightes, and that in deed he had no such carnall &amp; corporall body, as he appered to haue. And agaynst such errors speaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> epistle, and not of the reall and corporall presence of Christ in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t although <hi>Eucharistia</hi> or the sacrament be ordeyned for a remembrance of that very body, and so hath the name of it, as the sacraments haue the names of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which they signify. But by this so manifest writhing of the mind of Ignatius from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true sence and purpose that was ment, to an other sence and purpose that was not ment, may appeare the truth of the Papistes, who wrast and misconstrue all old auncient writers and holy doctors to their wicked and vngodly purposes.

This Dionyse spake of this mistery after the dignitie of it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> not contending with any other for the truth of it, as we do now, but extolling it, as a marueilous high mistery, which if the bread be neuer the holyer, and were onely a signi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication, (as this author teacheth) were no high mistery at all. As for the things of the Sacrament to be in heauen, the church teacheth so, and yet the same thinges be indéede present in the sacrament also: which is a mistery so deepe and darke from mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall capacitie, as is onely to be be beleued supernaturally, without asking of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (how) wherof S.

                  <p>Now as concerning the high mistery which S.

But notwithstanding any holines or godlines wrought in the receauers of them, yet they be not the more holy or godly in themselfes,<note place="margin">Holines in the sacraments.</note> but be only tokens, significations, and sacraments of that holines, which almighty God by his omnipotent power worketh in vs. And for their holy significations they haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of holines which almighty god by his omnipotent power worketh in vs. And for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly significations they haue the name of holynes, as the water in baptisme is called <hi>aqua sanctificans: Vnda regenerans,</hi> Halowing or regenerating water, because it is the sacrament of regeneration, and sanctification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Christ in our hands.</note>Now as concerning Chrisostomes saying, that Christ is in our hands, Chrisostome saith (as I haue rehearsed in my book) not onely that he is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> our hands, but also that we se him with our eyes, touch him him, feele him and grope him, fixe our teeth in his flesh, tast it, breake it, eat it, and digest it, make red our tongues, and dye them with his bloud &amp;c. which thinges cannot be vnderstand of the body and bloud of Christ, but by a figuratiue speech, as I haue more at large declared in my iiii. book the viii.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where as craftely to alter the sayinges of Origene, you goe about to put a diuersitie of the exhibition of Christ in these iii. thinges, in his worde, in baptisme, and in his holy supper, as though in his worde and in baptisme he were exhibited spiritually, &amp; in his holy supper sensibly to be eaten with our mouthes: this distinction you haue dreamed in your slepe, or imagined of purpose. For Christ after one sort is exhibited in all these iii. in his worde, in baptisme, and in the Lordes supper: that is to


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7682:97"/>
say spiritually, and for so much in one sorte, as before you haue confessed your selfe. And Origene putteth no such diuersitie as you here imagine, but declareth one maner of giuing of Christ vnto vs in his worde, in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and in the Lordes supper, that is to say, in all these iii. <hi>secundum spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem.</hi> That as vnto the Iewes Christ was geuen in figures, so to vs he is geuen <hi>in specie,</hi> that is to say, <hi>in rei veritate,</hi> in his very nature: meaning nothing els, but that vnto the Iewes he was promised in figures, and to vs after his incarnation he is maried and ioyned in his proper kynd, and in his wordes and sacramentes, as it were sensibly geuen.</p>
                  <p>But how so euer I report Origene, you captiously and very vntruely do report me. For wheras I say, that in Gods word, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of baptisme, and of the Lordes supper, Christ is manifested and exhibited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vnto vs, as it were face to face, and sensibly, you leauing out these wordes (as it were)<note place="margin">As it were</note> make a quarell to this word (sensibly) or rather you make that word (sensibly) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foundation of all your weake building, as though there were no difference betwene sensibly, and as it were sensibly: and as it were all one thing a man to lye sleaping, and as he were sleaping: or deade, and as he were dead. Do not I write thus in my first booke, that the washing in the water of baptisme, is as it were a shewing of Christ before our eyes, and a sensible touching, feeling, and groping of him? And do these wordes import, that we see him &amp; grope him indede? And further I say, that the eating and drinking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacramentall bread and wine, is as it were a shewing of Christ before our eyes, a smelling of him with our noses, and a feeling &amp; groping of him with our handes. And doe we therfore see him indede with our corporall eyes, smell him with our noses, and put our handes in his side and fele his woundes? If it were so indede, I would not adde these wordes, as it were. For what speach were this of a thing that is in dede, to say, as it were? For these wordes as it were, signifie that it is not so indede. So now likewise in this place of Origene, where it is sayd, that Christ in his wordes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes is manifested and exhibited vnto vs, as it were face to face, and sensibly, it is not ment that Christ is so exhibited in dede face to face, and sensibly, but the sence is cleane contrary, that he is not there geuen sensibly nor face to face. Thus it apeareth how vprightly you handell this matter, and how truely you reporte my wordes. But the further you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceade in your aunswer, the more you shew crafty iuggeling, legier de <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> mayne, passe a gods name, to blynd mens eyes, strange speaches, new inuentions not without much impietie as the wordes sound, but what the meaning is, no man can tell but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maker him selfe. But as the words be placed, it seemeth you meane, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes supper we be not made by Christes spirite participant of the benefyt of his passion: nor by baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or Gods word, we be not made participant of his godhead by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite: and furthermore by this distinction (which you fayne without any ground of Origene) we receaue not man and God in baptisme: nor in the Lordes supper we be not by meanes of his godhead made partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant of the effect of his passion. In baptisme also by your distinction we receaue not a pledge of the regeneration of our flesh, but in the Lordes supper: nor Christ is not truely present in baptisme. Which your sayd differences do not onely derogate and diminish the effect and dignitie of

And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme the aduerbe (ly) signifieth the maner of a thing that is indede, and sometyme the maner of a thing that is not.

And yet it is but the Romish church. For the olde &amp; first Church of Christ is cleerely agaynst you. And Origen sayth not as you do, that to vnderstand the sayd wordes of Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> spiritually, is to vnderstand them as the spirite of God hath taught the church: but to vnderstand them spiritually, is to vnderstand them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the wordes sound: for he that vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth them after the letter (sayth Origen) vnderstandeth them carnally, and that vnderstanding hurteth and destroyeth.

                  <p>And agaynst the papistes he teacheth most playnly, that the Communion ought to be receaued of all men vnder both kindes: and that Christ called bread his body, and wine his bloud: and that there is not transubstantiation (but that bread remayneth there as a figure to represent Christes body, and wine to represent his bloud) and that those which be not the liuely members of Christ, do eat the bread and drincke the wine, and be not nourished by them, but the very flesh and bloud of Christ they neither eate nor drincke.</p>

Where as Ciprian of all other, like as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he is auncient within 250. yeares of Christ, so did he write very openly in the matter and therfore Melancthon in his epistle to Decolampadius did chuse him for one,<note place="margin">Melancthon.</note> whose words in the affirmation of Christes true presence in the sacrament had no ambiguitie And like iudgement doth Hippinus in his book before alleaged geue of Cyprianus faith in the sacrament,<note place="margin">Hippinus.</note> which two I allege to counteruayle the iudgement of this author, who speaketh of his owne head as it liketh him, playing with the words, grosse, and car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall, and vsing the word represent, as though it expressed a figure only. Hippinus in the sayd booke alleadgeth Cyprian to say, <hi>Lib,</hi> 3. <hi>ad Quirinum</hi> that the body of our Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is our sacrifice in flesh,<note place="margin">Ciprian. li. 3 ad quirinum.</note> meaning, as Hipinus sayth, (<hi>Eucharistiam,</hi>) wherin S Augustin (as Hippinus saith further) in the praier for his mother, speaking of the bread and wine of <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> sayth that in it is dispensed the holy host and sacrifice, whereby was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the byl obligatory that was agaynst vs. And further Hippinus sayth, that the olde men called the bread and wine of our Lordes supper, a sacrifice, an host, and oblation for that specially, because they beleued &amp; taught the true body of Christ and his true bloud to be destribute in the bread and wine of <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> and as S.

These be Hippinus very words, who because he is I thinke in this authors opinion taken for no Papist, I rather speake in his words then in myne owne, whom in an other part of this worke, this author doth as it were for charity by name sclaunder to be a Papist. Wherfore the sayd Hippinus wordes shalbe as I thinke more weighty to oppresse this authors talke then mine be, and therfore howsoeuer this author handleth before the wordes of S.

For your own bare words without any proofe I trust the indifferent reader will not allow, hauing such experience of you as he hath. And if Cyprian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of all other had writ most plainly agaynst me (as you say without profe) who thinketh that you would haue omitted here Cyprians wordes, and haue fled to Melancthon,<note place="margin">Melancthon.

                  <p>And as for Cyprian and S. Augustine, here by you alleaged, they serue nothing for your purpose, nor speake nothing against me, by Epinus own iudgement. For Epinus sayth, that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> is called a sacrifice, because it is a remembrance of the true sacrifice, which was offred vpon the cros and that in it is dispensed the very body and bloud, yea the very death of Christ, (as he alleadgeth of S. Augustine in that place) the holy sacrifice wherby he blotted out and canceled the obligation of death, which was a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst vs, nayling it vpon the crosse, and in his owne person wanne the victory, and tryumphed agaynst the princes &amp; powers of darknesse. This passion, death, and victory of Christ is dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed and distributed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords holy supper, and dayly among Christs holy people.

                     <hi>ad Quirinum</hi> neither.

be naturally in Christ, or <hi>Christ to be naturally in him.</hi> For the beyng of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Christ and <hi>the being of Christ in vs,</hi> maketh vs to be one in them. And therfore if Christ haue taken verily the flesh of our body, and the man that was verily born of the virgin Mary is Christ, and also <hi>we receaue vnder thè true mistery the flesh of his body,</hi> by meanes wherof we shalbe one (for the father is in Christ, and <hi>Christ in vs</hi>) how shall that be called the vnity of will, when the <hi>naturall property, brought to passe by the Sacrament,</hi> is the sacrament of vnity?</p>
                  <p>Thus doth the Papists (the aduersaries of Gods word &amp; of his truth) alleage the authority of Hilarius (eyther peruersely and purposely, as it semeth, vntrue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly reciting hym and wrasting his words to their purpose) or els not truely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding him.</p>
                  <p>For although he sayth that Christ is naturally in vs, yet he sayth also that we be naturally in him. And neuerthelesse in so saying, he ment not of the natural and corporall presence of the substaunce of Christes body and of ours (for as our bodyes be not after that sort within his body, so is not his body after that sort within our bodies:) but he ment that Christ in his incarnation receyued of vs a mortal nature and vnited the same vnto his diuinity, and so be we naturally in him.</p>
                  <p>And the sacraments of Baptisme &amp; of his holy supper (if we rightly vse the same) do most assuredly certify vs, that we be partakers of his godly nature, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing geuen vnto vs by him, immortality and life euerlasting, and so is Christ naturally in vs. And so be we one with Christ, and Christ with vs, not onely in will and mind, but also in very naturall properties.</p>
                  <p>And so concludeth Hylarius agaynst Arrius, that Christ is one with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not in purpose and will onely, but also in very nature.</p>
                  <p>And as the vnion betwene Christ and vs in baptisme is spirituall, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no real and corporall presence: so likewise our vnion with Christ in his ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly supper is spirituall, and therfore requireth no reall and coporall presence.</p>
                  <p>And therfore Hilarius speaking therof, both the sacraments, maketh no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene our vnion with Christ in baptisme, and our vnion with him in his holy supper. And sayth further, that as Christ is in vs, so be we in him, which the Papistes cannot vnderstand corporally and really, except they will say, that all our bodyes be corporally within Christes body. Thus is Hylarius answered vnto, both playnly and shortly.</p>

                  <p>This answere to Hylary, in the lxxviii. leafe requyreth a playne precise issue, worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be tried apparant at hand.

                        </gap> vnitatis?</hi> My translation is this. <hi>If the word was made verely flesh, and we verely receaue the word beyng flesh, in our Lordes meat, how shall not Christ be thought to dwell naturally in vs: who being borne man, hath taken vnto him the nature of our flesh that can not be seuered, and hath put together the nature of his flesh to the nature of his eternity, vnder the Sacrament of the communion of his flesh vnto vs, for so we be all one, because the father is in Christ, and Christ in vs. Wherfore whosoeuer will deny the father to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in Christ, must denye first either himselfe to be naturally in Christ, or Christ not to be naturally in him, for the being of the father in Christ and the being of Christ in vs, maketh vs to be one in them. And therfore if Christ hath taken verely the flesh of our body, and the man that was born of the virgine Mary is verely Christ, and allowe verely receiue vnder a mistery the flesh of his body, by meanes wherof we shalbe one, for the father is in Christ, and Christ in vs: how shall that be called the vnitye of will, when the natural propriety brought to passe by the Sacrament, is the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This translation differeth from myne other, wherat this author findeth fault, but wherin? the word (<hi>Vero</hi>) was in the other coppy an adiectiue, and I ioyned it wyth (<hi>Misterio</hi>) &amp; therfore sayd the true mistery: which word (mistery) needed no such adiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue (true), for euery mistery is true of it selfe. But to say, as Hilary truely correct sayth, that we receyue vnder the mistery, truely, the flesh of Christes body, that word (truely,) so placed, setteth forth liuely the reall presence, and substantiall presence, of that is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and repeteth agayne the same that was before sayd, to the more vehemency of it. So as this correction is better then my first copy, and according to this correction, is Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius alleaged by Melancthon to Decolampadius: for the same purpose I alleage him. An other alteration in the translation thou séest reader in the word <hi>(Perfectae)</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in my copy was <hi>(Perfecta)</hi> and so was ioyned to <hi>(Proprietas)</hi> which now in the genetiue case ioyned to <hi>(Vnitatis)</hi> geueth an excellent sence to the dignity of the Sacrament, how the naturall proprietie by the Sacrrament, is a Sacrament of perfect vnity, so as the perfect vnity of vs with Christ,<note place="margin">An issue.</note> is to haue his flesh in vs and to haue Christ bodely and naturally dwelling in vs by his manhood, as he dwelleth in vs spiritually by his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and now I speak in such phrase as Hylarie and Cyrill speake, and vse the words, whatsoeuer thys author sayth, as I will iustifye by their playne wordes.</p>
                  <p>And so I ioyne now with this author an Issue, that I haue not peruersely vsed the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of Hylary, but alleadged him as one that speaketh most clearly of this matter: which Hilarie in his 8. booke <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> entreateth how many diuers wayes we be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> one in Christ, among which he accompteth fayth for one: then he commeth to the vnity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> in Baptisme,<note place="margin">Unity in fayth. Unity in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> where he handleth the matter aboue some capacities, and because there is but one Baptisme, and all that be baptised be so regenerate in one dispensation, and do the same thing, and be one in one, they that be one by the same thing, be, as he sayth, in nature one. From that vnity in Baptisme he commeth to declare our vnitye with Christ in flesh,<note place="margin">Unity in flesh.</note> which he calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament of perfect vnity, declaring how it is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, who tooke truely our flesh mortal, in the vyrgins womb, deliuereth vs the same flesh glorified truely to be communicate with our flesh, wherby as we be naturally in Christ, so Christ is naturally in vs: and when this is brought to passe, then the vnitie betwéen Christ and vs is perfected. For as Christ is naturally in the father of the same essence, by the diuine nature: So we be naturally in Christ by our natural flesh, which he toke in the virgins wombe, and he naturally in vs, by the same flesh in him glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and geuen to vs, and receiued of vs in the Sacrament For Hilarie sayth in playne words,<note place="margin">Hylarius.</note> how Christes very flesh, and Christes very bloud receyued and drunken <hi>(Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta &amp; hausta)</hi> bring this to pas. And it is notable how Hilarie compareth together y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> (truely) in Christes taking of our flesh in the virgins wombe, with the (truely) of our taking of his flesh <hi>(In cibo dominica)</hi> in our Lordes meat: by which words, he expresseth the Sacrament, and after reproueth those that said: we were onely vnited by obedience and will of religion to Christ, and by him so to the Father, as though by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7682:100"/>
of flesh and bloud, no proprietie of naturall communion were geuen vnto vs: whereas both by the honour geuen vnto vs, we be the sonnes of God, and by the sonne dwelling carnally in vs, and we beyng corporally and inseparably vnite in hym, the mistery of true and naturall vnity is to be preached. These be Hilaries wordes: for this latter part, where thou hearest reader, the son of God to dwell carnally in vs, not after mans grosse imagination, for we may not so thinke of Godly misteries, but (car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) is referred to the truth of Christes flesh,<note place="margin">Carnally.</note> geuen to vs in this Sacrament: and so is (naturally) to be vnderstanded,<note place="margin">Naturally.</note> that we receaue Christes naturall flesh, for the truth of it, as Christ receyued our naurall flesh of the virgine, although we receaue Christes flesh glorified incorruptible, very spiritual, and in a spiritual maner deliuered vnto vs. Here is mention made of the word (corporall) but I shall speake of that in the discussio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Cyrill. This Hylary was before S. Augustine, and was known both of him and S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Hierome, who called him (<hi>Tubam latini eloquij</hi>) against the Arrians. Neuer man fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> fault at this notable place of Hylary. Now let vs consider how the author of this booke forgetteth himselfe, to call Christ in vs naturally by his Godhead, which were then to make vs al Gods by nature, which is ouer great an absurdity, and Christ in his diuine nature dwelleth only in his father naturally, &amp; in vs by grace. But as we receaue him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> in the sacrament of his flesh and bloud if we receiue hym worthily, so dwelleth he in vs naturally, for the naturall communication of our nature and hys. And therfore where this author reporteth Hylary to make no difference betwéene our vnyon to Christ in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Baptisme, and in the supper, let him trust in him no more that told hym so: or if this au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor will take vpon him as of his owne knowledge, then I must say, and if he were an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other would say an aunswere in french, that I will not expresse. And hereupon will I ioynin the Issue,<note place="margin">An issue.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Hylary the matter is so playn otherwise then this author rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, as it hath no coulor of defence to the contrary. And what Hylary speaketh of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and our vnity therin, I haue before touched, and this vnity in flesh is after trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted apart.</p>
                  <p>What shall I say to this so manifest vntruth? but that it confirmeth that I haue in other obserued, how there was neuer one of them that I haue red writing against the Sacrament, but hath in his writings sayd somewhat so euidently in the matter, or out of the matter discrepant from truth, as might be a certayn marke to iudge the quality of his spirite.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> HEre you confesse that you cited Hilary vntruely, but you impute the fault to your copy. What copy you had I know not, but aswell the citation of Melancthon, as all the printed bookes that euer I saw, haue otherwise then you haue written, and therfore it seemeth that you neuer red any printed booke of <hi>Hylarius.</hi> Marry it might be that you had from Smyth a false copy written,<note place="margin">Smyth.</note> who informed me, that you had of him all the authorityes that be in your booke. And hauing al the authorities that he had with great trauell gathered, by and by you made your booke, and stale from him all his thanck and glory, like vnto Esops choughe, which plumed himselfe with other birds fethers. But whersoeuer you had your copy all the books setforth by publike fayth haue otherwise, then you haue cited. And although the false allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Hylary toucheth you somewhat yet chiefly it toucheth Smyth, who hath erred much worse in his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation then you haue done, albeit nether of you both handle the matter sincerely and faithfully, nor agree the one with the other.</p>

For if you haue found Hilary truely corrected (as you say you haue) your fault is the more, that out of a true copy would pick out an vntrue transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if you haue so done, then by putting in a little prety (not) where none ought to be, with that little prity trip you haue cleane ouerthrowne your selfe. For if it be an errour to deny that Christ is not naturally in vs, (as it his rehersed for an errour) then must it be an errour to affirme that Christ is naturally in vs. For it is all one thing, that he is not, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that he is naturally in vs. And so by your owne translation you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow your selfe quite and cleane, in that you say in many places of your book, that Christ is naturally in vs, and ground your saying vpon Hylarie.

                  <p>But for the perfectnes of the vnity between Christ and vs, you declare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> here to be the perfect vnity to be that, which is but the one halfe of it. For the perfect vnity of vs with Christ, is not onely to haue Christ corporally and naturally dwelling in vs, but likewise we to dwell corporally and naturally in him. And Hylary declareth the second part to pertain to our vnity with Christ, aswell as the first, which of sleight &amp; pollicy you leaue out purposely, because it declareth the meaning of the first part, which is not that Christ is in them that receaue the sacrament, and when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the sacrament only, but that he naturally tarrieth and dwelleth in all them that partayn to him, whether they receaue the sacrament or no. And as he dwelleth naturally in them so do they in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mine issue.</note>And although you haue excused your peruersity by your false copy, yet here I will ioyne an issue with you, that you did neither aleage Hylaries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> wordes before truely, nor yet now do truely declare them. As for the fyrst part you haue confessed your selfe, that you were deceiued by a false copy. And therfore in this part, I plead that you be gilty by your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as concerniug the second part, Hylary speaketh not of the vnitye of Christ with the sacrament, nor of the vnity of Christ with vs onely when we receaue the sacrament, nor of the vnity of vs with Christ onely, but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so with his father, by which vnity we dwell in Christ, and Christ in vs, &amp; also we dwell in the Father and the father in vs.<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. Iohn. 5. Iohn. 6.</note> For as Christ beyng in his father, &amp; his father in him, hath lyfe of his father so he beyng in vs, &amp; we in him, geueth vnto vs the nature of his eternity, which he receiued of his father, that is to say, immortality and life euerlasting, which is the nature of his Godhead. And so haue we the Father and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sonne dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in vs naturally,<note place="margin">Naturally.</note> and we in them, forasmuch as he geueth to vs the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of his eternitie, which he had of his father, and honoureth vs with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> honoureth vs with that houour which he had of his father. But Christ giueth not this nature of eternity to the Sacrament, except you will say


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7682:101"/>
that the sacrament shall haue euerlasting lyfe, as you must needes say, if Christ dwell naturally in it, after Hylaries maner of reasoning. For by the saying of Hylary, where Christ dwelleth, there dwelleth his father, &amp; giueth eternall lyfe by his sonne.</p>
                  <p>And so be you a goodly sauiour, that can bring to euerlasting life both bread, and drinke, which neuer had life. But as this nature of eternity is not geuen to the sacrament: so is it not geuen to them that vnworthely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the sacrament, which eat and drink their owne damnation. Nor it is not geuen to the liuely members of Christ, onely when they receaue the sacrament, but so long as they spiritually feede vpon Christ, eating his flesh and drinking his bloud, either in this life, or in the life to come. For so long haue they Christ naturally dwelling in them, &amp; they in him. And as the Father naturally dwelleth in Christ, so by Christ doth he natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dwell in vs.</p>
                  <p>And this is Hylaries mind, to tell how Christ and his father dwel na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in his faythfull members, and what vnity we haue with them (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, an vnity of nature, and not of wil onely) and not to tel how christ dwelleth in the sacrament, or in them that vnworthely receaue it, that he dwelleth in them at that time onely, when they receiue the sacrament. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And yet he sayth, that this vnity of faythfull people vnto God, is by fayth taught by the sacrament of Baptisme, &amp; of the Lords table, but wrought by Christ by the sacrament and mistery of his incarnation and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he humbled himself vnto the lowlines of our feeble nature that he might exalt vs to the dignity of his godly nature, and ioyne vs vnto his father in the nature of his eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thus is playnly declared Hylaries mind, who ment nothing lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as you say) to entreat how many diuers wayes we be one in Christ, but onely to entreat and proue that we be naturally in Christ, and Christ in vs. And this one thing he proueth by our fayth, and by the Sacrament of Baptisme, and of the Lords supper, and still he sayth aswell that we be naturally and corporally in him, as that he is naturally in vs.</p>
                  <p>And where you speak of the vnity in baptisme, and say that Hylarius <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> handleth that matter aboue some capacities howsoeuer Hilary handleth the matter, you handle it in such sort, as I thinke passeth all mens capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vnles your selfe make a large commentary therto. For what these your wordes meane <hi>(because there is but one Baptisme, and all that be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised be so regenerate in one dispensation, and do the same thing, and be one in one, they that be one by the same thing, be as he sayeth, in nature one)</hi> and what that one thing is which they do that be baptised, I think no man can tell, except you read the riddle your self.</p>
                  <p>And now to your issue. If you can shew of the words of Hylary in this place, that Christ is naturally in the Sacraments of bread and wine, or in wicked persons, or in godly perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s onely when they receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then will I confesse the issue to passe vpon your syde, that you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this Author truely, &amp; that he maketh most clearely for you against me. And if you can not shew this by Hylaries words, then must you hold vp your hand and say, Giltie.</p>
                  <p>And yet furthermore when Hylary sayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be naturally in Christ, he


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7682:102"/>
meaneth not that our bodyes be contayned within the compasse of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that we receaue his naturall eternitie. And so likewise when he sayth that Christ dwelleth naturally and carnally in vs, he meaneth not that his body is contained corporally within the compase of our mouthes or bodyes, (which you must proue by his playne wordes, if you will iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your yssue, that he speaketh most clearly for you) but he meaneth that Christ communicateth and geueth vnto vs the nature of his eternitie or euerlasting lyfe. And he dwelleth in vs by his incarnation, as S. Iohn sayth:<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Verbum caro factum est, &amp; habit auit in nobis,</hi> the word was made flesh and dwelled in vs.</q>
And as he may be sayde to dwell in vs by receauing of our mortall nature, so may we be sayd to dwell in him by receauing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his immortalitie. And neuer man found faulte (as you truely say)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> at this notable place of Hillary: nor agayne neuer learned man hitherto expounded him as you do.</p>
                  <p>And when I sayd that Christ is in vs naturally by his godhead, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> not what I sayd (as you say of me) for I playnly expounded what I ment by naturally, that is to say, not by naturall substaunce to make vs godes, but by naturall condition geuing vnto vs immortality and euerlasting life, which he had of his father, and so making vs pertakers of his godly nature, and vniting vs to his father. And if we atayne to the vnitie of his father, why not vnto the vnitie of the godhead not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall substaunce, but by naturall proprietie? As Cirill sayth that we be made the children of God and heauenly men by participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the deuine nature, as S. Peter also teacheth.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> And so be we one in the father, in the sonne, and in the holy ghost.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that we receaue Christ in the sacrament of his flesh and bloud, if we receaue him worthily: here you haue giuen good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> euidence agaynst your selfe, that we receaue him not, and that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in vs naturally, except we receaue him worthely. And therfore where you say, that there is none that writeth agaynst the truth in the sacrament, but he hath in his writinges somewhat discrepant from truth that might be a certayn marke to iudge his spirite, this is so true, that your selfe differ not onely from the truth in a nomber of places, but also from your owne sayinges.</p>
                  <p>And where you bidde me trust him no more that told me, that Hilary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> maketh no difference betwene our vnion in Christ in baptisme, and in his holy supper, it was very Hilary himselfe. of whom I lerned it, who sayth, that in both the sacramentes,<note place="margin">Mine Issue.</note> the vnion is naturall, and not in will onely. And if you will say the contrary, I must tell you the french aunswer that you would tell me. And herein I will not refuse your issue.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The aunswere to <hi>Cyrillus. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note>And this answer to Hilarius will serue also vnto Ciril, whom they alleadge to speake after the same sort that Hilarius doth, that Christ is naturally in vs. The wordes which the recite, be these. We deny not (sayth Cyril, agaynst the heretike) but we be spiritually ioyned to Christ by fayth and sincere charitie: but that we should haue no maner of coniunction in our flesh with Christ, that we vtterly deny, and think it vtterly discrepant from Godes holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For who doubteth, but Christ is so the vine tree, and we so the branches,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7682:102"/>
as we get thence our life. Heare what S. Paule sayth.
<q>We be all one body with Christ, for though we be many, we be in one in him. All we participate in one foode. <hi>Thinketh this heretike that we know not the strength and vertue of the misticall benediction? which when it is made in vs, doth it not make Christ by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his flesh to dwell corporally in vs?</hi> Why be the members of faythfull mennes bodyes called the members of Christ? Know you not (sayth S. Paule) that your members be the members of Christ?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> And shall I make the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, partes of the whores body? God forbid. And our sauiour also sayth: He that eateth my flesh and drincketh my bloud, <hi>dwelleth in me</hi>:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> and I in him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although in these wordes Cyrill doth say that Christ doth dwel corporally in vs, when we receaue the misticall benediction, yet he neyther sayth that Christ dwelleth corporally in the bread, nor that he dwelleth in vs corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only at such tymes as we receaue the sacrament, nor that he dwelleth in vs, and not we in him, but he sayth as well, that we dwell in him, as that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs. Which dwelling is neyther corporall nor locall, but an heauenly, spirituall and supernaturall dwelling, wherby so long as we dwell in him and he in vs, we haue by him euerlasting life.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> And therfore Cyril sayth in the same place, that Christ is the vine, and we the branches, bicause that by him we haue lyfe. For as the branches receaue lyfe and nourishment of the body of the vine, so receaue we by him the naturall property of his body, which is life and immortality, and by that meanes we being his members, do liue and are spiritually nourished.</p>
                  <p>And this ment Cirill by this word <hi>Corporally,</hi> when he sayth, that Christ dwelleth corporally in vs. And the same ment also S. Hilarius by this worde <hi>Naturally,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Colo. 2.</note> when he sayd, that Christ dwelleth naturally in vs. And as S. Paule, when he sayd that in Christ dwelleth the full diuinity <hi>Corporally,</hi> by this word <hi>Corporally,</hi> he ment not that the diuinity is a body, and so by that body dwelleth bodily in Christ. But by this word <hi>Corporally,</hi> he ment, that the diuinity is not in Christ, accidentally, lightly and slenderly, but substancially and perfectly with all his might and power: so that Christ was not onely a mortall man to suffer for vs, but also he was immortall God able to redeeme vs.</p>
                  <p>So S. Ciril, when he sayd that Christ is in vs <hi>Corporally,</hi> he ment that we haue him in vs, not lightly and to small effect and purpose, but that we haue him in vs substancially, pithely and effectually, in such wise that we haue by him redemption and euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And this I sucke not out of mine owne singers,<note place="margin">In Ihon lib. 4. cap. 17.</note> but haue it of Cirils owne expresse wordes, where he sayth: A litle benediction draweth the whole man to God, and filleth him with his grace, <hi>and after this manner Christ dwelleth in vs,</hi> and we in Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as for corporall eating and drinking with our mouthes, and digesting with our bodyes, Cirill neuer ment that Christ doth so dwell in vs, as he playnly declareth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Our sacrament (sayth he) doth not affirme the eating of a man, drawing wickedly christen people to haue grosse imaginations and carnall fantasies of such thinges as be fine and pure,<note place="margin">Anathematis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo 11.</note> and receaued onely with a sincere fayth.<note place="margin">In Iho. li. 4. c. 17.</note> But as two waxes, that be molten and put togither, they close so in one, that euery part of the one, is ioyned to euery part of the other, euen so (sayth Cirill) <hi>he that receaueth the flesh and bloud of the Lord, must needes be so ioyned with Christ,


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7682:103"/>
that Christ must be in him, and he in Christ.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these wordes of Cirill appeareth his mynd playnly, that we may not grossely and rudely think of the eating of Christ with our mouthes, but with our fayth, by which eating (although he be absent hence bodely, and be in the eternall life and glory with his father) yet we be made partakers of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be immortall, and haue eternall lyfe and glory with him.</p>
                  <p>And thus is declared the mind as well of Cirill as of Hilarius.</p>

I will write here the very wordes of Cirill in Greeke, as they be of Decolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius brought forth and published in his name, wherby the reader that vnderstandeth the Greeke (as many do at this tyme) may iudge of Decola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>padius conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in handling this matter.

Now let the indifferent reader iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you or I be in errour, and whether of vs both hath most neede to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himselfe of ignorance.

And wheare as I haue proued this by Cyrills owne wordes, as well in that place in his tenth booke vpon S.

A substanciall answere be you sure, and a learned. For you do here like a keper which I knew once, required to follow a sute with his hound after one that had stolen a deare, And when his hound was in his right sute and had his game fresh before him: and came nere to the house and place where the deere,

was in deed, after he had a little inkling that it was a speciall frend of his that killed the deare, and then being loth to find the sute, he plucked backe his hound, being in the right way, and appoynted him to hunt in an other place where the game was not: and so deceaued all them that followed him, as you would here doe to as many as will follow you. For you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to bring the reader to a place, where he shall finde the meaning of this word (corporally) and when he commeth to the place where you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt, the word is spoken of there, but the meaning therof is not declared, neither by you nor by Cirill, in that place: And so the reader by your fayre promise is brought from the place, where the game is truely in deed, and brought to an other place, where he is vtterly disapoynted of that he sought for.</p>

                  <p>Neuerthelesse Cirill meaneth no more by these wordes, but that Christ is vnited vnto vs two manner of wayes, by his body and by his spirite.

                  <p>But to geue you all the aduantage that may be, I will graunt for your pleasure, that by the misticall benediction Cirill vnderstoode the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christes flesh and bloud (as you say) and that Christ is therby v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited corporally, vnto vs. Yet sayth not Cirill that this vnity is onely when we receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to all that receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being renued to a new life, be made partakers of the diuine nature, which nature Cirill himselfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vi. chapiter of Iohn, declareth to be life. But he speaketh not one word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corporall presence of Christ in the fourmes of bread and wine, nor no more doth Hilary. And therfore I may well approue that I sayd, that the answer made vnto Hilary, will very well also serue for Cirill. And yet neyther of them both hath one word, that serueth for your purpose, that Christes flesh and bloud should be in the sacrament vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And where you say that Christ vniteth himselfe to vs as man, when he geueth his body in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to such as worthely receaue it, if you will speake as Cirill and other old authors vse to do, Christ did vnite himselfe to vs as man at his incarnation.

But if you meane playnly, speake playnly, whether Christes body being in the sacrament vnder the fourmes of bread and wine, haue head, feete, armes, legges, backe and bely, eyes, eares and mouth, distinct and in due order and proportion? Which if he lacke, the simplest man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knoweth, that it can not be a perfect corporall mans body, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an imaginatiue or phantasticall body, as Martion and Uale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyne taught it to be. Expresse here fully and playnly, what manner of body you call this corporall body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And where you say that I alleadge Cirill to deny in wordes the eating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of a man, and to affirme the receauing in this sacrament to be onely by fayth, and yet it shall appeare by further discussing (say you) that Cirill sayth not so. If you had not rubbed shame out of your forehed, you would not haue sayd, that he sayth not so, and be taken with so manifest an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. For although you like a Gramarian, ruffle in your cases, Genders, numbers, and persons, (and in matters of no learning trouble the reader to shew your selfe learned) corrupting the Greeke, Latin and English, to draw them to your purpose, yet shall you neuer proue that Cirill speaketh of any other eating of Christ, but by fayth.</p>
                  <p>And to make the matter playne (which it semeth you yet vnderstand not) I shall shortly reherse, as well the argument of Nestorius, as the answer of Cirill. Nestorius the hereticke sayd,<note place="margin">Nestorius.</note> that Christ was but a pure man, and not God, and that he had but a common body such as other men haue, wherunto the Godhead was onely assistant, as it is to other men. And to proue the same, he alleadged Christes owne wordes, when he sayd, He that eateth my flesh &amp;c. and he that eateth me, and as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing father sent me.<note place="margin">Ihon. 6.</note> And forasmuch as Christ sayd, that he had flesh, and was eaten and sent, and God cannot be eaten nor sent (sayd Nestorius) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded he, that Christ was not God, but man, whose flesh might be eaten and sent: whose grosse argumentation Cirill confuting sayth, that by his rude reasoning of eating, he draweth mens mindes wickedly to phansy of the eating of mans flesh (meaning of the eating therof with tooth and mouth) and so to imagine carnally and grosely such thinges, of Christ, as be vnderstand to be donne with an onely and pure fayth. And as Nestorius made his argument of the eating of mans flesh, euen so did Cirill make his answer of the eating of the same, and not of the commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof. For vnto what purpose should commixtion serue in that place and wherunto should Christes body be commixted? Or why should Cirill charge Nestorius with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixtion in Christ, seeing that he was charged with the cleane contrary (as you say) that he seperated the natures in Christ, and did not confound and commixt them? And furthermore, if Nestorius had made his argument of the eating, and Cirill had made his answere of the commixtion, they had fowghten <hi>Andabatarum more</hi> (as the prouerbe sayth) like two blind men, that when the one striketh in one

And because it is a worke supernaturall, and a great miracle, this Emissen represseth mans carnall reason, and socoureth the weke fayth, with remembraunce of like power of God in the creation of this world, which were brought forth out of tyme by Emissene, if Christes bodye were not in substaunce present, as Emissenes wordes bee, but in figure onely as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this author teacheth.<note place="margin">Onely.</note> And where this authour coupleth together the two Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Baptisme, and of the body and bloud of Christ, as though there were no difference in the presence of Christ in eyther, he putteth himselfe in daunger to be reproued of malice or ignoraunce. For although these misteries be both great, and mans regeneration in baptisme is also a mistery, and the secret worke of God, and hath a great meruayle in that effect, yet it differeth from the mistery of the sacrament, touching the maner of Christes presence, and the working of the effect also. For in


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7682:107"/>
baptisme, our vnion with Christ is wrought, without the reall presence of Christes humanitie, onely in the vertue and effect of Christes bloud, the whole Trinitie there working as author, in whose name the sacrament is expressely ministred, where our soule is regenerate and made spirituall, but not our body indede, but in hope onely that for the spirit of Christ dwelling in vs, our mortall bodyes shalbe resuscitate, and as we haue in baptisme bene buried with christ, so we be assured to be partakers of his resurection. And so in this sacrament we be vnite to Christes manhod by this deuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. But in the sacrament of Christes body and bloud, we be in nature vnited to Christ as man, and by his glorified flesh made partakers also of his diuinitie, which mistical vnion representeth vnto vs the high estate of our glorification, wherin body and soule shall in the generall resurection, by a maruailous regeneration of the body, be made both spirituall, the speciall pledge wherof, we receaue in this sacrament, and therfore it is the sacrament (as Hilary sayth) of perfect vnitie. And albeit the soule of man be more precious then the body, and the nature of the godhead in Christ more excellent then the nature of man in him glorified, and in baptisme mans soule is regenerate in the vertue and effect of Christes passion and bloud, Christes godhead present there without the reall presence of his humanitie, although for these respectes the excelency of baptisme is great: yet bicause the mistery of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the alter, where Christ is present both man and God in the effectuall vnitie, that is wrought betwene our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, our soules and Christes in the vse of this sacrament, signifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies in the generall resurection, which shall be the end and consumatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all our felicitie. This sacrament of perfect vnitie is the mistery of our perfect estate, when body and soule shalbe all spirituall, and hath so a degre of excelencie, for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that is estemed in euery end and perfection, wherfore the word (spirituall) is a necessary word in this sacrament, to call it a spirituall foode,<note place="margin">Spirituall.</note> as it is indede, for it is to worke in our bodyes a spirituall effect, not onely in our soules: and Christes body and flesh is a spirituall body and flesh, and yet a true body and very flesh. And it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in this sacrament after a spirituall maner,<note place="margin">Spirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> graunted and taught of all true tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, which we should receaue also spiritually,<note place="margin">Spiritually.</note> which is by hauing Christ before spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually in vs to receaue it so worthely. Wherfore, like as in the inuisible substance of the sacrament there is nothing carnall but all spirituall, taking the word carnall, as it signifieth grossely in mans carnall iudgement: So where the receiuers of that foode bring carnall lustes or desires, carnall fansies or imaginations with them, they receaue the same preciens foode vnworthely to their iudgement and condemnation. For they iudge not truely after the simplicitie of a true Christian fayth, of the very presence of Christes body. And this sufficeth to wipe out that this Author hath spoken of Emissen agaynst the truth.</p>

For when you haue recited these wordes of Emissene, that the inuisible priest by the secret power with his word, tourneth the visible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures into the substaunce of his body and bloud, and so further as serueth to your affection, when you come euen to the very place where Emissen de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clareth these words, there you leaue and cut of your writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But because the reader may know, what you haue cut of, and thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> know Emissens meaning, I shall here rehearse Emisenes words, which you haue left out. If thou wilt know (sayth Emissene) how it ought not to seeme to thee a thing new and impossible, that earthly and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things be tourned into the substance of Christ, looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy self which art made new in baptisme. When thou wast far from life, and banished as a stranger from mercy, and from the way of saluation, and inwardly wast dead, yet sodenly thou beganst an other new life in Christ, and wast made new by holesome misteries, and wast tourned into the bodye of the church, not by seing, but by beleuing, &amp; of the child of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by a secret purenes thou wast made the sonne of God. Thou visibly didst remayne in the same measure that thou haddest before, but inuisibly thou wast made greater, without any encrease of thy body. Thou wast the self same person and yet by encrease of fayth thou wast made an other man. Outwardly nothing was added, but all the change was inwardly. And so was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made the sonne of Christ, and Christ formed in the mind of man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as thou putting away thy former vilenes diddest receiue a new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not feling any chaunge in thy body, and as the curing of thy disease, the putting away of thine infection, the wiping away of thy filthines, be not seene with thine eyes, but beleued in thy minde: so likewise when thou doost goe vp to the reuerend aulter to feed vpon the spirituall meat, in thy fayth, looke vpon the body and blud of him that is thy God, honour hym, touch him with thy minde, take him in the hand of thy hart, and chiefly drink him with the draught of thy inward man.</q> These be Emissens own wordes. Upon which words I gather his meaning in his former words by you alleadged. For where you bring in these wordes, that Christ by his secret power with his word turneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> visible creatures into the substance of his body and bloud, straightwaies in these wordes by me now rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he sheweth what maner of turning that is, &amp; after what maner the earthly and corruptible things be turned into the substance of Christ, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so (saith he) as it is in baptisme, wherin is no Transubstantiation. So that I gather his meaning of his own playne words, and you gather his meaning of your own imagination, deuisyng such phantasticall things, as neither Emissen sayth, nor yet be catholike.</p>

In which thinges you make difference betweene baptisme and the sacrament (as you call it) of the aultare. Or what man that were learned in gods word would affirme, that in the general resurrection our bodies and soules shalbe all spirituall? I know that S. Paule sayth, that in the resurrection our bodies shalbe spirituall,<note place="margin">Spirituall.</note> meaning in the respect of such vilenes, filthines, sinne, and corruption, as we be subiect vnto in this miserable world. Yet he sayth not that our bodies shalbe all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all. For not withstanding such spiritualnes as S. Paule speaketh of, we shall haue all such substantiall partes and members, as pertaine to a very naturall mans body. So that in this part our bodyes shall be carnall, cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall, reall, and naturall bodies, lacking nothing that belongeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mens bodies. And in the respect is the body of Christ also, carnall and not spirituall. And yet we bring none other carnall imaginations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body, nor, meane none other, but that Christes body is carnall in this respect, that it hath the same flesh and naturall substaunce which was borne of the virgine Mary, and wherin he suffered and rose agayne, and now sitteth at the right hand of his father in glory, and that the same his naturall body now glorified, hath all the naturall partes of a mans body in order, proportion &amp; place distinct, as our bodies shalbe in these respects carnall after our resurrection. Which maner of carnalnes and diuersitie of partes and members, if you take away now from Christ in heauen, &amp; from vs after our resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you make Christ now to haue no true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body but a phantasticall body, as Martion &amp; Ualentine did: &amp; as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our bodies, you run into the error of Origen, which phansied &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that at the resurrection all things should be so spiritual, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should be turned into men, and bodies into soules.</p>
                  <p>And yet it is to be noted by the way, that in your aunswere here to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missene, you make spiriturally, and a spirituall manner all one.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth myne aunswere to S. Ambrose in this wise.</p>

                  <p>So that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the authors, before those wordes be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do take the bread and wine but as other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread and wine, but after those wordes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then they take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for consecrated &amp; holy bread &amp; wine.</p>
                  <p>Not that the bread and wine can be partakers of any holines or godlinesse, or can be the body and bloud of Christ, but that they represent the very body and bloud of Christ, and the holy foode and nourishment, which we haue by him. And so they be called by the names of the body and bloud of Christ, as the signe, token and figure is called by the name of the very thing, which it sheweth and signifieth,</p>
                  <p>And therfore as S. Ambrose in the wordes before cited by the aduersaries saith, that before the consecration, it is bread, and after the consecration it is Christes body, so in other places he doth more playnly set forth his meaning saying these wordes:<note place="margin">De his qui mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And as the bread is a corporall meat, and corporally eaten, so sayth S.

And this author himselfe expoundeth S. Cyprian in the. 35. leafe of this booke, how the diuinity is poured into the bread Sacramentally, which is a straunge phrase not expressing there Cyprians minde, and far discrepant from the doctrine here.</p>
                  <p>And in an other place this author saith,<note place="margin">Fol. 86. pa. 2.</note> that as hote and burning yron is yron still, &amp; yet hath the force of fyre: so the bread &amp; wine be turned into the vertue of Christs flesh and bloud. By which similitude bread may conceyue vertue, as yron conceyueth fyre, &amp; then as we cal yron burning and fyry, so we may call bread vertuous and holy vnles the author would agayn resemble bread to a whetstone that may make sharp and haue no sharpenee in it at all. Which matter I declare thus, to shew that as this author dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth from truth in other, so be dissenteth from that he vttereth for truth himselfe, and walketh in a maze, impugning the very truth in this sacrament, and would haue that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>taken for a Catholick doctrine that is not one, and the same doctrine through this whole booke so farre of is it from the whol of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teaching. But now let vs consider what speches of S. Ambrose this author bringeth forth, wherewith to alter the truth of the very playne proper speech of S. Ambrose saying: It is bread before the consecration, &amp; after it is Christes body.</p>
                  <p>S. Ambrose as this author saith in an other place sayth thus: Before the Benediction of the heauenly words, it is called an other kind of thing, but after the consecration is signifyed the body and bloud of Christ. And an other speach thus. Before the consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is called an other thing, but after the consecration it is named the bloud of Christ and yet a third speech where the word (call) is vsed before and after both, as thou reader maist sée in this authors booke in the 83. leafe. Now good reader, was there euer man so ouersene as this author is, who seeth not S. Ambrose in these thre latter speaches to speake as playnely as in the first. For in the last speach S, Ambrose saith, it is called bread before the consecration and called the body of Christ after the consecration. And I would demaund of this author, doth not this word (call) signify the truth that is bread in deed before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration? which if it be so, why shal not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same word (cal) signify al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the very truth added to the wordes of the body of Christ after the consecration? And likewise when he sayth, speaking of the body of Christ the word (signified) or (named) which is as much as (call). The body of Christ is signifyed there, for Christ sayd this is my body. &amp;c. vsyng the outward signes of the visible creatures to signify the body &amp; bloud present,<note place="margin">Luc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7682:110"/>
what he ment by (calling) he putteth that word (call) to the bread, before the consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aswell as to the body of Christ after the consecration, thereby to declare how in his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the word (call) signifieth as much truth in the thing where unto it is added after consecration as before, and therfore as it is by S.

As touching the spirituality of the meat of Christes body, I haue spoken before, but where this author addeth it requireth no cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall presence, he speaketh in his dreame beyng oppressed with slepe of ignorance and can not tell what (corporall) meaneth as I haue opened before by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority of Cyril.

                  <p>IT is not I that wrastle with S.

Ambrose,<note place="margin">Whether breade be Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> It is bread before consecration, and after it is Christes body? These words of S. Ambrose be not fully so playne as you pretend, but cleane contrary. For what can be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther more vnplayn or vntrue, then to say of bread after consecration, that it is the bodye of Christ, vnles the same be vnderstand in a figuratiue spech? For although Christes bodye (as you say) be there after consecration, yet the bread is not his body, nor his body is not made of itby your confession. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the saying of S. Ambrose that it is Christes body can not be true in playne spech. And therfore S. Ambrose in the same place, where he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the body and bloud of Christ, he sayth it is a figure of his body and bloud. For these be his words, <hi>Quod ex figura corporis &amp; sanguinis domini nostri Iesu Christs,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the word (consecration) I haue declared the signification <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> therof, according to the mind of the old authors, as I will iustify.</p>
                  <p>And for the writing of Melancthon to Decolampadius, you remayne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> still in your old error,<note place="margin">A sacramentall change.</note> taking Myconius for Decolampadius. And yet the change of bread and wine in this sacrament (which Melancthon spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of) is a sacramental change (as the nature of a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t requireth) signifying how wonderfully almighty God by his omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy worketh in vs his liuely members, and not in the dead creatures of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>And the chaunge is in the vse, and not in the elements kept and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wherein is not the perfection of a sacrament. Therefore as water in the fonte or vessell, hath not the reason and nature of a sacrament, but when it is put to the vse of christening, and then it is changed into the proper nature and kinde of a sacrament, to signifye the wonderfull chaunge which almighty God by his omnipotency worketh really in them that be baptised therewith, such is the chaunge of the breade and wine in the Lordes supper. And therefore the bread is called Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye after consecration (as S. Ambrose sayth) and yet it is not so really but sacramentally. For it is neither Christes misticall body (for that is the congregation of the faythfull dispersed abroad in the world) nor hys naturall bodye (for that is in heauen) but it is the sacrament both of his


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7682:110"/>
true naturall body, and also of his misticall body, and for that considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the name of his body, as a sacrament or signe may beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the very thing that is signified and represented therby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And as for the foresayd books intituled to S. Ambrose, if I ioyned Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brose with Clement, &amp; should say that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd bookes intiuled in the name of S. Ambrose <hi>de sacramentis, &amp; de misterijs iniciandis</hi> were none of his, I should say but as I thinke, and as they do thinke that be men of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learning and iudgement, as I declared in my second book, which speaketh of transubstantiation. And so dooth iudge not onely Erasmus, but also Melancthon (whom you alleadge for authority when he maketh for your purpose) suspecteth the same. And yet I playnly denye not these bookes to be his (for your pleasure to geue you asmuch aduauntage, as you can aske) and yet it auaileth you nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> But here I cannot passeouer, that you be offended, because I say, that bread &amp; wine be called holy,<note place="margin">Holy bread.</note> when they be put to an holy vse, not that they haue any holines in them, or be partakers of any holinesse or godlines. I would fayne learn of Smith and you, when the bread and wine be holy. For before they be holowed or consecrated they be not holy by your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but be common bakers bread, and wine of the tauerne. And after the consecration, there is neyther bread nor wine (as you teach,) at what tyme then should the bread and wine be holy? But the creatures of bread and wine be much bound vnto you, and can no lesse do, then take you for their sauior. For if you can make them holy and godly, then shall you glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them, and so bryng them to eternall blisse. And then may you aswell saue the true laboring bullocks and innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shepe and lambes, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the prophet, <hi>Homines &amp; iumenta saluabis domine.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But to admonish the reader (say you) how the bread and wine haue no holynes, this fortune of spech not vnderstand of the people, engendreth some scruple that nedeth not. By which your saying I cannot tel what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people may vnderstand, but that you haue a great scruple that you haue lost your holy bread. And yet S. Paule speaketh not of your holy bread as you imagine being vtterly ignoraunt (as appeareth) in the scripture, but he speaketh generally of all manner of meates, which christian people receaue with thankes giuing vnto God, whether it be bread wine or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fish, flesh, white meat, herbes, or what manner of meat and drinck so euer it be.</p>
                  <p>And the sanctified bread, which S. Augustine writeth,<note place="margin">August. de pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum meritis &amp; remiss. 26. li. 2 cap. 26.</note> to be geuen to them that be catechised, was not holy in it selfe, but was called holy for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse and signification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> And I expresse S. Cyprians minde truely, and not a whit discrepant from my doctrine here, when I say, that the diuinitye may be sayd to bee powred or put sacramentally into the bread,<note place="margin">Cyprianus.</note> as the spirite of God is sayd to be in the water of baptisme, when it is truely ministred, or in his word when it is syncerely preached, with the holy spirite working mightely in the hartes of the hearers. And yet the water in it selfe is but a visible ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the preachers word of it self is but a sound in the ayre, which as soone as it is hard, vanisheth away, and hath in it selfe no holines at all, although for the vse &amp; ministery therof, it may be called holy. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise may be sayd of the sacramentes, which (as S. Augustine sayth) be


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7682:111"/>
as it were Gods visible word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Holy bread.</note>And whereas you reherse out of my wordes in an other place, that as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> hoat and burning yron is yron still, &amp; yet hath the force of fyre, so the bread and wine be tourned into the vertue of Christes flesh and bloud: you ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther report my words truly nor vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truely. For I declare in my booke, vertue to be in them, that godly receaue bread and wine, and not in the bread and wine.

                     </gap>, after which sence we say, that there is vertue in herbs, in words and in stones) and not to signify vertue in holynes (which in greek is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, wher of a person is called vertuous, whose fayth and conuersation is godly. But you sophistically and fraudulently do of purpose abuse the word ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to an other significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then I me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to approue by my words your own vayne error, that bread should be vertuous &amp; holy, making in your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a fallax or craft, called equiuocation. For where my meaning is, that the death of Christ and the effusion of his bloud haue effect and strength in them that truely receaue the sacrament of his flesh and bloud, you turne the matter quite, as though I should say, that the bread were godly and vertuous, which is very frantick and vngodly opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and nothing pertai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning to mine application of the similitude of yron. But this is the mother of many errors, both in interpretation of scriptures, and also in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng of old auncient writers when the mind and intent of him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a similitude is not considered. But the similitude is applied vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters then the meaning was. Which fault may be iustly noted in you here, when you reason by the similitude of hoat burning yron, that bread may conceiue such vertue as it may be called vertuous and holy. For my onely purpose was by that similitude to teach, that yron remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his proper nature &amp; substance by conceauing of fire may work an other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the nature of yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so likewise bread remaynyng in is proper nature and substaunce in the ministration of the sacrament, hath an other vse, then to feed the body. For it is a memoriall of Christes death, that by exercise of our fayth, our soules may receaue the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly food. But this is a strange maner of spech (which neither scripture nor approued author euer vsed before you) to cal the sacrametal bread ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as you doe. But into such absurdities men do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly fall, when they will of purpose impugne the euident truth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But was there euer any man so ouersene (say you) as this author is? Who seeth not S. Ambrose in these three latter speeches to speak as plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly as in the first? Was there euer any man so destitute of reason (say I) but that he vnderstandeth this, that when bread is balled bread, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the proper name as it is in deed:<note place="margin">Bread is bread, is a playne speache.</note> and when bread is called the body of Christ, it taketh the name of a thing, which it is not in deed, but is so cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led by a figuratiue spech.<note place="margin">Bread is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body, is a figuratiue speache.</note> And calling, say you, in the words of Christ, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth making, which if it signifieth when bread is called bread, then were calling of bread, a making of bread. And thus is aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your demaund, why this word (call) in the one signifieth the trueth, and in the other not, because that the one is a playne speche and the other a figuratiue. For els by our reasoning out of reason, when the cup which Christ vsed in his last supper, was called a cup, and when

                  <p>And therfore doth he so often say that we receaue Christ in baptisme.

                  <p>This author noteth in Chrisostome two places,<note place="margin">Chrisostom.</note> and bringeth them forth: and in handling the first place, declareth himselfe to trifle in so great a matter, euidently to his owne reprofe. For where in the second booke of his worke, entreating transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, he would the same wordes of Chrisostome by this forme of spech in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue should not deny precisely. And when Chrisostome sayth, Do not think that you by man receiue the body of God, but that we should not consider man in the receiuing of it. Here this author doth alleage these wordes, and reasoneth of them as though they were termes of mere deniall. But I would aske of this author this question, If Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes fayth had bene that we receaue not the body of God in the Sacrament verily, why should he vse wordes idlely to entreate, of whom we receiued the body of God, which after this authors doctrine we receaue not at all but in figure? and no body at all which is of Christes humanity being Christ, as this author teacheth spiritually, that is, by his diuine nature in him onely that worthely receaueth, and in the very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he concludeth in this booke onely fyguratiuely. Turne back reader to the 36. leafe in the authors booke and read it with this, and so consyder vpon what principle here is made an <hi>(Ergo.)</hi> I will aunswere that place when I speake of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which shall be after answered to the third and fourth booke, as the naturall order of the matter requireth.</p>
                  <p>The second place of Chrisostome that this author bringeth forth, he graunteth it soundeth much agaynst him, &amp; fauoreth his aduersaryes, but with conferring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, he trusteth to alter it from the true vnderstanding. And not to expound, but confound the matter, be ioyneth in spech the sacrament of baptisme with this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (which shift this author vsed vntruely in Hylary) and would now beare in hand that the presence of Christ were none otherwise in this sacrament then in baptisme which is not so, for in this sacrament Christes humanity and godhead is really present, and in baptisme his godhead with the effectuall vertue of his bloud, in which we be washed, not requiring by scripture any reall presence therof for dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that mistery, as I haue before touched discussing the aunswere to Emissen, where as Chrisostome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this sacrament, whereof I haue before spoken, and Melancthon alleadging it to Decolampadius saith thus: The great miracle and great beneuolence of Christ is, that he sitteth aboue with his father,<note place="margin">Chrisost. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. lib. 3.</note> and is the same houre in our handes here to be embrased of vs. And therfore where this author would note the wonder of Gods worke in the Sacrament to be wonerfull for the worke and effect in man, this is one peece of trueth, but in the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, the old Fathers wonder at the worke in the Sacrament how bread is chaunged into the body of Christ, how Christ sitting in heauen God &amp; man, is also man and God in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and being worthely receiued, dwelleth in such carnally and naturally, as Hylary sayth, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally as Cyrill sayth. How this can be, no man can tell, no faythfull man should aske, and yet it is the true catholick fayth to be truely so wrought. For as Cinistene sayth: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> he that is the author of it, he is the witnes of it. And therfore I will make it an issue with this author,<note place="margin">An issue.</note> that the olde fathers speaking of the wonderfull operation of God in this Sacrament, referre it not onely to the vertue and effect of this Sacrament, nor to the vertue specially, but chiefly to the operation of God in the substaunce of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,<note place="margin">In Ioan, tractae. 26.</note> and the Sacrament selfe, for such a difference S.

For I vse not this spech, that we receaue not the body of God at all, that we receaue it but in a figure. For it is my constant fayth and beleefe, that we receaue Christ in the sacrament veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely, and this is plainely taught and set forth my book. But that (verily, as I with Chrisostome and all the olde authors take it) is not of such a sort as you would haue it. For your vnderstanding of (Uerily) is so Capernaicall,<note place="margin">Uerile.</note> so grosse, and so dul, in the perceauing of this mistery, that you thinke a man can not receaue the body of Christ verily, vnles he take him corporally in his corporall mouth, flesh, bloud, and bones, as he was borne of the virgine Mary. But it is certaine, that Chrisostome ment not, that we receaue Christes body verily after such a sort, when he sayth, Doe not thinke that you receiue by a man the body of God. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I deny onely this grosse vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, you misreport my doctrine, that I should say we receaue not Christ at all, but in a figure, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at all: wherin you vntruly and sclaundrously report me, as my whole book and doctrine can witnesse agaynst you. For my doctrine is, that the very body of Christ which was borne of the virgine Mary, and suffered for our sinnes, geuing vs lyfe by his death, the same Iesus as concerning his corporal presence, is taken from vs, and sitteth at the right hand of his father, and yet is he by fayth spiritually present with vs, and is our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall foode and nourishment, and sitteth in the middes of all them that-be gathered togither in his name. And this feding is a spirituall feedyng and an heauenly feeding, farre passing all corporall and carnall feeding, and therfore there is a true presence and a true feding indeed, and not in a figure onely, or not at all, as you most vntruely report my saying to be. This is the true vnderstanding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true presence, receiuing &amp; feding vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body and bloud of our Sauior Christ, and not as you depraue the meaning and true sence therof, that the receiuing of Christ truly and veri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receiuing corporally with the mouth corporall, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the spirituall receauing is to receaue Christ onely by his diuine nature, which thing I neuer sayd nor me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Turn I pray thee ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle reader to the 36 leaf of my booke, and note these wordes there, which I alledge out of Chrisostome. Doe not thinke (sayth he) that you receaue by a man the body of God. Then turne ouer the leafe, and in the xx, line note again my saying that in the holy communion, Christ himselfe is spiritually eaten and drunken, and nourisheth the right beleuers. Then compare those sayings with this place of this ignoraunt lawier, and thou shalt euidently perceiue, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

he wil not, or can not, or at the least he doth not vnderstand what is ment in the booke of common prayer, and in my booke also, by the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and feding vpon Christ spiritually.</p>
                  <p>But it is no maruaile, that Nicodemus and the Capernaites vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not Christ, before they be borne a new, and forsaking their papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call leauen, haue learned an other lesson of the spirite of God, then flesh &amp; bloud can teach them. Much talke the Papistes make about this belefe, that we must beleue and haue a stedfast fayth, that Christes body is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally there, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> visible formes of bread &amp; wine be: of which belefe is no mention made in the whole scripture, which teacheth vs to beleue &amp; professe, that Christ (as concerning his bodily presence) hath forsaken the world, &amp; is ascended into heauen, &amp; shall not come agayne vntill the resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all thinges that be spoken of by Prophets. But wheras in the feeding vpon Christes body and drinking of his bloud, there is no mouth and teeth can serue, but onely the inward and spirituall mouth of fayth, there the Papistes kepe silence like monkes, and speake very little. And the cause why, is flesh and bloud which so blindeth all the Nichodemes &amp; Caparnaites, that they can not vnderstand what is spirituall natiuity, spirituall circumcition, spirituall honger and thirst, and spirituall eating and drinking of the flesh and bloud of our Sauiour Christ: but they hang all together so in the letter, that they cannot enter into the kingdome of the spirit, which knowledge, if that you had, you should soone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vpon what principle my <hi>Ergo</hi> were made. And where you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the order of the bookes,<note place="margin">The order of the booke.</note> setting the carte before the horse, that is to say the iii and iiii booke before the second, saying that the naturall order of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter so requireth, here the reader may note an euident marke of all subtle Papistes, which is vnder the pretence &amp; coulour of order, to breake that order whereby the falsehead of their doctrine should best be detected and the truth brought to light. For when they perceaue a window open, wherby the light may shine in, and the truth appeare, then they busily go about to shut that window, and to draw the reader from that place to some misticall and obscure matter where more darkenes is, and les light can be sene. And when besides the darkenes of the matter, they haue by their subtle sophistry cast such a mist ouer the readers eyes, that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come blind: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dare they make him iudge, be the matter neuer so vntrue. And no meruail, for he is now beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e so blindfeld, &amp; subiect vnto them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he must say what so euer they bid him, be it neuer so much repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t truth. In such sort it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Now if you can bring good testimony for you, that the sacrament eateth Christes flesh and drincketh his bloud, and that it shall lyue for euer (which neuer had lyfe) and that Gods operation &amp; worke is more in domme creatures then in man, then I must needes and will confesse the issue to passe with you.

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:7682:114"/>These be the wordes which the papistes do cite out of Theophilus vpon the gospell of S. Mark But by this one place it appeareth euidently, eyther how negligent the Papistes be, in searching out and examining the sayinges of the authors which they alleadge for theyr purpose, on els how false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull they be, which willingly and wittingly haue made in this one place, and as it were with one breth, two loud and shamefull lyes.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that because they would geue the more authoritie to the wordes by them alleadged, they (like false poticaries that fell <hi>quid pro quo</hi>) false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the authors name, fathering such sayings vpon Theophilus Alexandrinus, an old and auncient author, which were in deed none of his wordes, but were the wordes of Theophilactus, who was many yeares after Theophilus Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus. But such hath euer bene the Papisticall subtelties, to set forth theyr owne inuentions, dreames and lyes, vnder the name of antiquitie and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authors.</p>
                  <p>The second lye or falsehod is, that they falsely the authors wordes and meaning, subuerting the truth of his doctrine. For where Theophilactus (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the catholike doctrine of auncient authors) sayth: that almighty God (condescending to our infirmitie) reserueth the kind of bread and wine, and yet turneth them into the vertue of Christes flesh and bloud: They say, that he reserueth the formes and apparaunces of bread and wine, and turneth them into the veritie of his flesh and bloud, so turning and altering kindes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to formes and apparaunces, and vertue into veritie, that of the vertue of the flesh and bloud, they make the veritie of his flesh and bloud. And thus they haue falsefied as well the name as the wordes of Theophilactus, turning veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie into playne and flatte falsitie.</p>
                  <p>But to sette forth playnly the meaning of Theophilactus in this matter. As hot and burning yron is yron still, and yet hath the force of fyer: and as the flesh of Christ still remayning flesh, geueth life as the flesh of him that is good so the sacramentall bread and wine remayne still in theyr proper kindes, and yet to them that worthely eate and drink them, they be tourned not into the corporall presence, but into the vertue of Christes flesh and bloud.</p>
                  <p>And although Theophilactus spake of the eating of the very body of Christ, and the drinking of his very bloud (and not onely of the figures of them) and of the conuersion of bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ, yet he meaneth not of a grosse, carnall, corporall and sensible conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the bread and wine, nor of a like eating and drinking of his flesh and bloud (for so not onely our stomackes would yern and our hartes abhorre to eate his flesh &amp; to drincke his bloud, but also such eating and drinking could nothing profite or auayle vs) but he spake of the celestiall and spirituall eating of Christ, and of a sacramentall conuersion of the bread, calling the bread not onely a figure, but also the body of Christ, geuing vs by these wordes to vnderstand, that in the sacrament we do not onely eat corporally the bread (which is a sacrament and figure of Christes body) but spiritually we eate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his very body, and drink his very bloud.

For that bread by the mysticall benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is transformed by the misticall wordes and presence of the holy ghost into the flesh of our lord. And it should trouble no man, that the bread is to be beleued flesh, for whilest our lord walked in flesh and recaued nourishment of bread, that bread he did eat was changed into his body, and was made like to his holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> flesh, and as it is costomably in mans feeding serued to the sustentation and increase of it, therfore the bread now also is changed into the flesh of our Lord. And how is it then that it appeareth not flesh but bread? that we should not lothe the eating of it, for if flesh did appeare, we should be vnpleasantly disposed to the communion of it. Now our lord condescending to our infirmitie, the misticall meat appeareth such to vs, as those we haue ben accustomed vnto. Hitherto I haue faythfully expressed Theophilac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wordes out of latine of Oecolampadius translation, without terming the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall poyntes of her wise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the words purport in latine, By which may appeare what was Theophilactes meaning what doctrine he geueth of the sacrament, and how his owne wordes vpon saynt Marke be to be vnderstanded, when he sayth: <hi>Speciem quide panis &amp; vim seruat, in vertutem autem carnis &amp; sanguinis transelementat</hi> (incorupting of which wordes this author maketh a great matter, when they were not alleaged for his, but as they be his (<hi>seruare speciem</hi>) may be well translate (forme and aparance) by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vpon S.

Now when this author sayth: they were not Theophilus Alexandrinus wordes, that is a large negatiue, and will be hardly proued otherwise then by addition of the authors knowledge, for any thing that he can finde, and so there shalbe no absurditie to graunt it. And thus I returne to myne issue with this author, that Theophilact himselfe hath no such meaning expressed in wordes as this author attributed vnto him, but an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contrary meaning, sauing herein I will agree with this author, that Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact ment not grossely, sensibly, &amp; carnally, as these wordes sound in carnall mennes iudgementes.

Although (sayd I) Theophilactus spake of the eating of the very body of Christ, and the drinking of his very bloud, and not onely of the figures of them (and of the conuersion of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ,) yet he meaneth not of a grosse, carnall, corporall and sensible conuersion of the bread and wine, nor of a like eating and drinking of his flesh and bloud (for so not onely our stomackes would yerne, &amp; our hartes abhorre to eate his flesh and to drink his bloud, but also such eating and drinking could nothing profite and auayle vs) but he spake of the celestiall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eating of Christ, and of a sacramentall conuersion of the bread, calling the bread not onely a figure, but also the body of Christ, geuing vs by those wordes to vnderstand, that in the sacrament we do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eate corporally the bread (which is a sacrament and figure of Christes body) but spiritually we eate also his very body, and drincke his very bloud.

For when he asketh the question, why doth not the flesh appeare? He should haue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered (say you) that the flesh is not there in deed, but the vertue of the flesh, I pray you doth not he aunswer playnly the same effect? Is not his aunswer to that question this (as you confesse your selfe) that the fourmes of bread and wine be chaunged into the vertue of the body of Christ? And what would you require more? Is not this as much to say, as the vertue of the flesh is there but not the substaunce corporally and carnally?</p>
                  <p>And yet another third errour is committed in the same sentence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one sentence should not be without three errours at the least in your translation. For wheras Theophilact hath but one accusatiue case, your put therto other two mo of your owne heade. And as you once taught Barnes, so now you would make Theophilact your scholer, to say what you would haue him. But that the truth may appeare what Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact sayd, I shall reherse his owne wordes in Greeke, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Condescendens nobis benignus Deus, speciem quidem panis et vini seruat, in potestatem autemcarnis et sanguinis transelementat.</hi> And in English they be thus much to say. The mercifull God condesending to our infermitie, conserueth still the kind of bread and wine, but turneth them into the vertue of his flesh and blou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. To this sentence you do adde of yonr owne authoritie these wordes (the bread &amp; wine) which wordes Theophilact hath not, which is an vntrue parte of him, that pretendeth to be a true interpretour. And by adding those wordes, you alter clearly the authors meaning. For wheare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authors meaning was that we should abhore to eate Christes flesh, and drincke his bloud in theyr propre forme and kind, yet almighty God hath ordeyned that in his holy supper we should receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourmes and kindes of bread and wine, and that those kindes should be tourned (vnto them that worthely receaue the same) into the vertue and effecte of Christes very flesh and bloud, although they remayne still in the same


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7682:117"/>
kynd and fourme of bread and wine. And so by him the nature and kinde of bread and wine remayne. And yet the same be tourned into the vertue of flesh and bloud. So that the word, (fourmes) is the accusatiue case, aswell to the verbe tourneth, as to the verbe conserueth, but you to make Theophilact serue your purpose, adde of your own head two other accusa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue cases, that is to say (bread and wine) besides Theophilactes words, wherin all men may consider how little you regarde the truth, that to mayntayne your vntrue doctrine once deuised by your selues, care not what vntruth you vse besides, to corrupt all doctours, making so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faultes in translation of one sentence.</p>

And then it is to be thought, that he would not alter that word (wherin all the contention standeth) without some consideration. And specially when Theophilus speaketh of the veritie of Christes body (as you say) if Theophilact had thought the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had bene there, would he haue refused the word, and changed veritie into vertue, bringing his owne fayth into suspition, and geuing occasion of errour vnto other?</p>
                  <p>And where to excuse your errour in translation, you say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wordes by you alleaged in the name of Theophilus Alexandrinus, be not Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philactes wordes, and I deny that they be Theophilus wordes, so then be they no bodies wordes, which is no detriment to my cause at all, (by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I tooke him for none of my witnes) but it is in a maner a clere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of your cause, which take him for your cheif &amp; principall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse saying that no catholike writer among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grekes, hath more playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set forth the truth of the presence of Christes body in the Sacrament, then Theophilactus hath, and here vpon you make your issue.</p>
                  <p>And yet haue I a good cause to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Theophilactes wordes, for as much as I finde them in his workes printed abrode, sauing one word which you haue vntruly corrupted, bycause that worde pleaseth you not.

                     <note place="margin">Hiero nim.</note>This Author trauayleth to aunswer S. Hierom, and to make him the easier for him to deale with, he cutteth of that followeth in the same S. Hierom, which should make the matter open and manifest, how effectually S. Hierom speaketh of the Sacrament of Christes body and bloud. There is (sayth S. Hierome) as greate difference betwene the loaues called <hi>Panes propositionis,</hi> and the body of Christ, as there is betwene the shadowe of a body and the body it selfe, and as there is betwene an image and the true thing it selfe, and betwene an example of thinges to come, and the thinges that be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>figured by them. Therfore as mekenes, pacience, sobrietie, moderation, abstinence of gayne, hospitalitie also, and liberalitie should be chiefly in a Bishop, and among all layemen an excellency in them: so there should be in him a speciall chastitie, and as I should say chastitie that is priestly, that he should not onely absteyne from vncleane worke, but also from the caste of his eye, and his mynde free from errour of thought, that should make the body of Christ. These be S. Hieroms wordes in this place. By the latter parte whreof appeareth playnly how S. Hierome meaneth of Christes body in the Sacrament, of which the loaues that were <hi>(Panes propositionis)</hi> were a shadow (as S. Hierome sayth) that bread being the image, and this the truth, that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this that was prefigured. So as if Christes body in the Sacrament should be there but figuratiuely (as this author teacheth) then were the bread of Proposition, figure of a figure, and shadow of a shadow which is ouer great an absurditie in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Therfore there can not be a more playne proofe to shew, that by S. Hieromes mynd, Christes body is verely in the Sacrament and not figuratiuely onely, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he noteth <hi>(Panes propositionis)</hi> to be the figure and the shadow of Christes body in the Sacrament. For as Tertulian sayth,<note place="margin">Tertulianus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersus Martione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lib. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Figura non esset nisi veritatis esses corpus.</hi> The other were not to be called a figure, if that, answered vnto it, wer not of truth, which is the sence of Tertulians wordes. And therfore S. Hierome could w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no other wordes haue expressed his mynde so certaynly &amp; playnly, as with these to confesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of Christes body in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And therfore regarde not reader what this author sayth: For S. Hierome affirmeth playnly Christes true body to be in the Sacrament, the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherof although S. Hierom attributeth to the minister, yet we must vnderstand him, that he taketh God for the author and worker, notwithstanding by reason of the minestry in the church, the doing is ascribed to manne as minister, bycause Christ sayd <hi>(Hoc facite)</hi> after which speach, saluation, remission of sinne, and the worke in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes is attribute to the minister, being neuerthelesse the same the propre and speciall workes of God.</p>
                  <p>And this I adde, bicause some be vniustly offended, to heare that man should make the body of Christ. And this author findth fault before at the word making, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiousely heard and reuerently spoken, should offend no man, for man is but a miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, wherin he should not glory. And Christ maketh not him selfe of the matter of bread, nor maketh him selfe so oft of bread a new body, but sitting in heauen, dooth as our inuisible Priest worke in the mistery of the visible pristhood of his church, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth present by his omnipotencie, his glorified body and bloud in this high mistery, by conuertion of the visible creatures of bread and wine, as Emissen sayth, into the same. This author of this booke (as thou reader mayst perceaue) applieth the figure of the breades called <hi>Panes propositionis,</hi> to the body of Christ to come, where as S. Hierome calleth them the figure of Christes body in the Sacrament, and therfore doth fashion his argument in this sence. If those breades that were but a figure, required so much cleanes in them that should eat them, that they might not eate of them, which a day or two before had lyen with theyr wiues: what cleanes is required in him that should make the body of Christ? Wherby thou mayst se how this author hath reserued this notable place of S. Hierom to the later ende, that thou shouldest in the ende as well as in the middest see him euidently snarled, for the better remembrance.</p>

                  <p>TO these wordes of S. Hierome I haue sufficiently aunswered in my former booke. And now to adde some thing therunto, I say that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he meaneth not that <hi>Panis Propositionis,</hi> be figures of the sacrament, but of Christes very body. And yet the same body is not onely in the sacrament figuratiuely, but it is also in the true ministration therof, spiritually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent &amp; spirituallye eaten, as in my booke I haue playnely declared. But how is it possible that <hi>Caius Vlpian</hi> or <hi>Sceuola, Batholus, Baldus</hi> or <hi>Curtius</hi> should haue knowledge what, is ment by the spirituall presence of Christ in the sacrament, and of the spirituall eating of his flesh and bloud, if they be voyde of a liuely fayth feeding and comforting theyr soules, with their owne workes and not with the breaking of the body and shedding of the bloud of our Sauiour Christ.</p>
                  <p>The meat that the Papistes liue, by is indulgences and pardons, and such other remission of sinnes, as cometh all from the Pope, which giueth no life, but infecteth and poysoneth: but the meate that the true Christian man lyueth by, is Christ him selfe, who is eaten onely by fayth, and so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is life and spirite, giuing that life that endureth and continueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. God graunt that we may learne this heauenly knowledge of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall presence, that we may spiritually taste and feede of this heauenly foode.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now where you say that there canne not be a more playne proofe to shew that Christes body is verely in the sacrament, and not figuratiuely onely, than when S. Hierome noteth <hi>Panis propositionis,</hi> to be the figure and shadow of Christes body in the sacrament. For (as Tertulian sayth) the other were not to be called a figure, if that which aunswereth to it were not of truth. Here your (for) is a playne <hi>fallax à non causa vt causa,</hi> and a wonderous subtiltie is vsed therin. For where Tertulian proueth, that Christ had here in earth a very body (which Martion denied bicause that bread was instituted to be a figure therof, and there canne bee no figure of a thing that is not, you alleadge Tertulians wordes, as though he should say, that Christes body is in the sacrament vnder the forme of bread, whereof neyther Tertulian intreated in that place, nor it is not required, that the body should be corporally where the figure is, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it should be in vayne to haue a figure when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing it selfe is present. And therfore you vntruely reporte both of S. Hierome and Tertulian. For neyther of them both do say, as you would gather of theyr wordes, that Christes body is in the sacrament really and corporally.</p>
                  <p>

And is not euery thing made of that which is tourned into it? As bread is made of Corne, wine of grapes, beare of water, hoppes and mault, and so of all thinges like? And when you haue confessed your selues so many yeares passed, that Christ is made of bread in the sacrament, what moueth you now to say, that Christ maketh not him selfe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of bread? except y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eyther you will say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the priest doth it and not Christ (which were an intollerable blaspheme) or that the truth is of such a nature that euen the very aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries therof (sometime vnwares acknowledge it, or els that force of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes constrayneth you to confesse the truth agaynst your will, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you see none other shift to escape? But if you take vpon you to defend the receaued doctrine of the Papistes, you must affirme that doctrine which they affirme, and say that bread in the Sacrament is the matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christes body is made, wherof must than nedes follow <hi>ex consequenti,</hi> that he hath from tyme to tyme a new body, made of new bread, besides the body which was incarnated, and neuer but once made, nor of none other substaunce but of his mother. So that it is but a vayne cauilation (onely to elude simple people, or to shift of the matter) to say (as you do) that Christ is not made of the breade, but is made to be present there. For than should he haue sayd, There is my body, and not, This is my body And to be present, requireth no new making: but to be present by conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, requireth a new making. As the wine that was bought at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the Cane of Galilee (if there were any such) was present with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conuertion, and so without new making: but the wine that was made of water, was present by conuertion, which could not be without new making. And so must Christes body be newly made, if it be present by corporall conuertion of the substaunce of bread, into the substaunce of it.

                        <hi>The aunswer to</hi> Damascenus de fide orth. lib. 4. cap 14.</note>But here Iohn Damascen may in no wise be passed ouer, whome for is anctoritie, the aduersaries of Christes trew naturall body, do recken as a stout champion, sufficient to defende all the whole matter alone. But neither is the authorite of Damascene so greate, that they may oppresse vs therby, nor, his wordes so playne for them, as they boast and vntruly pretende. For he is but a yong new author in the respecte of those which we haue brought in for our partie. And in diuers poyntes he varieth from the most auncient authors (if he meane as they expound him) as when he sayeth, that the bread and wine be not figures, which all the olde authors call figures: and that the bread and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> wyne consume not, nor be auoyded downward, which Origen and S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine affirme: or that they be not called the examples of Christes body after the consecration, which shall manefestly appeare false by the Lyturgy ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto S. Basyll.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer the sayd Damascene was one of the Byshop of Romes chief proctours agaynst the Emperours, and as it were his right hand, to set abroad all idolatrye by his owne hand writing. And therfore if he lost his hande (as they say he didde) he lost it by Goddes most righteous iudgemente, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they fayne and fable of the myraculous restitution of the same. And yet whatsoeuer the sayd Damescen writeth in other matters, surely in this place which the aduersaries do alleadge, he writeth spiritually and godly, although the Papists eyther of ignoraunce mistake him, or els willingly wrast him, and writh him to theyr purpose, cleane contrary to his meaning.</p>
                  <p>The sum of Damascene his doctrine in this matter is this. That as Christ being both God and man hath in him two natures, so hath he two natiuities, one eternall, and the other temporall. And so likewise we (being as it were double men, or hauing euery one of vs two men in vs, the new man and the old man, the spirituall man and the carnall man) haue a double natiuitie: One of our first carnall father Adam (by whome as by auncient inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and euerlasting damnation) and the other of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Adam, that is to say, of Christ, by whome we be made heires of celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benediction, and euerlasting glory and imortalitie.</p>
                  <p>And bicause this Adam is spirituall, therfore our generation by him must be spirituall, and our feeding must be likewise spirituall. And our spirituall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by him is playnly set forth in baptisme, and our spirituall meat and food is set forth in the holy communion and supper of the Lord. And because our sightes be so feeble that we cannot see the spirituall water wherwith we be washed in baptisme, nor the spirituall meat wherwith we be fed at the


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7682:120"/>
Lordes table. Therfore to help our infermities, and to make vs the better to see the same with a pure fayth, our sauiour Christ hath set forth the same, as it were before our eyes, by sensible signes and tokens, which we be dayly vsed and accustomed vnto.</p>
                  <p>And bycause the common custome of men, is to wash in water, therfore our spirituall regeneration in Christ, or spirituall washing in his bloud, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs in baptisme by water. Likewise our spirituall norishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Christ, is set before our eyes by bread &amp; wine, bicause they be meates and drinkes which chiefly &amp; vsually we be fedde withal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that as they feede the body, so doth Christ with his flesh &amp; bloud spiritually feed the soule.</p>
                  <p>And therfore the bread and wine be called examples of Christes flesh and bloud, and also they be called his very flesh and bloud, to signifie vnto vs, that as they feed vs carnally, so doe they admonish vs, that Christ with his flesh and bloud doth feed vs spiritually, and most truely vnto euerlasting lyfe.</p>
                  <p>And as almighty God by his most mighty word and his holy spirite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, brought forth all creatures in the beginning, and euer sithens hath preserued them: euen so by the same word and power he worketh in vs, from tyme to tyme, this meruailous spirituall generation and wonderfull spirituall nourishment and feeding, which is wrought onely by God, and is comprehended and receaued of vs by fayth.</p>
                  <p>And as bread and drincke by naturall nourishment, be chaunged into a mannes body, and yet the body is not chaunged, but is the same that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: so although the bread and wine be sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally changed into Christes body, yet his body is the same, and in the same place that it was before, that is to say, in heauen, without any alteration of the same.</p>
                  <p>And the bread and wine be not so changed into the flesh and bloud of Christ, that they be made one nature, but they remayne still distinct in nature so that the bread in it selfe is not his flesh, and the wine his bloud, but vnto them that worthely eare and drincke the bread and wine, to them the bread and wine be his flesh and bloud, that is to say, by things naturall, and which they be accustomed vnto, they be exaulted vnto things aboue nature. For the sacramentall bread and wine be not bare and naked figures, but so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and effectuous, that who soeuer worthely eateth them, eateth spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christes flesh and bloud, and hath by them euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, whosoeuer commeth to the Lordes table, must come with all humilitie, feare, reuerence, and puritie of lyfe, as to receaue not onely bread and wine, but also our sauiour Christ, both God and man, withall his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, to the reliefe and sustentation both of theyr bodyes and soules.</p>
                  <p>This is briefly the summe and true meaning of Damascene, concerning this matter.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore they that gather of him; eyther the naturall presence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body in the Sacraments of bread and wine, or the adoration of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and visible sacrament: or that after the consecration there remayneth no bread, nor wine, nor other substaunce, but onely the substaunce of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ eyther they vnderstand not Damascene, or els of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full frowardnes they will not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him: which rather seemeth to be true, by such colections as they haue vniustly gathered and noted out of him.</p>
                  <p>For although he say, that Christ is the spirituall meat, yet as in baptisme the holy ghost is not in the water, but in him that is vnfaynedly baptised: so


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7682:121"/>
Damascene ment not, that Christ is in the bread, but in him that worthely eateth the bread.</p>
                  <p>And though he say that the bread is Christes body and the wine his bloud, yet he ment not that the bread considered in it selfe, or the wine in it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not receaued, is his flesh and bloud: but to such as by vnfayned fayth worthely receaue the bread and wine, to such the bread and wine, are called by Damascene the body and bloud of Christ, bicause that such persons, through the working of the holy ghost, be so knitte and vnited spiritually to Christes flesh and bloud, and to his diuinite also, that they be fedde with them vnto euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, Damascene sayth not that the sacrament should bee worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and adored, as the Papists terme it (which is playne idolatrye) but that we must worship Christ God and man. And yet we may not worship him in bread and wine, but sittyng in heauen with his father, and being spiritually within our selues.</p>
                  <p>Nor he sayth not; that there remayneth no bread nor wine, nor none other substaunce, but only the substaunce of the body and bloud of Christ: but he sayth playnly, that as a burning coale is not wodde only, but fier and wodde ioyned together, so the bread of the Communion is not bread only, but bread ioyned to the diuinite. But those that say, that there is none other substaunce but the substaunce of the body and bloud of Christ, do not onely deny that there is bread and wine, but by force they must deny also, that there is either Christes diuinitie or his soule. For if the flesh and bloud, the soule and diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Christ be foure substances, and in the sacrament be but two of them, that is to say, his flesh and bloud, than where is his soule and diuinitie? And thus these men diuide Iesus, seperating his diuinitie from his humanitie. Of whome S. Iohn sayth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.</note> Whosoeuer deuideth Iesus, is not of God, but he is Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer these men do so separate Christes body from his members in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">In libro de dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus in Christo voluntatibus.</note> that they leaue him no mans body at all. For as Damascene sayth that the distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of members pertayne so much to the nature of mans body, that where there is no such distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no perfect mans body.</p>
                  <p>But by these papists doctrine, there is no such distinction of members in the sacrament: for either there is no head, feete, handes, armes, legges mouth, eyes, and nose at all, or els all his head, all feete, all handes, all armes, all legges, all mouth, all eyes, and all nose. And so they make of Christes body, no mans body at all.</p>
                  <p>Thus being confuted the Papists erroures, aswell concerning Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, as the real, corporal, and naturall presence of Christ in the sacrament (which were two principall poyntes purposed in the beginning of this worke) Now it is tyme some thing to speake of the third errour of the papistes, which is concerning the eating of Christes very body, and drinking of his bloud.</p>

And this will I say, Damascene, writeth so euidently in the matter, that Peter Martyr, for a shift is fayne to finde fault in his iudgement and age, and yet he is .viii.

                  <p>As for the foure substances, which this author by accompte numbreth of Christ, myght haue bene left vnreckened by tale, because amonge them that be faythfull, and vnderstand truely wher soeuer the substaunce of Christes very body is, there is also vnderstanded by concomitaunce to be present the substaunce of his soule as very man, and also of the Godhead as very God.<note place="margin">Concomitance.</note> And in the mater of the sacrament therfore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with hym that woulde haue the substaunce of bread there, it may be sayd there is in the Sacrament the onely substaunce of Christes bodye, because the worde onely thus placed, excludeth other straunge substaunces, and not the substances which without contention be knowen and confessed vnite with Christes body. And so a man may be sayd to be alone in his house, when he hath no straungers, although he hath a number of his owne men. And Erasmus noteth how the euangilest writeth Christ to haue prayed alone, and yet certayne of his disciples were there. And if in a contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on raysed, whether the father and sonne were both killed in such a field or no, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the father to haue bene onely killed there, and therupon a wager layd, should I lose, if by profe it appeared, that not onely the father, but also three or fower of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seruauntes were slayne, but the sonne escaped? And as in this speache the worde (onely) serued to exclude that was in contention, and not to reduce the number to one, no more is it in the speach that this author would reproue, and therfore neded not to haue occupyed him selfe in the matter, wherin I heard him once say in a good audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hym selfe was satisfied.

               <head>THE CONFVTATION OF the fourth booke.</head>
               <p>THus hauing perused the effect of the third booke, I will likewise peruse the fourth, and then shall follow in direct course, to speake of the matter of transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiacion. In this fourth Book the author intreateth eating and drinking of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body and bloud: And in the first part therof trauayleth to confirme his purpose, and in the second part, aunswereth as he can so his aduersaries, and so taketh accasion to speake of Adoration.</p>
               <p>His chiefe purpose is to proue that euill men receiue not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body and bloud of Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the Sacrament, which after this authors doctrine, is a very superfluous matter. For if the sacrament be onely a figure, and the body and bloud of Christ be there onely fyguratiuely, whereto should this author dispute of euill mens eating, when good menne can not eate Christ in the sacrament, bycause he is not there. For by the effect of this authors doctrine, the Sacrament is but a visible preaching by the tokens and signes of bread and wine, that in beleeuing and remembring Christes benefites, with reuoluing them in our mynde, we should in fayth feed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ spiritually, beleuing that as the bread &amp; wine feedeth &amp; nourisheth our bodies, so Christ feedeth &amp; nourisheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our soules, which be good wordes, but such as the wordes in Christes supper do not learneds, &amp; yet may be well gathered, not to limitte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mistery of the supper, but to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> spoken &amp; taught touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleuing &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring Christes benefites, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuoluing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our minde, therby to learne vs how to feed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually without the vse of the visible Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, beyng called of S. Augustine the inuisible sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">August. in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone domini in moute lib. 3.</note> wher <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in by fayth we be nourished with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, &amp; the vertus of Christes body &amp; bloud, which the true teaching of the church calleth spirituall manducation only, without which no man is to be accompted a true membre of the mysticall body of Christ. And therfore who so feedeth vpon Christ thus spiritually, must needes be a good man, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> onely good men be true members of Christes misticall body, which spirituall eating is so good a frute, as it declareth the tree necessaryly to be good, and therfore it must be and is certayne conclusion, that onely good men do eat and drincke the body and bloud of Christ spiritually, that is to say, effectually to life. So as this author shall haue of me no aduersary therin. And if this author had proued that to be the true doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine that Christes very body and bloud is not present in the visible Sacrament, then might he haue left this fourth booke vnwritten. For after his doctrine, as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good men do not eate Christes body in the Sacrament vnder the visible signes, for bycause it is not there, and then much lesse should euyll men reach it.</p>
               <p>In the Catholike teaching, all the doctrine of eating of Christ is concluded in two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> maner of eatings, one in the visible Sacrament Sacramentall, an other spirituall without the sacrament. And because in the eating of the visible Sacrament S. Paule speaketh of vnworthy, the same true teaching to open the matter more clerely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture noteth vnto vs three maner of eatinges, one spirituall onely, which onely good men do, feeding in fayth without the visible Sacrament. An other is both spirituall and Sacramentall, which also good men only do, receiuing the visible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, with a true sincere charitable fayth. The third maner of eating is Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall only, which after S.

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine noteth how Baptisme among the Christian men of Aphrike was very well called health, and the Sacrament of Christes body called lyfe, as in which God geueth helth and lyfe, if we worthely vse them. The ordinaunce of these Sacramentes is Goddes worke, the very author of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who as he is in him selfe vniforme, as S.

               <p>And in the sixt of S. Iohn sayth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.

                  <note place="margin">Oecumenius.</note> open and declare with similitudes in nature very aptly. The doue (they say) and the bèetell, shall feed both vpon one oyntment, and the beetell dye of it, and the doue strengthned by it. The diuersitie in the effect following of the diuersitie of them that eate, and not of that is eaten, which is alway one. According hereunto S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine agaynst the donatists geueth for a rule the sacramentes to be one in all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not one that receaue &amp; vse them. And therfore to knitte vp this matter for the purpose, I intend and write it, for we must consider the substance of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> sacrament of Christes body and bloud to be alwayes, as of it selfe it is by Christes ordinaunce, in the vnderstanding wherof, this author maketh variaunce, and would haue it by Christes ordinaunce but a figure, which he hath not proued, but and he had proued it, then is it in substaunce but a figure, and but a figure to good men. For it must be in substaunce one to good and bad, and so neyther to good nor bad this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is otherwise dispensed then it is truely taught to be by preaching.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if it be more then a figure, as it is in deed, and if by Christes ordinance it hath present vnder the forme of those visible signes of bread and wine, the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ, as both bene truly taught hitherto, then is the substance of the Sacrament one alwayes as the oyntment was, whether doues eate of it or beteles. And this Issue I ioyne with this author,<note place="margin">An Issue.</note> that he shall not be able by any learning to make any diuersitie in the substance of this sacrament, what soeuer diuersite follow in the effect. For the diuersitie of the effect, is occasioned in them that receaue, as before is proued. And then to answere this author. I say that onely good men eate and drinck the body and bloud of Christ spiritually, as I haue declared, but all good and euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the visible Sacrament of that substaunce, God hath ordeyned it, which in it hath no variance, but is all one to good and euill.</p>

                  <p>First after the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of my fourth booke, collected as pleaseth you, at the first dash you beginne with an vntrue report, ioyned to a subtell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte or falax, saying that my chief purpose is to proue that euill men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue not the body and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament. And hereupon you conclude, that my fourth booke is superfluouse. But of a false ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, all that be learned do know that nothing can be rightly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now mine intent and purpose in my fourth boooke is not to proue, that euill men receaue not the body and bloud of Christ in the sacrament (although that be true) but my chief purpose is to proue, that euell men eate not Christes flesh nor drincke not his bloud, neither in the sacrament nor out of the sacrament: as on the other side good men eat and drincke them both in the sacrament: and out of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And in the word (Sacrament) which is of your addition (is a subtill falax,<note place="margin">The worde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> called double vnderstanding. For when the Sacrament is called onely a figure (as you reherse) wherin the body and bloud of Christ be onely figuratiuely, there the word (Sacrament) is taken for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde signes of bread and wine. And after when you reherse that the Sacrament is a visible preaching by the tokens and signes of bread and wine, in beleuing and remembring Christes benefites, there the word (Sacrament) is taken for the whole ceremony and ministration of the Sacrament. And so when you goe about by equiuocation of the word to deceaue other men, you fall into your owne snare, and be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your selfe, in that you think you conuey the matter so craftely, that no man can espy you.</p>
                  <p>But to vtter the matter playnly without fallax or cauilation, I teach that no man can eat Christes flesh and drincke his bloud but spiritually, which forasmuch as euill men do not, although they eat the sacramentall bread vntill theyr bellyes be full, and drincke the wine vntill they be dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet eat they neither Christes flesh, nor drincke his bloud, neither in the sacrament nor without the sacrament, because they cannot be eaten and dronken but by spirite and fayth, wherof vngodly men be destitute, being nothing but world and flesh.</p>
                  <p>This therfore is the summe of my teaching in this fourth booke, that in the true ministration of the Sacrament Christ is present spiritually, and so spiritually eaten of them that be godly and spirituall. And as for the vngodly and carnall, they may eate the bread, and drincke the wine, but with Christ him selfe they haue no communion or company,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they neyther eate his flesh nor drincke his bloud, which who soeuer eateth,<note place="margin">Ihon. 6.</note> hath (as Christ sayth him selfe) life by him, as Christ hath life by his father. And to eate Christes body or drincke his bloud (sayth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine)


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7682:123"/>
is to haue life.<note place="margin">August in Iohn. tract. 26. &amp; de verbis Apost. sermon. 2.</note> For whether Christ be in the Sacrament corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (as you say) or spiritually in them that rightly beleue in him, and duely receaue the Sacrament (as I say) yet certayne it is, that there he is not eaten corporally but spiritually. For corporal eating with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth, is to chaw &amp; teare in peces with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teeth, after which maner Christes body is of no man eaten: although Nicholas the second,<note place="margin">Nicolaus secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> made such an article of the fayth, and compelled Berengatius so to professe. And therfore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ were corporally in the Sacrament, yet seeing that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be corporally eaten, this booke commeth in good place and is very necessary, to know that Christes body can not be eaten but spiritually, by beleuing and remembring Christes benefites, and reuoluing them in our mynd, beleeuing that as the bread and wine feed and nourish our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, so Christ feedeth and nourisheth our soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ought this to come out of a christian mannes mouth, That these be good wordes, but such as the wordes of christes supper do not learne vs? Do not the wordes of Christes supper learne vs to eate the breade and drinke the wine in the remembraunce of his death?<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 1. Cor. 11. 1.

Should not then christian people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording hereunto, in fayth feed vpon Christ spiritually, beleuing that as the bread &amp; wine feed and nourish theyr bodyes, so both Christ their soules with his owne flesh and bloud? And shall any Christian man now say, that these be good wordes, but such as the wordes in Christes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per do not learne vs?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And yet these sayd wordes limit not the mistery of the supper: for as much as that mistery of eating Christes flesh and drinking his bloud ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth further then the supper, and continueth so long as we be liuely membres of Christes body. For none feede nor be nourished by him, but that be liuely members of his body, and so long and no longer feede they of him, then they be his true membres, and receaue life from him. For feeding of him, is to receaue life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But this is not that inuisible sacrament which you say S. Augustin speaketh of <hi>in sermone Domini in monte,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augusti. in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo. domini in monte. lib. 2.</note> the iij booke. For he calleth there the dayly bread, which we continually pray for, eyther corporall bread and meate which is our dayly sustenaunce for the body, or els the visible sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of bread and wine, or the inuisible sacrament of gods word and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes, of the which sacramentes gods word is dayly heard, and the other is dayly seene.

And you cannot lay the fault

here in the Printer, for I haue seen it written so both by your own hand, and by the hand of your secretary.</p>
                  <p>Now when you haue wrangled in this matter as much as you can, at length you confesse the truth, that who so feedeth vpon Christ spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, must needes be a good man, (for only good men be membres of Christes misticall body) which spirituall eating is so good a frute, as it declareth the tree necessarelye to be good. And therfore it must be and is a certaine conclusion, that onely good menne doe eate and drinke the bodye and bloude of Christ spiritually, that is to say, effectually to lyfe. This you write in conclusion, and this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very doctrine that I teache, and in the same tearmes: marry, I adde therto, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the eating of Christes body is a spirituall eating, and the drinking of his bloud is a spirituall drinkyng, and therfore no euill man can eate his flesh, nor drinke his bloud, as this my forth booke teacheth, and is necessary to be writen. For although neither good nor euell men eate Christes body in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnder the visible signes, in the which he is not but sacramentally: yet the good feede of him spiritually, being inhabiting spiritually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, although corporally he be absent and in heauen: but the euell men neither feede vpon him corporally, nor spiritually (from whom he is both the sayd wayes absent) although corporally, they eate and drinke with theyr mouthes, the sacramentes of his body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Three manner of eatings.</note>Now where you note here three manner of eatinges, and yet but two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> manner of eatinges of Christ, this your noting is very true, if it be truly vnderstand. For there be in dede three maner of eatinges, one spirituall onely an other spiritual and sacramentall both together, &amp; the third sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentall only: and yet Christ him selfe is eaten but in the first two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies, as you truely teache. And for to set out this distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more playnly, that playne menne may vnderstand it, it may thus be tearmed, That there is a spirituall eating only, when Christ by a true fayth is eaten without the sacrament: Also there is an other eating both spirituall and sacramental, when the visible sacrament is eaten with the mouth, and Christ him selfe is eaten with a true fayth: The third eating is sacramentall only, when the sacrament is eaten and not Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. So that in the fyrst is Christ eaten without the sacrament: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde he is eaten with the sacrament: and in the thirde the sacrament is eaten without him: and therfore it is called sacramentall eating onely, bycause onely the sacramente is eaten, and not Christ himselfe. After the two first maner of wayes, godly men do eate (who feede and liue by Christ) the thirde manner of wayes the wicked do eate, and therfore (as S. Augustine sayth) they neither eate Christes flesh nor drinke his bloud although euery day they eat the sacrament therof,<note place="margin">August in Ioh. tract. 26.</note> to the condemnation of theyr presumption. And for this cause also S. Paule sayth not, He that eateth Christes body, and drinketh his bloud vnworthely, shall haue condemnation, and be gilty of the Lordes body: but he sayth, he that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this bread,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> and drinketh the cup of the Lord vnworthely, shalbe gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Lordes body, and eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, bycause he estemeth not the Lordes body.</p>
                  <p>And here you committe two fowle faultes. One is, that you declare S. Paule to speake of the body and bloud of Christ, when he spake of


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7682:124"/>
the bread and wine. The other fault is, that you adde to S. Paules wordes this word (there) and so buylde your worke vpon a foundation made by your owne selfe.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that if my doctrine be true, neyther good men nor euill eate but the sacramentall bread, it can be none other but very fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes and mere wilfulnes, that you will not vnderstand that thinge which I haue spoken so playnly, &amp; repeted so many tymes. For I say, that good men eat the Lordes body spiritually to theyr eternall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where as euyl men eat but the bread carnally to their eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. And as you note of S. Augustine, that baptisme is very well called health,<note place="margin">August. de pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; remiss. li. 1. cap. 24.</note> and the sacrament of Christes body called lyfe, as in which God gyueth health and lyfe, if we worthely vse them: so is the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread very well called Christes body, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine his bloud, as in the ministration wherof, Christ geueth vs his flesh and bloude, if we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely receaue them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And where you teach how the workes of God in them selues be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way true and vniforme in all men without diuersitie in good and euill,<note place="margin">The workes of God vniforme.</note> in worthy and vnworthy, you bring in this misticall matter here clearly without purpose or reason, farre passyng the capacitie of simple readers, onely to blinde their eyes withall. By which kynde of teaching it is all one worke of God to saue and to damne, to kill and to gyue lyfe, to hate and to loue, to elect and to reiect, and to be short, by this kinde of doctrine God and all his workes be one, without diuersite eyther of one worke from an other, or of his workes from his substaunce. And by this meanes it is all one worke of God in baptisme and in the Lordes supper. But all this is spoken quite besides the matter, and serueth for nothing but to cast a myst before mens eyes, as it semeth you seeke nothing els thorow your whole booke.</p>

And if the promises of God (as you say) be not disapoynted by our infidelitie, then if euyll men eate the very body of Christ and drink his bloud, they must nedes dwell in Christ, and haue Christ dwelling in them, and by him haue euerlasting lyfe: bycause of these promises of Christ, <hi>Qui man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat

And as it is one Sonne that shineth vppon the good and the badde,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> that melteth butter, and maketh the earth harde: one flower wherof the bee sucketh hony, and the spyder poyson, and one oyntment, (as Decumenius sayth) that kylleth the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll,<note place="margin">Decumenius.</note> and strengthneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doue. Neuerthelesse as all that be washed in the water be not washed with the holy spirite, so all that eate the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread, eate not the very body of Christ.

of bread and wine, do eat and drincke also with theyr mouthes Christes very flesh and bloud, be they neuer so vngodly and wicked persons. But Christ him selfe taught cleane contrary in the sixt of Iohn, that we eate not him carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our mouthes, but spiritually with our fayth, saying:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> 
                     <q>Verily verily I say vnto you: he that beleueth in me, hath euerlasting lyfe.
I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat Manna in the wildernes, and dyed. This is the bread that cam from heauen,<note place="margin">The godly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat Christ.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the most true doctrine of our sauiour Christ, that whosoeuer eateth him, shall haue euerlasting lyfe. And by and by it followeth in the same place of S. Iohn more clearly. <q>Verely verely I say vnto you, except you eat the flesh of the sonne of man, and drincke his bloud, you shall not haue life in you. <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlasting,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This taught our sauiour Christ as well his disciples as the Iewes at Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, that the eating of his flesh and drincking of his bloud was not like to the eating of Manna. For both good and bad did eate Manna, but none do eate his flesh and drincke his bloud, but they haue euerlasting lyfe. For as his father dwelleth in him, and he in his father, and so hath life by his father: so he that eateth Christes flesh and drinketh his bloud, dwelleth in Christ and, Christ in him, and by Christ he hath eternall life.</p>
                  <p>What neede we any other witnes? when Christ himselfe doth testifie the mater so playnly, that who so euer eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud, hath euerlasting life? and that to eate his flesh and to drincke his bloud, is to beleue in him? And who so euer beleueth in him, hath euerlasting lyfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth necessarily, that vngodly persons (being limmes of the deuill) do not eate Christes flesh nor drinke his bloud, except the Papistes would say, that such haue euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>But as the diuell is the food of the wicked, which he nourisheth in all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and bringeth vp into euerlasting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so is Christ the very foode of all them that be the liuely members of his body, and them he nourisheth, fedeth, bringeth vp and cherisheth vnto euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>And euery good and faythfull Christian man seleth in himselfe,<note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> how he fedeth of Christ, eating his flesh and drincking of his bloud.

And this great benefite of Christ, the faythfull man earnestly considereth in his mynd, chaweth and digesteth it with the stomake of his hart, spiritually receauing Christ wholy into him, and giuing agayne him selfe wholy vnto Christ.</p>
                  <p>And this is the eating of Christes flesh and drinking of his bloud, the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherof is to euery man, the feling how he eateth and drincketh Christ,

                     <note place="margin">Ciprianus in ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mo. de coena do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note>Cyprian in his sermon, ascribed vnto him, of the Lordes supper, sayth:
The author of this tradition sayd,<q> that except we eat his flesh &amp; drincke his bloud, we should haue no life in vs, instructing vs with a spirituall lesson, &amp; opening to vs a way to vnderstand so priuy a thing, that we should know, <hi>that the eating is our dwelling in him, and our drincking is as it were an incorporation in him,</hi> being subiect vnto him in obedience, ioyned vnto him in our willes, and vnited in our affections. <hi>The eating therfore of this flesh, is a certayne hunger and desire to dwell in him.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus writeth Cyprian of the eating and drinking of Christ'. And a litle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he sayth, that none do eate of this lambe, but such as be true Israelites, that is to say, pure christian men without colour or dissimulation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Athanasius de peccato in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um sanctum.</note>And Athanasius speaking of the eating of Christes flesh and drincking of his bloud, sayth that for this cause he made mention of his ascentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to plucke them from corporall phantasy, that they might lerne hereafter that his flesh was called the celestiall meate that came from aboue, <hi>and a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

                  <p>In these wordes Athanasius declareth the cause why Christ made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ascension into heauen, when he spake of the eating and drincking of his flesh and bloud. The cause after Athanasius mynd was this, that his hearers should not thinke of any carnal eating of his body with their mouthes (for as concerning the presence of his body) he should be taken from them, and ascend into heauen, but that they should vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him to be a spirituall meate, &amp; spiritually to be eaten, and by that refreshing to giue eternall life, which he doth to none, but to such as be his liuely members.</p>
                  <p>And of this eating speaketh also Basilius,<note place="margin">Basilius epistol. 141.</note> that we eate Christes flesh and drincke his bloud, being made by his incarnation and sensible lyfe, partakers of his word and wisedome.
<q>
                        <hi>For his flesh and bloud he calleth all his misticall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation here in his flesh and his doctrine,</hi> consisting of his whole life, pertayning both to his humanitie and diuinitie, wherby the soule is nourished and brought to the contemplation of thinges eternall.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus agreeth S. Hierom with the other before rehersed, that <q>heretikes and such as follow worldly pleasures eate not Christes flesh nor drincke his bloud, bicause that Christ sayd, He that eateth my flesh, and drincketh my bloud, hath euerlasting life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And S. Ambrose sayth, that Iesus is the bread which is the meat of sainctes and that he that taketh this bread, <hi>dyeth not a sinners death. For this bread is the remission of sinnes.</hi>

<q>This bread of life which came downe from heauen, doth minister euerlasting life, <hi>and who soeuer eateth this bread, shall not dye for euer, and is the body of Christ.</hi> And yet in an other booke set forth in his name, he sayth on this wise: He that did eate Manne dyed, <hi>but he that eateth this body, shall haue remission of his sinnes, and shall not dye for euer.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>These sentences of S. Ambrose be so playne in this matter, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no more, but onely the rehersall of them.</p>
                  <p>But S. Augustine in many places playnly discussing this matter, sayth: <hi>He that agreeth not with Christ, doth neither eate his body, nor drinke his bloud,</hi>

booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De ciuitate Dei lib. 21. Cap. 25.</note> disputing agaynst two kindes of heretikes: Wherof the one sayd, <q>that as many as were Christned, and receaued the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body and bloud, should be saued, how so euer they liued or beleeued, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Christ sayd: This is the bread that came from heauen, that who so euer shall eate therof, shall not dye. I am the bread of lyfe, which came from heauen, who so euer shall eate of this bread, shall liue for euer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore (sayd these heretikes) all such men must nedes be deliuered from eternall death, and at length be brought to eternall life. The other sayd, <hi>that heretikes and scismatikes myght eate the sacrament of Christes body, but not his very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, bycause they be no members of his body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therfore they promised not euerlasting life to all that receaued Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes baptisme and the sacrament of his body, but to all such as professed a true fayth, although they liued neuer so vngodly. For such (sayd they) do eate the body of Christ, not onely in a sacrament, but also in deede, bycause they be members of Christes body.</p>
                  <p>But S. Augustine answering to both these heresies, sayth:
<q>That neither he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, nor such as professe a true fayth in theyr mouthes, and in theyr liuing shew the contrary, haue eyther a true fayth (which worketh by charitie, and doth none euil) or are to be counted among the members of Christ. For they can not be both members of Christ and members of the deuill. <hi>Therfore</hi> (sayth he) <hi>it may not be sayd, that any of them eate the body of Christ.</hi> For when Christ sayth, he that eateth my flesh and drincketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him: He sheweth what it is (not sacramentally, <hi>but indeed</hi>) <hi>to eate his body and drincke his bloud: which is, when a man dwelleth so in Christ, that Christ dwelleth in him.</hi> For Christ spake those wordes as if he should say, <hi>He that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in me, and in whom I dwell not let him not say or thincke, that he eateth my body, or drincketh my bloud.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These be the playne wordes of S. Augustine, that such as liue vngodly, although they may seme to eate Christes body (bicause they eate the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body) yet in deed they neyther be members of his body, nor do eate his body.</p>
                  <p>Also vpon the gospell of S. Iohn he sayth,<q> that he that doth not eate his flesh and drincke his bloud, hath not in him euerlasting lyfe. And he that eateth his flesh and drincketh his bloud,<note place="margin">In Ihon. tractat. 26.</note> hath euerlasting lyfe. But it is not so in those meates, which we take to sustayne our bodyes. For although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them we cannot liue, yet it is not necessary, that who so euer receaueth them, shall liue, for they may dye by age, sicknes or other chaunces.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in this meat and drincke of the body and bloud of our Lord, it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For both they that eate and drincke them not, haue not euerlasting lyfe: <hi>And contrariwyse who so euer eate and drincke them, haue euerlasting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note and ponder well these wordes of S. Augustine, that the bread and wine and other meates &amp; drinckes (which nourish the body) a man may eate, and neuerthelesse dye: but the very body and bloud of Christ no man eateth, but that hath euerlasting life. So that wicked men can not eate nor drincke them, for then they must nedes haue by them euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>And in the same place S. Augustine sayth further. The sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the vnitie of Christes body &amp; bloud is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Lordes table, of some men to lyfe: &amp; of some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death, <hi>but the thing it selfe</hi> (wherof it is a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) <hi>is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all men to lyfe, &amp; of no man to death.</hi>
And more ouer he sayth:<q> This is to eate that meate


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7682:127"/>
and drincke that drincke, to dwell in Christ, and to haue Christ dwelling in him. And for that cause <hi>he that dwelleth not in Christ, &amp; in whome Christ dwelleth not, without doubt he eateth not spiritually his flesh nor drincketh his bloud,</hi> although carnally and visibly with his teeth, he byte the Sacrament of his body and bloud.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus writeth S. Augustine in the xxvj. homely of S. Iohn. And in the next homely following, he sayth thus.<note place="margin">In Iohn. tractat. 27.</note> 
                     <q>This day our sermon is of the body of the Lord, which he sayd he would geue to eat for eternall life. And he declared the maner of his gift and distribution, how he would geue his flesh to eate, saying: He that eateth my flesh and drincketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. <hi>This therfore is a token or knowledge, that a man hath eaten and drunken, that is to say, if he dwell in Christ, and haue Christ dwelling in him.</hi> If he cleaue so to Christ, that he is not seuered from him. This therfore Christ taught and admonished by these <hi>misticall or figuratiue wordes,</hi> that we should be in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vnder him our head among his members, eating his flesh, nor forsaking his vnitie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in his booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana.</hi> S. Augustine sayth,<note place="margin">De doctrina christiana. lib. 3.

                        <hi>The eating is to be refreshed, and the drincking what is but to liue?</hi> Eate life, drincke life: And that shall be, when that which is taken visibly in the sacrament, is in very deed eaten spiritually and dronken spiritually.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all these sentences of S. Augustine it is euident and manifest, that all men, good and euill, may with theyr mouthes visibly and sensibly eate the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Christes body and bloud, but the very body &amp; bloud them selues be not eaten but spiritually, &amp; that of the spiritual members of Christ, which dwell in Christ, &amp; haue Christ dwelling in them, by whome they be refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and haue euerlasting lyfe.</p>
                  <p>And therfore sayth S. Augustine,<note place="margin">In Ioh Tract. 59</note> that when the other Apostles did eate bread that was the Lord, <hi>yet Iudas did eate but the bread of the Lord, and not the bread that was the Lord.</hi> So that the other Apostles with the sacramentall bread did eate also Christ him selfe, whome Iudas did not eate. And a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of places moe hath S. Augustine for this purpose, which for eschewing of tediousnes, I let pas for this tyme, and will speake some thing of S. Cirill.
¶ Cyrill vpon S.

                  </p>

                        <hi>that when we eate the flesh of our sauiour, than haue we life in vs.</hi> For if thinges that were corrupt, were restored by onely touching of his clothes, <hi>how can it be, that we shall not liue that eate his flesh?</hi> And further he sayth, that as

                  </p>
                  <p>Here S. Cyrill declareth the dignitie of Christes flesh, being inseparably annexed vnto his diuinitie, saying, that it is of such force and power, that it geueth euerlasting life. And what soeuer occasion of death it findeth, or let of eternall life, it putteth out and driueth cleane away all the same, from them that eate that meate and receaue that medicine. Other medicins or playsters sometyme heale, and sometyme heale not, but this medicine is of that effect and strength, that it eateth away all rotten and dead flesh and perfectly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all woundes and sores that it is layd vnto.</p>
                  <p>This is the dignitie and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of Christes flesh and bloud, ioyned to his diuinite, of the which dignite, Christes aduersaries the Papistes, depriue and robbe him, when they affirme, that such men do eate his flesh and receaue this playster, as remayne still sicke and sore, and be not holpen therby.</p>
                  <p>Thus hast thou heard (gentle reader) the groundes and profes which moued me to write the mater of this iiii. booke, that good men onely eate Christes flesh and drincke his bloud. Now shalt thou here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late byshopes confutation of the same.</p>

                  <p>And as for the Scriptures and doctours which this author alleadgeth to proue that only good men receaue the body and bloud of Christ, I graunt it without contention <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> speaking of spirituall manducation and with liuely fayth without the Sacrament. But in the visible sacrament euell men receaue the same that good men do, for the substance of the sacrament is by godes ordinauce all one. And if this author would vse for a profe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that in the sacrament Christes very body is not present, bicause euill men receaue it, that shalbe no argument, for the good seed when it was sowen did fall in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill ground and although Christ dwelleth not in the euill man, yet he may be receaued of the euill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> man to his condemnation, bycause he receaueth him not to glorifie him as God, as S. Paule sayth <hi>(Non dijudicans corpus domini)</hi> not esteming our Lordes body. And to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that euer this author bringeth to proue, that euell men eate not the body of Christ, may be sayd shortly, that spiritually they eat it not, besides the sacrament, and in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they eate it not effectually to life, but condemnation. And that is and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a not eating. As they be sayd not to heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, that here it not profitably. And bycause the body of Christ of it selfe is ordeyned to be eaten for life, those that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely eate to condemnation, although they eate in dede, may be sayd not to eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they eate vnworthely, as a thing not well done, may be in speach called not done, in respect of the good effect wherfore it was chiefly ordered to be done. And by this rule, thou reader mayst discusse all that this author bringeth forth for this purpose, eyther out of Scriptures or doctors. For euill men eate not the body of Christ to haue any fruite by it, as euil men be sayd not to heare gods word to haue any frute by it, and yet as they heare the worde of spirite &amp; life and neuerthelesse perish, so euill men eate in the visible sacrament the body of Christ and yet perish. And as I sayd, this aunswereth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particuler sayinges of Ciprian, Athanase, Basyl, Hierome, and Ambrose.</p>
                  <p>As for S. Augustine which this author alleageth <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> the same S.

As for S. Augustine shall be hereafter more playnly declared. Finally, he that receaueth worthely the body &amp; bloud of Christ, hath euerlasting life, dwelleth in Christ and Christ in him, he that receaueth vnworthely, which can be onely in the sacrament, receaueth not lyfe, but condemnation.</p>

                  <p>IF you graunt without contention that which I do proue, then you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> must graunt absolutely and franckly without any addition, that onely good men eate and drincke the body and bloud of Christ. For so say all the scriptures and authors playnly, which I haue alleadged, without your addition of spirituall manducation: and not one of them all say as you do, that in the visible Sacrament euell men receaue the same that good men do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But I make no such vayne proofes as you fayne in my name, that in the sacrament Christes very body is not present, bycause euil men receaue it. But this argument were good (although I make no such.) Euell men eate and drincke the sacrament, and yet they eate and drincke not Christes flesh and bloud: Ergo his flesh and bloud be not really and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally in the sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And when you say that Christ may be receaued of the euel man to his condemnation, is this the glory that you geue vnto Christ, that his whole presence in a man, both with flesh, bloud, soule and spirite, shall make him neuer the better? and that Christ shalbe in him, that is a member of the deuell? And if an euill man haue Christ in him for a tyme, why may he not then haue him still dwelling in him? For if he may be in him a quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of an houre, he may be also an whole houre, and so a whole day, and an whole yeare, and so shall God and the diuell dwell together in one house. And this is the croppe that groweth of your sowing, if Christ fall in euell men, as good seed falleth in euell ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And where you say, that all that euer I bring, to proue that euell men eate not the body of Christ, may be shortly aunswered, truth it is (as you sayd in one place of me) that all that I haue brought may be shortly aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, if a man care not what he aunswer: as it seemeth you pas not much what you aunswer, so that you may lay on lode of wordes. For where as I haue fully proued as well by authoritie of scripture, as by the testimony of many olde writers, that although euell men eate the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, and drincke the wine (which haue the names of his flesh and bloud) yet they eate not Christes very flesh nor drincke his bloud: Your short and whole aunswer is this,<note place="margin">That may be sayd not done y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not well don.</note> that euell men may be sayd not to eate Christes flesh and drincke his bloud, bycause they do it not frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as they ought to do. And that may be called a not eating, as they may be sayd not to heare godes word, that heare it not profitably: and a thing not well done, may be in speach called not done, in the respect of the good effect. I graunt such speaches be sometyme vsed, but very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and when the very truth commeth in discussion, then such Paradoxes are not to be vsed. As if it come in question whether a house be builded, that is not well builded, then the diffinition of the matter must not be, that it is not builded, although the carpenters and other workemen haue fayled in theyr couenaunt and bargayne, and not builded the house in such sort as they ought to haue done. So our sauiour Christ teacheth that all heard the word,<note place="margin">Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore when this matter cometh in discussion among the old writers, whether euell menne eate Christes body or no, if the truth had bene that euill men eate it, the


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7682:129"/>
olde writers would not so precisely haue defined the contrary, that they eate not, but would haue sayd they eate it, but not effectually, not frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, not profitably. But now the authors which I haue alleaged, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine playnly and absolutely, that euell men eate not Christes body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other addition. But after this sort that you do vse, it shall be an easy matter for euery man to say what liketh him, and to defend it well inough, if he may adde to the scriptures and doctours wordes at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and make the sense after his owne phantasye. The scriptures and Doctoures which I alleadge, do say in playne wordes (as I do say) that euell menne do not eate the body of Christ nor drincke his bloud, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that haue life therby.</p>
                  <p>Now come you in with your addition and glose, made of your owne head, putting therto this word (effectually.) Yf I should say that Christ was neuer conceaued nor borne, could not I auoyd all the scriptures that you can bring to the contrary, by adding this word (apparantly) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my saying stoutly? And might not the Ualentinians, Marcianistes and other that sayd that Christ dyed not for vs, defend their errour with addition (as they did,) of this word (putatiue) to all the scriptures that were brought agaynst them? And wat herisie can be reproued, if the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes may haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberty that you do vse, to adde of their owne heades to the wordes of scripture?<note place="margin">Deu. 12.</note> contrary vnto Godes word directly, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs to adde nothing to his word, nor to take any thing away.</p>
                  <p>And yet more ouer, the authorities which I haue brought to approue my doctrine, do clerely cast away your addition, adding the cause why euell men can not eate Christes flesh nor drincke his bloud. And you haue taught almost in the beginning of your booke, that Christes body is but a spirituall body, and after a spirituall manner eaten by fayth. And now you haue confessed, that who so fedeth vpon Christ spiritually, must nedes be a good man. How can you than defend now, that euell men eat the body of Christ? except you will now deny that which you graunted in the beginning (and now haue forgotten it) that Christes body cannot be eaten but after a spirituall maner by fayth? Wherin it is meruayle, that you hauing so good a memory, should forgette the common prouerbe, <hi>Mendacem memorem esse oportet.</hi>

                  <p>And it had ben more conuenient for you to haue answered fully to Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Athanasius, Basyll, Hierom and Ambrose, then when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer, to wipe your handes of them with this slender answer, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you haue answered.

Than come you to my questions wherin I write thus.</p>
                  <p>And now for corroboration of Cyrils saying,<note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> I would thus reason with the Papistes, and demaund of them: Whan an vnrepentant sinner receaueth the sacrament, whether he haue Christes body within him or no?</p>
                  <p>If they say no, than haue I my purpose, that euell men although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the sacrament of Christes body, yet receaue they not his very body. If they say yea, Than I would aske them further, Whether they haue Christes spirite within them or no?</p>
                  <p>If they say nay, than do they separate Christes body from his spirite, and his humanitie from his diuinitie, and be condemned by the Scripture as very Antichristes, that diuide Christ.</p>
                  <p>And if they say yea, that a wicked man hath Christes spirit in him, then the scripture also condemneth them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> saying:
<q>that as he which hath not the spirite of Christ, is none of his, <hi>so he that hath Christ in him, lyueth bycause he is iustified:</hi> And if his spirite that raysed Iesus from death, dwell in you, he that raysed Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus from death, <hi>shall geue life to your mortall bodies, for his spirites sake, which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus on euery side the scripture condemneth the aduersaries of gods word.</p>
                  <p>And this wickednes of the Papistes is to be wondred at, that they affirme Christes flesh, bloud, soule, holy spirite, and his deitie to be in a man, that is subiect to sinne and a lim of the deuill, They be wonderful iuglers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers, that with certayne wordes can make God and the diuell to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one man, and make him both the temple of God, and the temple of the Deuill.

                  <p>But to encounter directly with this author, where he opposeth by interogation, and would be answered, whether an vnrepentant sinner that receaueth the sacrament, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hath Christes body within him or no. Marke reader this question, which declareth that this author talketh of the sacrament, not as him selfe teacheth, but as the true teaching is although he meane otherwise, for els how could an vnrepentant sinner receaue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body, but onely in the sacrament vnworthely? and how could he receaue it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and it were not there? but to answer to this question, I answer no: for it foloweth not he receaued him, <hi>(ergo)</hi> he hath him in him, for the vessel being not meet, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, because he was a sinner, in whom he dwelleth not. And where this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor now become a questionist, maketh two questions, of Christes body, and his spirite, as though Christes body myght be deuided from his spirite, he supposeth other to be as ignoraunt as him selfe. For the learned man will aunswere, that an euell man by force of Gods ordinance, in the substance of the sacrament receaued in deed Christes very body there present, whole Christ God and man, but he taried not, nor dwelled not, nor


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7682:130"/>
fructified not in him, nor Christes spirite entered not into that mannes soule bycause of the malice and vnworthines of him that receaued. For Christ will not dwell with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall nor abide with sinners. And what hath this author won now by his forked questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? wherin he seemeth to glory as though he had imbrased an absurditie that he hunted for, wherin he sheweth onely his ignoraunce, who putteth no difference betwene the entring of Christ into an euell man by Gods ordinance in the sacrament, and the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Christes spirite in an euell man, which by scripture can not be, ne is by any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike man affirmed. For S. Paule sayth: In him that receaueth vnworthely remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> iudgement and condemnation. And yet S. Paules wordes playnly import that those dyd eate the very body of Christ which dyd eate vnworthely, and therfore were gilty of the body and bloud of Christ. Now reader consider what is before written, and thou shalt easely see, what a fond conclusion this author gathereth in the xcvii. leafe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as though the teaching were that the same man should be both the temple of God, and the temple of the deuell, with other termes, wherewith it liketh this author to refresh himselfe, and fayneth an aduersary, such as he would haue, but hath none, for no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike man teacheth so, nor it is not all one to receaue Christ, &amp; to haue Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him. And a figure therof was in Christes conuersation vppon earth, who tarieth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not with all that receaued him in outward apparaunce: and there is noted a difference that some beleued in Christ, and yet Christ committed not him selfe to them. And the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> gospell prayseth them that heare the word of God and keep it, signifiing many to haue the word of god, and not to keep it, as they that receaue Christ by his ordinaunce in the sacrament, and yet bycause they receaue him not, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> entent of his ordinance worthely, they are so much the worse therby through theyr owne malice. And therfore to conclude this place with the author, who soeuer eateth Christes flesh and drincketh his bloud, hath euerlasting lyfe, with S.

And although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it followeth not, he receaued Christ, eego he hath him in him: yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth necessarily, he receaueth him, ergo he hath him within him, for the tyme of the receipt: As a bottomleffe vessell, although it keepe no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, yet for the tyme of the receauing, it hath the licour in it. And how can Christ departe from an vnpenitent sinner (as you say he doeth) if he haue him not at all? And because of myne ignoraunce, I would fayne leran of you (that take vpon you to be a man of knowledge) how an euill man receauing Christes very body, and whole Christ God and man (as you say an euell man doth) and Christes body being such as it cannot be


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7682:130"/>
deuided from his spirite (as you say also) how this euell man receauing Christes spirite, should be an euell man, for the tyme that he hath Christes spirit within him? Or how can he receaue Christes body and spirite (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your saying) and haue them not in him for the tyme he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them? Or how can Christ enter into an euell man (as you confesse) and be not in him, into whome he entreth at that present tyme? These be matters of your knowledge (as you pretend) which if you can teach me, I must confesse myne ignoraunce. And if you cannot, for so much as you haue spoken them, you must confesse the ignoraunce to be vpon your owne part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And S. Paule sayth not (as you vntruely recite him) that in him that receaueth vnworthely,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> remayneth iudgement and condemnation, but that he eateth and drincketh condemnation. And where you say, that S. Paules wordes playnly import, that those did eate the very body of Christ, which did eate vnworthely, euer still you take for a supposition the thing which you should proue. For S. Paule speaketh playnly of the eating of the bread and drincking of the cup, and not one word of eating of the body and drincking of the bloud of Christ. And let any indifferent reader looke vpon my questions, and he shall see, that there is not one word answered here directly vnto them, except mocking and scorning be taken for aunswere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And where you deny, that of your doctrine it should follow, that one man should be both the temple of God and the temple of the deuell, you can not deny, but that your owne teaching is, that Christ entreth into euell men, when they receaue the sacrament. And if they be his temple into whome he entreth, then must euell men be his temple, for the tyme they receaue the sacrament, although he tary not long with them. And for the same tyme they be euell men (as you say) and so must nedes be the temple of the deuell. And so it followeth of your doctrine and teaching, that at one tyme a man shall be the temple of God and the temple of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> deuell. And in your figure of Christ vpon earth, although he taryed not long with euery man that receaued him, yet for a tyme he taried with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> them. And the word of God tarieth for the tyme with many, which after forget it, and kepe it not. And then so must it be by these examples in euell men receauing the sacrament, that for a tyme Christ must tary in them, although that tyme be very short. And yet for that tyme by your doctrine those euell men must be both the temples of God and of Beliall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And where you pretend to conclude this matter by the authoritie of S. Paule,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 1. Cor. 11.</note> it is no small contumely and iniury to S. Paule, to asscribe your fayned and vntrue glose vnto him, that taught nothing but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, as he learned the same of Christ. For he maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the eating and drincking of the bread and cuppe, but not one word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eating and drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Christes body and bloud. Now followeth in my booke my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Papistes in this wise.</p>
                  <p>But least they should seme to haue nothing to say for them selues, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge S. Paule in the eleuenth to the Corinth. where he sayth:<note place="margin">Chap. 6. <hi>The aunswere to the Papists.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> He that eateth and drincketh vnworthely, eateth and drincketh his owne damnation, not discerning the Lordes body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:7682:131"/>But S. Paule in that place speaketh of the eating of the bread and drinking of the wine, and not of the corporall eating of Christes flesh and bloud, as it is manifest to euery man that will reade the text. For these be the wordes of S. Paule: Let a man examin him selfe, and so <hi>eat of the bread and drincke of the cup,</hi> for he that eateth and drincketh vnworthely, eateth and drincketh his owne damnation, not discerning the Lordes body.</p>
                  <p>In these wordes S. Paules mynd is, that for asmuch as the bread and wine in the Lordes supper, do represent vnto vs the very body and bloud of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, by his owne institution and ordinance, therfore although he sit in heauen at his fathers right hand, yet should we come to this misticall bread and wine with fayth, reuerence, purite and feare, as we would do, if we should come to see and receaue Christ him selfe sensibly present. For vnto the faythfull Christ is at his own holy table prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with his mighty spirite &amp; grace and is of them more fruitfully receaued, then if corporally they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue him bodely present. and therfore they that shall worthely com to this Gods boord, must after due triall of them selues, consider first who ordeined this table, also what meat and drincke they shall haue that come therto, and how they ought to behaue them selues therat. He that prepared the table, is Christ him selfe: The meat and drincke wherwith he fedeth them that come therto as they ought to do, is his own body, flesh and bloud. They that com therto, must occupy theyr myndes in considering how his body was broken for them, and his bloud shed for theyr redemption, and so ought they to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to this heauenly table with all humblenes of hart, and godlynes of mynd, as to the table wherin Christ hym selfe is giuen. And they that come otherwise to this holy table, they come vnworthely, and do not eat &amp; drincke Christes flesh and bloud, but eat and drincke theyr own damnation; bicause they do not duely consider Christes very flesh and bloud, which be offred there spiritually to be eaten and drinken, but dispising Christes most holy supper, do come therto as it were to other common meates &amp; drinckes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarde of the Lordes body, which is the spirituall meat of that table.</p>

And this I would aske of this Author why should it be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fault in the vnworthy not to esteme the Lordes body, when he is taught (yf this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors doctrine be true) that it is not there at all? If the bread after this authors tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be but a figure of Christes body, it is then but as Manna was, the eating wherof vnworthily and vnfaythfully,<note place="margin">

                     </note> was no gift of Christes body. Erasmus noteth these wordes of S. Paule to be gylty of our Lordes body, to proue the presence of Christes body there, who compareth such an offender to the Iewes, that did shed Christes bloud maliciously, as those do prophane it vnprofitably, in which sense the Grke commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do also expound it. And where this author bringeth in the wordes of S. Paule as it were to poynt out the matter, Let a man examine him selfe, and so eate of the bread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and drincke of the cup,<note place="margin">To eate.</note> for he that eateth vnworthely, &amp;c. these wordes of examining and so eatyng, declare the thing to be ordered to be eaten, and all the care to be vsed on our side, to eate worthely, or els S. Paule had not sayd (and so eat.) And when S. Paule sayth, Eate iudgement, and this Author well remember him selfe, he must call Iudgement, the effect of that is eaten, and not the thing eaten, for iudgment is neyther spirituall meat nor corporall, but the effect of the eating of Christ in euyll men, who


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7682:131"/>
is saluation to good, and iudgement to euell. And therfore as good men, eating Christ haue saluation, so euill men eating Christ haue condemnation, and so for the diuersite of the eaters of Christes body, followeth as they be worthy and vnworthy, the effect of condemnation or lyfe. Christes sacrament and his worke also in the substance of that sacrament bring alwayes one. And what so euer this author talketh otherwise in this matter, is mere trifles.</p>

                  <p>AS touching myne aunswere here to the wordes of S.

For I speake in such playne termes, as all men vnderstand, that when S. Paule sayd (he that eateth and drinketh vnworthely,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> eateth &amp; drinketh his owne damnation) in that place he spake of the eating of the bread and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> drincking of the cup, and not of the corporall eating and drincking of Christes flesh and bloud. These my playne wordes you do wrape vp in these darke termes, that I would distinct the vnworthy eating in the substaunce of the Sacrament receaued. Which your wordes vary so farre from myne, that no man can vnderstand by them my meaning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you put a large comment therto. For I distinct the vnworthy eating none otherwise, then that I say, that when S. Paule speaketh of vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy eating, he maketh mencion of the vnworthy eating of the bread, and not of the body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where you aske me this question,<note place="margin">Vnworthy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> why it should be a fault in the vnworthy, not to esteme the Lordes body, when it is not there at all?</p>
                  <p>There is in my booke a full and playne answere vnto your question al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy made, as there is also to your whole booke. So that in making of my booke, I did foresee all things that you could obiect agaynst it: In so much that here is not one thing in all your book, but I can shew you a sufficient answer therto, in one place or other of my former booke. And in this your question here moued. I referre the reader to the wordes of my booke in the same place.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that if the bread be but a figure, it is lyke Manna:<note place="margin">Manna.</note> as concerning the materiall bread, truely it is like Manna, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ him selfe, he sayd of him selfe, Not as your fathers did eate Manna and are dead, He that eateth this bread shall liue for euer. And as concerning Erasmus, and the greke commentaries, neyther of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> them sayth vppon the place of S. Paule,<note place="margin">Ihon. 6.</note> as you alleage them to say. And what soeuer it pleaseth you to gather of these wordes (examining and so eating) yet S. Paules wordes be very playne, that he spake not of the eating of the very body of Christ, but of the eating of the materiall bread in the sacrament, which is all one, whether the good or euyll eate of it. And all the care is on our syde, to take heede that we eate not that bread vnworthely. For as the eating of the bread vnworthely, not of Christ him selfe (who can not be eaten vnworthely) hath the effect of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and damnacion, so eating of the same bread worthely, hath the effect of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes death and saluation. And as he that eateth the bread worthely may be well sayd to eate Christ and life: So he that eateth it vnworthely may


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7682:132"/>
be sayd to eate the diuell and death, as Iudas did, into whom with the bread entred Satan. For vnto such it may be called <hi>mensa daemoni orum, non mensa Domini,</hi> not Gods bourd, but the diuels. And so in the eaters of the bread worthely or vnworthely, followeth the effect of euerlasting lyfe or euerlasting death. But in the eating of Christ himselfe is no diuersite, but whosoeuer eateth him,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> hath euerlasting lyfe. For asmuch as the eating of him, can be to none dampnation but saluation, because he is lyfe it selfe. And what so euer you bable to the contrary,<note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> is but meare fables, deuised without goddes word or any sufficient ground.

                  </p>
                  <p>"In which wordes S. Augustine semeth to conclude, that aswel the euill as the good doe eate the body and bloud of Christ, although the euill haue no benefite but hurt therby.</p>
                  <p>But consider the place of S. Augustine diligently, and then it shall euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, that he ment not of the eating of Christes body, but of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof. For the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of S. Augustine there, is to proue that good thinges auayle not to such persons as do euill vse them, and that many thinges which of them selues be good, and be good to some, yet to other some they be not good. As that light is good for whole eyes, and hurteth sore eyes: that meate which is good for some, is euill for other some: One medecine healeth some, and maketh other sicke. One harnes doth arme one, and combreth another: one coate is meete for one, and to straight for an other. And after other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, at the last S. Augustine sheweth the same to be true in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes both of Baptisme and the Lordes body, which he sayth do profite onely them, that receaue the same worthely.</p>
                  <p>And the wordes of S. Paule which S. Augustine citeth, do speake of the Sacramentall bread and cup, and not of the body and bloud. And yet S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine called the bread and the cup, the flesh and bloud, not that they be so in deed, but that they signifie, as he sayth in an other place <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Maximinum.</hi>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7682:133"/>
he dwelleth in Christ and Christ in him, but after a certayn maner, which maner he saw when he sayd these wordes.</q>
This is the sense of S. Augustines saying in Latine wherby appeareth the fayth of S. Augustin to be, in the sacrament to be eaten and dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the very body and bloud of Christ, which for the substaunce of the sacrament euill men receaue as good men do, that is to say, as S. Augustine doth poynt it out by his wordes, the same flesh and the same bloud of Christ, with such an expression of speach, as he would exclude all difference that deuise of figure might imagine, and therfore sayth <hi>Ipsam carnem, ipsum sanguinem,</hi> which signifie the selfe same in dede, not by name onely as the author of the booke would haue S. Augustine vnderstanded: and when that appeareth as it is most manifest, that Iudas receaued the same being wicked that good men do, how the same is before the recept by godes omnipotencie present in the visible sacrament, and so not receaued by the onely instrument of fayth, which in euill men is not liuely, but by the instrument of the mouth, wherin it entreth with the visible element, and yet as S. Augustine sayth dwelleth not in him, that so vnworthely receiueth, bycause the effect of dwelling of Christ is not in him that receaueth by such a maner of eating as wicked men vse. Wherby S. Augustine teacheth the diuerse effect to ensue of the diuersitie of the eating, and not of any diuersitie of that which is eaten, whether the good man or euill man receaue the sacrament. If I would here encombre the reader, I could bring forth many mo places of S. Augustine to the confusion and reprofe of this Authors purpose, and yet notwithstanding to take away that he might say of me, that I way not S. Augustine: I thinke good to alleadge and bring forth the iudgement of Martyn Bucer touching S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Bucerus.</note> who vnderstandeth S. Augustine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> clere contrary to this author, as may playnly appeare by that the sayd Bucer writeth in few wordes in his epistle dedicatory of the great worke he sent abroad of his enarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the gospelles where his iudgement of S. Augustine in this poynt he vttereth thus:

                        <note place="margin">Bucerus.</note> The sense in English is this. How often writeth he (speaking of S. Augustine) Iudas also to haue receaued the selfe body and bloud of our Lord? No man thefore by the authoritie of the fathers can say Christ to be absent in the holy supper.</q>
Thus sayth Bucer who vnderstandeth S. Augustine as I haue before alleadged him, and gathereth therof a conclusion, that no man can by the fathers sayinges proue Christ to be absent in the holy supper, And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Bucers iudgement, the doctrine of this Author can be in no wise catholique, as dissenting from that hath ben before taught and beleued, whether Bucer will still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that he hath so solemnly published to the world and by me here alleadged, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, and whether he do or no, it maketh no matter, but thus he hath taught in his latter iudgement with a great protestation, that he speaketh without respect other then to the truth wherin because he semed to dissent from his frendes he sayth: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. which wordes haue an imitation of an elder saying, and be thus much to say: Socrates is my frend, truth is my best beloued, and the church most regarded. And with this Bucer closeth his doctrine of the sacrament, after he knew al that Zuinglius &amp; Decolampadius could say in the matter. And here I will leaue to speake of Bucer, and bring forth Theodoretus a man most extolled by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> this author,<note place="margin">Theodoretus in epi. 1. Cor. 11.</note> who sayth playnly in his commentaries vpon S.

And to expresse it yet more playnely then paraduenture you would haue me, I say, that the same visible &amp; pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable flesh that was for vs crucified and appeared after his resurrection, and was seene, felt, and groped, and ascended into heauen, and there sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at his fathers right hand, and at the last day shall come to iudge the quick &amp; the dead, that selfe same body, hauing all the partes of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in good order and proportion, and being visible and tangible, I say is eaten of christen people at his holy supper, what will you now require more of me, concerning the truth of the body? I suppose you be sory that I graunt you so much, and yet what doth this helpe you? For the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie is not in the body, but in the eating therof, no man eating it carnally, but the good eating it both sacramentally and spiritually, and the euill onely sacramentally, that is to say, figuratiuely. And therfore hath S. Augustine these wordes (<hi>Certo quodam modo,</hi> after a certayne manner) bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the euill eate the sacrament, which after a certayne manner, is called the very body of Christ: which maner S.

                     <note place="margin">August. ad Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacium episto. 23.</note> saying: If sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes had not some similitude or likenes of those thinges wherof they be sacraments, they could in no wise be sacramentes. And for theyr simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and likenes, they haue commonly the name of the thinges wherof they be sacraments. Therfore after a certayne manner the sacrament of Christes body is. Christes body the sacrament of Christes bloud is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bloud.

And if Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred than into Iudas with the bread (as you write) then the deuill and Christ entred into Iudas both at once.<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note>

And I meruayle you be not ashamed to alleadge so vayne a matter agaynst me, which in dede is not in my booke, and if it were, yet were it nothing to the purpose.

what you meane by corporall I know not, and the opening therof shall discusse the whole matter.

For that vnderstand I to be a mans corporall body, that hath all such partes, without which may be a body, but no perfect mans body. So that the lacke of a finger maketh a lacke in the perfection of a mans body. Mary if you will make Christ such a body as bread and cheese is (wherin euery part is bread and cheese without forme and distinction of one part from an other) I confesse myne ignoraunce, that I know no such body to be a mans body. Now haue I shewed myne ignoraunce, declare now your wit and learning.

And yet is not Christ clearly absent in the godly administration of his holy supper, nor present onely in a figure (as euer you vntruely report me to say) but by his omnipotent power he is effectually present by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nourishment and feeding, as in Baptisme he is likewise present by spirituall renuing and regenerating. Therfore where you would proue the corporall presence of Christ, by the reuerence that is to be vsed at the aulter (as Emissene teacheth) with no lesse reuerence ought he that is baptised to come to the font, then he that receaueth the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the aulter. And yet is that no profe, that Christ is corporally in the font. And what so euer you haue here sayd of the comming to the aulter, the like may be sayd of comming to the font.

                  <p>For els what made the people to runne from theyr seates to the aulter, and from aulter to aulter, and from sakering (as they called it) to sakering, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,

tooting, and gasing at that thing which the priest held vp in his handes, if they thought not to honor that thing which they saw? What moued the priestes to lift vp the sacrament so hye ouer theyr heades? or the people to cry to the priest, Hold vp, hold vp: and one man to say to an other, Stoupe downe before, or to say: This day haue I seene my maker. And, I cannot be quiet, except I see my maker once a day? What was the cause of all these, and that as well the priest as the people so deuoutly did knocke and kneele at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sight of the sacrament? but that they worshiped that visible thing, which they saw with theyr eyes, and tooke it for very God? For if they worshiped in spirit onely Christ, sitting in heauen with his father, what neded they to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue out of theyr seates to toote and gase? as the Apostles did after Christ, when he was gone vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If they worshiped nothing that they sawe, why did they rise vp to see? Doubtlesse many of the simple people worshiped that thing which they saw with theyr eyes.</p>
                  <p>And although the subtill Papistes do colour and cloke the matter neuer so finely, saying that they worship not the sacraments which they see with theyr eyes, but that thing which they beleue with their fayth to be really and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the sacraments, yet why do they then runne from place to place, to gase at the things which they see, if they worship them not? giuing therby oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to them that be ignorant, to worship that which they see. Why doe they not rather quietly sit still in their seates, and moue the people to do the like, worshiping God in hart and in spirite, than to gadde about from place to place, to see that thing, which they confesse them selues, is not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.</p>
                  <p>And yet to eschew one inconuenience (that is to say, the worshipping of the sacrament) they fall into an other as euell, and worship nothing there at all. For they worship that thing (as they say) which is really and corporally, and yet inuisibly present vnder the kindes of bread and wine, which (as before is expressed and proued) is vtterly nothing.

                     <note place="margin">August. in psal. 98.</note>But the Papistes (for theyr owne commodity to keepe the people still in idolatry) do often alleadge a certayne place of S. Augustine vpon the Psalmes where he sayth, <hi>that no man doth eate the flesh of Christ, except he first worship it, and that we do not offend in worshipping therof, but we should, offend if we should not worship it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is true, which S. Augustine sayth in this place. For who is he that professeth Christ, and spiritually fedde and nourished with his flesh and bloud, but he will honor and worship him, sitting at the right hand of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and render vnto him from the botome of his hart, all laud, prayse and thankes, for his mercifull redemption?</p>
                  <p>And as this is most true, which S. Augustine sayth, so is that most false, which the Papistes would perswade vpon S. Augustines wordes, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread and wine, or any visible thing is to be worshipped in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For S. Augustines mynd was so farre from any such thought, that he forbiddeth vtterly to worship Christes owne flesh and bloud alone, but in consideration, and as they be annexed and ioyned to his diuinity. How much lesse then could he thinke or allow, that we should worship the Sacramentall bread and wine, or any outward or visible Sacrament, which be shadowes, figures, and representations of Christes flesh and bloud?</p>
                  <p>And S. Augustine was afrayd, least in worshiping Christes very body, we should offend, therfore he biddeth vs, when we worship Christ, that we should not tarry and fixe our myndes vpon his flesh (which of it self auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing) but that we should lift vp our myndes from the flesh to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite, which geueth lyfe: and yet the Papistes be not afrayd by crafty meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs, to worship those thinges, which be signes and sacraments of Christes body.</p>
                  <p>But what will not the shamelesse Papistes alleadge for theyr purpose, when they be not ashamed to mayntayne the adoration of the Sacrament by these wordes of S. Augustine? Wherin he speaketh not one word of the adoration of the sacrament, but onely of Christ him selfe?</p>
                  <p>And although he say, that Christ gaue his flesh to be eaten of vs, yet he ment not, that his flesh is here corporally present, and corporally eaten, but onely spiritually. As his word declare playnly, which follow in the same place, where S. Augustine as it were in the person of Christ, speaketh these wordes.</p>

Augustine should meane of the adoring of Christes flesh in heauen, as this author would haue it. S. Augustine speaketh of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> giuing of Christes flesh to vs to eate, and declareth after, that he meaneth in the visible Sacrament, which must be inuisibly vnderstanded &amp; spiritually, not as the Capernaites did vnderstand Christes wordes, carnally to eate that body cut in peces: and therfore there may be no such imaginations to eat Christes body after the manner he walked here, nor drincke his bloud as it was shedde vpon the Crosse: but it is a mystery and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that is godly of godes worke supernaturall aboue mans vnderstanding, and therfore spiritually vnderstanded shall geue life, which life carnall vnderstanding must nedes exclude. And by these my wordes, I thincke I declare truely S. Augustines mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the truth of this sacrament, wherin Christ giueth truly his flesh to be eaten, the flesh he spake of before taken of the virgine. For the spirituall vnderstanding that S. Augustine speaketh of is not to exclude the truth of Gods worke in the sacrament, but to exclude carnall imagination from musing of the manner of the worke, which is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> mistery such as a carnall man can not comprehend. In which matter if S. Augustine had had such a fayth of the visible sacrament, as the author sayth him selfe hath now of late, and calleth it catholicke, S. Augustine would haue vttered it, as an expositor playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this place, and sayd, there is but a figure of Christes body: Christes body and flesh is in heauen and not in this visible sacrament, Christes speach that was estemed so hard, was but a figuratiue speach. And where Christ sayd, This is my body, he ment onely of the figure of his body: which manner of saying S. Augustine vseth not in this place, and yet he could speake playnly, and so doth he, declaring vs first the truth of the flesh that Christ geueth to be eaten, that is to say, the same flesh that he tooke of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And yet bicause Christ giueth it not in a visible manner, nor such a maner as the Capernaites thought on, nor such a maner as any carnall man can conceaue, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the flesh in the sacrament, giuen not a common flesh but a liuely, godly and spirituall flesh. Therfore S. Augustine vseth wordes and speach wherby he denieth the gift of that body of Christ, which we did see, and of the bloud that was shed, so as by affirmation and deniall so nere together of the same to be geuen, and the same not to be giuen, the mistery should be thus farre opened, that for the truth of the thing giuen, it is the same, and touching the manner of the giuing, and the quality of the flesh giuen, it is not the same. And bicause it is the same, S. Augustine sayth before we must worship it, and yet bicause it is now an hidden godly mistery, we may not haue carnall imaginations of the same but godly, spiritually and inuisibly vnderstand it.</p>

Augustine had ment as I do, he would in this place haue declared a figure, and haue sayd, that here is but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and we eate onely a figure, but Christ himselfe is gone vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and is not here it is to much arrogancy of you, to appoynt S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin his wordes, what he should say in this place, as you would lead an hound in a line where you list, or draw a beare to the stake. And here still you cease not vntruly to report me. For I say not that in the Lordes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is but a figure, or that Christ is eaten only figuratiuely, but I say that there is a figure and figuratiue eating. And doth not S. Augustine suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare a figure in Christes wordes, when he sayth, that they must be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spiritually: And what man can deuise to expresse more playnly, both that in Christes speach is a figure, and that his body is not corporally present, and corporally eaten, then S. Augustine doth in a thousand places? but specially in his epistle <hi>ad Bonifacium, ad Dardanum, ad Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarium, De doctrina Christiana, De catechisandis rudibus, in quest super leuit, De ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitate Dei, Contra Adamatium, contra aduersarium legis &amp; prophetarum, In epistolam &amp; Euangelium Iohannis, In sermone ad infantes, &amp; De verbis apostoli.</hi> The flesh of Christ is a true flesh, and was borne of a woman, dyed, rose agayne, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen, and sitteth at the right hand of his father, but yet is he eaten of vs spiritually, and in the maner of the eating, there is the mistery and secret, and yet the true worke of God.</p>
                  <p>And where you vnderstand the inuisible mistery (which S. Augustin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> speaketh of) to be in the diuersity of the body of Christ seene or not seene, you be farre deceaued. For S. Augustine speaketh of the mistery that is in the eating of the body, and not in the diuersity of the body: which in substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is euer one without diuersity. The meaning therfore of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine was this, that when Christ sayd (Except you eate the flesh of the sonne of man,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> you shall not haue life in you,) he ment of spirituall and not carnall eating of his body. For if he had entended to haue described the diuersity of the maner of Christes body visible and inuisible, he would not haue sayd (this body which you see) but this body in such maner as you see it, or in such like termes, you shall not eate. But to eate Christes flesh (sayth S. Augustine) is fructifully to remember that the same flesh was crucified for vs.<note place="margin">August. de doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri. christiana. li. 3. cap. 4.</note> And this is spiritually to eate his flesh and drincke his bloud.</p>

vpon S.

The bloud and flesh of Christ is two wayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded, either the spirituall and godly, of which him selfe sayd: My flesh is verely meate, and my bloud is verely drincke. And vnles ye eate my flesh &amp; drincke my bloud, ye shall not haue euerlasting lyfe. Or the flesh which was crucified and the bloud which was shed with the spere. According to this diuision, the diuersity of flesh and bloud is taken in Christes sayntes, that there is one flesh that shall see the saluation of God, an other flesh and bloud that cannot possese the kingdome of heauen. There be S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes wordes. In which, thou reader seest a deniall of that flesh of Christ to be geuen, to be eaten, that was crucified, but the flesh geuen to be eaten to be a godly and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flesh, and a distinction made betwen them, as is in our flesh, of which it may be sayd, that the flesh we walke in here, shall not see God, that is to say, as it is corruptible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the text of S. Paule, flesh and bloud shall not possesse heauen,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.</note> and yet we must beleue and hope with Iobe truly: that the same our flesh shall see God in heauen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> after which diuision likewise we receaue not in the sacrament Christes flesh that was crucified, being so a visible and mortall flesh, But Christes flesh glorified, incorruptible and impassible, a Godly and spirituall flesh. And so that is but one in substance, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so that same one is neuerthelesse for the alteration in the maner of the being of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it deuided and so called not the same, wherin S. Hierom and S. Augustine vsed both one maner of speaking: and S. Hierom resembling the diuision that he reherseth of Christes flesh, to the diuision of our flesh in the resurrection, doth more playnly open how the same may be called not the same, bicause we beleue certaynly the resurrection of the same flesh we walke in, and yet it shall be by the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of incorruptibility not the same in quality, and so be verefied the scriptures that flesh shall not possesse heauen: and, I shal see God in my flesh: and here I will note to the reader by the way S. Hierome writeth this distinction of Christes flesh as a matter agreed on, and then in catholique doctrine receaued not of his inuention, but in the catholique fayth as a principle establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which declareth the belyfe to haue bene of that very godly and spiritual flesh geuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> really in the sacrament, for els to eate onely in fayth, is specially to remember Christes flesh, as it was visibly crucified, wherin was accomplished the oblation for our sinne: and S. Paule willeth vs in the supper to shew forth and professe the death of Christ, for so Christ would haue his death continually expressed till his coming, and if S. Hierome with other should haue ment of the eating of Christ as he sitteth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen reigning, this destinction of Christes flesh were an idle matter and out of purpose to compare the distinction in it to be like distinction of oure flesh to enter into heauen, and not to enter into heauen, the same and not the same. And thus I say that this place of S. Hierome sheweth so euedently both his and S. Augustines fayth, that wrot at the same tyme as there cannot be desired a more euident matter.</p>

                  <p>TO what purpose you should bring in here this place of S. Hierome (making much agaynst you and nothing for you) I cannot conceaue. For he declareth no more in this place, but that as all men in this world haue passible bodyes, subiect to much filthynes, corruption and death,<note place="margin">Spirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> and yet after our resurrection we shalbe deliuered from corruption, vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, weakenes and death, and be made incorruptible, glorious, mighty and spirituall: so Christes body in earth was subiect vnto our infirmities, his flesh being crucified, and his bloud being shed with a spere, which now (as you truly say) is glorified, impassible, incorruptible and a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body, but yet not so spirituall, that his humanitie is turned into his diuinity, and his body into his soule (as some heretikes phantasy) nor that the diuersity of his members be taken away, and so left without armes and legges, head and feete, eyes and eares, and turned into the forme and fashion of a bowle, as the Papistes imagine. The sunne and

the mone, the fier and the ayre be bodyes, but no mans bodyes, bycause they lacke hart and lungues, head and feete, flesh and bloud, vaynes and sinewes to knit them togither.<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> When Christ was transfigured, his face shyned like the sunne, and with his mouth he spake to Moyses &amp; Helias. And after his resurrection we read of his flesh and bones,<note place="margin">Luc. 14. Ioh. 20.</note> his handes and feete, his side and woundes, visible and palpable, and with mouth, tongue and teeth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> he did eate and speake, and so like a man he was in all proportions and members of man, that Mary Magdalene could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him from a gardiner. And take away flesh and skinne, sinewes and bones, bloud and vaynes, and then remayneth no mans body. For take away distinction and diuersitie of partes and members, how shall Peter be Peter, and Paule be Paule? How shall a man be a man, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a woman? And how shall we see with our eyes, and heare with our eares, grope with our handes, and go with our feete? For eyther we shal do no such thinges at all, or see with euery part of our bodies, and likewise heare, speake and go, if there be no diuersity of members. This I haue spoken for this purpose, to declare that S. Hierome speaking of Christes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diuine and spirituall flesh, excludeth not therby any corporall member, that pertayneth to the substance of a mans naturall body, but that now being glorified, it is the same in all partes, that it was before. And that same flesh being fyrst borne mortall of the virgine Mary, and now being glorifyed and immortall as well the holy fathers did eate before he was borne,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> and his apostles and disciples whiles he liued with vs here in earth as we doe now when he is glorified. But what auayleth all this to your purpose, except you could proue, that to a spirituall eating is required a corporall presence?</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that S. Hierome and S. Augustine vse both one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> maner of speaking that is not true. For S. Hierom speaketh of the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the body of Christ, and S. Augustine of the diuersity of eating therof. And yet here is to be noted by the way, that you say, we receaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christes flesh that was crucified, which your wordes seme to agree euill with Christes wordes,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. .1 Cor. 10</note> who the night before he was crucified, declared to his desciples, that he gaue them the same body, that should suffer death for them. And the Apostles receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, yet passible and mortall, which the next day was crucified, and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue not in the sacrament the body that was crucified, then receaue we not the same body that the Apostles did. And here in your idle talke you draw by force S. Hieroms wordes to the sacrament, when S.

                  <p>And here for the conclusion of the matter, you fantasy and imagine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> such nouelties, and wrape them vp in such darke speaches, that we had neede to haue Ioseph or Daniell to expound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But to returne to S. Augustine touching adoration, if the very flesh of Christ were not in the sacrament truely present, which is as much to say, as in substaunce present, if it were not in deede present, that is to say really present, if it were not corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that is to say,<note place="margin">Truely. Really. Corporally.</note> the very body of Christ there present God and man. If these truthes consenting in one were not there, S. Augustine would neuer haue spoken of adoration there. No more he doth sayth this author there, but in heauen: let S. Augustines wordes quoth I be iudge, which be these, No man eateth that flesh but he first worshippeth it.
<q>It is found out how such a footestoole of the Lordes foot should be worshipped, and not onely that we do not sinne in worshipping, but we do sinne in not worshipping it. These be S. Augustines wordes, which I sayd before, can not be drawen to an vnderstanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the worshipping of Christes flesh in heauen, where it remayneth continually glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and is of all men christened continually worshipped.</q>
For as S. Paule sayth, Christ is so exalted that euery tongue should confesse, that our sauiour Christ is in the glory of his father. So as the worshipping of Christ there in the estate of his glory where he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reigneth, hath neither (afore) ne (after) but an (euer) continuall worshipping in glory. Wherfore S. Augustine speaking of a (before) must be vnderstanded of the worshipping <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Christes flesh present in the Sacrament, as in the dispensation of his humility, which Christ ceaseth not to do reigning in glory, for although he hath finished his humble pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible conuersation, yet he continueth his humble dispensation in the perfection of his misticall body, and as he is our inuisible priest for euer, and our aduocate with his father, and so for vs to him a mediator, to whom he is equall, so doth he vouchsafe in his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which he continueth to make an effectuall remembraunce of his offering for vs, of the new Testament confirmed in his bloud, and by his power maketh him selfe present in this visible Sacrament, to be therein of vs truely eaten, and his bloud truely drunken, not onely in fayth, but with the truth and ministery of our bodely mouth, as God hath willed and commaunded vs to do: which presence of Christ in this humility of dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to releaue vs and feed vs spiritually, we must adore as S. Augustine sayth before we eate: and we do not sinne in adoring, but we sinne in not adoring, remembring the diuine nature vnite vnto Christes flesh, and therfore of flesh not seuered from the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Which admonishment of S. Augustine declareth he ment not of the worshipping of Christes flesh in heauen, where can be no danger of such a thought, where all to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues confesse Christ to be in the glory of his father, of which Christ as he is there in glory continually to be worshipped, it were a colde saying of S. Augustine to say, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wee doe not sinne in worshipping Christ in heauen, but sinne in not worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him, as though any coulde haue doubted whether Christe shoulde bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in his humanitye in heauen being inseparably vnite to the diuinity. And when I say in his humanity, I speake not properly as that mistery requireth, for as Christes person is but one of two perfite natures, so the adoration is but one as Cirill declareth it, and therfore abhorreth the addition of a sillable to speake of coadoration. And will this author attribute to S. Augustine such a grossenes to haue written and giuen for a lesson, that no man sinneth to worship Christes flesh in heauen reigning in glory? wherfore taking this to be so farre from al probabilitie, I sayd before these words of S. Augustine can not be drawen with any tenters to stretch so farre as to reach to heauen, where euery christian man knoweth and professeth the worshipping of Christ in glory, as they be taught also to worship him in his dispensation of his humility, when he maketh present him selfe in this Sacrament, whome we should not receaue into our mouth before we adore him. And by S. Augustines rule, we not onely not sinne in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring, but also sinne in not adoring him.</p>

If it be referred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the presence, than it is neyther trew, nor S. Augustine sayth no such thing, that Christ is really, substancially, and corporally present there. If it be referred to the worshipping, than it is trew, according to S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines mynd, that there in the receauing of the sacrament in spirite and truth, we glorify and honor Christ, sitting in heauen at his fathers right hand. But to this adoration is required no reall, substanciall, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall presence,<note place="margin">Genes. 28,</note> as before I haue declared: for so did Iacob worship Christ before he was borne, and all faythfull christen people do worship him in all places where soeuer they be, although he carnally and corporally be farre distant from them. As they dayly honor the father and pray vnto him,<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> and yet say, <hi>Qui es in coelis,</hi> confessing him to be in heauen. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to auoyd all the ambiguitie, and fallax of your speach, I say, that we being here, do worship here Christ, being not corporally here, but with his father in heauen.</p>
                  <p>And although all christen men ought of duety continually to worship Christ being in heauen, yet bicause we be negligent to doe our duties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, his word and sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be ordeined to prouoke vs therunto. So that although otherwise we forgat our dutyes, yet when we come to any of his sacraments,<note place="margin">1. Cor 11.</note> we should be put in remembrance thereof. And therfore sayd Christ (as S. Paule writeth) As often as you shall eate this bread and drincke this cup, shew forth the lordes death, vntill he come. And do this (sayd Christ) in remembraunce of me.<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> And the worshipping of Christ in his glory, should be euer continuall without eyther before or after. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles forasmuch as by reason of our infirmity, ingratitude, malice and wickednes, we go farre from our offices and dueties herein, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments call vs home agayne, to do that thing, which before we did omit, that at the least we may do at some tyme, that which we should doe at all tymes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Humiliation.</note>And where you speake of the humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ in the sacrament, you speake without the booke. For the scripture termeth not the matter in that sort, but calleth his humiliation only his incarnation and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with vs here in earth, being obedient euen vnto death, and for that humiliation, he is now from that tyme forward exalted for euer in glory. And you would plucke him downe from his glory,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> to humiliation agayne. And thus is Christ intreated, when he commeth to the handling of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt lawyers, blynd sophisters, and popish diuines, but the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of Christ, worship him in spirite, sitting in his high glory and Maiesty, and pluck him not downe from thence, corporally to eate him with their teeth, but spiritually in hart ascend vp (as S. Chrisosto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayth) and feede vpon him where he sitteth in his high throne of glory with his father. To which spirituall feding is required no bodely presence, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so mouth nor teeth, and yet they that receaue any sacrament, must adore Christ (both before and after) sitting in heauen in the glory of his father. And this is neyther (as you say it is) a cold nor grosse teaching of S.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7682:140"/>
nor your teaching is not so farre from all doubtes, but that you seeme so afrayd your selfe to stand to it, that when you haue sayde, that Christ is to be worshipped in his humanity, as it were to excuse the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, you say, you speake not properly.</p>
                  <p>And this doctrine of S. Augustine was very necessary for ij. conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. One is for the exposition of the Psalme,<note place="margin">Saynt Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines doctrine is necessary. Psal. 99.</note> which he tooke in hand to declare, where in one verse is commaunded to worship the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gods fotestole, and this he sayth may be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the flesh of Christ which flesh being earth, and the foode of faythfull christen people, is to be worshipped of all that feede and liue by him. For notwithstanding that his flesh is earth of earth, and a creature, and that nothing ought to be worshipped but God alone, yet is found out in Christ the explication of this great doubt and mistery, how flesh, earth, and a creature, both may and ought to be worshipped, That is to say, when earth and flesh being vnited to the godhead in one person, is one perfect Iesus Christ both God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and man. And this is neyther a cold nor grosse saying of S. Augustine, but an explication of the diuine and high mistery of his incarnation.</p>
                  <p>The other cause, why it is necessary both to teach and to exhort men to honor Chistes flesh in heauen, is this, that some know it not, and some doe it not. For some heretikes haue taught, that Christ was but a man, and so not to be honored. And some haue sayd, that although he be both God and man, yet his diuinity is to be honored, and not his humanity. For extirpation of which errors, it is no grosse nor cold saying, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes flesh in heauen is to be honored. And some know right well, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ God and man ought to be honored with one entier and godly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and yet forgetting them selfe in theyr factes,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> do not according to their knowledge, but treading the sonne of God vnder their feete,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the bloud, wherby they were sanctified, crucifie agayne the sonne of God, and make him a mocking stocke to all the wicked. And many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christ yet hauing vayne cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tasies in their heades, do worship and serue Antichrist, and thinking them selues wise, become very fooles in deed. And count you it then a cold and a grosse saying, that Christ in heauen is to be honored? wherin so many olde authors haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and written so many bookes, and wherin all godly teachers tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle from tyme to tyme? And yet bring you here nothing to proue, that S.

                  <p>And this will serue to answere also the place here following of S.

                  <p>And for the more manifest confirmation that S. Augustine ought thus to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, I shall bring in S. Ambrose saying, of whome it is probable, S. Augustine to haue learned that he writeth in this matter.</p>

It is therfore no meane question and therfore we should more diligently consider, what is the foote stoole. For we read in an other place, heauen is my throne, and the earth the foote stoole of my feete. But yet the earth is not to be worshipped of vs, bicause it is a creature of God. And yet let vs see though least the prophet means that earth to be worshipped, which our Lord Iesus tooke in the taking of flesh. So then by the footestoole let the earth be vnderstanded, and then by the earth the flesh of Christ, which we do now worship also in the misteries, and which the Apostles, as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sayde, worshipped in our Lord Iesu, for Christ is not deuided, but one. Hitherto S. Ambrose, wherby may appeare how S. Ambrose and S. Augustine tooke occasion to open their fayth and doctrine touching adoration, vpon discussion of the selfe same words of the prophet Dauid.</q>
And S. Ambrose expressely noteth our adoration in the misteries where we worship Christes flesh inuisibly present, as the Apostles did, when Christ was visibly present with them. And thus with these so playne wordes of S. Ambrose consonant to those of S. Augustine, and the opening of S. Augustines wordes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I trust I haue made manifest, how this Author trauayleth agaynst the streame,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and laboreth in vayne to writh S. Augustine to his purpose in this matter. The best is in this author that he handleth S.

                  <p>HEre apeareth your sincerity in proceeding in this matter. For you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> leaue out those wordes of S. Ambrose, which maketh his meaning playne, that the prophet spake of the mistery of Christes incarnation. <hi>Si negant quia in Christo etiam incarnationis adoranda misteria sunt.</hi> &amp;c. If they deny (sayth he) that the misteries of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christ be to be honored &amp;c. And a little after <hi>Qua ratione ad incarnationis dominicae sacramentum spectare vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur, quod ait Propheta, Adorate scabellum pedum eius, consideremus.</hi> Let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by what meanes this saying of the prophet (worship his foote stoole) may be seene to pertayne to the sacrament of Christes incarnation. And after the wordes by you rehearsed, foloweth by and by, <hi>Cum igitur incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis adorandum sit Sacramentum.</hi> &amp;c. Seing then that the Sacrament of the incarnation is to be honored. In these wordes sheweth S. Ambrose playnly that the worshipping of Christes flesh is vnderstand of the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his incarnation. So that S. Ambrose ment not onely that men should worship Christ, when they receaue the Sacrament, but that all creatures, at all tymes, should worship him. And therfore he expresseth there by name, how the Angels did worship him, and also Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene and the Apostles after his resurrection,<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> when they receaued not the Sacrament.<note place="margin">Luc. 2.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thus haue I aunswered to all that you haue brought agaynst my fourth booke, not obscurely (as you like a cuttell haue done, hiding your selfe in your darke colours) but playnly to the capacity of all men, asmuch as I can. And this haue I done with some payne of writing, but little or no study for the matter, being a very easy thing for defence of the truth to answere by gods word, and auncient authors to an ignorant lawyer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well exercised in neyther of both, but making such diuinity a she can dreame in his sleape, or deuise of his owne brayne, or hath sucked out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistical lawes and decrees, and for lacke of arguments, furnishing vp his booke with prety toyes, with glorious bosting, and scornfull taunting.

And such places as he seeth his rhetorike will not serue, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them away slightly, bicause he is afrayd to file his hands therwith. Wherfore I may now right well and iustly conclude here myne answere to his confutation, with the wordes of my fourth booke, which be these.</p>
                  <p>But our sauiour Christ himselfe hath geuen vs warning before hand, that such false Christians and false teachers should come, and hath bydde vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them, saying:<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus our Sauiour Christ (like a most louing pastor and sauiour of our soules) hath giuen vs warning before hand of the perilles and dangers that were to come, and to be wise and ware, that we should not geue credite vnto such teachers, as would perswade vs to worship a peece of bread, to kneele to it, to knocke to it, to creepe to it, to follow it in procession, to lift vp our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to it, to offer to it, to light candels to it, to shut it vp in a chest or boxe, to do all other honor vnto it, more then we do vnto God: hauing alway this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>or scuse for our idolatry, Behold here is Christ.<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> But our Sauiour Christ calleth them false Prophets, and sayth: Take heed, I tell you before:

               <p>HAuing declared how much agaynst all truth this author would beare in hand, that the reall presence, the corporall presence, and substanciall presence of Christes most precious body and bloud in the sacrament, is not the true catholique doctrine, but a deuise of the Papistes, which is a terme wherwith this author both vncharitably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> charge the kinges true subiectes, among whome he knoweth a great many to be of that fayth he calleth now Papish: But setting wordes a part and to come to the matter, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I haue shewed this author to erre partly by wilfulnes, partly by ignorance in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the olde authors, concerning the true reall presence of Christes body and bloud in the Sacrament, so I trust to shew this author ouerseene in the article of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. For enter wherunto, first I say this, that albeit the word Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was first spoken of by publique authority in that assemble of learned men of Christendome, in a generall counsaile, where the Bishop of Rome was present, yet the true matter signified by that word, was older and beleued before vpon the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Christes wordes, and was in that counsayle confessed, not for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Bishop of Rome, but for the authority of truth, being the article such as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not the authority of the Bishop of Rome, but the true doctrine of Christes miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and therfore in this realme (the authority of Rome cessing) was also confessed for a truth by all the clergy of this realme in an open counsayle, specially discussed and though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the hardenes of the law that by parliament was established, of that and other articles hath bene repelled, yet that doctriue was neuer hitherto by any publique counsayle or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing set forth by authority empayred, that I haue hard, wherfore me thinketh this author should not improue it by the name of the Bishop of Rome, seing we read how truth was vttered by Balsaam and Caiphas also: and S. Paule teacheth the Philippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that whither it be by contention or enuy, so Christ be preached, the person should not empayre the opening of truth, if it be truth, which Luther in deed would not alow for truth impugning the article of Transubstantiation, not meaning therby as this author doth to empayre the truth of the very presence of Christes most precious body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the aniter, (as is afore sayd) in the discussion of which truth of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I for my part should be speciall defended by two meanes, wherwith to auoyd the enuious name of Papist.<note place="margin">Zuinglius.</note> One is that Zuinglius himselfe, who was no Papist as is well knowen, nor good christen man as some sayd neither, sayth playnly writing to Luther in the matter of the Sacrament, it must nedes be true, that if the body of Christ be really in the Sacrament, there is of necessity Transubstantiation also. Wherfore seing by Luthers trauayle, who fauored not the Byshops of Rome neither, and also by euidence of the truth most certayne and manifest it appeareth, that according to the true


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7682:142"/>
catholqiue sayth Christ is really present in the sacrament, it is now by Zuinglius iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a necessary consequence of that truth to say there is Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, which shalbe one meane of purgation, that I defend not Transubstantiation as depending of the Bishop of Romes determination, which was not his absolutely, but of a necessity of the truth, howsoeuer it liketh Duns or Gabriell to write in it, whose sayinges this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> vseth for his pleasure. An other defence is, that this author himselfe sayth that it is ouer great an absurdity to say, that bread insensible, with many other termes that he addeth, should be the body of Christ, and therfore I thinke, that the (is) that is to say, the inward nature and essence of that Christ deliuered in his supper to be eaten and dronken, was of his body and bloud, and not of the bread and wine, and therfore can well agree with this author, that the bread of wheate is not the body of Christ, nor the body of Christ made of it as of a matter, which considerations will enforce him that beleueth the truth of the presence of the substaunce of Christes body as the true catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will passe ouer the vnreuerent handling of Christes wordes (This is my body) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> which wordes I heard this Author (if he be the same that is named) once reherse more seriously in a solemne and open audience to the conuiction and condemnation (as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) of one that erroniously mayntayned agaynst the sacrament the same that this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calleth now the catholique fayth.</p>

                  <p>IN this booke (which answereth to my second booke rather with taunting wordes then with matter) I will answere the chief poyntes of your intent, and not contend with you in scolding, but will geue you place therin.</p>
                  <p>First I charge none with the name of papistes, but that be well worthy therof.<note place="margin">Papistes were the Authors of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> For I charge not the hearers but the teachers, not the learners, but the inuenters of the vntrue doctrine of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not the kinges faythfull subiects, but the Popes darlinges, whose fayth and belefe hangeth of his onely mouth. And I call it their doctrine, not onely bycause they teach it, but bycause they made it, and were the first fynders of it.</p>
                  <p>And as in the third booke, concerning the reall presence of Christes body and bloud in the Sacrament, you haue not shewed myne ignorance or wilfulnes, but your owne: so do you now much more in the matter of Transubstantiation: Which word (say you) albeit the same was fyrst spoken of in the generall counsell, where the Byshop of Rome was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet the true matter signified by that word was older. Here at the first brunt you confesse, that the name of Transubstantiation was giuen at the counsell. So that either the matter was not before (as it was not in deed) or at the least it was before a namelesse child (as you do graunt) vntill the holy father Innocent the thyrd, which begat it, assembled a company of his frendes as godfathers to name the child. And by what authority the counsayle defined the matter of Transubstantiation, it may easely appeare. For authority of scripture haue they none, nor none they do alleadge. And what the authority of the Pope was there, all men may see, being present in the same no lesse then .800. Abbottes and Priours, who were all the Popes owne chyldren, of him created and begotten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:7682:143"/>And as for the confession of all the clergy of this Realme in an open counsell,<note place="margin">The counsayle in England.</note> the authority of Rome ceasing, you speake here a manifest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth wittingly agaynst your conscience. For you know very well (and if you will denie it, there be enough yet aliue can testify) that diuers of the clergy, being of most godly liuing, learning, and iudgement, neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the articles, which you speake of. And what meruayle was it, that those articles (notwithstanding diuers learned men repugning) passed by the most voyces of the Parliament? seing that although the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Rome was then newely ceased, yet the darkenes and blindnes of errours and ignoraunte that came from Rome, still remayned and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershadowed so this Realme, that a great number of the Parliament had not yet theyr eyes opened to see the truth. And yet how that matter was enforced by some persons, they know right well that were then present. But after, when it pleased almighty God, more clearly to shine vnto vs by the light of this word, our eyes by his goodnes were opened, darkenes discussed, and that which was done in ignoraunce and darkenes, was by knowledge and light in publique Counsell rehersed and taken away, as well concerning the doctrine as the hardnes of the law. For if the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine had bene true and godly, there is no christen harted man, but he would haue desired the establishment and continuaunce therof. But the doctrine being false and such as came onely from Rome, they be not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be likened to those truthes, which came from God, and were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Balaam and Cayphas, but to be numbred among those lyes, which came from his vicar,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> who when he speaketh lyes, <hi>ex proprijs loquitur,</hi> he speaketh properly of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And the Byshop of Rome was not cleane gone out of England, as sone as the lawes were made agaynst his authority, but remayned still by his corrupt doctrine, as I feare me he doeth yet in some mennes hertes, who were the chief procurers and setters forthward of the foresayd law. But yet is all togither to be imputed to the Byshop of Rome, forasmuch as from thens came all the foresayd errours, ignorance and corruption into these parties.</p>
                  <p>Now where you take vpon you here, to purge your selfe of Papistry by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> me and Zuinglius, if you haue no better compurgators then vs two, you be like to fayle in your purgation. For neyther of vs (I dare say) durst swere for you in this matter, though Zuinglius were aliue. Or if your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stand to this poynt, that Christ called not bread made of wheat his body (although in a formall and proper speach bread is not in deede his body) you may be as rancke a Papist as euer was, for any purgation you can make by this way. For Christ called bread made of wheate his body as the wordes of the Euangelistes playnly declare, and all old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters teach, and in your booke of the deuils sophistrie, you haue confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, saying that Christ made demonstration of bread, when he sayd, This is my body. And therfore bring some better purgation then this, or els had you bene better not to haue offered any purgation, in a matter that no man charged you withall, than by offering a purgation, aud fayling therin, to bring your selfe into more suspition.</p>
                  <p>And where as in fortification of your matter of Transubstantiation, you make your argument thus, That forasmuch as the body of Christ is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>


                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:7682:143"/>
really in the sacrament, there is of necessity Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also.<note place="margin">Reall presence proueth no Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> This your argument hath two great faultes in it. The first is, that your ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is false, and then you can not conclude therof a true consequent. The second fault is, that although the autecedent were graunted vnto you, that the body of Christ is really in the sacrament, yet the consequent can not be inferred therof, that there is of necessity Transubstantiation. For Christ can make his body to be present in the Sacrament, as well with the substance of the bread, as without it, and rather with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread then with the accidents: forasmuch as neyther Christes body there occupieth any place, (as you say yourselfe) nor no more doth the substance of bread by it selfe, but by meanes of the accidentes, as you say also.</p>
                  <p>

                              <p>Here the Papistes triumph of these wordes, when Christ sayd: <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which they call the wordes of Consecration. For (say they) assone as these wordes be fully ended, there is no bread left, nor none other substance, but onely Christes body. When Christ sayd <hi>(this)</hi> the bread (say they) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned.


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7682:144"/>
And when he sayd <hi>(is)</hi> yet the bread remayned. Also whan he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>(my)</hi> the bread remayned still. And when he sayd <hi>(bo)</hi> yet the bread was there still. But when he had finished the whole sentence: <hi>This is my body,</hi> then (say they) the bread was gone, and there remayned no substance but Christes body, as though the bread could not remayne, when it is made a Sacrament. But this negatiue, that there is no bread, they make of theyr owne braynes, by their vnwritten verities, which they most highly esteme.</p>
                              <p>Oh good Lord, how would they haue bragged if Christ had sayd: This is no bread? but Christ spake not that negatiue, This is no bread, but sayd affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly, This is my body not denying the bread, but affirming that his body was eaten, (meaning spiritually) as the bread was eaten corporally.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note>And that this was the meaning of Christ, appeareth playnly by S. Paule,
in the tenth chap. to the Corinth. the first epistle, where he (speaking of the same matter) sayth: <q>Is not the bread which we breake, <hi>the communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ?</hi>
                                 </q>
Who vnderstood the mynd of Christ better then S. Paule, to whom Christ shewed his most secret counsailes? And S. Paule is not afrayd, for our better vnderstanding of Christes wordes, somewhat to alter the same, least we might stand stiffely in the letters and sillables, and erre in mistaking the sense and meaning. For where as our Sauiour Christ brake the bread, and sayd, <hi>This is my body:</hi> S. Paule sayth, that the bread which we breake, is the communion of Christes body. Christ sayd, His body: and S. Paule sayd, the communion of his body: meaning neuerthelesse both one thing, that they which eate the bread worthely, do eate spiritually Christes very body. And so Christ calleth the bread his body (as the old authors report) bycause it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth his body, and signifieth vnto them which eat that bread according to Christes ordinance, that they do spiritually eate his body, and be spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fed and nourished by him, and yet the bread remayneth still there as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to signifie the same. But of these wordes of Consecration shall be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hereafter more at large.</p>
                              <p>Therfore to returne to the purpose; that the bread remayneth, and is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this Sacrament, appeareth by the wordes of Christ, which he spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consecration.<note place="margin">Math 16.</note> For that Christ <hi>tooke bread, and brake it, and gaue it to his disciples, and sayd: Take, eate.</hi> All this was done and spoken before the wordes of Consecration. Wherfore they must nedes be vnderstood of the very bread, that Christ tooke bread, brake bread, gaue bread to his disciples, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to take bread, aud eate bread. But the same is more playne and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the wine that it remayneth, and is drunken at the Lordes supper, as well by the wordes that goe before as by the wordes that follow after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. For before the wordes of consecration, Christ tooke the cup of wyne, and gaue it vnto his disciples, and sayd: <hi>Drincke ye all of this.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Math. 16. Marc. 14.</note> And after the wordes of consecration followeth, They dranke all of it.</p>
                              <p>Now I aske all the Papistes, what thing it was, that Christ commaunded his disciples to drincke, when he sayd, Drincke ye all of this. The bloud of Christ was not yet there by theyr owne confession, for these wordes were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the consecration: Therfore it could be nothing els but wine that he commaunded them to drincke.</p>
                              <p>Then aske the Papistes once agayne, whether the disciples dranke wine or not? If they say yea, then let them recant theyr errour, that there was no wine remayning after the consecration. If they say nay, then they condemne the


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7682:144"/>
Apostles of disobedience to Christes commaundement, which dranke not wine as he commaunded them, Or rather they reproue Christ as a Iuggler, which commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his Apostles to drincke wine, and when they came to the drincking therof, he himselfe had conuayed it away. Moreouer, before Christ deliuered the cup of wine to his disciples, he sayd vnto them: <hi>Deuide this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Luc. 11.</note>

                              <p>Here I would aske the Papistes an other question, what thing it was that Christ commaunded his disciples to deuide among them? I am sure they will not say, it was the Cup, except they be disposed to make men laugh at them. Nor I thinke they will not say, it was the bloud of Christ, as well because the wordes were spoken before the consecration, as bicause the bloud of Christ is not deuided, but spiritually giuen whole in the sacrament. Then could it be vnderstand of nothing els but of wine, which they should deuide among them, and drincke all togither.</p>
                              <p>Also when the Communion was ended, Christ sayd vnto his Apostles:
<q>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I say vnto you, that I will drincke no more henceforth of <hi>this frute of the vine,</hi>
                                 </q>
                                 <note place="margin">Math. 16. Marc. 14.</note> vntill that day, that I shall drincke it new with you in my fathers kingdome.</p>
                              <p>By these wordes it is cleare, that it was very wine that the Apostles dranke at that godly supper. For the bloud of Christ is not the frute of the vine, nor the accidents of wine, nor none other thing is the frute of the vine, but the very wine onely.</p>
                              <p>How could Christ haue expressed more playnly, that bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, then by taking the bread in his handes, and breaking it him selfe, and geuing it vnto his disciples, commaunding them to eate it? And by taking the cup of wine in his handes, and deliuering it vnto them, commaunding them to deuide it among them, and to drincke it, and calling it the frute of the vine? These wordes of Christ be so playne, that if an angell of heauen would tell vs the contrary, he ought not to be beleued. And then much lesse may we beleue the subtill lying Papistes.</p>
                              <p>If Christ would haue had vs to beleue (as a necessary article of our fayth) that there remayneth neyther bread nor wine, would he haue spoken after this sort, vsing all such termes and circumstau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as should make vs beleue, that styll there remayneth bread and wine?</p>
                              <p>What maner of teacher make they of Christ, that say he ment one thing, when his wordes be cleane contrary? What christen hart can paciently suffer this contumely of Christ?</p>
                              <p>But what crafty teachers be these Papistes, who deuise phantasies of theyr owne heades, directly contrary to Christes teaching, and then set the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to christen people, to be most assuredly beleued as Gods owne most holy word?
S. Paule did not so, but followed herein the manner of Christes speaking, in calling of bread, bread, and wine, wine, and neuer altering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes wordes herin.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
                                 <q>The bread which we breake (sayth he) is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Christes body?</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now I aske agayne of the Papistes, whether he spake this of the bread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated or not consecrated? They can not say that he spake it of the bread vnconsecrated, for that is not the communion of Christes body by their owne doctrine.
<q>And if S. Paule spake it of bread consecrated, then they must nedes confesse that after consecration, such bread remayneth, as is broken bread,


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7682:145"/>
which can be none other, then very true materiall bread.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> And strayght wayes after, S. Paule sayth in the same place, that we be partakers of one bread and one cup.</q>
And in the next chapiter, speaking more fully of the same matter, foure tymes he nameth the bread and the cup, neuer making mention of any Transubstantiation, or remayning of accidentes without any substance, which thinges he would haue made some mention of, if it had bene a necessary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our fayth, to beleue that there remayneth no bread nor wine. Thus it is euident and playne, by the wordes of scripture, that after consecration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth bread and wine, and that the Papisticall doctrine of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is directly contrary to gods word.</p>

For although he may read in some blind glose that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of the last sillable, gods worke is to be accompted wrought, being a good lesson to admonish the minister to pronounce all, yet it is so but a priuate opinion, and reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> vttered, not to put the vertue in the last sillable, nor to scorne the catholique fayth, after which manner taking example of this author, if an Ethnicke should iest of <hi>(Fiat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lux)</hi> at <hi>(fi)</hi> was nothing, and then at <hi>(at)</hi> was yet nothing <hi>(at lu)</hi> was nothing but a litle little pearing, put an <hi>(x)</hi> to it, and it was sodenly <hi>Lux,</hi> and then the light. What christen man would handle eyther place thus? and therfore reader let this entry of the matter serue for an argument with what spirite this matter is handled, but to answere that this author noteth with an exclamation: Oh good Lord how would they haue brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: if Christ had sayd, This is no bread. Here I would question with this author,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> whether Christ sayd so or no, and reason thus: Christes body is no materiall bread, Christ sayd: This is my body, Ergo he sayd, this is no bread. And the first part of this reason, this author affirmeth in the 59. leafe. And the second part is Christes wordes, and therfore to auoyd this conclusion the onely way is to say, that Christes speach was but a figure, which the catholique doctrine sayth is false, and therfore by the catholique doctrine Christ saying, this, is my body, sayth in effect, this is no bread, wherat this author sayth: They would bragge if Christ had sayd so. In speach is to be considered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that euery yea containeth a nay in it naturally, so as who so euer sayth: This is bread, sayth it is no wine: Who soeuer sayth this is wine, sayth, it is no beere. If a Lapidary sayth: This is a Diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he sayth it is no glas, he sayth it is no christall, he sayth it is no white Saphir. So Christ saying this is my body, sayth it is no bread: Which plainesse of speach caused Zuinglius to say playnly, if there be prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, there is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to say, not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread, &amp; therfore who wil playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny transubstantion, must deny the true presence of the substaunce of Christes body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> as this author doth, wherein I haue first conuinced him, and therfore vse that victory for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> his ouerthrow in transubstantiation. I haue shewed before how Christes wordes were not figuratiue when he sayd, This is my body, and yet I will touch here such testimonie, as this author bringeth out of one Hylary for the purpose of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, in the xxv. leafe of this booke in these wordes: There is a figure sayth Hylary, for bread and wine be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="01"/> outwardly sene, and there is also a truth of that figure, for the body and bloud of Christ be of a truth inwardly beleued. These be Hylaries words as this author alledgeth them, who was he sayth within 350. yeares of Christ. Now I call to thy iudgement good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, could any man deuise more pithy wordes for the proofe of the reall presence of Christes body and bloud, and the condemnation of this author that would haue an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figure? Here in Hilarius wordes is a figure compared to truth, and sight outwardly


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7682:145"/>
to beleue inwardly. Now our belief is grounded vpon gods word, which is this; This is my body: in which wordes Hylary testifieth that is inwardly beleued is a truth, and the figure is in that is sene outwardly. I take Hylary here as this author alledgeth him, whereby I aske the Reader, is not this author ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Christs speach is not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue but true and proper beyng inwardly true that we beleue? Ye will say vnto me, What is this to transubstantiation, to the reprofe wherof it was brought in? bicause he sayth bread and wine is seene. First I say that it ouerthroweth this author for truth of the presence of Christes body, and euery ouerthrow therin ouerthroweth this author in Transubstantiation, not by authority of the church of Rome, but by consequence in truth as Zuinglius sayth, who shall serue me to auoyd papistry. If one aske me, what say ye then to Hilary that bread and wine is seene? I say they be in déede séene, for they appeare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> so, and therfore be called so: as Isaac sayd of Iacob, it was his voyce, and yet by his sence of féelyng, denyed him Esau, which was not Esau, but was Iacob, as the voyce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did declare him. If ye will aske me how can there accordyng to Hylaries wordes, be in the outward visible creatures any figure, vnlesse the same be in déede as they appeare bread and wine? I will aunswere. Euen as well as this outward obiect of the sensible hearynes of Iacob, resemblyng Esau, was a figure of Christes humanitie and of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humanitie in déede. Thus may Hylary be aunswered to auoyde his authoritie from contrarying transubstantiation. But this author shall neuer auoyde that him selfe hath brought out of Hylary, which ouerthroweth him in his figuratiue speach, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his deniall of transubstantiation also, as shall appeare in the further handlyng of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> this matter. Where this author in the 18. leaf compareth these S. Paules wordes: The bread that we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ: to the expoundyng of Christes wordes, This is my body: I deny that: for Christes wordes declared the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the Sacrament when he sayd, This is my body: and S. Paul declareth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> worthy vse of it accordyng to Christes institution, and by the wordes, (The bread that we breake) doth signifie the whole vse of the Supper, wherein is breakyng, blessing, thankesgeuyng, dispensing, receiuyng and eatyng, So as onely breakyng is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and yet by that part in a figure of speach S. Paul meaneth all, beyng the same as appeareth by the Scripture, a terme in speach, to goe breake bread, although it be not alwayes so taken, whereby to signifie to go celebrate our Lordes Supper: and therfore bread in that place may signifie the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread, as it is adhibite to be consecrat, which by the secret power of God turned into the body of Christ, and so distributed and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body of Christ, as the cup is likewise of the bloud of Christ, after the benediction, which benediction was not spoken of in the bread, but yet must be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> vnderstanded. As for callyng of Christes bread his body, is to make it his body, who as S. Paule sayth calleth that is not, as it were, and so maketh it to be.</p>
                  <p>The argumentes this author vseth in the 19. and 20. leafe of the order of Christes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> speaches as the Euangelistes rehearse them, be captious deuises of this author, in case he knoweth what S.

                     <hi>De doctrina Christiana,</hi> where he geueth a rule of recapitulation as he calleth it, when that is told after, that was done afore, and therfore we may not argue so firmely vpon the order of the tellyng in the speach. S. Augustine bringeth an example that by order of tellyng.<note place="margin">Augustine lib. 3 cap. 36.</note> Adam was in Paradise or any trée was brought forth for féedyng, with diuers other, wherewith I will not encomber the Reader. The Euangelist rehearseth what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> Christ sayd and did simply and truely, whiche story we must so place in vnderstandyng, as we trifle not with the mysterie, at staying and stoppyng of letters and sillables. And therfore though the word (take, eate) go before the wordes (This is my body) we may not argue that they tooke it and eate it afore Christ had told them what he gaue them, &amp; all these often rehearsalles of bread, with he tooke bread, and breake bread, and blessed bread, and if ye will adde held bread, all this induce no consequence that he therfore gaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="81"/> bread. For hee gaue that he had consecrate, and gaue that he made of bread. If Christ when he was tempted to make stones bread, had taken the stones and blessed them and deliuered them saying, This is bread, had he than deliuered stones, or rather that hee made of stones bread?

it: And yet not content to vse this fonde reasonyng, this author calleth Papistes to witnes that they might laugh at it, bicause the Euangelist telleth the story so as Christ sayd, (drinke) and then told after what it was, this author phantasieth that the Apostles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> should be so hasty to thinke ere Christ had told them what he gaue, which and they had, I thinke hee would haue stayed the cup with his hand, or byd them tary, whiles he had told them more. I will no further trauaile with this reasoning, which is pitie to heare in such a matter of grauitie, of such consequence as it is both in body and soule. We may not trifle with Christes wordes after this sort. When S. Paule sayth, we be partakers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> of one bread, hee speaketh not of materiall bread, but of Christes body our heauenly bread, which to all is one and can not be consumed, but able to féede all the world, and if this author gyueth credite to Theodoreths, whom he calleth an holyman, then shall he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> neuer finde the Sacrament called bread after the sanctification, but the bread of lyfe, the like whereof should be in an Epistle of Chrisostome, as Peter Martyr alledgeth, not yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> printed, by whose authoritie if they haue any, as in their place this author maketh much of them, all these argumentes be all trifles, for all the namyng of bread by Christ and S. Paule and all other, must be vnderstanded before the sanctification and not after. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> if thou (Reader) lookest after vpon Theodoretus &amp; that Epistle, thou shalt finde true that I say, whereby all this questionyng with the Papistes is onely a calying for this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors pleasure, agaynst his owne authors, and all learnyng.</p>

Then if God chaunge the bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christes body in one instaunce, tell me I pray you, in which instaunce? For seyng that our promiticiation is by succession of tyme, I thinke you will not say, that the worke of God is done before the last syllable be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, (for then Christes body should be there before the wordes of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7682:147"/>
in the true ministration of the Sacrament is both a figure and a truth: the figure outwardly, and the truth inwardly. For bread and wyne be sensible signes and Sacraments, to teach vs outwardly, what feedeth vs inwardly. Outwardly we see and feele bread and wyne with our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward senses, but inwardly by faith we see and feede vpon Christes true body and bloud. But this is a spirituall feedyng by faith, which requireth no corporall presence. And here I aske you two questions, One is this, whither Hylarie say that the body of Christ is vnder the formes of bread and wyne, and that corporally? If he say not so (as the Reader shall soone iudge, looking vpon his wordes) then stand I vpright without any fall or foyle: for Hylarie sayth not as you do. The other question is, whither Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie doe not say that there is a figure: let the Reader iudge also, and see whither you be not quite ouerthrowen with your owne crooke, in saying that Christes speach is not figuratiue. And yet the third question I may adde also, why S. Hylarie should say, that bread and wine be figures, if there be no bread nor wine there at all, but be taken cleane away by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation? And where as for aunswere hereto you take the example <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> of Iacob, who for his hearynes resembled Esau, and was (as you say) a a figure of Christes very humanitie, you doe like an vnskilfull Mariner, that to auoyde a litle tempest, runneth himselfe vpon a rocke. For where you make Iacob (who rese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled Esau, and was not he in deede) to be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christes humanitie, you make by this example, that as Iacob by his hearynesse resembled Esau and was not he in deede, so Christ by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparence resembled a man, and yet he was no man in deede.</p>

And then you must needes confesse, that you haue nothing to defend your selfe, but onely one sentence, and that put out of order, and from his right place, as you say your selfe, where in deede the Euangelistes and Apostles (being true rehearsers of the story in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) did put those wordes in the right place.

Now these sayinges cannot be vnderstanded before the sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will graunt that the bread was Christes body, and that it was eaten before it was sanctified. Wherfore let euery reader that knoweth any thing, iudge whether you seeke any truth in this matter, or whether you study to serch out vayne cauilations, and yet the same being cleane contrary to the manifest wordes of holy scripture, and to all approued writers. Wherfore gentle reader way S. Paules wordes, whether he call it bread after the sanctification, or onely before, and as thou findest Saynt Paule make with this mans saying (that trifeleth away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth) so thou mayst beleeue him in all other thinges. Hitherto is discussed how the doctrine of Transubstantiation is agaynst gods word, now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in my booke, how the same is agaynst nature, Wherof I write thus.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now consider also, how the same is agaynst naturall reason,<note place="margin">Chap. 3. The papisticall doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst reason.</note> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural operation, which although they preuayle not agaynst Gods word, yet when they be ioyned with Gods word, they be of great moment to confirme any truth. Naturall reason abhorreth <hi>vacuum,</hi> that is to say, that there should be any empty place, wherin no substance should be. But if there remayne no bread nor wine, the place where they were before, and where their accidents


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7682:149"/>
be, is filled with no substance, but remayneth <hi>vacuum,</hi> cleane contrary to the order of nature.</p>
                  <p>We see also that the wine, though it be consecrated, yet will it tourne to vineger, and the bread will mowle: which then be nothing els but sower wine and mowled bread, which could not wax sower nor mowly, if there were no bread nor wine there at all.</p>
                  <p>And if the sacramentes were now brent (as in the olde church they burned all that remayned vneaten) let the Papistes tell what is brent. They must nedes say, that it is eyther bread or the body of Christ. But bread (say they) is none there: then must they nedes burne the body of Christ, and be called Christ burners (as heretofore they haue burned many of his members) except they will say, that accidents burne alone without any substaunce, contrary to all the course of nature.</p>
                  <p>The sacramentall bread and wine also will nourish, which nourishment naturally cometh to the substaunce of the meates and drinkes, and not of the accidentes.</p>
                  <p>The wine also will poyson, (as diuers bishops of Rome haue had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both in poysoning of other, and being poysoned them selues) which poysoning they can not ascribe to the most holsome bloud of our Sauiour Christ, but onely to the poysoned wine.</p>
                  <p>And most of all, it is agaynst the nature of accidents, to be in nothing. For that definition of accidents, is to be in some substance, so that if they be, they must nedes be in some thing. And if they be in nothing, than they be not. And a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thinges moe, of like foolishnes do the Papistes affirme by their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, contrary to all nature and reason. As that two bodies be in one place, and one body in many places at one tyme, and that substances be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of accidents onely, and accidents conuerted into substances, and a body to be in a place, and occupy no roume, and generation to be without corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and corruption without generation, and that substances be made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and turned into nothing, with many such like thinges, agaynst all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and principles of nature and reason.</p>

                  <p>In the third chapiter written in the xxi. leafe it troubleth this author that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Transubstantiation is in his iudgement agaynst naturall reason and naturall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in the entry of which matter he graunteth wisely that they should not preuayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst gods worde, and yet he sayth, when they be ioyned with gods word, they be of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> great moment to confirme any truth: wherin if he meaneth to confirme Gods worde by reason, or gods misteries by naturall operation, myne vnderstanding cannot reach that doctrine, and is more strange to me, then this author maketh Transubstantiation to be to him. As for the reason of (<hi>vacuum</hi>) declareth a <hi>vacuum,</hi> that nature abhorreth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not. And if we speake after the rules of nature, quantity filleth the place rather than substaunce. And shortly to answere this Author, it is not sayd in the doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, that there remayneth nothing: for in the visible forme of bread remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the proper obiect of euery sence truely: that is seene with the bodely eye, is truely seene, that is felt, is truely felt, that is sauored, is truely sauored, and those thinges corrupt, putrifie, norish and consume after the truth of the former nature, God so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it that creat all, vsing singularly that creature of bread, not to vnite it vnto him as he did mans nature, to be in bread impanate, &amp; breaded as he was in flesh incarnate. And as for reason in place of seruice as being inferiour to sayth, will agree with the fayth of Transubstantiation well inough. For if our fayth of the true presence of Christes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body be true, as it is most true grounded vpon these wordes of Christ (This is my


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7682:149"/>
body,) then reason yelding to that truth, will not striue with Transubstantiation, but playnly affirme that by his iudgement, if it be the body of Christ, it is not bread. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in the rule of common reason, the graunt of one substance is the deniall of an other,<note place="margin">Conclusions of reason.</note> and therfore reason hath these conclusions throughly, whatsoeuer is bread is no wine whatsoeuer is wine, is no milke, and so forth.</p>
                  <p>And therfore being once beleued this to be the body of Christ, reason sayth by and by, it is not bread by the rule aforesayd, wherby appeareth how reason doth not striue with Transubstantiation, being once conquered with sayth of the true presence of Christes body, which is most euident, and no whit darkened by any thing this Author <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> hath brought. As for naturall operation is not in all mens iudgements as this Author taketh it, who semeth to repute it for an inconuenience, to say that the accidents of wine do sower and ware viniger. But vlpian, a man of notable learning, is not afrayd to write in the law,<note place="margin">Reode Smith fol. 64.</note>

                     </hi>) in manner one substance, wherin he sheweth him selfe farre agaynst this Authors skill, which I put for an example to shew that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall operations haue had in naturall mens iudgements diuers considerations, one sometime repugnant to an other, and yet the Authors of both opinions called Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers all. Among which some thought (for example) they spake wisely, that estemed all thing to alter as swiftly as the water runneth in the streme, and thought therfore no man could vtter a word, being the same man in the end of the word that he was when he began to speake, and vsed a similitude. Like as a man standing in one place can not touch the same one water twise in a running streame, no more can a man be touched the same man twise, but he altereth as swiftely as both the streame. These were laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to skorne, yet they thought themselues wise in naturall speculation, Aristotle (that is much estemed and worthely) fansied a first matter in all thinges to be one, in which consideration he semeth to be as extreame in a stay, as the other fond Philosophers were in mouing. By which two extremeties I condemne not naturall speculation, wherwith I thinke God pleased for man to meruayle in contemplation of his inferiour workes, and to tame his rash wit in the inexplicable variety of it, but to vse it so, as to make it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> an open aduersary to religion, it is me semeth without all purpose. The doctrine of Transubstantiation doth not teach no earthly thing to remayne in the Sacrament, but contrarywise, that the visible forme of bread and wine is there as the visible figure of the Sacrament, and to be the same in greatnes, in thicknes, in wayght in sauor, in tast, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> in propriety also to corrupt, putrifie, and nourish, as it did before, and yet the substance of those visible creatures, to be conuerted into the substance (as Emissene sayth) of the body of Christ. And here will reason do seruice is sayth, to say if there be a conuersion in deede as fayth teacheth, and none of the accidents be conuerted, then the substance is conuerted, for in euery thing all is substance and accidents, but the accidents be not chaunged, and yet a change there is, it must nedes be then that substance is changed. Which deduction reason will make, and so agree with Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in conuenient due seruice. And thus I haue gotten reasons good will, whatsoeuer this author sayth, and from the ground of fayth haue by reason deduced such a conclusion to proue transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, as vnles he destroy the true fayth of the presence of Christes very body which he can not, must nedes be allowed. And as for naturall operation of putrifying, engendring wormes, burning, and such experiences, which being the substance of bread absent, this Author thincketh can not be so; when he hath thought throughly, he can of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> his thought conclude it onely to be a meruayle, and it be so as agaynst the common rules of philosophy, wherin as me semeth it were a nearer way, as we be admonished to leaue searching of (how) of the worke of God in the mistery of Christes presence being that the celestiall parte of the sacrament so not to search (how) in the experience of the operation of nature, of the visible earthly part of the Sacrament. When God sent <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in desert, the people saw many meruayles in it, besides the common operation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet they neuer troubled them selues with (howes). And as one very well wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, it is consonant that as there is a great miracle in the worke of God to make there present the substance of the body of Christ, to likewise to knowledge the miracle in the absence of the substance of bread, and both the heauenly and earthly part of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be miraculous, and so many miracles to be ioyned together in one, agreeth with the


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7682:150"/>
excelency of the Sacrament. As for the obiections this Author maketh in this matter, be such as he findeth in those scholasticall writers, that discusse as they may or labour thereaboute wherwith to satisfie idle imaginations, and to make learned men prompt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and ready to say sumwhat to these trifles, whose arguments this author taketh for his principall foundation. For playne resolution and auoyding wherof, if I would now for my parte bring forth their solutions and answers, there were a part of schole Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, so brought into English, to no great prayse of eyther of out learninges, but our vayne labour, to set abrode other mens trauayles to trouble rude wittes with matter not necessary, and by such vnreuerent disputing and alteration to hinder the truth. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all that this Author reherseth of absurdity, repugneth in his estimation onely is the conclusion of philosophie, which should nothing moue the humble simplicite of sayth in a christen man, who meruayleth at Gods workes and reputeth them true, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he can not comprehend the wayes and meanes of them.</p>

                  <p>HEre in the beginning of this chapiter, it is a strange thing to me, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you should thinke strangenes in my saying, that naturall reason and operation ioyned to Gods word should be of great moment to confirme any truth, not that they adde any authority to Gods word, but that they helpe our infirmity: as the sacraments do to Gods promises, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in themselues be most certayne and true. For did not the eating and drincking of Christ, his laboring and sweating, his agony and pangs of death,<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> confirme the true fayth of his incarnation? And did not his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Apostles confirme and stablish their fayth of his resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?<note place="margin">Iohn 20. Luc. 24. Iohn. 20. Luc. 24.</note> Dyd not the sight of Christ and feeling of his woundes induce Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas to beleue that Christ was risen? When neyther the report of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout woman, nor yet of the Apostles which did see him, could cause him to beleue Christes resurrection? And when they tooke our Sauiour Christ for a spirite, did not he cause them by their sight and feeling of his flesh and bones, to beleue that he was very man, and no spirite, as they phantasied? Which sensible profes were so farre from derogation of fayth that they were a sure establishment therof. Wherfore if your vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can not reach this doctrine, it is indede very slender in godly thynges.</p>
                  <p>And as for my reason of <hi>vacuum,</hi> you haue not yet answered thereto, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nature suffereth not any place to be without some substance, which by meanes of his quantity filleth the place. And quantity without substance to fill any place, is so fare from the rulers of nature, that by order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, quantity without substance hath neither filling nor being. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I do not say, that by the doctrine of Transubstantiation there remayneth nothing, (so that all that you speake to answere that matter, is to no purpose, but <hi>res vacua</hi>) yet by the doctrine of Transubstantiation ioyned vnto nature, there should remayne vtterly nothing in deede: for substance remayneth none, by your doctrine of Transubstantiation, and without substance can be no accidents by the rules of nature. Therfore comparing your doctrine and nature together, eyther you must recant your doctrine of Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or confesse that nothing remayneth, or at the least graunt that your teaching repugneth to the order of nature, which suffiseth for me in this place, where my purpose is onely to shew, how the doctrine of Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is agaynst nature and reason.</p>
                  <p>Now where you so often speake of the visible forme of bread remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>


                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:7682:150"/>
by this word (forme) you swetely deceaue your selfe,<note place="margin">The worde Forme.</note> thinking that it doth much auaunce your fayth of Transubstantiation, vnderstanding by that word the accidences, similitudes, and likenes without substance remayning, misunderstanding both holy scripture and the auncient doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. S. Paule speaking of Christes incarnation sayth,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> that he being in forme of God, did humble him selfe, taking vpon him the forme of man. By which wordes S. Paule ment not, that Christ was like vnto god, and not God indede, nor yet that he was like vnto man, and not very man in dede, but that he was and is very God and very man, hauing .ii. substances, one of his Godhead, and the other of his manhod, vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one person. And the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctors writing of this sacrament, when they speake of the formes of bread and wine, do vse this vocable (forme) (as S. Paule vseth it) to signify very bread and very wine, or the substances of bread and wine, and not the similitude or likenes of bread and wine without the substances, as you fantasy, and imagine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And you after this sort wrasting holy scriptures and doctors, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of your error of Transubstantiation, do lead your selfe craftely into an other heinous errour (if this your proposition be true, that the graunt of one substance is a deniall of any other) which is, to deny Christ eyther to be very God or man. For by your sentence, if he in substance be God, then can he not haue the substance of man: for the graunt of one substance is a deniall of any other, as ye say.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And like as ye do erre in misunderstanding of the Scripture and Doctours, so do you erre in reason and iudgement of thinges: your owne eyes, nose, mouth, and fingers, bearing witnes agaynst you of your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full error and folly. For what man is liuing (which hath his right wittes) that can beleeue as you teach, that the proper obiect of euery sence remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (that is to say, colour, taste, sauoure &amp;c) and yet the former substance of bread and wine is gone? And here, to further your belefe of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, you do exaggerat your accustomed absurdity of Impana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christes body, as if euery man that beleueth not your errour of Transubstantiation, must of necessity fall into the errour of Impanation, or as if I defended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd Impanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Impanation.</note> But whether I defended any such fonde opinion or no, or whether I haue herein sufficiently answered the Papistes, I referre to the iudgement of all wise and learned men (that be any thing indifferent) which haue redde my booke.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning naturall reason, where you say it will agree with the doctrine of Transubstantiation well inough, if the fayth of the true presence of Christes very body be true. For aunswere hereto I say, that if your phantasticall belefe of the reall presence of Christes naturall body in the sacrament were as true as the gospell (as none opinion can be more erronious and fond) yet would both fayth and reason iudge, that there were still bread. Fayth, bicause holy scripture manifestly sayth so: Reason, bicause it is so, not onely to all our sences, but also in all the effects and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of bread. And reason can not discerne, but that Christes body may be as well present with the substance of bread, as with the accidents, and that rather also, forasmuch as you confesse your selfe, that after the rules of nature, quantity filleth the place rather then substaunce. And so


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7682:151"/>
may reason iudge the body of Christ, to be the body of Christ, and yet the bread to be the bread still, and wine to be wine and no bread, nor none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confusion of natures to be there agaynst reason.</p>
                  <p>And as touching naturall operation, in the handling therof, you shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> your ignoraunce in naturall philosophy, which teacheth that in mutation from one quality to an other, is required one substance to receaue both the qualities. For white of it selfe can not be made blacke, nor colde hotte, but one substance may be now hote now colde, now blacke now white. As cold water may be made hote although colde in it selfe can not be hote. Therfore you can not blame me, to thinke in this a great inconuenience and absurdity in nature, that swetenes of it selfe should change into sowernes, when the substance of wine is gone, and no substance remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to receaue this mutation, this matter being so cleane contrary to the precepts and rules of naturall philosophy.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ulpian.</note>And I meruayle that you can not see how much Ulpian whome you alleadge, maketh agaynst your selfe, and with my saying, that both in wine and viniger remayneth substance, which is changed from swete to sower, so that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sweete of it selfe is not made sower, but that substaunce which before was sweete, is after sower. And therfore what great skill you haue in citing of Ulpian, to proue that the accidents of wine without substance do sower and waxe viniger, let the wise reader iudge.</p>
                  <p>But Ulpian semeth to me to haue an other sense then all men can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, but I will not discusse the minde of Ulpian, because I am no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, least you should cast the prouerbe in my teeth, <hi>Ne sutor vltra crepidam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to what purpose you should bring in the diuersity of iudgements in naturall operations, and the extreme fondnes of philosophers, some in mouing, some in staying, I can not deuise, except it be the permission of God, that as some of the philosophers by their fond opinions in nature, made themselues laughing stocks to all men, of reason so should ye Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do. And yet so much more is the Papisticall opinion of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation to be laughed to scorne of all men, as it passeth the fondnes of all the philosophers, and that so farre, that the fondest of the philosophers would haue laughed at it, and haue clapped it out of their scholes with one consent, as an opinion more mete for frantike and mad men, then for men of naturall reason. And as fond opinions as some philosophers had, yet was there none that so farre erred in reason, to say that acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might stand without any substance, but all with one vniforme consent agreed, that accidences had none other being or remayning, but in their substances. And yet if the fayth of our religion taught vs the contrary, then reason must yelde to fayth. But your doctrine of Transubstantiation is as directly contrary to the playne wordes of scripture, as it is agaynst the order of naturall reason.</p>
                  <p>And where you say that the doctrine of Transubstantiation doth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> teach, that no earthly thing remayneth, but that the visible forme of bread and wine remayneth the same in greatnes, in thicknes, in weight, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, in tast, in property also to corrupt, putrify, and nourish, as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tell playnly I pray you, what thing it is which you call the visible fourme of bread and wine, whether it be an accidence or a substance, and if it be an accidence, shew whether it be a quantity or quality, or what


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7682:151"/>
other accidence it is, that all men may vnderstand what thing it is which (as you say) is the same in greatnes, thicknes, weight, sauour, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther properties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> And where you alleadge Emissen for the conuersion of the substaunce of bread and wine,<note place="margin">Emissen.</note> this conuersion (as Emissene sayth, and as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before) is like to our conuersion in baptisme, where outwardly is no alteration of substance (for no sacramentall alteration maketh altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the substance) but the meruaylous and secret alteration is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our soules. And as the water in baptisme is not changed, but sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally (that is to say, made a sacrament of spirituall regeneration, which before was none) so in the lordes supper, neyther the substance nor accidences of bread and wine be changed, but sacramentally: but the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration is inwardly in the soules of them that spiritually be refreshed and nourished with Christes flesh and bloud. And this our fayth teacheth vs, and naturall reason doth good seruice to fayth herein agaynst your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Transubstantiation. So that you haue not gotten reasons, good wil, nor consent to your vayne doctrine of Transubstantiation, although you had proued your reall presence. Which hitherto you haue not don, but haue taken greate payne to shoote away all your boltes in vayne, missing quite and cleane both the pricke and the whole butte.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And yet in the end you take a good ready way for your owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, like vnto a man that had shot all his shaftes cleane wide from the butte, and yet would beare all men in hand that he had hitte the pricke.

The olde catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Authors tell, wherfore Christ called bread his body, and how chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten people fed of his body. And the blessed virgine Mary asked how she should conceaue a child, neuer hauing company with man.<note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> And you tell yourselfe how Christ is in heauen, how in vs, and how in the sacrament, declaring all to be but after a spirituall maner.

                  <p>But at length when you haue swette well fauoredly in answering to myne arguments of naturall reason and naturall operation,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> you be fayne to confesse a great part to be true, and to turne altogether into miracles,


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7682:152"/>
and that into such kind of miracles, as the old catholike writers neuer knowledged nor touched in none of their workes. For besides the chief miracle, which you say is in the conuertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the substance of bread into the substance of Christes body, and of the wine into his bloud, there be other miracles when the formes of wine tourue into viniger, and when bread mouldeth, or a man doth vomite it, or the mouse eateth it, or the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it, or wormes breed in it, and in all like chaunces, God still worketh miracles, yea euen in poysoning with the consecrated wine. And the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of such miracles (as you do iudge) pertayneth to the excellency of the Sacrament, where as among the schoole authors this is a common receaued proposition, <hi>non esse ponenda miracula sine necessitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where you say that I make my principall foundation vpon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of the scholasticall writers, although myne arguments deduced out of the scholasticall authors be vnto you insoluble (and therfore you passe them ouer vnanswered) yet I make no foundation at all vpon them, but my very foundation is onely vpon Gods word, which foundation is so sure, that it will neuer fayle. And myne arguments in this place, I bring in onely to this end, to shew how farre your imagined Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation is, not onely from Gods word, but also from the order and precepts of nature, and how many and portentuous absurdities you fall into by meanes of the same. Which it semeth you do confesse by holding your peace, without making answere therto. But now lette vs consider what is next in my booke.</p>

The papisticall doctrine is also agaynst, all our sences.</note>The Papisticall doctrine is also agaynst all our outward senses, called our fiue wits. For our eyes say, they see there bread and wine: our noses smell bread and wine: our mouthes tast, and our handes fele bread and wine. And although the articles of our fayth be aboue all our outward senses, so that we beleue thinges which we can neyther see, feele, heare, smell nor tast, yet they be not contrary to our senses, at the least so contrary, that in such thinges, which we from tyme to tyme do see, smell, fele, heare and tast, we shall not trust our fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but beleue cleane contray. Christ neuer made no such article of our fayth. Our fayth teacheth vs to beleue thinges that we see not, but it doth not bid vs, that we shall not beleue that we see dayly with our eyes, and heare with our eares, and grope with our handes. For although our senses can not reach so farre as our fayth doth, yet so farre as the compasse of our sences doth vsually reach, our fayth is not contrary to the same, but rather our senses do confirme our fayth.<note place="margin">Ihon. 20.</note> Or els what auayled it to S. Thomas, for the confirmation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes resurrection, that he did put his hand into Christes syde, and felt his woundes, if he might not trust his sences, nor geue no credite thereto?</p>
                  <p>And what a wide doore is here opened to Valentinianus, Martion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretikes, which sayd, that Christ was not crucified, but that Simon Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneus was crucified for him, although to the sight of the people, it semed that Christ was crucified, Or to such heretikes as sayd, that Christ was no man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to mens sightes he appeared in the forme of man, and semed to be hungry, drie, weary, to wepe, sleepe, eate, drincke, yea and to dye like as other men do. For if we once admitte this doctrine, that no credite is to be geuen to our senses, we open a large field, and geue a greate occasion vnto an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable rablement of most heinous heresies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:7682:152"/>And if there be no trust to be geuen to our senses in this matter of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why then do the Papistes so stoutly affirme, that the accidents remayne after the consecration, which can not be iudged but by the sences? For the scripture speaketh no word of the accidents of bread &amp; wine but of the bread &amp; wine themselues. And it is agaynst the nature &amp; diffinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, to be alone without any substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Wherfore if we may not trust our sences in this matter of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, than if the substance of the bread &amp; wine be gone, why may we not then say, that the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be gone also? And if we must nedes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue our senses, as conserning the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of bread and wine, why may we not do the like of the substance, and that rather than of the accidents: forasmuch as after the consecration, the Scripture sayth in no place that there is no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread nor of wine, but calleth them still by such names as signifie the substances, and not the accidents?</p>
                  <p>And finally, if our senses be dayly deceaued in this matter, than is the sensible sacrament nothing els, but an elution of our senses. And so we make much for theyr purpose, that sayd that Christ was a crafty iugglar, that made thinges to appeare to mens sightes, that in dede were no such thinges, but formes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, figures, and apparances of them.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude in fewe wordes this processe of our senses, let al the Papists lay their heades togither, and they shall neuer be able to shew one article of our fayth, so directly contrary to our senses that all our senses by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall affirme a thynge to be, and yet our fayth shall teache vs the contrary thereunto.</p>

If we beleue our sences in the accidents, why may we not do the like of the substance? I answere thus, that the sences can no skill of substance as lerned men speake of substance, nor this author neither, if a man should iudge him by this question. For and a sensuall man one that followeth his rude senses would say, Come hither master schollar, I here much talking in this world of substance and accidence, and if he were of a mery nature, would say his litle boy had learned his accidence, but him selfe woreth not perfectly what substance meaneth, as clerkes terme it, and bringing forth a piece of bread, an other of chese, and a pot of ale, would desire the scoller to learne him the substance of them, and shew it with his finger, and shew him also what differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> betwene the substance of bread, chese, and the ale, I thincke the schollar with the aduice of all at cambridge and Oxford also, could not doe it, and the more the schollar should trauayle with such a rude man so sensuall in the matter, I thinke he should be the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of, oneles the sensuall man would set a part his rude wittes and learne of the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar some reasonable vnderstanding, which is that the substance is the inward nature, wherin those that be accidents do naturally stay the quantity immediately, and the rest by meane of quantity, in which the rest may be sayd to stay, which wordes were new diuinity to this man, who touching the bread would aske the scholler roundly, Callest thou not this substance, this good thicke piece that I handle? The scholler would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, Syr as I shall answere you. You will say I play the sophister, for I must speake lerning to you, that you can no skill of. And be not angry though I tell you so, for and ye were learned, ye would not aske me this question, for substance as it is properly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded to be of this or that thing, is properly neither sene by it selfe nor felt, and yet by reason comprehended truely to be in that we fele or see, neuertheles in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon speach


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7682:153"/>
and in the speach of such as for the purpose speake after the common capacitie, the word substance is vsed to signifie that is seene or felt, and so ye may say ye see the substance or fele the substance of bread, and yet ye do in dede see but the colour, and by it the largenes, and fele the heate or coldnes, moysture or drines, weight or lightnes, hardnes or softnes, thiknes, &amp; thinnes. If ye wil learne what substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ye must leaue your outward se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; consider in your vnderstanding how in euery thing that is, there is a stay, which we cal a substance, being the principall part of euery thing, which fayling, we say that speciall thing not to be. As where the substance of bread is not, there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> special thing bread is not, bicause bread is as euery other naturall visible thing is of two partes substance and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes: now if the one parte, that is to say substance be not there, which can be but by miracle, then is no bread properly there, bicause the one and chief part is not there, and yet I say not nothing is there, for the other part remayning hath a being as Gods visible creature, and may be called the visible part of bread: and therfore the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward kind and forme of bread and the appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread and a true sensible part of bread, and therfore be called also by the name of bread, not that it is so properly, but after the common speach and capacity of men, and may be called the nature of bread, signifying the property and the matter of bread signifiing the grossenes. The rude man I thinke would hereat say, Here is sophistry in dede, for here is substance, and no substance, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of bread and no bread, apparance of bread and no bread, called bread and no bread, this is playne iugling where it hapneth. Wherin this rude man for want of true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the wordes and perfect consideration of the matter speaketh thus fondly, who if he should therupon require the scholler to shew him some difference of the very substance betwene bread, cheese, and ale, what could the lerned scholler answere here, but euen frankly declare his ignoraunce, and say I know none, which is as much to say, as I know there is a difference, but I wot not what it is. Wherunto I trow the rude man would say to the scholler. Then art thou with all thy lerning as very a foole as I, to speake of a difference and can not tell what it is. Now if the scholler should vtter euen the extremity of his learning in proper termes, and say, I know bread is no cheese, and chese is no ale, and of their accidentall partes I can indede shew differences, but of the very substance none. The rude man if his nature were not ouer dull, would laugh roundly to heare a scholler vtter for a poynt of learning that bread is no cheese, and cheese is no ale, which who so knoweth not, is a very foole, and merely to knit vp the matter would kepe the accidents of his bread chese and all for him selfe, and geue the substance to the scholler if he can deuide it, as a reward for his cunning to his better nurture. And this I write after this grosse sort, to shew that this matter of substance is not commonly vnderstanded as sences exercised in learning perceaue it, and how mans outward sences can not as this author would haue it, be iudges of the inward nature of substance, which reason perswadeth to be, vsing the seruice of the sences for induction of the knowledge, in which iudgement vpon their report hapneth many tymes much deceite.<note place="margin">Coena Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densi, hospitis.

That stone, which among many thought to haue some skill, hath been taken for a precious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> diamond, hath after by cunning lapidaries been iudged to be but a white saphire, and contrariwise: So easily may our iudgement vpon the report of our sences fall in errour, not that the sences be properly deceaued, but rather the man that is grossely sensuall, and iudgeth fondly by them. For the very substance is not the proper obiect of any of the fiue wittes, but of their report considered in reason denied, and sometyme gessed at, wherof ensueth greate errour and (<hi>quid pro quo</hi>) among the poticaries and learned also in thinges strange, whereof they haue but accidentall markes. Wherefore vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the premises it may easily appeare how the question of this author, why the sences be not beleued in knowledge of substance, as in knowledge of accidents, may be resonably answered. And then if the iudgement of reason in the estimation of Gods naturall workes and denying this or that substance, when by accidents it should seeme otherwise, reason doth stay sensuallity, and when men of experience, knowledge, and


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7682:153"/>
credite, haue determined such a certayne stone to be a very true diamond, other igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant will be ashamed to say the contrary. And if a man fearing himselfe deceaued to haue bought one kinde of drugges for an other, and yet mistrusting wisely his owne iudgement, hauing caused it to be vewed by men of knowledge, good fayth and honesty, if they affirme it to be the very thing, this man will then condemne his owne imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vpon credite call it so, and take it so to be: wherfore if in these thinges I say, reason doth in a man stay sensuality, and if knowledge with honesty ruleth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rude vnderstanding, and finally, if credite among men be so much regarded, how much more conuenient is it, that fayth in Godds word (wherin can be no deceite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as there is in men) should alter and change mans iudgement in reason, and bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the obedience of fayth. Of that is bread after the iudgement of our reason, after the report of our sences, Christ determineth vnto vs the substance of that to be his body, saying: This is my body, why shall not now a true christen man answere euer according to his fayth, to say and professe the same to be the substance of Christes body vpon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of Christes wordes, as well as the carnall man will vpon report of his sences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in reason there to be the substance of bread? wherby is not taken away the credite of our sences as this author supposeth, which haue their obiects still true as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For the collour, greatnes, sauour, and tast, all remayne truely with the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of them as before. Upon whose report reason neuertheles now reduced to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequie of fayth, forbeareth reuerently to conclude agaynst the truth of fayth, but according to fayth confesseth the substance to be the very substance of Christes body, and the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to remayne in their very true nature, bicause fayth teacheth not the contrary, and that it agreeth with the rule of fayth so to be, and therfore remayneth a very true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, thicknes and wayght, which may be called in common speach, substance, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the outward nature. And in that sense Theodoret reasoning with an heretique se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to call it, bicause hauing spoken of substance remayning, he declareth what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by it, adding it may be seene and felt as before, which is not the nature of substance properly, but by like common speach that remayneth may be called matter, as Origen called it, wherein also remayne the true sauour and tast with true propriety to corrupt, or putrifie, and also nourish, God so ordering the vse of the creature of bread and likewise wine in this mistery, as the inward nature of them which indeede is the substance, but onely comprehended in reason and vnderstanding, is conuerted into the most precious substance of Christes body and bloud, which is indeede a substance there present, by gods omnipotency onely to be comprehended by fayth, so farre as may be vnderstanded of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mannes weakenes and imbecilitie. And where this author putteth a danger if sences be not trusted, there is a gappe open to the Ualentinians and Marcionistes, and therfore bringeth in the feeling of S. Thomas: hereunto I say that the truth of that feeling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon a true beliefe, according to the scriptures, that Christ was very man: for els the body glorified of Christ (as S. Gregory noteth) was not of the owne glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nature,<note place="margin">Homel. 26.</note> then eyther visible or palpable: but therin Christ condescended to mannes infirmity, and as he was truth it selfe, left that a true testimony to such as humbly were disposed by grace to receaue it, not to conuince heretiques, who can deuise way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward answers to the externall actes of Christ, as now a dayes they delude the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous entring of Christ to his disciples, the dores being shutte. Our fayth of the true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> manbode in Christ is truely beleued, by true preaching thereof and by the scriptures, not by the outward sences of men which altogither we must confesse, could be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ineuitable profe thereof. And therfore Christ appearing to his disciples going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

And so all Christes doinges which were most true, doe beare testimony to the truth, but in their degree of testimony, and the feeling of S. Thomas, being (as S.

Thomas touched then Christ, as truely by miracle, after his resurrection in his body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> glorified, as if he had touched his body before glorification. Finally, in Christes actes or his ordinances, be no illusions, all is truth and perfect truth, and our sences in the

And although you haue taken neuer so great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and paynes in this place to answere myne argumentes (wherin you do nothing els but shew your ignorance in philosophy and logike) yet all is in vayne, except you could proue Transubstantiation to be a matter of our fayth, which being not proued, all that you haue spoken here, serueth to no purpose, nor concludeth nothing.

                  <p>And as concerning these wordes of Christ (This is my body) by your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> owne teaching in these wordes, he called bread his body, which can be no formall and proper speach, but spoken by a figure, as the order of the text playnly declareth, and all the old authors do testify.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that although the substance of bread and wine be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> gone, yet the sences haue their proper obiect still remayning (as they had before) that is to say, the colours, greatnes, thicknes, weight, sauour, and tast, expresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I pray you playnly what thing it is that is coloured, great, thinne or thicke, heauy or light, sauoury or tasted?

                  <p>But other shift haue you none to defend your Transubstantiation, but to deuise such monstrous kindes of speaches, as neuer was heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7682:155"/>
For you say, that the nature, matter and substance of bread and wine remayne not, but be changed into the body and bloud of Christ: the olde writers say directly contrary, that the nature, matter and substance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne. Christ (sayth Theodoret) called bread and wine his body and bloud,<note place="margin">Theodoretus.</note> and yet changed not their natures. And agayne he sayth, The bread and wine after the consecration lose not their proper nature, but keepe their former substance, forme and figure which they had before. And Origene sayth that the matter of bread auayleth nothing,<note place="margin">Origene.</note> but as con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning the materiall part therof, it goeth downe into the bealy, and is auoyded downward. And Gelasius sayth,<note place="margin">Gelasius.</note> that the nature and substance of bread and wine cease not to be. Now seeing that your doctrine (who teach that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature matter and substance of bread and wine be changed and remayne not) is as cleane contrary to these olde writers, with many other, as black is contrary to white, and light to darknes, You haue no remedy to defend your errour and wilfull opinion, but to imagine such portentuous and wonderfull kindes of speaches to be spoken by these au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as neuer were vttered before by no man, that is to say, that the outward aparance and accidences of any thing, should be called the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, matter and substance therof. But such monsters had you rather bring forth, then you would in one iote relent in your errour once by you vttered, and vndertaken by you defended. And yet bring you nothing for the profe of your saying, but that if the authors wordes should be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand as they be spoken, this should follow thereof, that bread and wine should be seene and felt, which as no man doubteth of, but all men take it for a most certayne truth, so you take it for a greate inconuenience and absurdity. So farre be you forced in this matter to vary in speach and iudgement from the sentence and opinion of all men.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And as touching the belefe of S. Thomas,<note place="margin">Thomas.</note> although he beleued cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly that Christ was a man, yet he beleued not that Christ was risen, and appeared to the Apostles, but thought rather that the Apostles were deceaued by some vision or spirit, which appeared to them in likenes of Christ, which he thought was not he indede. And so thought the Apostles themselues vntill Christ sayd:
<q>Videte manus meas &amp; pedes, quia ego ipse sum: Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate &amp; videte, quia spiritus carnem &amp; ossa non habent, sicut me videtis habere.<note place="margin">Luc. vit.</note>
                     </q>
See my handes and my feete, for I am euen he: Grope and see, for a spirite hath no flesh and bones, as you see that I haue. And so thought also S. Thomas,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> vntill such tyme as he put his handes into Christes side and felt his woundes, and by his sense of feeling perceaued that it was Christes very body, and no spirite nor phantasy, as before he beleued. And so in S. Thomas the truth of feeling depended not vpon the true belefe of Christes resurrection, but the feeling of his senses brought him from misbelefe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right and true fayth of that matter. And as for S. Gregory,<note place="margin">Gregorius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. 16.</note> he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no such thinges as you report, that the glorified body of Christ was of the owne nature neither visible nor palpable, but he sayth cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Christ shewed his glorified body to S. Thomas palpable, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it was of the same nature, that it was of before his resurrection, whereby it is playne after S. Gregories minde, that if it were not pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, it were not of the same nature. And S. Gregory sayth further in the same homely.
<q>Egit miro modo superna clementia, vt discipulus ille dubitans,


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7682:156"/>
dum in magistro suo vulnera palparet carnis, in nobis vulnera sanaret infidelitatis. Plus enim nobis Thomae infidelitas ad fidem, quam fides credentium discipulcrum profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it: quia dum ille ad fidem palpando reducitur, nostra mens omni dubitatione postposita in fide solidatur.</q>
The supernall clemency wrought meruaylously, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which doubted by groping the woundes of flesh in his master, should heale in vs the woundes of infidelity. For the lacke of fayth in Thomas profited more to our fayth then did the fayth of the disciples that beleued. For when he is brought to fayth by groping, our minde is stablished in fayth without all doubting. And why should S. Gregory write thus, if our sences auayled nothing vnto our fayth, nor could nothing iudge of substances? And do not all the olde catholike authors proue the true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ, by his visible conuersation with vs here in earth: that he was heard preach, seene eating, and drincking, labouring and sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Do they not also proue his resurrection by seing, hearing and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of him? which if it were no proofe, those arguments were made in vayne agaynst such Heretikes that denied his true incarnation. And shall you now take away the strength of their arguments to the maintenance of those olde condemned heresies, by your subtill sophistications? The touching and feeling of Christes handes, feete and wounds was a proofe of his resurrection, not as you say, to them that beleued, but as S Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory sayth, to them that doubted.</p>
                  <p>And if all thinges that Christ did and spake to our outward senses,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> proue not that he was a naturall man (as you say with Martion, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander, Ualentinus, Apolinaris, withother like sort) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I would know how you should confute the sayd heresies? Marty will you say peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the scripture which sayth playnly, <hi>Verbum caro factumest.</hi> But if they would say agayne, that he was called a man and flesh, bicause he tooke vpon him the forme of a man and flesh, and would say that S. Paule so declareth it,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> saying: <hi>Forinam serui accipiens,</hi> and would then say further, that forme is the accidence of a thing, and yet hath the name of substance, but is not the substance indeede, what would you then say vnto them? if you deny that the formes and accidences be called substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then go you from your owne saying. And if you graunt it, then will they auoyde all the scriptures that you can bring to proue Christ a man, by this cauilation, that the apparances, formes and accidences of a man, may be called a man, aswell as you say that the formes and accidences of bread, be called bread. And so prepare you certayne propositions and groundes for heretikes to build their errours vpon, which after when you would; you shall neuer be able to ouerthrowe.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Thomas touched truely Christes body glorified, how could y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching (as you say) is not of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> substance but of the accidents only? and also Christes body glorified (as you say) is neyther visible nor palpable?

is not in the ministration of the holy communion an illusion of our senses, if our senses take for bread and wine that which is not so indeede.</p>
                  <p>Finally where as I required earnestly, all the Papistes to lay their heades togither, and to shew one article of our fayth so directly contrary to our senses, that all our senses by dayly experience, shall affirme a thing to be, and yet our fayth shall teach vs the contrary therunto, where I say I required this so earnestly of you, and with such circumstances, and you haue yet shewed none, I may boldly conclude, that you can shew none. For sure I am, if you could (being so earnestly prouoked therunto) you would not haue fayled to shew it in this place. As for the article of our resurrection, and of the feeding of angels serue nothing for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For my saying is of the dayly experience of our senses, and when they affirme a thing to be, but the resurrection of our flesh, and the feeding of angels, be neither in dayly experience of our senses, nor our senses affirme them not so to be. Now after the matter of our senses followeth in my booke the authorities of ancient writers in this wise.</p>
                  <p>Now for as much as it is declared, how this Papisticall opinion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation is agaynst the word of God,<note place="margin">Chap. 5.

                  <p>He writeth in his second Apology,<q> that the bread, water, and wine, in this Sacrament, are not to be taken as other common meates and drinckes be, but they be meates ordeined purposely to geue thankes to God and therfore be called <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> and be called also the body and bloud of Christ.

                  <p>By which saying it is euident, that Iustinus thought, that the bread and wine remayned still, for els it could not haue bene turned into our flesh and bloud to nourish our bodies.</p>

                  <p>I will spend no mo wordes herein,<note place="margin">Iustinus.</note> but hauing auoyded this authors reasoning against Transubstantiation. Now let vs examine his authorities. First he beginneth with Iustine the Martyr, Whose wordes be not truly by this author here reported, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be these truely translate out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greke. When the priest hath ended his thankes geuing and prayers, and all the people hath sayd Amen, they whom we call Deacons, geue to euery one then present, a parte of the bread and of the wine and water consecrated, and cary part to those that be absent: and this is that foode, which is among vs called (<hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristia</hi>) wherof it is lawfull for no man to be partaker, except he be perswaded those thinges to be true that be taught vs, and be baptized in the water of regeneration in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, and ordreth his life after the manner which Christ hath taught. For we do not take these for common bread or drincke, but like as Iesus Christ our sauiour incarnate by the word of God, had flesh and bloud for our saluation, euen so we be taught <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the foode, (wherwith our flesh and bloud be nourished by alteration) when it is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7682:157"/>
by the prayer of his word, to be the flesh and bloud of the same Iesus incarnate.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the Apostles in those their workes, which be called gospels, teach that Iesus did so commaund them, and after he had taken the bread, and ended his thankes geuing, sayd: Do this in my remembrance, This is my body. And likewise taking the cup af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had geuen thankes, sayd: This is my bloud, and did giue them to his Apostles onely.<note place="margin">An issue.</note> And here I make an issue with this author, that he wittingly corrupteth Iustine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the allegation of him, who writeth not in such forme of wordes as this author allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of his second Apology, nor hath any such speach. The bread, water, and wine in this sacrament, are meates ordeined purposely to giue thankes to God, and therfore be called <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> nor hath not these wordes, They be called the body and bloud of Christ: but hath in playne wordes, that we be taught, this foode consecrate by gods word, to be the flesh and bloud of Christ, as Christ in his incarnation tooke flesh and bloud: nor hath not this forme of wordes placed to haue that vnderstanding, how the same meate and drincke is changed into our flesh and bloud. For the wordes in Iustine speaking of alteration of the foode, haue an vnderstanding of the foode, as it is before the consecration, shewing how Christ vsed those creatures in this mistery, which by alteration nourish our flesh and bloud.</p>
                  <p>For the body of Christ, which is the very celestiall substance of the host consecrate, is not changed, but without all alteration spiritually nourisheth the bodies and soules of them that worthely receaue the same to immortality, wherby appeareth this authors conclusion, (that bread and wine remayne still, which is tourned into our flesh and bloud) is not deduced vpon Iustines wordes truely vnderstanded, but is a glose inuented by this author and a peruerting of Iustines wordes, and their true meaning. Wherupon I may say, and conclude euen as this author erreth in his reasoning of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wit agaynst Transubstantiation, euen so erreth he in the first allegation of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities by playne misreporting: let it be further named or thought one as the thing deserueth.</p>

For where Iustine hath a good long processe in this matter, I take no more but that is directly to the purpose of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, which is the matter being here in question. And the long wordes of Iustine, I knit vp togither in as fewe wordes as I can, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the sense truly, and not varying farre from the wordes.

                  <p>And what neede I willingly to corrupt Iustine, when his wordes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your allegation, serue more for my purpose agaynst your fayned tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> then as I alleadge them my selfe. For if the Deacons giue to euery one present a part of the bread, wine and water consecrated, and send parte to them that be absent (as you reporte Iustines wordes) do not then bread, wine and water remayne after consecration? seing that they be distributed to diuers men in partes? For I thincke you will not say that the body of Christ is deuided into partes, so that one man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> an hand, and an other a legge. And Iustine sayth further, that the same foode of bread, wine and water called <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> nourisheth our flesh and bloud by alteration, which they could not do, if no bread, wine nor water were there at all.</p>
                  <p>But here is not to be passed ouer one exceeding great craft and vntruth in your translation, that to cast a mist before the readers eyes, you alter the order of Iustines wordes in that place, where the pith of the matter standeth: For where Iustine sayth of the foode of bread, wine and water after the consecration, that they nourish our flesh and bloud by alteration, the nourishment which Iustine putteth after consecration, you vntruly put it before the consecration, and so wilfully and craftely alter the order of Iustinus wordes, to deceaue the reader,<note place="margin">Myne Issue.</note> and in this poynt will I ioyne an issue with you. Is such craft and vntruth to be vsed of Bishoppes? and then in matters of fayth and religion, wherof they pretend and ought to be true professors? But I meruayle not so much at your sleights in this place seeing that in the whole booke through out you seeke nothing lesse, then the truth. And yet all your sleightes will not serue you, for how can the foode (called <hi>Eucharistia</hi>) nourish before the consecration, seeing it is not eaten vntill after the consecration?</p>
                  <p>The next author in my booke is Irene, whome I alleadge thus.</p>
                  <p>Next him was Irenaeus,<note place="margin">Irenaeus contra Valentinum. li. 4. cap. 34.</note> aboue 150. yeares after Christ, who (as it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) could not be deceaued in the necessary poyntes of our fayth, for he was a disciple of Policarpus, which was disciple to S. Ihon the Euangelist.</p>
                  <p>This Irenaeus followeth the sense of Iustinus wholy in this matter, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most also his wordes, saying,<q> that the bread wherein we geue thankes vnto God, although it be of the earth, yet when the name of God is called vpon it, it is not than common bread, but the bread of thankes geuing, hauing two thinges in it, one earthly, and the other heauenly. What ment he by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thing, but the sanctification which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by the inuocation of the name of God?</q>
And what by the earthly thing: but the very bread which (as he sayd before) is of the earth: and which also (he sayth) doeth nourish our bodies as other bread doth which we do vse?</p>

                     <q>Next Iustine is Irene, in the allegation of whome, this author maketh also an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true reporte, how hath not this for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wordes in the forth booke <hi>contra Valentinum,</hi> that the bread wherein we geue thankes vnto God, although it be of the earth, yet when


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7682:158"/>
the name of god is called vpon, it is not thru common bread, but the bread of thankes giuing, hauing two thinges in it, one earthly and the other heauenly. This is Irene alleadged by this author, who I say writeth not in such forme of wordes. For his wordes be these. Like as the bread which is of the earth, receauing the calling of God, is now no common bread, but <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> consisting of two thinges, earthly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, so our bodies receauing <hi>Eucharistian,</hi> be no more corruptible.</q>
                     <q>These be Irenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wordes where Irene doth not call the bread receauing, the calling of God, the bread of thankes giuing, but <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> and in this <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> he sheweth how that, that he calleth the heauenly thinges, is the body and bloud of Christ, and therfore sayth in his fift booke, When the chalice mixt, and the bread broken, receaue the word of God, it is made <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> of the body and bloud of Christ, of which the substance of our flesh is stayed and increased. And how say they that our flesh is not able to receaue gods gift. who is eternall life which flesh is nourished with the body and bloud of Christ?</q>
These be also Irenes wordes, wherby appeareth, what he ment by the heauenly thing in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistia,</hi> which is the very presence of Christes body and bloud. And for the playne testimony of this fayth, this Irene hath bene commonly alleadged, and specially of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton to Decolampadius, as one most auncient and most playnly testifying the same. So as his very wordes truly alleadged, ouerthrow this author in the impugnation of Christes reall presence in the Sacrament, and therfore can nothing help this authors purpose agaynst Transubstantiation. Is not this a goodly and godly entre of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in the first two authorities that he bringeth in, to corrupt them both?</p>

                  <p>WHo seeth not, that as you did before in Iustine, so agayne in Irene you seeke nothing els, but meare cauilations and wrangling in wordes? Is not <hi>Eucharistia</hi> called in english, thankes giuing? If it be not,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> tell you what it is called in English? And doth not Iren say, <hi>Panes in qup gratiae actae sunt,</hi> that is so say, bread wherein thankes be giuen, what haue I offended then in englishing <hi>Eucharistiam</hi>; thankes giuing? Do not I write to English men, which vnderstand not what this greeke word <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistia,</hi> meaneth: what greate offence is it then in me to put it into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, that English men may vnderstaud what is sayde Should I do as you do, put greeke for English and write so obscurely, that English men should not know the authors meaning?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And do you not see, how much the words of Ireneus by you aleadged, make agaynst your selfe? These be his wordes after your citation: When the chalice mixt, and the bread broken, receaue the word of God, it is made <hi>Eucharistia</hi> of the body and bloud of Christ, of which the substance of our flesh is stayd and encreased.</q>
Doth not Irene say here playnly, that the chalice mixt, and the bread broken,
<q>after the word of God (which you call, the wordes of consecration) is made <hi>Eucharistia</hi> of the body and bloud of Christ, and not the body and bloud of Christ? And sayth he not further, that they stay and increase the substance of our bodies?</q>
But how can those thinges stay and increase our bodies, which be transubstantiated and gone before we receaue them? And haue you forgotten now in Irene, what you sayd in the next leafe before in Iustine, that the alteration and nourishment by the foode of bread and wine was vnderstande before the consecration? which you confesse now to be after the consecration? And when you thus obscure the authors wordes, peruerting and corrupting both the wordes and sences, yet shall you conclude your vntrue dealing with these wordes concerning me? Is not this a goodly and godly entres of this author in the first two authorities that he bringeth in to corrupt them both? Now followeth Origene next in my booke.</p>

When God formed Adam of clay, the matter of the clay remayned in Adam and yet the materiall clay remayned not: for it was altered into an other substance, which I speake not to compare equally the forming of Adam to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sacrament, but to shew it not to be all one to say the materiall bread and the matter of bread.

                  <p>WHat should I tarry much in Origene, seeing that you confesse that he sayth, the matter of bread remayneth, and Origene sayth, that the meate which is sanctified, <hi>iuxta id quod habet materiale in ventrem abit,</hi> that is to say, as concerning the materiall parte therof, goeth into the belly.

                  <p>But when you see that this shift will not serue, then you flie to an other, and say that the accidentes of bread be called the matter of bread, which is so shamefull a shift, as all that haue any manner of knowledge, may playnly see your manifest impudency. But many such shiftes you vse in this matter, not withstanding the importaunce of it. Now let vs come to Ciprian,<note place="margin">Ciprian ad Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cili. li. 2. epist. 3.</note> of whome I write in this manner.</p>
                  <p>After Origene came Ciprian the holy martir about the yeare of our Lord 250. who writeth agaynst them that ministred this Sacrament with water one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without wine. For as much (sayth he) as Christ sayd: <q>I am a true vine, <hi>therfore the bloud of Christ is not water, but wine, nor it can not be thought that his bloud</hi> (wherby we be redemed and haue life) <hi>is in the cup, when wine is not in the cup, wherby the bloud of Christ is shewed.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What wordes could Ciprian haue spoken more playnly, to shew that the wine doth remayne, than to say thus: If there be no wine, there is no bloud of Christ?</p>
                  <p>And yet he speaketh shortly after, as playnly in the same Epistle.<note place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> Christ sayth he) taking the cup, blessed it, and gaue it to his disciples, saying: <q>Drincke you all of this, for this is the bloud of the newe testament, which shall be shed for many, for the remission of sinnes. I say vnto you, that from hence forth I will not drincke of this creature of the vine, vntil I shal drincke with you newe wine in the kingdome of my father. By these wordes of Christ (sayth S. Ciprian) we perceaue, that the cuppe which the Lord offered, was not onely water, but also wine, <hi>And that it was wine that Christ called his bloud, wherby it is cleare that Christes bloud is not offered if, there be no wine in the Chalice.</hi> And after it followeth: How shal we drincke with Christ new wine of the creature of the vine if in the

                  </p>
                  <p>In these wordes of S.

And as the name wine must be vsed before the consecration, to shew the truth of it then, so it may also be vsed for a name of it after to shew what it was, which is often vsed. And in one place of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian by this author here alleadged, it appeareth S.

Is not here mention of new wine of the creature of the vine: what new wine can be but the bloud of Christ, the very wine consecrate by Gods omnipotency, of the creature of the vine offered? And therfore this one place may geue vs a lesson in Ciprian, that as he vseth the word (wine) to signifie the heauenly drincke of the bloud of Christ, made by consecration, of the creature of wine, so when he nameth the bread consecrate bread, he meaneth the heauenly bread Christ, who is the bread of life. And so Ciprian can make nothing by those wordes agaynst Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, who writeth playnly of the change of the bread by Gods omnipotency into the flesh of Christ, as shall after appeare, where this author goeth about to answere to him.</p>

                  <p>CIprians wordes tend not onely to shew,
that wine is the creature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> appoynted to the celebration of the mistery, but that it is also there present, and dronken in the mistery. For these be his wordes: <q>It cannot be thought, that Christes bloud is in the cup, when wine is not in the cup, wherby the bloud of Christ is shewed.</q>
And agayne he sayth: It was wine that Christ called his bloud, and that it is cleare, that Christes bloud is not offered, if there be no wine in the chalice. And further he sayth: How shall we drincke with Christ new wine of the creature of the vine, if in the sacrifice of God the father and of Christ, we do not offer wine? In these wordes Ciprian sayth not, that Christ is the wine which we drincke, but that with Christ we drincke wine, that commeth of the vine tree, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christes bloud is not there, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wine is not there. And where is now your Transubstantiation, that taketh away the wine? For take away the wine, and take away by Ciprians mind, the blood of Christ also.</p>
                  <p>But least any man should stomble at Ciprians wordes, where he seemeth to say that the bloud of Christ should be really in the cup, he sayth nor meaneth no such thing, but that it is there sacramentally or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely. And his meaning needeth none other gathering, but of his owne wordes, that follow next after in the same sentence, that by the wine the bloud of Christ is shewed. And shortly after he sayth, that the cup which the Lord offered, was wine, and that it was wine that Christ called his bloud. Now come we to Emissen, your principall stay in whome is your chiefe glory. Of him thus I write.</p>

                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:7682:159"/>Eusebius Emissenus,<note place="margin">Eusebus Emisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> a man of singuler fame in learning, about CCC. yeares after Christes ascention, did in few wordes set out this matter so playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (both how the bread and wine be conuerted into the body and bloud of Christ, and yet remayne still in the nature: and also how besides the outward receauing of bread and wine, Christ is inwardly by fayth receaued in our heartes) all this (I say) he doth so playnly set out, that more playnnesse can not be reasonably desired in this matter. For he sayth, that the conuersion of the visible creatures of bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ, is like vnto our conuersion in baptisme, where outwardly nothing is chaunged, but remayneth the same that was before: but all the alteration is inwardly and spiritually.</p>

Thou wast the selfe same person,</hi> and yet by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of fayth, thou wast made an other man. <hi>Outwardly nothing was added, but all the change was inwardly.</hi> And so was man made the sonne of Christ, and Christ fourmed in the mind of man.

                  <p>Hitherto haue I rehersed the sayinges of Eusebius, which be so playne, that no man can wish more playnly to be declared, that this mutation of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ, is a sacramentall mutation, and that outwardly nothing is changed. But as outwardly we eate the bread, and drincke the wine with our mouthes, so inwardly by fayth, we spiritually eate the very flesh, and drincke the very bloud of Christ.</p>

                  <p>As touching Emissene by whose wordes is expressely testified the truth of the reall presence of Christ in the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Emissene.</note> and also the sence of the doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this author maketh himselfe bold ouer him, and so bold that he dare corrupt him, which Emissene writeth not, that man is turned into the body of the church. And here I make an issue with this author,<note place="margin">An Issue.</note> that Emissene hath not that word of turning in that place, and man to be turned into the body of the church is no conuenient speach, to signifie a change in him that is regenerat by baptisme. He in dede that is thrust out of the chauncell for his misdemeanour in seruise tyme, may be sayd turned into the body of the church. But Emissene speaketh not so here, but bicause the same Emissene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the mistery of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, sayth the visible creatures be turned into the substance of the body of Christ, this author thought it would sound gayly well, to the confusion of that true doctrine of turning, to speake in Baptisme of the turning of a man into the


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7682:160"/>
body of the church. And it may be commonly obserued in this author, when he alleadgeth any authority of others, he bringeth forth the same in such forme of wordes as he would haue them, and not as they be, for the most part or very often, and once of purpose were ouer often in so high a matter as this is. And yet in this Emissens authority, after all the payne taken to reforge him, Emissens doctrine playnly confoundeth this Authors teaching. This author maketh a note, that there is in man baptised nothing changed outwardly, and therfore in the Sacrament neyther, and it must be graunted. For the doctrine of transubstantiation teacheth not in the Sacrament any outward change. For the substance of the bread and wine is an inward nature, and so is substance of one defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And to speake of the thing changed, then as in man the change is in the soule, which is the substance of man: So for the thing changed in the visible creatures should be also changed, and is changed, the substance of the bread and wine to answere therein to the other. And we must consider how this comparison of the two changes is made as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> were by proportion, wherein ech change hath his speciall end and terme, (whereunto) and therfore according to the terme and end, hath his worke of change, speciall and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall both by gods worke. Thus I meane, The visible creatures hath there ende and terme (wherunto) the change is made, the very body and bloud of Christ, which body being a true body, we must say is a corporall substance. The soule of man hath his ende and terme a spirituall alteration, incorporall, to be regenerate the sonne of God. And then the doctrine of this Emissene is playne this, that each changers is of like truth, and then it followeth; that if the change of mans soule in Baptisme be true and not in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, the change likewise in the sacrament is also true and not in a figure. And if mans soule by the change in Baptisme be in deede, that is to say, really made the sonne of God, then is the substance of the bread, which is as it were the soule of the bread (I am bolde here in speach to vse the word soule, to expresse proportion of the comparison,) but euen so is the inward nature of the bread which is substance, turned and changed in to the body of Christ, being the terme and ende of that change. And here I say (so) not to declare the manner, but the truth of the ende, that is to say, as really and in deede the change is in the substance of bread as in the soule of man, both these changes be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous, and both be in the truth of there change, wherunto they be changed of like truth and realty to be done indeede, they resemble one an other in the secrecie of the mistery, and the ignorance of our senses, for in neither is any outward change at all, and therfore there was neuer man tripped himselfe more handsomly to take a fall, then this author doeth in this place, not onely in corrupting euidently and notably the words of Emissene without purpose, wherby neuerthelesse he shewed his good will, but also by setting forth such matter, as ouerturneth all his teaching at once.</p>
                  <p>For now the author must say the change in mans soule by Baptisme, to be there made the sonne of God, is but in figure and signification, not true and reall in deede, or els graunt the true catholique doctrine of the turne of the visible creatures into the body and bloud of Christ, to be likewise not in figure and signification, but truly, really, and indeede: And for the thing changed as the soule of man, mans inward nature is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: so the inward nature of the bread is changed.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> WHere I haue corrupted Emissene, let the reader be iudge. But when Emissene speaketh godly of the alteration, change, and turning of a man,<note place="margin">Turning.</note> from the congregation of the wicked vnto the congregation of Christ (which he calleth the body of the church) and from the childe of death vnto the child of God, this must be made a matter of scoffing, to turne light fellowes out of the chancell into the body of the church. Such trifling now a dayes becometh gayly well godly Bishoppes, what if in the steede of (turning) I had sayd (skipt ouer) as the word <hi>transilisti</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, which (although peraduenture the bookes be false and should be <hi>transisti</hi>) I haue translated (turning) should I haue so escaped a mocke trow you? You would then haue sayd, he that so doth, goeth not out at the chancell dore into the body of the church, but skippeth ouer the stalles. But that Emissene ment of turning, is cleare, aswell by the wordes that go before, as those which go after, which I referre to the iudgement of the indifferent reader.</p>
                  <p>But forasmuch as you would perswade men, that this author maketh so much for your purpose, I shall set forth his minde playnly, that it may appeare how much you be deceaued. Emissenes mynd is this,<note place="margin">Emissenus minde.</note> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our sauiour Christ hath taken his body hence from our bodely sight, Yet we see him by fayth, and by grace he is here present with vs, so that by him we be made new creatures, regenerated by him, and fedde and nourished by him, which generation and nutrition in vs, is spirituall without any mutation appearing outwardly, but wrought within vs inuisibly by the omnipotent power of God. And this alteration in vs, is so wonderfull, that we be made new creatures in Christ, grafted into his body, and of the same receaue our nourishment and encreasing. And yet visibly with our bodely eyes we see not these thinges, but they be manifest vnto our fayth by gods worde and sacraments. And Emissene declareth none other reall presence of Christ in the sacrament of his body and bloud, then in the Sacrament of baptisme, but spiritually by fayth to be present in both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where Emissene speaketh of the conuersion of earthly creatures into the substance of Christ,<note place="margin">Conuersion.</note> he speaketh that aswell of baptisme, as of the lordes supper, as his owne wordes playnly declare. If thou wilt know (sayth he) how it ought not to seme to thee a new thing and impossible, that earthly and corruptible thinges be turned into the substance of Christ looke vppon thy selfe, which art made new in baptisme. And yet he ment not, that the water of baptisme in it selfe is really turned into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christ, nor likewise bread and wine in the Lordes supper, but that in the action, water, wine and bread, as sacraments, be sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally conuerted (vnto him that duely receaueth them) into the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christ. So that the sacramentall conuersion is in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the reall conuertion is in him that receaueth the sacraments, which reall conuertion is inward, inuisible and spirituall. For the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corporall substances, aswell of the name as of the water, remayne the same that they were before. And therfore sayth Emissene. Thou visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diddest remayne in the same measure that thou haddest before, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisibly thou wast made greater without any increase of thy body, thou wast the selfe same person, and yet by the encrease of fayth thou wast


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7682:161"/>
made an other man. Outwardly nothing was added, but all the change was inwardly. In these wordes hath Emissene playnly declared, that the conuersion in the sacraments (wherof he spake when he sayd, that earthly and corruptible thinges be turned into the substance of Christ) is to be vnderstand in the receauours by their fayth, and that in the sayd conuersion the outward substance remayneth the selfe same that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And that Emissene ment this, as well in the sacrament of the lordes supper, as in the sacrament of baptisme, his own wordes playnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. So that the substance of Christ, as well in baptisme as the Lordes supper, is seene: not with our eyes, but with our fayth: and touched not with our bodies, but with our mindes: and receaued not with our hands, but with our hartes: eaten and drunken not with our outward mouthes, but with our inward man.</p>
                  <p>And where Emissene sayth, that Christ hath taken his body from our sight into heauen, and yet in the sacrament of his holy supper he is present with his grace through fayth, he doth vs to vnderstand, that he is not present in the formes of bread and wine out of the ministration (except you will say, that fayth and grace be in the bread, when it is kept and hanged vp) but when the bread and wine be eaten and drunken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christes institution, then to them that so eate and drincke, the bread and wine is the body and bloud of Christ, according to Christes wordes,<note place="margin">The booke of common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> 
                     <hi>Edite, hoc est corpus meum. Bibite, hic est calix senguinis mei.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the booke of the holy communion, we do not pray that the creatures of bread and wine may be the body and bloud of Christ, but that they may be to vs the body and bloud of Christ, that is to say, that we may so eate them, and drincke them, that we may be partakers of his body cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and of his bloud shed for our redemption.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue I declared the truth of Emissenes mynd, which is agreable to Gods word,<note place="margin">Absurdities.</note> and the olde catholike Church. But now what illusions and dreames you fantasy of Emissenes wordes, it is a wonder to heare. First that the substance of bread and wine is an inward nature, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in baptisme the whole man is not regenerated but the soule onely, and that the soule of man is the substance of man, and made the sonne of God. And now when it serueth for your purpose, the body of Christ is a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall substance, which in all your booke before was but a spirituall body, and the substance of bread and wine be visible creatures, which were wont with you to be inward and inuisible natures: and now is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nature of the bread the substance of the bread, where as in other places the outward fourmes be the substance, so litle substance is in your doctrine, that from tyme to tyme you thus alter your sayings. This is no tripping, but so shamefull a fall, and in so foule and stincking a place, that you shall neuer be able to spunge the filthines out of your clothes, and to make your selfe sweete agayne.</p>
                  <p>And you appoynt at your pleasure both <hi>terminum a quo, terminum ad quem,</hi> and the changes, and the thinges that be changed, altogither otherwise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> then Emissene doth. For in Emissene the changes be regeneration and nourishing or augmentation, the thing that is changed is the man, both in regeneration and in nutrition or augmentation, and in regeneration <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> is the sonne of perdition, and <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> is the sonne of


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7682:161"/>
God. And in nutrition <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> is the hunger and thirst of the man, and <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> is the feeding and satisfying of his hunger and thirst. But you appoynt the changes to be Transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and regeneration, and the thinges that be changed in Transubstantiation, you say is the substance of bread and wine, and the same to be <hi>terminum a quo,</hi> and the flesh and bloud of Christ (say you) is <hi>terminus ad quem.</hi> And in regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you assigne <hi>terminum a quo,</hi> to be the soule of man onely, and <hi>terminum ad quem,</hi> to be regenerated the sonne of God. And so being viii. thinges in these ii. mutations, in each of them the change, the thing that is changed, the thing from whence it is changed, and the thing wherunto it is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, you haue mist the butte clearly in all, sauing ii. that is to say, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and the thing wherunto regeneration is made, and in all other vi. you missed the quishion quite. And yet if the change were in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread and wine, proportionably to the change of the soule (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the substance of man as you say) if you should make the proportions agree, then as the soule, being the mans substance, remayneth without Transubstantiation, so must the bread and wine remayne without tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. And if the substance of the bread and wine be not the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe in the lordes supper (because substance) as you say (is a thing inuisible,) then is not the substance of water the visible signe in baptisme bring no more visible the substance of the one, then the substance of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now of Hilary I write thus.</p>
                  <p>Hilarius also in few wordes sayth the same.<note place="margin">Hilarius.</note>
                     <q>There is a figure (sayth he) for <hi>bread and wine be outwardly seene.</hi> And there is also a truth of that figure, for the body and bloud of Christ be of a truth inwardly beleued. And this Hilarius was within lesse then 350. yeares after Christ.</q>

                  <p>But I will examine moe particularieties. I haue before answered to Hilary,<note place="margin">Hilarius.</note> so whome neuerthelesse I would aptly haue sayd somewhat now to note, how he distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth outwardly and inwardly by beleefe and corporall sight. For outwardly as Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sene sayth, we see no change, and therfore we see after Consecration, as before, which we may therfore call bread, but we beleue that inwardly is, which as Emissene sayth, is the substance of the body of Christ, wherunto the change is made of the inward na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread, as by the comparison of Emissene doth appeare.</p>

                  <p>YOur distinction made here of outwardly and inwardly, is a playne confusion of Hilarius mynd, and contrary to that which you wrote before in Emissene. For there you sayd, that the visible creatures be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (meaning by the visible creatures, the substances of bread and wine) and now when Hilary sayth, that bread and wine be seene, you say that their substances be not seene, but the outward formes onely, which you say, be called bread and wine. But here appeareth into how narrow a straight you be driuen, that be fayne for a shift to say, that the accidents of bread without the substance, be called bread.</p>

And then as often as the author is ouerthrowen in the truth of the presence, so often is he (by Zuinglius rule) ouerthrowen in Transubstantiation.

As Hilary sayd, there is a figure, (for bread and wine be openly seene) he sayth not there was a figure, for bread and wine were openly seene.

Chrisostome sayth thus: Christ vsed wine, and I graunt he did so. For he did consecrate that creature, and as Emissene sayth, turned it in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration and dispensation of these misteries. But this saying toucheth nothing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Transubstantiation. The second saying of Chrisostom which I neuer redde but in Peter Martirs booke, who sayth it is not printed, toucheth this authors doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> much, if the bread by consecration be deliuered from the name of bread, and exalted to the name of our Lordes body. Now consider reader, if this manner of speach by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome here meaneth an effectuall naming, to make the substance of the body of Christ present, as Chrisostome in his publike approued workes is vnderstanded of all to teach, then is the deliuerance from the name of bread of like effect, to take away the reason of the name of bread, which is the change in substance therof. Or if the author will say that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by the name of bread Chrisostome vnderstandeth the bare name, how can that stand without reprofe of S. Paule: who after this authors mynde calleth it bread after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, and so do many other by this author alleadged. Here percase may be sayd what should I reason what he ment, when he sayth playnly the nature of bread still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth? To this I say that as Chrisostome in this place (of an epistle not published <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by credite) sayth that the nature of bread remayneth: So Ciprian that was older then he, sayth the nature of bread is changed, which Chrisostome in his other workes, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique credite set abrode, semeth not to deny. Now the word (nature) signifieth both the substance,<note place="margin">The word Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath two significations.</note> and also propriety of the nature. The substance therfore after Ciprian by the word of God is changed, but yet the proper effect is not changed, but in the accidences remayne without illusion, by which diuers signification and acception of the word na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both the sayings of S. Ciprian and S. Chrisostome (if this be his saying) may be accorded, and notwithstanding the contrariete in letter, agree neuertheles in sence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene themselfe, and agree with the true doctrine of Transubstantiation. Adde to this how the wordes of Chrisostome next following this sentence, alleadged by this author, and as it semeth of purpose left her out, do both confound this authors enterprise, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> confirme the true doctrine. Which wordes be these, (And is not called two bodies but one body of the sonne of God.) Of Chrisostome I shall speake agayne hereafter.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THe first place of Chrysostome by me alleadged, you say toucheth not the doctrine of Transubstantiation. But you rehearse but a piece of Chrisostomes wordes. For he sayth not onely that Christ vsed wine, but also drancke wine in the misteries, and the very wine of the grape. And how could then the wine be transubstantiate, except it were transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, after it was drunken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now as touching the second part of Chrisostome, where he sayth, that the bread when it is consecrated, is deliuered from the name of bread and is exalted to the name of the Lordes body, and yet the nature of bread doth still remayne, he meaneth that the bread is deliuered from the bare name of bread, to represent vnto vs the body of Christ (according to his institution) which was crucified for vs, not that he is present or crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bread, but was crucified vpon the Crosse. And the bread is not do clearely deliuered from the name of bread, that it is no bread at all, (for


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7682:163"/>
he sayth the nature of bread doth still remayne) nor that it may not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of bread, but it is so deliuered, that commonly it is called by the higher name of the Lordes body,<note place="margin">Changing of names.</note> which to vs it representeth. As you and I were deliuered from our surnames, when we were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated bishops, sithens which tyme we haue so commonly bene vsed of all men to be called bishoppes (you of Winchester and I of Caunterbury) that the most part of the people know not that your name is Gardyner, and myne Cranmer. And I pray God that we being called to the name of Lordes, haue not forgotten our owne baser estates, that once we were simple squiers. And yet should he haue done neyther of vs wrong, that should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> haue called vs by our right names, no more then S. Paule doth any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury to the bread in the sacrament, calling it bread, although it haue also an higher name of dignity, to be called the body of Christ. And as the bread being a figure of Christs body hath the name therof, and yet is not so in deede, so I pray God that we haue not rather bene figures of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, bearing the name and title of Pastors and Bishoppes before men, then that we haue in deede diligently fed the little flocke of Christ with the swete and holsome pasture of his true and liuely word.</p>
                  <p>And where you alleadge Ciprian,<note place="margin">Ciprian.</note> to auoyd therby the saying of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in the epistle by me cited, you take Ciprian clearely amisse, as I haue playnly opened hereafter in the xi. chapiter of this booke, wherunto for to auoyde the tediousnes of repeting, I referre the indifferent reader, vnto which myne answer there, healpeth much that which you graunt here,<note place="margin">The word Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that the word (nature) signifieth both the substance and also the propriety. For in Ciprian it is not taken for the substance (as you would fayne haue it) but for the property. For the substance of bread still remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them that duely receaue the same, the property of carnall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is changed into a spirituall nourishment, as more largely in myne answer to you in that place shall be declared.</p>
                  <p>And where you would somewhat releue your selfe by certayne words <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Chrisostome, which immediatly follow the sentence by me alleadged (which wordes be these, that the bread after consecration is not called two bodies, but one body of the sonne of God) vpon which wordes you would gather your Transubstantiation, how effectuall your argument is in this matter, may appeare by an other like. Steuen Gardiner after he was consecrated, was called the byshop of Winchester, and not two byshoppes but one bishop, ergo Steuen Gardiner was transubstantiate. And a counter layd by an Auditour for a thousand poundes, is not then called a counter, but a thousand poundes, ergo it is transubstantiated. And the man and wife after mariage, be called but one body, ergo there is Transubstantiation. This must be the fourme of your argument, if you will proue Transubstantiation by these wordes of Chrisostome.</p>
                  <p>Now come we to S. Ambrose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ambrosius.</note>At the same tyme was S. Ambrose, who declareth the alteration of bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ, not to be such, that the nature and substance of bread and wine be gone, but that thorough grace, there is a spirituall mutation by the mighty power of God, so that he that worthely ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of that bread, doth spiritually eate Christ, and dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him.</p>

                  <p>And he bringeth for example here of the change of vs in baptisme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man is so changed (as is before declared in the wordes of Eusebius) that he is made a new creature, and yet his substance remayneth the same that was before.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but confirmeth it most playnly, bicause he teacheth the true presence of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the sacrament, which he sayth, is by change, and thinges still remayning, and that may be verefied in the outward visible matter, that is to say, the accidents remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with their proper effects, which therfore may worthely be called thinges. And here I would aske this Author, if his teaching as he pretendeth were the catholike fayth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the bread onely signified Christes body, what should nede this force of Gods word that S. Ambrose speaketh of, to bring in the creation of the world, wherby to induce mans fayth in this mistery to the belefe of it? As for the example of Baptisme to show the change in mans soule, wherof I haue spoken, declaring Emissene, serueth for an induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to leane to our outward sences, ne to mistrust the great miracle of God in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bycause we see none outward experience of it, but els it is not necessary that the resemblance shall answere in equality, otherwise then as I sayd afore, each part answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his conuenient proportion, and as for their comparison of resemblance Baptisme with the sacrament, this author in his doctrine specially reproueth, in that he can not I thinke deny, but man by regeneration of his soule in Baptisme, is the partaker of holines, but as for the bread, he specially admonisheth, that it is not partaker of holines by this consecration, but howsoeuer this author in his owne doctrine snarleth him selfe, the doctrine of S. Ambrose is playne, that before the consecration it is bread, and after the consecration the body of Christ, which is an vndoubted affirmation then to be no bread, howsoeuer the accidents of bread do remayne.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> SAynt Ambrose teacheth not the reall and corporall presence of Christs body in the sacrament, as I haue proued sufficiently in my former booke, the 64. 81. and 82. leaues, and in myne answere vnto you in this booke. But agaynst Transubstantiation he teacheth playnly, that after consecration not onely thinges remayne, but also that the thinges chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, still remayne. And what is this, but a flatte condemnation of your imagined Transubstantiation? For if the thinges changed in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do still remayne, and the substances of bread and wine be changed, then it followeth that theire substances remayne, and be not transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, so that your vntrue and crafty shift will not releeue your matter any whit, when you say, that the accidence of bread is bread, wherin all the world knoweth how much you erre from the truth. And better it had bene for you to haue kept such sayings secret vnto your selfe, which no man can speake without blushing (except he be past all shame) than to shew your shamefull shiftes open vnto the world, that all men may see them. And specially when the shewing therof onely discouereth your shame, and easeth you nothing at all. For the accidences be not changed (as you say your selfe) but the substances. And then if the thinges that be changed remayue, the substance must remayne, and not be transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated.


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7682:164"/>
And S. Ambrose bringeth forth to good purpose the creation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the world, to shew the wonderfull worke of God, aswell in the spirituall regeneration, and spirituall feeding and nourishing of the liuely mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christes body, as in the creation and conseruation of the world. And therfore Dauid calleth the spirituall renouation of man, by the name of creation, saying: <hi>Cor mundum crea in me Deus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm. 50.</note> O God create in me a new hart. And as for any further answer here vnto Ambrose nedeth not, but bicause you referre you here to Emissene, they which be indifferent, may read what I haue answered vnto Emissene a little before, and so iudge.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs examine S. Augustine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Augustinus in sermone ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes.</note>And S. Augustine about the same tyme, wrote thus: That which you see in the alter, is the bread and the cup, which also your eyes do shew you. But fayth sheweth further, that bread is the body of Christ, &amp; the cupper his bloud, Here he declareth two thinges: that in the sacrament remayneth, bread and wine which we may discerne with our eyes: and that the bread and wine be called the body and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In lib. sententia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Prosperi.</note>And the same thing he declareth also as playnly in an other place, saying: The sacrifice of the Church consisteth of two thinges, of the visible kind of the element, and of the inuisible flesh and bloud of our Lord Iesu Christ, both of the sacrament, and of the thinge signified by the sacrament. Euen as the person of Christ consisteth of God and man, forasmuch as he is very God and very man. For euery thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth in it, the very nature of those thinges, wherof it consisteth. Now the sacrifice of the church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth of two thinges, of the sacrament, and of the thing thereby signified, that is to say, the body of Christ. Therfore there is both the sacrament, and the thing of the sacrament, which is Christes body.</p>
                  <p>What can be deuised to be spoken more playnly agaynst the error of the Papistes, which say that no bread nor wine remayneth in the sacrament? For as the person of Christ consisteth of two natures, that is to say, of his manhod, and of his godhead, (and therfore both those natures remayne in Christ,) euen so (sayth S. Augustine) the sacrament consisteth of two natures, of the elements of bread and wine, and of the body and bloud of Christ, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both these natures must nedes remayne in the sacrament.</p>
                  <p>For the more playne vnderstanding hereof, it is to be noted, that there were certayne heretikes, as <hi>Simon, Menander, Martion, Valentinus, Basilides, Cerdon, Manes, Eutiches, Manichaeus, Apolinaris,</hi> and Diuers other of like sortes, which sayd, that Christ was very God, but not a very man, although in eating, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, sleeping, and all other operations of man, to mens iudgementes he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like vnto a man.</p>
                  <p>Other there were, as <hi>Artemon, Theodorus, Sabellius, Paulus Samasathenus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, Photinus, Nestorius,</hi> and many other of the same sectes, which sayd, that he was a very naturall man, but not very God, although in geuing the blind their sight, the dumbe their speach, the deafe their hearing, in healing soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his word all diseases, in raysing to life them that were dead, and in all other workes of God, he shewed himselfe as he had bene God.</p>
                  <p>Yet other there were, which seeing the scripture so plaine in those two mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, confessed that he was both God and man, but not both at one tyme. For before his incarnation (sayd they) he was God onely, and not man, and after his incarnation, he ceased from his Godhead, and became a man onely, and


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7682:164"/>
not God, vntill his resurrection or ascension, and then (say they) he left his manhod, and was onely God agayne, as he was before his incarnation. So that when he was manne, he was not God: and when he was God, he was not man.</p>
                  <p>But agaynst these vayne heresies, the Catholike fayth, by the expresse word of God holdeth and beleueth, that Christ after his incarnation left not his diuine nature', but remayned still God, as he was before, being togither at one tyme, (as he is still) both perfect God and perfect man.</p>
                  <p>And for a playne declaration hereof, the old auncient authors giue two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: one is of man, which is made of two partes, of a soule and of a body, and ech of these two partes remayne in man at one tyme. So that when the soule, by the almighty power of god, is put in to the body, neither the body nor soule perisheth therby, but therof is made a perfect man, hauing a perfect soule and a perfect body, remayning in him both at one tyme. The other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which the olde authors bring in for this purpose, is of the holy Snpper of our Lord, which consisteth (say they) of two partes, of the sacrament or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible element of bread and wine, and of the body and bloud of Christ. And as in them that duely receaue the sacrament, the very natures of bread and wine ceasse not to be there, but remayne there still, and be eaten and drunken cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, as the body and bloud of Christ be eaten and drunken spiritually: so likewise doth the diuine nature of Christ remayne still with his humanity.</p>
                  <p>Let now the Papistes auaunt them selues of their Transubstantiation, that there remayneth no bread nor wine in the ministration of the Sacrament, if they will defend the wicked heresies before rehersed, that Christ is not God and man both togither. But to proue that this was the mynd of the old au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, beside the saying of S. Augustine here recited, I shall also reherse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Winchester.</head>
                  <p>In the 26. leafe this author bringeth forth two sayinges of S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Augustinus.</note> which when this author wrote, it is like he neither thought of the third or first booke of this worke. For these two sayinges declare most euidently the reall presence of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and bloud in the Sacrament, affirming the same to be the sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appeareth it is no figure onely. In the first saying of S. Augustine is written thus, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how fayth sheweth me that bread is the body of Christ: now whatsoeuer fayth sheweth is a truth, and then it followeth that of a truth it is the body of Christ, which speach bread is the body of Christ, is as much to say, as it is made the body of Christ, and made not as of a matter, but (as Emissene wrote) by conuersion of the visible creature into the substance of the body of Christ, and as S. Augustine in the same sentence wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is bread before the consecration, and after, the flesh of Christ. As for the second saying of S. Augustine, how could it with more playne wordes be written, then to say that there is both the Sacrament and the thing of the Sacrament which is Christes body, calling the same the sacrifice of the church. Now if Christes body be there, it is truely there, and in dede there, which is really there, as for there in a figure, were as much to say, as not there in truth and indede, but onely signified to be absent, which is the nature of a figure in his proper and speciall speach. But S. Augustine sayth euen as the author bringeth him forth, and yet he gaue his priuy nippe by the way thus: It is sayd of S. Augustine there be two thinges in the sacrifice, which be conteyned in it, wherof it consisteth so as the body of Christ is conteined in this sacrifice by S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines mynd.
According whereunto S. Augustine is alleadged to say in the same booke, from whence this author tooke this saying, also these wordes following,<q> vnder the kindes of bread and wine which we see, we honor thinges inuisible, that is to say, the


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7682:165"/>
flesh and bloud of Christ, nor we do not likewise esteme these two kindes as we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the consecration,<note place="margin">Out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> for we must faythfully confesse before the consecration to be bread and wine that nature formed, and after consecration, the flesh and bloud of Christ, which the benediction hath consecrate.</q>
Thus sayth S. Augustine as he is alleadged out of the booke,<note place="margin">The booke of S. Augustine <hi>de suis prosperi</hi> is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had.</note> which in deede I haue not, but he hath the like sence in other places, and for honoring of the inuisible heauenly thinges there, which declare the side and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence, S. Augustine hath the like in his booke <hi>De Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chisandis rudibus,</hi> and in the 98. psalme, where he speaketh of adoration. This may be notable to the reader, how this author concludeth himselfe in the fayth of the reall presence of Christes body, by his owne collection of S. Augustine mynd, which is as he confesseth in his owne wordes, noting S. Augustine, that as the person of Christ consisteth of two natures, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Sacrament consisteth of to natures, of the elements of bread and wine, and of the body and bloud of Christ, and therfore both these natures do remayne in the Sacrament. These be this authors owne wordes, who trauayling to confound Transubstantiation, confoundeth euidently himselfe by his owne wordes touching the reall present. For he sayth the nature of the body and bloud of Christ must remayne in the sacrament, and as truely as the natures of the manhod and Godhead were in Christ, for therupon he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth. And now let this author choose whether he will say any of the natures, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode or the godhead were but figuratiuely in Christ, which and he do, then may be the better say for the agrement of his doctrine. The nature of the body and bloud of Christ is but figuratiuely in the Sacrament. And if he say (as he must nedes say) that the two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> natures be in Christes person really, naturally, substantially, then must he graunt by his owne collection the truth of the being of the nature of the body and bloud of Christ to be likewise in the Sacrament, and therby call backe all that he hath written agaynst the real presence of Christes body in the sacrament, and abandon his deuise of a presence by significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is in truth a playne abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as himselfe also speaketh openly, which open speach can not stand, and is improued by this open speach of his owne.</p>
                  <p>Likewise where he sayth the nature of the body and bloud of Christ remayne in the Sacrament, the word (remayne) being of such signification, as it betokeneth not onely to be there, but to tary there, and so there is declared the sacrifice of the church, which mistery of sacrifice is perfited before the perception, and so it must be euident how the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> body of Christ is there, that is to say, on the alter before we receaue it, to which aulter S. Augustine sayth, we come to receaue it. There was neuer man ouerturned his own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> assertions more euidently, then this author doth herein this place, the like wherof I haue obserued in other that haue written agaynst this Sacrament, who haue by he way sayd somewhat for it, or they haue brought their treatise to an end.</p>
                  <p>It will be sayd here, how soeuer this author doth ouerthrow him selfe in the reall presence of Christes very body, yet he hath pulled downe Transubstantiation, and done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> as crafty wrastlers do, falling themselues on theire backe, to throw there fellowe ouer them. But it is not like, for as long as the true fayth of the reall presence standeth, so longe Transubstantiation standeth, not by authority of determination, but by a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence of the truth, as I sayd before, and as Zuinglius defendeth playnly, and as for these places of S. Augustine may be answered vnto, for they speake of the visible nature and element, which remayne truely in the propriety of their nature, for so much as remayneth, so as there is true reall and bodily matter of the accidents of bread and wine, not in fantasy or imagination, wherby there should be illution in the sences, but so in deede as the experience doth shew, and the change of substance of the creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better substance, should not impayre the truth of that remayneth, but that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, doth in deede remayne, with the same naturall effects by miracle that it had when the substance was there which is one maruaile in this mistery, as there were diuerse more in Manna the figure of it. And then a miracle in gods working doth not empayre the truth of the worke. And therfore I noted before, how S. Thomas did touch Christ after his resurrection truely, and yet it was by miracle, as S. Gregory writeth. And further we may say, touching the comparison, that when a resemblaunce is made of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Sacrament to Christes person, or contrariwise of Christes person to declare the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we may not presse all partes of the resemblance, with a through equality in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7682:165"/>
of each part by it selfe, but onely haue respect to the ende wherfore the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is made. In the person of Christ be ioyned two whole perfite natures insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vnite, which fayth the Nestorians impugned, and yet vnite without confusion of them, which confussion the Eutichians in consequence of their error affirmed, and so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments be brought of the sacrament, wherewith to conuince both, as I shall shew an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to Gelasius. But in this place S. Augustine vseth the truth most certayne of the two natures in Christes person, wherby to declare his beleefe in the Sacrament, which beleefe as Hilary before is by this author alleadged to say, is of that is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For that is outwardly of the visible creature, we see (he sayth) with our bodely eye, and therfore therin is no poynt of fayth that should neede such a declaration, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine maketh. And yet making the comparison, he reherseth both the truthes on both sides, saying: As the person of Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth of God &amp; man, so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of two thinges, the visible kind of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> element, &amp; the inuisible flesh &amp; bloud, finishing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> similitude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therfore, There, is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, both the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Christes body, that which is inuisible, &amp; therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is by S. Augustine opened in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ to be there truely and therwith, that needed no declaration, that is to say, the visible kind of the element is spoken of also as being true, but not as a thing which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be proued, for it neded not any proofe as the other part did. And therfore it is not necessary to presse both partes of the resemblance so, as bicause in the nature of Christs humanity, there was no substance conuerted in Christ, which had bene contrary to the order of that mistery, which was to ioyne the whole nature of man to the godhead in the person of Christ, that therfore in this mistery of the Sacrament, in which by the rules of our fayth, Christes body is not Impanate, the conuersion of the substance of the visible elements should not therfore be. If truth answereth to truth for proportion of the truth in the mistery that is sufficient. For els the natures be not so vnite in one hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the mistery of the Sacrament, as there be in Christes person, and the flesh of man in Christ by vnion of the diuinity, is a diuine spirituall flesh, and is called and is a liuely flesh, and yet the author of this booke is not afrayd to teach the bread in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to haue no participation of holines, wherein I agree not with him, but reason agaynst him with his owne doctrine, and much I could say more, but this shall suffice. The wordes of S. Augustine for the reall presence of Christes body be such as no man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> can wrest or wreth to an other sence, and with their force haue made this author to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw himselfe in his owne wordes. But that S. Augustine sayth, touching the nature of bread and the visible element of the Sacrament, without wresting or writhing may be agreed in couenient vnderstanding with the doctrine of Transubstantiation, and therfore is an authority familiar with those writers that affirme Transubstantiation by expresse wordes,<note place="margin">The master of the sentences hath these wordes of S. Augustine.</note> out of whose quiuer this author hath pulled out his bolt, and as it is out of his bow sent, turneth backe and hitteth himselfe on the forehead, and yet after his fashion, by wrong and vntrue translation he sharpened it somewhat, not without some punishment of God, euidently by the way by his owne wordes to ouerthrow him selfe.</p>
                  <p>In the second columne of the 27. leafe and the first of the 28. leafe, this author ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a processe in declaration of heresies in the person of Christ, for conuiction wherof, this author sayth the olde fathers vsed arguments of two examples, in eyther of which examples were two natures togither, the one not perishing ne confounding the other. One example is in the body and soule of man. An other example of the Sacrament, in which be two natures, an inward heauenly, and an outward earthly, as in man there is a body and a soule.</p>

the soule is in mans body, that argument of the Sacrament had not two thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, so as the argument of the body and soule had, wherby to shew how two thinges may be togither without confusion of eyther, ech remayning in his nature: for if the teaching of this author in other partes of this booke were true, than were the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> like a body lying in a traunce, whose soule for the while were in heauen, and had no two thinges, but one bare thing, that is to say bread, and bread neuer the holier with signification of an other thing so farre absent, as is heauen from earth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say as I probably thinke, this part of this second booke agaynst Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a collection of this author when he minded to mayntayne Luthers opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Transubstantiation onely, and to striue for bread onely, which not withstanding the new enterprise of this author to deny the reall presence, is so fierce and vehement, as it ouerthroweth his new purpose ere he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in his order in his booke to entreate of. For there can no demonstration be made more euident for the catholike fayth of the reall presence of Christes body in the Sacrament, then that the truth of it was so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly beleued, as they tooke Christes very body as verely in the sacrament, euen as the soule is present in the body of man.</p>

                  <p>WHen you wrote this, it is like that you had not considered my third booke, wherin is a playne and direct answer to all that you haue brought in this place, or els where, concerning the reall presence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body and bloud in the Sacrament. And how slender proofes you make in this place, to proue the reall presence, because of the Sacrifice, euery man may iudge, being neyther your argument good, nor your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent true. For S. Augustine sayth not, that the body and bloud of Christ is the sacrifice of the church, and if he had so sayd, it inferreth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this conclusion, that the body of Christ should be really in the bread, and his bloud in the wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How bread is Christes body.</note>And although S. Augustine sayth, that bread is Christes body, yet if you had well marked the 64.65. 66. leaues of my booke, you should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there haue perceaued how S. Augustine declareth at length, in what manner of speach that is to be vnderstand, that is to say figuratiuely, in which speach the thing that signifieth and the thing that is signified, haue both one name,<note place="margin">Ciprianus de vnctione chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis.</note> as S. Ciprian manifestly teacheth. For in playne speach without figure, bread is not the body of Christ by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, who do say, that the affirmation of one substance is the negation of an other. And if the bread were made the body of Christ (as you say it is) then must you needes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that the body of Christ is made of bread, which before you sayd was so foolish a saying, as were not tollerable by a scoffer to be deuised in a play, to supply when his fellow had forgotten his part. And seeing that the bread is not adnihilate and consumed into nothing (as the schoole authors teach) then must it needes follow, that the body of Christ is made of the matter of bread, for that it is made of the forme of bread, I suppose you will not graunt.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the second place of S. Augustine, he sayth not that the body and bloud of Christ be really in the Sacrament, but that in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sacrifice of the church, that is to say, in the holy administration of the Lordes supper, is both a Sacrament and the thing signified by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Sacrament being the bread and wine, and the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and exhibited, being the body and bloud of Christ. But S. Augustine sayth not, that the thing signified is in the bread and wine (to whome it


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7682:166"/>
is not exhibited, nor is not in it, (but as in a figure) but that it is there in the true ministration of the Sacrament, present to the spirite and fayth of the true beleuing man, and exhibited truely and indeede, and yet spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually not corporally.</p>
                  <p>And what neede any more euident proofes of S. Augustines mynd in this matter, how bread is called Christes body then S.

                  </p>
                  <p>The offering which the priest maketh, is called improperly the passion, death, or crucifying of Christ, not that it is that, but that it signifieth it. And the heauenly Sacrament (which truly represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth Christes flesh) is called Christes body, but improperly. And therfore is sayd (after a manner, but not in the truth of the thing, but in the signifying mistery.) So that the sence is this, it is called the body of Christ, that is to say, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth. Now the wordes of S. Augustine being so playne, that none can be more, and following the other wordes within tenne lines (so that you can alleadge no ignorance, but you must needes see them) it can be none other but a wilfull blindnes, that you will not see, and also a wilfull concealing and hiding of the truth from other men, that they should not see neyther.</p>
                  <p>And this one place is sufficient at full to answere what so euer you can bring of the presence of Christ in the Sacrament of bread and wine. For after consecration, the body &amp; bloud of Christ be in them but as in figures, although in the godly receauors, he is really present by his omnipotent power, which is as great a miracle in our dayly nurrishing, as is wrought before in our regeneration. And therfore is Christ no lesse to be honored of them that feede of him in his holy supper, then of them that be grafted in him by regeneration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And where as I sayd vpon S.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7682:167"/>
you should not say, that I nipt him. For S. Augustine sayth not, that the sacrament consisteth of two natures, and therfore both these natures must needes remayne in the Sacrament, but he sayth that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice consisteth of two thinges, which he calleth also natures, and therof it followeth, that those two thinges must be in the sacrifice, which is to be vnderstande, in the ministration not in the bread and wine reserued. And very true it is (as S Augustine sayth) that the sacrifice of the church consisteth of two thinges, of the Sacrament, and of the thing therby sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, which is Christes body, as the person of Christ consisteth of god and man.</p>
                  <p>But yet this resemblance is not altogither like (as you say truely for so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> much) for the person of Christ consisteth so of his godhead and manhod, that they be both in him in reall presence and vnity of person. But in the sacrifice it is otherwise, where neither is any such vnion betwene the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the truth of the Sacrament, nor any such presence of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ. For in the bread and wine Christ is but figuratiuely (as I sayd before) and in the godly receauours spiritually, in whome also he tarieth &amp; remayneth so long as they remayne the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his body.</p>

Yet you know the similitude was not taught of our Sauiour Christ for that purpose (for God is no fauourer of falsehod and vntruth.) So you do wrong both to the holy Doctoures and to me, to gather of oure simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude any other doctrine, than we meane by the sayd similitude.

                  <p>The other example is of the Lordes Supper or ministration of the Sacrament, where is also togither the substaunce and nature of bread and wine with the body and bloud of Christ, and the presence of the one putteth not away the other, no more then the presence of Christes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie putteth away hys diuinitie. And as the presence of the soule driueth not away the body, nor the presence of the fleshe and bloud of Christ driueth not away the bread and wine, so doth not the presence of Christes humanity, expell his diuinitie, but his diuinitie remayneth still with his humanitie, as the soule doth with the body, and the body of Christ with the bread. And then if there remayne not the nature and substaunce of bread, it must follow also, that there remaineth not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature of Christ, with his humanity, or els the similitude is cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolued.</p>
                  <p>But yet say you, we may not presse all partes of the resemblance with a through equality, but onely haue respect to the end, wherfore the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is made.

For the olde Authors make this resemblance, onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the remayning of two natures, not the manner and forme of remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is farre diuers in the person of Christ, from the vnion in the Sacrament. For the two natures of Christ be ioyned togither in vnity of person, which vnity is not betwene the Sacrament and the body of Christ. But in that poynt wherein the resemblance is made, there must needes be an equality by your owne saying. And for as much as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance was made onely for the remayning of two natures, therfore as the perfite natures of Christes manhod &amp; godhead, do both remayne, and the perfite nature of the soule and the body both also remayne so must the perfite nature of Christes body and bloud, and of bread and wine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so remayne. But for as much as the similitude was not made for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7682:168"/>
of remayning, nor for the place, therfore the resemblance requireth not, that the body and bloud of Christ should be vnited to the bread and wine in person or in place, but onely that the natures should remayne euery one in his kind. And so be you cleane ouerthrowen with your tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, except you will ioyne your selfe with those Heretikes, which denied Christes humanity &amp; diuinity to remayne both togithers.</p>

with the body. And it is not so great a meruayle that his body should be in heauen, and the sacrament of it here, as it is that his body should be here, and his soule in hell.</p>
                  <p>And if the Sacrament were a man, and the body of Christ the soule of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> it, (as you dreame in your traunse) then were the Sacrament not in a traunse, but dead for the tyme, whilest it were here, and the soule in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And like scoffing you might make of the Sacrament of Baptisme, as you doe in the Sacrament of Christes body, that it lyeth here in a traunse, when Christ being the life therof is in heauen.</p>
                  <p>And where you thinke that my second booke agaynst Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> was a collection of me, when I minded to mayntayne Luthers opinion agaynst Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiation onely, you haue no probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your thought, but still you remayne in your dreames, traunses and vayne phantasies, which you haue vsed throughout your booke, so that what so euer is in the bread and wine, there is in you no Transubstantiation, nor alteration in this thing at all.</p>
                  <p>And what auayleth it you so often to affirme this vntruth, that the body of Christ is present in the Sacrament, as the soule of man is present in the body, except you be like to them that tell a lye so often, that with often repeating they think men beleue it, and sometyme by often telling they beleue it them selues. But the authors bring not this similitude of the body and soule of man, to proue therby the presence of Christes body in the Sacrament, but to proue the two natures of the godhead and the manhoode in the person of Christ. Lette vs now discusse the minde of Chrisostome in this matter, whome I bring thus in my booke.</p>

Agaynst whome S. Iohn Chrisostome writeth thus.</p>
                  <p>When thou speakest of God, thou must consider a thing that in nature is single without composition, without conuersion that is inuisible, immortall, incircumscriptible, incomprehensible with such like. And when thou spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest of man thou meanest a nature that is weake, subiect to hunger, thirst, weeping, feare, sweating, and such like passions, which can not be in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature. And when thou speakest of Christ, thou ioynest two natures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in one persone, who is both passible and impassible: Passible as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his flesh, and impassible in his deite.</p>
                  <p>And after he concludeth saying: Wherfore Christ is both God and man: God by his impassible nature, and man bicause he suffered. He himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one person, one sonne, one Lord, hath the dominion and power of two natures ioyned togither, which be not of one substance, but ech of them hath his properties distinct from the other. And therfore remayneth there two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, distinct, and not confounded. For as before the consecration of the bread, we call it bread, <hi>but when Gods grace hath sanctified it by the priest, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the name of bread, and is exalted to the name of the body of the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the nature of the bread remayne still in it,</hi> and it is not called two bodies, but one body of Gods sonne: so likewise here, the diuine nature resteth in the body of Christ, and these two make one sonne, and one person.</p>

But what is this to make foundation of an argument vpon a secret copy of an epistle vttered at one tyme in diuers senses? I shall touch one speciall poynt, Peter Martyr sayth in Latin, whome the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator in English therin followeth, that the bread is reputed worthy the name of the Lordes body. This author Englishing the same place, termeth it (exalted to the name of the Lordes body) which wordes of exalting come nearer to the purpose of this author <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to haue the bread but a figure and therwith neuer the holier of it selfe. But a figure can neuer be accompted worthy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of our Lordes body, the very thing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament, onles there were the thing in deede, as there is by conuersion, as the church truely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Is not heare reader a meruaylous diuersity in report, and the same so set forth, as thou that canst but reade English mayst euidently see it? God ordring it so as such varieties and contradictions should so manifestly appeare, where the truth is impugned? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Agayne this author maketh Chrisostome to speake strangely in the end of this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the diuine nature resteth in the body of Christ, as though the nature of man were the stay to the diuine nature, where as in that vnion the rest is an ineffable miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the two natures in Christ to haue one substance called and termed an hipostasie, and therfore he that hath translated Peter Martyr into English doth translate it thus: The diuine constitution the nature of the body adioyned, these two both togither, make one sonne and one person.</p>
                  <p>Thou reader mayst compare the bookes that be abroad of Peter Martyr in Latine, of Peter Martyr in English and this authors booke, with that I write, and so deeme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whither I say true or no. But to the purpose of S. Chrisostomes wordes (if they be his wordes) he directeth his argument to shew by the mistery, of the Sacrament, that as in it there is no confusion of natures, but each remayneth in his property, so likewise in Christ the nature of his godhead doth not confound the nature of his manhode. If the visible creatures were in the Sacrament by the presence of Christes body there truely present, inuisible also as that body is, impalpable also as that body is, incorruptible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as that is, then were the visible nature altred, and as it were confounded, which Chrisostome sayth is not so, for the nature of the bread remayneth, by which word of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is conueniently signified the property of nature. For proofe wherof, to shew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning of the property without alteration, Chrisostome maketh onely the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and before I haue shewed how nature signifieth the propriety of nature, and may signifie the outward part of nature, that is to say, the accidents being substance in his proper signification the inward nature of the thyng, of the conuersion wherof, is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnderstand transubstantiation.</p>

Is this then a strange speach to you, that the diuine nature resteth in the flesh, that is to say, in the body of Christ? which if you deny, you know whose spirite yon haue. But your trust is altogither in obscure speaches, wherwith you trust so to darken the matter, that no man shall vnderstand it, least that if they vnderstand it, they must needes perceaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> your ignorance and error.</p>
                  <p>But when you promise to come to the purpose, (as to say the truth, all that you sayd before is clearly without purpose) but when you promise (I say) now at length to come to the purpose, your answere is nothing to the purpose of S. Chrisostoms mynd: for he made not his resemblance (as you say he did) onely to shew the remayning of the accidents (which you call the properties) but to shew the remayning of the substances, with all the naturall properties therof. That as Christ had here in earth his diuinity and humanity, remayning euery of them with his naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, the substance of his godhead, being a nature single without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, without conuersion inuisible, immortall, incircumscriptible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, and such like, (for these be Chrisostomes owne wordes) and the substance of his humanity, being a feble nature, subiect to hunger, thyrst, weeping, feare, sweating, and such passions, so is it in the bread and Christes body, that the bread after sanctification or consecration (as you call it) remayneth in his substance that it had before: and likewise doth the body of Christ remayne still in heauen in his very true substance, wherof the bread is a Sacrament and figure. For els, if the substance of the bread remayned not, how could Chrisostome bring it for a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, to proue that the substance of Christes humanity remayneth with his diuinity? Mary this that you say, had bene a gay lesson for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, to say that there appeareth bread by all the accidents therof, and yet is none in deede, that then by this similitude they might say likewise, that Christ appeared a man by all the accidences and properties of a man, and yet he was none in deede. And to make an ende of this author, your vayne comment will not serue you, to call the accidents of bread, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread, except you will alow the same in the Manichees, that the nature of Christes body, is nothing els but the accidences therof.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth Gelasius of the same matter.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto accordeth also Gelasius, writing agaynst Eutiches and Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,<note place="margin">Gelasius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Eutichen &amp; Nestorium.</note> of whome the one sayd, that Christ was a perfect man, but not God: and the other affirmed cleane contrary, that he was very God but not man. But agaynst these two heinous heresies, Gelasius proueth by most manifest scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Christ is both God and man, and that after his Incarnation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth in him as well the nature of his Godhead, as the nature of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, so that he hath in him two natures with their naturall properties, and yet is he but one Christ.</p>
                  <p>And for the more euident declaration hereof, he bringeth two examples, the one is of man, who being but one, yet he is made of two partes, &amp; hath in him two natures remayning both togither in him, that is to say, the body &amp; the soule with their naturall properties.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Note well these wordes agaynst all the Papistes of our tyme, that Gelasius (which was Bishop of Rome more then a thousand yeares passed) writeth of this Sacrament, that the bread and wine cease not to be there still, as Christ ceased not to be God after his incarnation, but remayned still perfect god, as he was before.</p>

Betwene the abominable teaching of Nestorius, sometyme not ruler but waster, not pastor, but pray searcher, of the church of Constantinople, and the wicked and detestable sect of Eutiches, the craft of the deuils spoyling so facioned it selfe, that men could not auoyd any of the secrets without danger of the other: So as whiles any man condemneth the falsenes of Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, he may be thought fallen to the errour of the Eutichian, and whiles he destroyeth the wickednes of the Eutichian, and whiles be destroyeth the wickednes of the Eutichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heresie, he may be challenged to releeue the teaching of the Nestorian.</q>
This is the sentence of Uigilius, by which appeareth how these heresies were both subtill conueyed, without so playne contradiction, as this author eyther by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or of purpose fayneth, as though the Nestorian should say, that Christ was a perfect man, but not God, and the Eutichian cleane contrary, very God, but not man. For if the heresies had bene such, Uigilius had had no cause to speake of any such ambiguity, as he noteth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man should hardly speake agaynst the one, but he might be suspected to fauor the other. And yet I graunt that the Nestorians saying might imply Christ not to be God, bicause they would two distinct different natures, to make also two distinct persons, and so as it were two Christs, the one onely man, and the other onely God, so as by their teaching God was neither incarnate, nor as Gregory Nazianzene sayth, man deitate, for so he is termed to say.</p>
                  <p>The Eutichians as S. Augustine sayth reasoning agaynst the Nestorians, became heretiques themselues, and bicause we confesse truely by fayth but one Christ the sonne of God very God: The Eutichians say, although there were in the virgins wombe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the adunation, two natures, yet after the adunation, in that mistery of Christes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, there is but one nature, and that to be the nature of God, into which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man was after their fansye transfused and so confounded, wherupon by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation a man might gather the nature of humanity not to remayne in Christ after the adunation in the virgins wombe.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And hereof I write thus much, bicause it should appeare that Gelasius by his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Sacrament, and of the two natures in man, went not about to proue that the godhead remayned in Christ after his incarnation, as the author of this booke would haue it, for the Nestorian sayd the godhead was an accession to Christ afterward by merite, and therfore with them there was no talke of remayning, when they este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Christes nature in his conception singuler and onely by gods power conceyued but onely man. And agayne the Eutichian so affirmed the continuance of the diuine nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in Christ after the adunation, as Gelasius had no cause to proue that was graunted, that is to say, the remayne of the diuine nature, but on the other side to proue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne of the humayne nature in Christ, which by the Eutichians was by implication rather denyed. Nestorius deuided God and man, and graunted alwayes both to be in Christ continually, but as two persons, and the person of Christ being God, dwelling within the person of Christ being man, and as Christ man encreased, so Christ God dignified him and so diuided one Christ into two persons, bicause of the two natures so different, which was agaynst the rules of our fayth, and destroyed therby the mistery of our redemption. And the Eutichians affirming catholiquely to be but one person in Christ, did perniciously say there was but one nature in Christ, accompting by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the humayne nature transfused into the diuine nature and so confounded. And to shew the narrow passage, Uigilius spake of Cirillus a catholike author, bicause writing of the vnity of Christes person, he expressed his meaning by the word (nature)<note place="margin">Nature.</note> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of any one constitution, which more properly the word person doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.<note place="margin">Personne.</note> The Eutichians would by that word after gather that he fauored their part, so taking the word at a vantage.</p>
                  <p>And bicause the same Cyrillus vsed the word subsistence to signifie substance,<note place="margin">Subsistence.</note> and therfore sayd in Christ there were two subsistences, meaning the diuine substance and humayne substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">Substaunce.</note> forasmuch as the word subsistence is vsed to expresse the person, that as to say hipostasie: There were that of that word frowardly vnderstanded, would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee should say, that there were two persons in Christ, which was the Nestorians heresie that he impugned. Such captiousnes was there in wordes, when arrogant men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> cared not by what meane to mayntayne their errour. These were both pernitious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and yet subtill, and each had a meruailous pretence of the defence of the glory of God, euen as is now pretended agaynst the Sacrament. And either part abused many scriptures, and had notable apparances for that they sayd, so as he that were not well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> exercised in scriptures, and the rules of our fayth, might be easely circumuented. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius was the greate Archebishop of Constantinople, vnto whome Cirill that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his heresy writeth, that seing he sclandereth the whole Church with his heresie, he must resist him, although he be a father, bicause Christ sayth, he that loueth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aboue me, is not worthy me. But Nestorius as appeareth although he vsed it ilfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uordly, had much learning and cloked his heresy craftely, denying the grosse matter that they imputed to him to teach two Christes, and other specialities layd to his charge and yet condemning the doctrine of Cyrill, and professing his owne fayth in his owne termes, could not hide his heresie so, but it appeareth to bee and contayne in effect that he was charged with, and therfore an admonishing was geuen by a catholike writer. Beleue not Nestorius, though he say he teach but one Christ. If one should heare aske what is this to the purpose to talke so much of these sectes? I Answere, this knowledge shall generally serue to note the manner of them that goe about to deceaue the world with false doctrine, which is good to learne.</p>
                  <p>An other speciall seruice is to declare how the author of this booke, eyther doth not


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7682:172"/>
know the state of the matter in these heresies he speaketh of, or els misreporteth them of purpose. And the arguing of Gelasius in this matter well opened, shall geue light of the truth of the mistery of the Sacrament, who agaynst the Eutichians vseth two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of examples, one of the two different natures to remayne in one person of man, and yet the Eutichians defamed that coniunction, with remayne of two different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and called it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, double nature, and Gelasius to enconter that terme sayth, they will with their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> one nature reserue not one Christ and whole Christ. And if two different natures, that is to say, soule and body make but one man, why not so in Christ? For where scripture speaketh of the outward man and inward man, that is to shew (Gelasius sayth) two diuers qualities in the same man, &amp; not to deuide the same into two men, and so intendeth to shew there ought to be no scruple to graunt two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures to remayne in their propriety, for feare that euery diuers nature should make a diuers person, and so in Christ diuide the vnity concluding that the integritie of Christ can not be but both the natures different remayning in their property Carnall imagination troubled the Eutichians to haue one person of two such differente natures remayning in their property, which the Nestorians releued with deuise of two persons, and the Eutichians by confusion of the humayne nature.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth Gelasius to the argument of example from the Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ, and noteth the person of Christ to be a principall mistery, and the Sacrament an image and similitude of that mistery, which sence his wordes must needes haue, bicause he calleth Christ the principall mistery, and as in one place he sayth the image and similitude of the body and bloud of Christ, so by and by he calleth the Sacrament the image of Christ. And here the wordes image and similitude, expresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the manner of presence of the truth of the thinges represented, to be vnderstanded onely by fayth, as inuisibly present. And S. Ambrose by this word image, signifieth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of truth to man in this life. And to shew the Sacrament to be such an image, as contayneth the very truth of the thing wherof it is the image.
Gelasius declareth in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his argument in these wordes,<q> As bread and wine go into the diuine substance, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> holy ghost bringing it to passe, and yet remayne in the property of their nature, so that principall mistery, those natures remayning wherof it is, declare vnto vs true and whole Christ to continue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these wordes of Gelasius where hee sayth, the bread and wine goe into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine substaunce, is playnly declared the presence of the diuine substaunce, and this diuine substaunce can signifie none other substaunce, but of the body and bloud of Christ, of whiche heauenly nature, and earthly nature of the bread and wine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth this Sacrament the Image of the principall mistery of Christes person.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as in the Image bee two diuers natures, and different remayning in their property: So likewise in the person of Christ, whiche is the conclusion of Gelasius argument, should remayne two natures. And here were a great daunger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> if we should say that Christes body whiche is the celestiall nature in the Sacrament, were there present but in a figure, for it should then imply, that in Christes person the principall mistery, it were also but in a figure. And therefore as in the mistery of Christes person ordayned to redeeme vs, beyng the principall mistery there is no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but truth in consideration of the presence of the two natures whereof Christ is: So in the Sacrament being a mistery ordered to feede vs, and the image of that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall mistery, there is not an onely figure but truth of the presence of the natures, earthly and celestiall, I speake of the truth of the presence, and meane such an integrity of the natures present, as by the rules of our fayth is consonant and agreable to that mistery, that is to say, in the person of Christ perfect God and perfect man, perfect God to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and perfect man to be deitate, as Gregory Nazianzen termeth it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Sacrament, the visible matter of the earthly creature in his propriety of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the vse of signification is necessarily required, and also according to the truth of Christ his wordes, his very body and bloud to be inuisibly with integrity present, which Gelasius calleth the diuine substance. And I thinke it worthy to be noted, that Gelasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> speaking of the bread and wine, reciteth not precisely the substance to remayne, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sayth, the substance or nature, which nature he calleth after the propriety, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiue


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7682:172"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> may be verified in the last. And it is not necessary, the examples to be in all partes equall, as Rusticus Diaconus handleth it very learnedly <hi>ConiraAcephalos.</hi> And Gelasius in opening the mistery of the Sacrament, speaketh of transition of the bread and wine into the godly substance, which word transition, is meete to expresse Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and therfore S. Thomas expressed Transubstantiation with the same word <hi>transire,</hi> writing: <hi>Dogma datur Christianis, quod in carnem transit panis &amp; venu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sanguinem.</hi> But in the mistery of Christes person, there is no tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sition of the Deitie into the humanitie, or humanitie into the Deitie, but onely Assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the humanity with the adunation of those two perfect natures so different, one person &amp; one Christ, who is God incarnate, and man Deitate, as Gregory Nazianzene sayth, without mutation, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, transition, transelementation or transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, which wordes be proper and speciall to expresse how <hi>Eucharistia</hi> is constitute of two different natures, an heauenly and earthly nature, a mystery institute after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the principall mystery, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to féede vs with the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the same glorious body that hath redéemed vs. And bicause in the constitution of this mystery of the Sacrament, there is a transition, of the earthly creature into the diuine substaunce, as Gelasius and S. Thomas terme it, and mutation as Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Ambrose teach it, which Theophilactus expresseth by the word transelementation, Emissen by the word conuersion, and all their wordes reduced into their owne proper sence expressed in one word of transubstantiation: it can not be conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient where the maner of constitution of the two mysteries be so different, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a lyke remainyng of the two natures, wherof the mysteries be. In the mystery of Christes person, bycause there was not of any of the two different natures either muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, transition, conuersion, or transelementation, but onely assumption of the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and adunation in the virgins wombe, we can not say the Godhead to haue suffered in that mystery, which were an absurditie, but to haue wrought the assumption and aduna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans nature with it, nor mans nature by that assumption and adunation dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and therfore professe truly Christ to be whole God and whole man, and God in that mystery to be made man, and man God, where as in the Sacrament bicause of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, mutation, and conuersion of their earthly creatures, wrought by the holy ghost, which declareth those earthly creatures to suffer in this conuersion, mutation and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we knowledge no assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those creatures or adunation with the heauenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therfore say not as we do in the principall mystery, that ech nature is wholly the other, and as we professe God incarnate, so the body of Christ breaded, and as man is Deitate, so the bread is corporate, which we should say, if the rules of our faith could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the constitution of ech mystery to be taught a lyke, whiche the truth of Gods word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> doth not suffer. Wherfore although Gelasius and other argue from the Sacrament, to declare the mystery of Christes person, yet we may not presse the Argument to destroy or confounde the propertie of ech mystery, and so violate the rules of our fayth, and in the authors not presse the wordes otherwise then they may agrée with the Catholique teachyng, as those did in the wordes of Cyrill, when he spake of nature and subsistence, wherof I made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion before to be remembred here in Gelasius, that we presse not the word substaunce and nature in him, but as may agree with the transition he speaketh of, by which word other expresse transubstantiation. And agaynst the Eutichians, for to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their confusion it suffiseth to shew two different natures to be in the Sacrament, and to remaine in their proprietie and the diuine nature not to confound the earthly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor as it were to swalow it, which was the dreame of the Eutichia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And we must forbeare to presse all partes of the example in the other Argument, from the person of man beyng one of the body and soule, which the Church doth professe in <hi>Symbolo Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasij</hi> of all receaued. For Christ is one person of two perfite natures, whereof the one was before the other, in perfection and creation of the other, the one impassible, and the other passible. Man is of the soule and body one, two different natures, but such as for their perfection required that vnitie, wherof none was before other perfect, of Christ we say, he is consubstantiall to his Father, by the substaunce of his Godhead, and consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall to man, by the substaunce of his manhoode, but we may not say, man is consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall by his soule to Aungels, and consubstantiall in his body to beastes, because then we should deduce also Christ by meane of vs to be consubstantiall beastes. And thus I

write to shew that we may not presse the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in euery part of it, as the author of this booke noteth vpon Gelasius, who ouerturneth his doctrine of the figure.</p>

                  <p>I Pitie you, to see how ye swinke and sweate, to confounde this author Gelasius. And yet his woordes be so playne agaynst your Papisticall Transubstantiation, that you haue clearely lost all your paynes, labours, and costes. For these be his wordes, spoken of the Sacrament, <hi>Esse non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinit substantia vel natura panis &amp; vini,</hi> the substaunce or nature of bread and wine ceasseth not to be. But to auoyde and dalye away these wordes, that be so cleare and playne, must needes bee layd on loade of wordes, the wit must be stretched out to the vtmost, all fetches must brought in that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be deuised, all colours of Rethorike must be sought out, all the ayre must be cast ouer with cloudes, all the water darkned with the cuttyls ynke, and if it could be (at the least asmuch as may be) all mens eyes also must be put out, that they should not see. But I would wish that you stode not so much in your owne conceite, trusted not so much in your inuentions and deuise of wit, in eloquence, and in craftines of speach, &amp; multitude of wordes, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should dare encounter you, but that all men should thinke you speake well, bicause you speake much, &amp; that you shuld be had in great reputation among the multitude of them that be ignoraunt, &amp; can not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne perfectly those that folow the right way of truth, from other that would lead them out of the way into errour &amp; blindnesse. This standyng in your conceite, is nothyng els but to stand in your owne light.</p>
                  <p>But where you say, that these heresies of Nestorius &amp; Eutiches were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not so grosse as I report, that the one should say, that Christ was a perfect man, but not God, and the other should say cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God, but not ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of the grossenes of these two heresies, I will not much conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For it might be, that they were of some misreported (as they were in deede if credite be to be giuen to diuers auncient hystories) but this I dare say, that there be diuers authors, that report of them as I do write, and consequently you graunt the same in effect.

And of the Nestorians you say, that they denyed Christ to be conceiued God or borne God, but onely man, and than could not he be naturally God, but onely man. And therfore neither by ignoraunce nor of purpose do I report them otherwise, than you confesse your selfe, and then I haue learned of other that were before my tyme. For S. Augustine in the place which you do cite of him,<note place="margin">August, contra hereses.</note> hath these wordes of Nestorius,
<q>
                        <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizare ausus est, Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum hominem tantum,</hi> he presumed to teach (sayth S.

And Gelasius writeth also thus. <hi>Eutichiani dicunt vnam esse naturam, id est diuinam, ac Nestorius nihilominus meme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat singularem,</hi>

of Christ, and the other his diuinitie (as I haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my booke) so that neither of ignoraunce nor of purpose haue I fayned any thyng, but you, either of malice, or of your accustomed maner to calumniate and find faulte with euery thyng that misliketh you (be it neuer so well) seeke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion likewise hereto carpe and reprehend where no fault is: being like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Momus, which when he could finde no fault with Uenus person, yet he picked a quarell to her slipper.

                  <p>But yet this bye matter (which you bryng in of the grossenes of these two errours) helpeth litle your inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but rather helpeth to fortifie my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agaynst your doctrine of transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, that your doctrine herein maketh a playne way for the Nestorians &amp; the Eutichians to defend their errours. For if the bread and the body of Christ before the consecration in the Sacrament be two natures, and after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration in that myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is but one nature, and that is the body of Christ, into which the nature of bread in your fantasie is transformed and confounded, and if also this mysterie be an example of the mysterie of Christes incarnation (as the old authours report) why may not then the Eutichians say, that before the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunation in the virgins wombe, the Godhead &amp; manhode were two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; yet after the adunation in that mysterie of Christes incarnation, there was but one nature, and that to be the nature of God, into which the nature of man was after their fantasie transfused and confounded? And thus haue you made by your transubstantiation a goodly paterne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the Eutichians to folow in maintenaunce of their errour.</p>
                  <p>And yet although the Eutichians sayd, that the nature of God and of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before their vniting were two, yet I read not that they sayd, that they were two in the virgines wombe (as you report of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) which is no great matter, but to declare how ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you be in the thing, wherof you make so great boast, or how litle you regard the truth, that wittingly wil tell an vntruth.

                  <p>And although Nestorius graunted two natures in Christ, yet not (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> you say) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his natiuitie, nor by adunation, but by cohabitation or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so that he made but one Christ, (although some otherwise take him) and not <hi>alium &amp; alium:</hi> after which sorte the Godhead is also in other godly men, whom by grace he maketh partakers of his godly nature, although by their naturall generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without the diuine nature vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in person, but after obteined by adoption &amp; grace. As by your example, a man is made Bishop, which by naturall generation is borne but a man.</p>
                  <p>And that this was Nestorius opinion, that Christ from his Natiuitie was but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely, &amp; had his godhead after by adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or accession, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of your own wordes, when you say, that the Nestoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s denied Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued God, or borne God, &amp; that the Godhead was an accessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Christ afterward by merite, and that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued but onely man, although shortly after you go from the same, saying that both the Godhead &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode were alwayes in Christ: such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie is in your dreamed pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tasies.</p>
                  <p>And where you haue written thus much (as you say) because it should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> appeare, that Gelasius by his Argumentes of the Sacrament, and of the two natures of man, went abont to proue that the Godhead remained in Christ after his incarnation, you might haue bestowed your tyme better, than to haue lost somuch labour, to impugne the truth. For although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nestorius nor Eutiches denyed the Godhead of Christ to remaine, yet Gelasius went not about onely to confute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also to set out playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true catholicke faith, that Christ being incarnated, was perfect God and perfect man, and how that might be, both the sayd natures and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces remainyng with all their naturall proprieties and conditions, without transubstantiation, abolition, or confusion of any of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And this he declareth aswell by the example of the Sacrament, as of the body and soule of man. Wherfore as true as it is, that the body and soule of man, and Godhead and manhode of Christ, remaine in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per substaunces, natures and properties, without transubstantiation or perishyng of any of them, so must it be in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And in the sayd heresies (as you say) was some appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the truth, euery one hauyng Scripture, which in sounde of wordes seemed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their errours, whereby they deceiued many. But as for your fayned doctrine of Transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, it hath no prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce nor appearance of truth by Gods word, for you haue not one Scripture that maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where as I hane many playne &amp; manifest Scriptures, that speaketh in playne termes, that bread is eaten, and wine is dronken. And this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Gelasius, with diuers other learned men, aswel Greekes as Latins, of the old Catholicke Churche, affirme in no doubtfull wordes, that the bread and wine be not gone, but remaine still. From which Scriptures and Doctours who soeuer dissenteth, declareth him selfe at the least to be

                  <p>And this matter being so cleare, neither your fine disguising, nor your painted colours, nor your gay Rhetorike, nor witty inuentions, can so hyde and couer the truth, that it shal not appeare, but the more you labour to striue agaynst the streame, the more faynt shall you waxe, and at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the truth hath such a violence, that you shall be borne cleane down with the streame therof.</p>

Nestorius (say you) was a great archebishop, and so (say I) was Ciril also. Nestorius (say you) as apeareth had much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, but cloked his heresie craftily. But the Histories of his tyme (who should know him best) describe him in this sorte, that he was a man of no great learnyng, but of an excellent naturall witte and eloquence, and full of craft and subtiltie, by meanes wherof, he was so proude and glorious, that he contemned all men in respect of him selfe, and disdained the old writers, thinkyng him selfe more wise then they all.

                  <p>And all this that you haue brought in here of these two heresies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be to no purpose in the principall matter, yet it serueth me to this purpose, that men may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture whose nature and witte is most like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the description of Nestorius, &amp; also how loth you be to come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; to make a direct aunswere to Gelasius wordes, who sayth in playne termes, that substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or nature of bread &amp; wine remaineth.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> First you would shake him of by this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that he vseth his two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes of the two examples of man, and the Sacrament, agaynst the Eutichians onely. But Gelasius will not so easely leaue his hold. For he speaketh indifferently as well against the Nestorians as the Eutichians, declaring by these two examples, how two differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t natures may remaine in Christ, and that the integritie of Christ can not be, except both the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures remaine in their properties, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth both the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd heresies, that affirmed but one nature to be in Christ, the Eutichians his diuinitie, and the Nestorians his humanitie. And yet if he had vsed these examples agaynst the Eutichians onely, they byte you as sore, as if they were vsed agaynst them both. For if he conclude by these two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, agaynst the Eutichians (as you say hee doth) that the integritie of Christ can not be but both natures different, (that is to say, his manhode and Godhead) must remaine in their propertie, then must it nedes be so in the examples also. And then as Christ had in him two natures, with their naturall properties, neither perishing, but both remainyng, and as man hath in him two natures (the soule and the body) both remainyng still, so


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7682:175"/>
must in the Sacrament also, the nature of bread and wine remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Transubstantiation, or corruption of any of the natures, accordyng to the sayd wordes of Gelasius, <hi>Esse non desinit substantia vel natura panis &amp; vini,</hi> the substance or nature of the bread and wine ceasseth not to be.</p>
                  <p>And Gelasius bringeth not this Image and similitude to that purpose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that you would draw it, that is to say, to expresse the maner of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but to expresse the maner of two natures in Christ, that they both so remaine, that neither is corrupted or transubstantiated, no more then the bread and wine be in the Sacrament. And by this all men may see, that Gelasius hath fastened his teeth so surely, that you can not so lightly cast him of with a shake of your chayne. And if he ment to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the maner of Christes presence in the Sacrament (as you fayne he doth) that the maner is onely by fayth (wherof he speaketh not one word) yet are you nothyng at libertie thereby, but held much more faster, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you were before. For Gelasius speaketh of the action of the mystery, &amp; Christes flesh and bloud be present in the action of the mystery onely by fayth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can they not be present in the bread or wine reserued, which haue no fayth at all. And presence by fayth onely requireth no reall, materiall, and and corporall presence.<note place="margin">Presence by fayth requireth no corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> For by fayth is Christ present in Baptisme, and by fayth Abraham saw him, &amp; the holy Fathers did eate his flesh and drincke his bloud, before he was borne. And Christ humbling him selfe to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our mortall nature,<note place="margin">Gala. 3. Ihon. 8. 1. Cor. 10,</note> hath exalted vs to the nature of his deitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs to reigne with him in his immortall glory, as it were Gods. And this (sayth Gelasius) God worketh in vs by his Sacramentes <hi>per quae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinae efficimur consortes naturae, &amp; tamen esse non desinit substantia vel natura panis &amp; vini,</hi> that is to say, by the Sacrament of Christes body and bloud we be associate vnto the diuine nature, and yet ceasseth not the substaunce or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread and wine to be. So that the Sacrament not beyng altered in substaunce, we be altered and go into the diuine nature or substaunce (as Gelasius termeth it,) beyng made partakers of Gods eternitie.</p>
                  <p>And therfore when he speaketh of the goyng of the Sacraments into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the diuine substaunce, he meaneth not, that the substaunces of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments go into the substaunce of God (which no creature can do) but that in the action of that mystery, to them that worthely receaue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, to them they be turned into diuine substaunce, through the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Ghost, who maketh the godly receauers to be the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the diuine nature and substaunce. And that this was the intent &amp; meanyng of Gelasius, appeareth by two notable sentences of him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is this. Surely (sayth he) the Image and similitude of the body and bloud of Christ, is celebrate in the action of the mysterie. The other is, that by the Sacrament we be made partakers of the godly nature: he sayth not, that the Sacramentes be, but that we be made partakers of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christes Godhead. And if he should meane (as you haue most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely altered both his wordes &amp; sence at your pleasure) not that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiuers, but that the substaunce of bread and wine should go into the diuine substaunce, then were not they chaunged into his humanitie, but into his deitie, and so were the bread and wine deified, or at the least made partakers of the diuine nature and immortalitie. But for asmuch as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius sayth, that the two natures in Christ remaine, in like case as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7682:175"/>
of the sacraments remayne, for he maketh his argument alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither of the remayning of the natures, by the verbe (<hi>permanere</hi>) and the participle (<hi>permanens</hi>) then as you say that the integrity of Christ can not be, except both his natures different remayne in their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so can not the integritie of the sacrament be, except the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine remayne in their properties. For els, seeing that the remayning of the natures is in the Sacrament as it is in Christ, (as Gelasius sayth) then if in the Sacraments remayne but the accidents and apearance of bread and wine, and not the substances of them, how could Gelasius by the resemblance of the two sacraments of bread and wine, proue the two substances and natures of Christ to remayne. Might it not rather be gathered, that onely the appearance of Christes humanity remayneth in accidents, and not the substance of it selfe (as Martion sayth, &amp; as you say it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament) or els that Christes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is absorpted vp by his diuinity, and confounded therwith, as the Eutichians say, that the bread and wine is by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body and bloud of Christ? But the catholique fayth hath taught from the beginning, according to holy scripture, that as the image or sacrament be two diuers natures and different, remayning in their properties (that is to say bread and wine) so likewise in the person of Christ remayne two natures, his diuinity and his humanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And I pray you, what danger is it to say, that Christes body is in the sacramentall bread, but as in a figure? should that emply, that his body is in his person, but as in a figure? That should be euen as good an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this: Christ was in the brasen serpent, but in a figure, ergo he is now in heauen but in a figure. For the forme of argumentation is all one in the one and the other. And if Christ be in vs by vertue and efficacie, although in the sacraments representing the same (as Gelasius sayth) he be but sacramentally, figuratiuely, and significatiuely, what perill is it to vs? And what auayleth it vs his being in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, and not in vs.</p>
                  <p>And the two natures in the Sacrament (which Gelasius taketh for the image and similitude of the two natures in Christ) be bread and wine, which as they remayne, and that truely in their natures and substances, so do the two natures in Christ. And yet be the bread and wine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the terrestriall nature of Christ, that is to say, of his body and bloud, but not of his celestiall and diuine nature, as you imagine. And they be called Sacraments, bicause they be figures, which if they were no figures, they were no Sacraments. But it is not required, that the thing represented by the figure, should be really and corporally present in the figure when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figures ordeyned to represent a thing corporally abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure were in vayne, as Lactansius sayth,<note place="margin">Lactantius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. lib. 2. c. 1.</note> if the thing were present.</p>
                  <p>And at the least wise in this place Gelasius vseth the natures and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of bread and wine (which be Sacraments of Christes flesh and bloud) to be images and similitudes in this poynt, not of his flesh and bloud, but of his diuine and humayne nature, that as the bread and wine in the Sacrament remayne still in theire proper kindes, without violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adnihilation, confusion, commixtion or Transubstantiation, so is it in the two natures of Christes manhode and his godhead. So that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius vseth this similitude for the incarnation of Christ, not for the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7682:176"/>
of the sacrament, as you would peruert his meaning.</p>
                  <p>And bicause you would haue all your thinges strange (as it were one that had come out of a strange cuntry, where he had learned a strange fashion of speach, neuer heard of before, or rather deuised it himselfe) you call the colours of bread and wine, the matter of bread and wine, bicause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> colours onely be visible after your teaching. And then must the naturall property of colours be, to signify our feeding spirituall by the body and bloud of Christ, that as they feede vs spiritually, so do the colours corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. And then making the argument <hi>ab opposito consequentis, ad oppositum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedentis,</hi> as colours feede not our bodyes, so Christ feedeth not our soules. This is the conclusion of your goodly new deuised diuinity.</p>
                  <p>And to like effect cometh your other saying in the same sentence, (bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> you were loth to commit but one horrible errour in one sentence) that Gelasius calleth Christes body and bloud his diuine substance.</p>
                  <p>This is a goodly hearing for the Eutichians, who say, that in Christ is no moe natures but his diuine substance, which by your interpretation must be true. For if his godhead be a diuine substance, and his body and bloud also a diuine substance, why should Eutiches be reprehended for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying in Christ to be any other than diuine substaunce? And so shall we bring to passe, that either Christ hath but one substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or two diuine sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>staunces (although not of like sorte) and so not one humaine substaunce. And is it like, that Gelasius, (who so long conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded agaynst Eutiches for two distinct substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in Christ, humaine and diuine) would in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of his disputation so much yeld vnto the hereticke, to graunt that Christes humaine substaunce should be a diuine substaunce?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Substaunce or nature.</note>And it is worthy to be noted, and double noted, how you wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the wordes of Gelasius, &amp; wrast them cleane out of tune. For where Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius sayth, that there remaineth the substaunce or nature of bread and wyne (to declare thereby the remainyng of two natures in Christ) you say that Gelasius saying may be verified in the last, and not in the first, that is to say, that the nature of bread and wine remaineth. And nature (say you) is there taken for the proprieties,<note place="margin">Nature for propertie.</note> which you call accidentes. And so you make Gelasius a goodly teacher, that should so ambiguously speake of two thyngs, when he meaneth but of one. For when he sayth, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce or nature remayneth, you say, he meaneth that onely the nature remaineth. And were this tollerable in a learned man, when he meaneth the nature to remaine, &amp; not the substaunce, to expresse it by these termes, The substaunce or nature remaineth? And if Gelasius meane that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of bread and wine remaineth not, but the natures, and then if by nature he vnderstode the accidentes (as you vntruely surmise of him) and make them the Image and similitude, to proue Christes two natures, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they proue no more, but that the accidentes of Christes natures remayne, and not the substaunce, whiche saying, whether it be a fauouryng of the Eutichians, Nestorians, Ualentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Martionistes, Apolinaristes, and other of that sort, let the learned be iudge.</p>
                  <p>And although it be not necessary the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples to be in all partes equall (as you alledge of <hi>Rusticus Diaconus</hi>) yet they must needes be like in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> point,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> wherfore they were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be examples, for els they were none examples. And therefore seyng that the bread and wine were of Gelasius brought


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7682:176"/>
for examples of Christes two natures, for this inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to proue that the two natures of Christ remaine in their substaunce, it must needes be so in the bread and wine or els they serued nothyng to that purpose.</p>
                  <p>And the transition that Gelasius ment of, is in the persons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Sacramentes, whiche be transformed into the diuine nature, (as Gelasius sayth) by efficacie &amp; vertue represented by the Sacraments, but the transition is not in the bread and wyne (as you and your Thomas imagine of transition) whiche remaine in the Sacrament without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciall mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, transitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, transelementatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if in the mystery of the Sacrament were transition, mutation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, and transelementation of the substaunce of bread and wine, how could that mystery be an example of the principall mystery of Christes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, to proue thereby that there is no transition, mutation, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or transelementation, of the two substaunces of Christ in his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Doth not the remainyng of substaunce in the Sacrament, proue the remainyng of substaunce in the Incarnation? For how can the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainyng of substaunce, be an example, image, and similitude to proue the remainyng of the substaunce? But here appeareth what it is to wrastle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the truth, &amp; to defend an euell cause, &amp; what absurdities wit &amp; elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be driuen vnto, when they striue agaynst God and his word.</p>

And then by argument from the cause, wherfore the resemblance was made, if the substance and nature of the bread and wine remayne not in the Sacrament, it followeth that the two natures and substance of Christ remayne not in his person, which is no sound teaching, wherfore to make the argument agree with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike teaching, we must needes say, that as in the person of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne the two natures and substance, of his godhead and manhod, so in the sacrament remayne the natures and substances of bread and wine, that the comparisons may agree with themselues and with the catholike fayth. Like as it is also in the other example of the body and soule, which two natures must needes remayne in the person of man, without tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation of any nature if they shall resemble the remayning of the two natures in Christ. And how do the two natures in the Sacrament remayne in their property (I pray you declare) if the nature of bread and wine be gon?

                  <p>Now let the Papistes choose, which of these two they will graunt (for one of them they must needes graunt) eyther that the nature and substance of bread and wine remayne still in the Sacrament after the consecration, (and than must they recant their doctrine of Transubstantiation) or els that they be of the errour of Nestorius, and other, which did say, that the nature of the Godhead, or of the manhod remayned not in Christ after his incarnation or ascension. For all these olde authors agree, that it is in the one, as it is in the other.</p>

For as the Eutichians reasoning (as S. Augustin sayth) to confound the Nestorians, fell into an absurdity in the confusion of their two natures in Christ: so Theodoretus reasoning agaynst the Eutichians, fell in a vehement sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition to be a Nestorian, like as S. Augustine reasoning agaynst the Maniches for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of free will, seemed to speake that the Pelagians would alow, and reasoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst Pelagians, seemed to say that the Manichees would alow, such a daunger it is to reduce extremities to the meane, wherein S. Augustine was better purged then Theodoret was, although Theodoret was reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled. But for example of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue sayd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Theodoretus agaynst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eutichia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to auoyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of natures in Christ sheweth how in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t where the truth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mistery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two natures in Christ may be as it were in similitude learned, the presence of the body of Christ there in the Sacrament doth not alter the nature, that is to say, the property of the visible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This saying was that the Nestorians would draw for there purpose to proue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct persons, agaynst whome Cirill trauayled to shew that in the Sacrament the flesh of Christ that was geuen to be eaten was geuen, not as the flesh of a common man, but as the flesh of God, wherby appeared the vnity of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to the manhod in Christ in one person, and yet no confusion, as Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus doth by his argument declare. But whether the Printers negligence, or this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ouersight hath confounded, or confused this matter in the vttering of it, I can not tell. For the author of this booke concludeth solemnly thus by induction of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that euen so the body of Christ was after the ascention changed into the godly substance. I wene the Printer left out a (not) and should haue sayd not changed, into the godly substance, for so the sence should be as Peter Martyr reporteth Theodorete. And yet the triumphe this author maketh agaynst them, he calleth for his pleasure Papistes, with his forked dilemma maketh me doubt, whether he wist what he sayd, or no: bicause he bringeth in Nestorius so out of purpose, saying the Papistes must ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graunt the substance of bread and wine to remayne, or els to be of Nestorius he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, that the nature of Godhed remayned not.</p>
                  <p>This author of the booke for the name of Nestorius, should haue put Eutiches, and then sayd for conclusion. The nature of manhod remayned not in Christ. And although


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7682:177"/>
in Theodoret the substance of bread is spoken of to remayne, yet bicause he doth after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> expound himselfe to speake of that is seene and felt, he seemeth to speake of Substance after the common capacity, and not as it is truely in learning vnderstanded, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inuisible and not palpable nature, but onely perceaued by vnderstanding, so as this outward nature that Theodorete speaketh of, may according to his wordes truly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> remayne, notwithstanding Transubstantiation. This author declareth playnly his ignoraunce, not to perceaue whither the argument of Theodoret and Gelasius ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which is properly agaynst the Eutichians rather then the Nestorians. For and no propriety of bread remayne, it proueth not the Godhead in Christ not to remayne, but the humanity onely to be as it were swallowed vp of the diuinity, which the Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians entended and specially after Christes resurrection, agaynst whome the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by Theodorete is specially brought, how so euer this author confoundeth the Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Eutiches names and taketh one for an other, which in so high a matter is no small fault, and yet no great fault among so many other houger and greater as be in this booke committed.</p>

And for ignorance of confusion, you confounde all togither. Gelasius and Theodorete proue, that the two natures in Christ be not confounded, bicause they remayne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both in their owne substances and properties, so that the remayning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth no confusion, which should be confounded if they remayned not. If a droppe of milke be put into a pot of wine, by and by it looseth the first nature and substance, and is confounded with the nature and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of wine. And if wine and milke be put togither in equale quantity, then both be confounded, bicause neyther remayneth, neyther perfect wine with his substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; natural proprieties, nor perfect milke, with the substance &amp; proprieties of milke, but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion, an humble iomble or hotch potch, a posset or sillabub is made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both togither, like as in mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the foure eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, not one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts remayning in his proper substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, forme &amp; pure naturall qualities.</p>
                  <p>So that if one nature remayne not, the same is confounded. And if there be more natures that lose their substance, they be all confounded, except there be an vtter consumption or adnihilation of the thing that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his substance, and therfore the argument which all the old ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall authors vse, to saue the confusion of the two natures in Christ, is to proue, that they both remayne. And if we may learne that, by the similitude of the sacrament (as Gelasius and Theodoret teach, and you here confesse the same) then must needes the substance of bread and wine remayne, or els is there none example nor similitude of the remayning of two natures in Christ, but of their confusion, as by youre fayned doctrine the substance of bread is confounded with the body of Christ, neyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adnihilate, nor remayning, but transubstantiated, confounded and conuerted into the substance of Christes body. And thus with your well vnderstanding of the matter, you confound all togither, where as I with my ignorance, not blaspheming that holy vnion and mistery of Christes

But surely more grosse ignoraunce or wilfull impiety then you haue shewed in this matter, hath not lightly bene seene or red of.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that I by ouersight, or the Printer by negligence, haue left out a (not,<note place="margin">Not.</note>) if I should haue put in that (not) of myne owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> head contrarye to the originall in Greeke, and to all the translatours in Latine, and the translation of Master Peter Martyr also, I should haue bene as farre ouerseene as you bee, whiche as it seemeth of purpose confound and corrupt, you care not whether any Authors wordes, or their meanyng.</p>
                  <p>And as for my forked dilemma, you shall neuer be able to aunswer ther to, but the more you trauayle therein, the more you shall entangle your selfe. For eyther you must graunt (as vnwilling as you be) that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substance of bread and wine remayne after the consecration, or els that the nature and substance of Christes humanity and diuinitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne not after his incarnation, wherein erred not onely Eutiches (whome you say I should haue put for Nestorius) but also Martion, Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Ualentinus, Nestorius, and other as in my booke I haue declared.</p>
                  <p>And one thing is principally to be noted in your answere to Theodoret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> how you can sophisticate and falsefy all mens sayinges, be they neuer so playne. For where betweene me and the Papistes the matter here in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is this. Whether the bread and wine remayne in their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substauce or no. I saying that they remayne, and the Papistes saying that they remayne not, the Issue being in this poynt whether they remayne, or remayne not, I bring for me Chrisostome (who sayth, the nature of bread remayneth:) I bring Gelasius, (who sayth, that there ceaseth not the substance or nature of bread and wine) I bring this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret, whose wordes be these: The bread and wine after consecration lose not their proper nature, but keepe their former substances, forme and figure. Now how can any man deuise to speake the truth in more playne wordes than these be? For they say the very same wordes that I say. And yet bicause the truth is not liked, here must be deuised a crafty Lawyers glose, of them that neuer sought other, but to calumniate the truth, and must be sayd (agaynst all learning, reason and speach) that substance is taken for the visible and palpable qualities or accidents: well yet then you confesse that those olde auncient Authors agree with me in wordes, and say as I do, that the bread and wine be not transubstantiated, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in their former substance: And then the issue playnly passeth with me by the testimony of these three witnesses, vntill such tyme as you can proue that these authors spake one thing, and ment an other, and that qualities and accidents be substances. And if you vnderstoode whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the argument of Theodoret and Gelasius tendeth, you would not say that they spake agaynst the Eutiches, any more then they do agaynst the Nestorians. For if the bread and wine remayne not (as you say) but be


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7682:178"/>
swallowed vp of the body and bloud of Christ, then likewise in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall mistery, eyther the deity must be swallowed vp of the humanity, or the humanity of the deity. The contrary wherof is not onely agaynst the Eutichians, but also agaynst the Nestorians, Martionistes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that denied any of his two natures to remayne perfectly in Christ.</p>
                  <p>And where as you with all the route of the Papistes, both priuately and openly report me to be vnlearned and ignorant, bycause you would therby impayre my credite in this weighty matter of our fayth, my knowledge is not any whit the lesse, bicause the Papistes say it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor yours any deale the more, bicause the Papistes do say, that you onely be learned, whome for any thing that euer I could perceaue in you, I haue found more full of wordes and talke then of learning. And yet the note of ignorance, I nothing passe of, if therby the truth and Gods glory should not be hindered.</p>
                  <p>Now after the reproofe of your doctrine of Transubstantiation, by all the old writers of Christes church, I write in my booke after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner.</p>
                  <p>Now forasmuch as it is proued sufficiently (as well by the holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Chap. 6. Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation came from Rome.</note> as by naturall operation, by naturall reason, by all our sences, and by the most olde and best learned authors, and holy martirs of Christes church,) that the substance of bread and wine do remayne, and be receaued of faythfull people in the blessed Sacrament, or supper of the Lord: It is a thing worthy to be considered and well wayed, what moued the Schoole authors of late yeares to defend the contrary opinion, not onely so far from all experience of our sences, and so farre from all reason, but also cleane contrary to the olde church of Christ, and to Godes most holy word. Surely nothing moued them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so much, as did the vayne fayth which they had in the church and sea of Rome.</p>
                  <p>For Ioannes Scotus,<note place="margin">Scotus super 4. sen. distinct. 11.</note> otherwise called Duns, (the subtillest of all the schoole authors) intreating of this matter of Transubstantiation, sheweth playnly the cause therof.<q> For (sayth he) <hi>the wordes of the Scripture might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded more easely, and more playnly without Transubstantiation,</hi> but the church did choose this sense, (which is more hard, being moued therto (as it seemeth) chiefly, bicause that of the Sacramentes men ought to hold, as the holy churh of Rome holdeth: But it holdeth, that bread is transubstantiate or turned into the body, and wine into the bloud, as it is shewed <hi>De summa Trinitate &amp; fide Catholicae.

                  </p>
                  <p>And Gabriell also (who of all other wrote most largely vpon the Canon of the Masse) sayth thus.<note place="margin">Gabriel. super Canonè missae lect. 40.</note>
                     <q> It is to be noted, that although it be taught in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the body of Christ is truely conteined and receaued of christen people vnder the kindes of bread &amp; wine, yet how the body of Christ is there, whether by conuersion of any thing into it, or without conuersion the body is there with the bread, both the substance and accidence of bread remayning there still, <hi>it is not found expressed in the Bible. Yet forasmuch as of the sacraments men must hold as the holy church of Rome holdeth,</hi> as it is written <hi>De haereticis, Ad abolendum.</hi> And that church holdeth and hath determined, that the bread is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiated into the body of Christ, and the wine into his bloud, <hi>Therfore is this opinion receaued of all them that be catholike,</hi> that the substance of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth not, but really and truely is tourned, transubstantiated and changed

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note>Thus you haue heard the cause, wherfore this opinion of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this present is holden and defended among christen people, that is to say, bicause the church of Rome hath so determined, although the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by the Papistes owne confession, appeare to be more easy, more true, and more according to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But bicause our english papistes (who speake more grossely herein then the Pope himselfe, affirming that the naturall body of Christ is naturally in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> bread and wine) can not, nor dare not ground their fayth, concerning tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, vpon the church of Rome: which although in name it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led most holy, yet in deede it is the most stinking dongehill of all wickednes that is vnder heauen, and the very sinagoge of the deuill, which whosoeuer followeth, can not but stumble, and fall into a pit ful of erroures.

Lue. 22. The answere.</note>The greatest reason and of most importance, and of such strength (as they thinke) or at the least as they pretend, that all the world can not answere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is this: Our sauiour Christ, taking the bread, brake it, and gaue it to his disciples, saying: <hi>This is my body.</hi> Now (say they) as sone as Christ had spoken these wordes, the bread was straight way altered and changed, and the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> therof was conuerted into the substance of his precious body.</p>
                  <p>But what christen eares canne paciently heare this doctrine, that Christ is euery day made a new, and made of an other substance, than he was made of in his mothers wombe? For where as at his incarnation he was made of the nature and substance of his blessed mother, now (by these papistes opinion) he is made euery day of the nature and substance of bread and wine, which (as they say) be turned into the substance, of his body and bloud. O what a meruaylous Metamorphosis and abhominable heresie is this? to say, that Christ is dayly made a new, and of a new matter? wherof it followeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, that they make vs euery day a new Christ, and not the same that was borne of the virgine Mary, nor that was crucified vpon the crosse, and that it was not the same Christ that was eaten in the supper, which was borne and crucified, as it shall be playnly proued by these arguments folowing.</p>
                  <p>First thus: If Christes body that was crucified was not made of bread, but the body that was eaten in the supper was made of bread, (as the papistes say) than Christes body that was eaten in the supper was not the same that was crucified. For if they were all one body, than it must needes follow, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christes body that was eaten was not made of bread, or els that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that was crucified was made of bread.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner it followeth: If the body of Christ in the Sacrament, be made of the substance of bread and wine, and the same body was conceaued in the Virgines wombe, than the body of Christ in the Virgines wombe was made of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>Or els turne the argument thus: The body of Christ in the Virgines wombe was not made of bread and wine, but this body of Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7682:179"/>
is made of bread and wine, than this body of Christ is not the same that was conceaued in the virgines wombe.</p>
                  <p>An other argument. Christ that was borne in the Virgines wombe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his body, was made of none other substance, but of the substance of his blessed mother, but Christ in the Sacrament is made of an other substance, and so it followeth, that he is an other Christ.</p>
                  <p>And so the Antichrist of Rome, the chiefe author of all idolatrie, would bring faythfull christen people from the true worshipping of Christ that was made and borne of the blessed virgine Mary, through the operation of the holy ghost, and suffered for vs vpon the crosse, to worship an other Christ made of bread and wine through the consecration of Popish priestes, which make themselues the makers of God. For (say they) the priest by the wordes of consecration maketh that thing which is eaten and dronken in the Lordes supper, and that (say they) is Christ himselfe both God and man, and so they take vpon them to make both God and man.</p>
                  <p>But let all true worshipers worship one God, one Christ, once corporally made, of one onely corporall substance, that is to say, of the blessed virgin Mary, that once dyed, and rose once agayne, once assended into heauen, and there sitteth and shall sit at the right hand of his father euermore, although spiritually he be euery day amongst vs, and who so euer come togither in his name, he is in the middest among them. And he is the spirituall pasture and food of our soules, as meat and drincke is of our bodyes, which he signifieth vnto vs by the institution of his most holy supper in the bread and wine, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that as the bread and wine corporally comfort and feed our bodyes, so doth he with his flesh and bloud spiritually comfort and feed our soules.</p>
                  <p>And now may be easely answered the Papistes argument wherof they do so much boast,<note place="margin">The aunswere more directly.</note> For bragge they neuer so much of their conuersion of bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ, yet that conuersion is spirituall, and putteth not away the corporall presence of the materiall bread and wine. But for as much as the same is a most holy sacrament of our spirituall norish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which we haue by the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ) there must needes remayne the sensible element, that is to say, bread and wine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which there can be no sacrament.</p>
                  <p>As in our spirituall regeneration there can be no sacrament of baptisme, if there be no water. For as baptisme is no perfect sacrament of spirituall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, without there be aswell the element of water, as the holy ghost, spiritually regenerating the person that is baptised (which is signified by the sayd water) euen so the supper of the Lord can be no perfect Sacrament of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food, except there be as well bread and wine, as the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ, spiritually feeding vs, which by the sayd bread and wine is signified.</p>
                  <p>And how so euer the body and bloud of our Sauiour Christ be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, they may as well be present there with the substance of bread and wine, as with the accidents of the same, as the scholeauthors, do confesse them selues, and it shall be well proued if the aduersaries will deny it.

                  <p>WHen I haue proued most euidently, as well by the testimony of the scripture, as by the consent of the olde authors of Christes church both greekes and Latines, from the beginning continually from tyme to tyme, that transubstantiation is agaynst gods most holy word, agaynst the olde church of Christ, agaynst all experience of our sences, agaynst all reason, and agaynst the doctrine of all ages (vntill the Bishops of Rome deuised the contrary) therfore. I conclude that the sayd doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation may iustely be called the Romish or papisticall doctrine. And where I haue shewed further, that the chiefe pillers of the papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrine, as Duns, Gabriell, Durand, with other do acknowledge, that if it had not bene for the determination of the church of Rome, they would haue thought otherwise (which is a most certayne argument, that this doctrine of Transubstantiation came from Rome, and therfore is worthely called a papisticall doctrine) all this must be answered with these wordes (as this author reporteth) and Duns and Gabriell boast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what they could do) wheras neither Duns nor any of the other, eyther bragge or bost, but playnly and franckely declare what they thinke. And if I report then otherwise then they say, reproue me therfore, and tell me wherin. But these be but shiftes to shake of the matter that you cannot answer vnto. Therfore vntill you haue made me a more full and direct answer, I am more confirmed in my assertion, to call transubstantiation a papisticall doctrine, then I was before.</p>
                  <p>But here you put me in remembrance of an ignorant reader, whose scholler I was in Cambridge almost forty yeares passed, who when he came to any hard chapiter, which he well vnderstoode not, he would find some preaty toy to shift it of, and to scip ouer vnto an other chapiter which he could better skill of. The same is a common practise of you through out your whole booke, that when any thing in my booke presseth you so sore that you cannot answere it, then finely with some mery iest, or vnsemely taunt you passe it ouer, and go to some other thing, that you perswade yourselfe, you can better answere, which sleight you vse here in ii. mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters togither, the one is where I proue the doctrine of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come from Rome, the other is, that of your sayd doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7682:180"/>
it followeth, that Christ euery day is made a new and of a new matter. In which ii. matters you craftely slide away from myne arguments, and answere not to one of them. Wherfore I referre to the iudgement of the indifferent reader, whither you ought not to be taken for conuinced in these ii. poyntes, vntill such tyme as you haue made a full answere to my profes and arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For where you say that Christ is not made of the substaunce of bread as of a matter, this is but a slippery euasion. For if Christ be made of bread, eyther he is made of the matter of bread, or of the forme therof. But the fourme say you remayneth, and is not turned into Christes body. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Christ be made of bread you must needes graunt that he is made of the matter of bread. Now for the the answere to the second reason of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes my booke hath thus.</p>
                  <p>An other reason haue they of like strength.<note place="margin">Chap. 9. The second ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</note> If the bread should remayne (say they) than should follow many absurdities, and chiefly, that Christ hath taken the nature of bread, as he tooke the nature of man, and so ioyned it to his substance. And than as we haue God verely incarnate for our redemption, so should we haue him Impanate.</p>
                  <p>Thou maist consider good reader, that the rest of their reasons be very weake and feeble,<note place="margin">The aunswer.</note> when these be the chiefe and strongest. Truth it is in deede, that Christ should haue bene impanate, if he had ioyned the bread vnto his substance in vnity of person, that is to say, if he had ioyned the bread vnto him in such sort, that he had made the bread one person with himselfe. But for as much as he is ioyned to the bread but sacramentally, there followeth no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panation therof, no more than the holy Ghost is Inaquate, that is to say, made water, being sacramentally ioyned to the water in baptisme.<note place="margin">Math. 3. Mark. 1. Luc. 3.</note> Nor he was not made a doue, when he tooke vpon him the forme of a doue, to signifie that he, whome S. Ihon did baptise, was very Christ.</p>
                  <p>But rather of the errour of the Papistes them selues (as one errour draweth an other after it) should follow the great absurdite which they speake vppon, that is to say, that Christ should be Impanate and Inuinate. For if Christ doe vse the bread in such wise, that he doth not adnihilate and make nothing of it (as the Papistes say) but maketh of it his owne body, than is the bread ioyned to his body in a greater vnity, than is his humanity to his Godhead. For his Godhead is adioyned vnto his humanity in vnity of person, and not of nature. But our Sauiour Christ by their saying adioyneth bread vnto his body in vntie both of nature and person. So that the bread and the body of Christ be but one thing, both in nature and person. And so is there a more entier vnion betwene Christ and bread, than betwene his Godhead and manhod, or betwen his soule and his body. And thus these arguments of the Papistes, returne (like riuited nayles) vpon their owne heades.</p>

                  <p>The solution to the second reason is almost as fondly handled, alluding from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panation to Inaquation, although it was neuer sayd in scripture, This water is the holy ghost, but in baptisme to be water and the holy Ghost also. And of the doue is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sayd, This is the holy Ghost, but the holy Ghost descended as in the resemblance of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> done. The substance of bread is not adnihilate, bicause Gods worke is not adnihilation, who geueth all being: and adnihilation is a defection of the creature from God, and yet Christes body is not augmented by the substance of bread, in which body it endeth by


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7682:181"/>
conuersion (as in the better) without adnihilation, which is a changing by miracle. And when this Author knoweth this, or should haue knowen it, or hath forgotten it, he writeth like one that were ignorant, and had read nothing in the matter, as it were to make himselfe popular, to ioyne himselfe in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the rude vnlearned people.</p>

                  <p>AS for my solution to the second reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is able to stand agaynst your confutation therof, and to ouerthrow it quite. For no more is Christ in the bread and wine, in the Lordes supper, then the holy Ghost is in the water of baptisme. And therfore if the holy Ghost be not inaquate, no more is Christ impanate. And when the scripture sayth, Upon whome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> soeuer thou shalt see the Ghost coming downe: And also when S. Iohn sayd,<note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> I saw the holy Ghost come downe like a doue: did he see any thing but the doue? And yet that which he sawe, the scripture there, as well by the voyce of God, as by the wordes of S. Ihon, calleth the holy Ghost. Wherfore the scripture calleth the doue the holy Ghost. For the speach was as much to say, as this which I see come downe, is the holy Ghost. and yet was that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doue, which he saw. And that the doue which he saw was the holy ghost, was as true a speach, as we, looking vpon the bread which we see, do say, This is the body of Christ. And yet as that speach meaneth not that the holy Ghost is made a doue, so this speach meaneth not that the body of Christ is impanate, No more then these wordes of Christ spoken vnto his mother Mary,<note place="margin">Ihon. 19.</note> and to S. Ihon, loe thy sonne. And loe thy mother, meane not that Ihon was made Christ, nor that Mary his mother, was made Ihons naturall mother.</p>
                  <p>But of your saying it followeth, that the bread is humanate or incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For if these wordes of Christ,<note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> This is my body, meane as you say, that bread is made Christes flesh, then as <hi>Verbum caro factum est,</hi> The word was made flesh, concludeth, that Christ was incarnate: So <hi>Panis caro factus est.</hi> The bread is made flesh, concludeth that the bread is incarnate, seing (as you say) it is not adnihilate.</p>
                  <p>But of adnihilation you write so strangely,<note place="margin">Adnihilation.</note> that it seemeth you haue written what you dreamed in your slepe, rather then what you learned of any author catholike or infidele. For who euer heard that adnihilation could be wrought but by the onely power of God? For the gentill philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers write according to the nature, that <hi>Sicut exnihilo nihil sit, Ita nihil in nihilum redigitur.</hi> Asnothing can be made of nought, so nothing can be tourned into nought: So that as it is the worke of God onely, to make of nought, so it can be but onely his worke also, to turne thinges into nought. And what man beeing neuer so rude or popular, hauing any discretion at all, would define adnihilation (as you do) that a defection of a creature from God, should be adnihilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and tourning into nothing? For so should all the angels that fell from God be adnihilate, and so should likewise all apostatase, and all other that by sinne relinquishe the army of God, and follow his aduersary the deuill,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> and all Papistes, that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Christ (as Iudas did) runne to Antechrist, to whome it were better to be adnihilate, or neuer to be borne, then eternally to remayne in gods indignation. Now followeth the last reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note>Yet a third reason they haue, which they gather out of the sixt of Ihon,


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7682:181"/>
where Christ sayth:<note place="margin">The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Iohn. 6.</note>
                     <q>I am liuely bread, which came from heauen: If any man eate of this bread, he shall liue for euer. And the bread which I will geue is my flesh, which I will geue for the life of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then reason they after this fashion. If the bread which Christ gaue, be his flesh, than it can not also be materiall bread, and so it must needes follow, that the materiall bread is gone, and that none other substance remayneth, but the flesh of Christ onely.</p>
                  <p>To this is soone made answer,<note place="margin">The aunswere.</note> that Christ in that place of Ihon, spake not of the materiall and sacramentall bread, nor of the sacramentall eating (for that was spoken two or three yeares before the sacrament was first ordayned) but he spake of spirituall bread
(many times repeating,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> 
                     <q>I am the bread of life, which came from heauen) and of spirituall eating by fayth, after which sorte, he was at the same present tyme eaten of as many as beleued on him, although the sacrament was not at that tyme made and instituted.</q>
And therfore he sayd:
<q>Your fathers did eate Manna in the desert, and dyed, but he that eateth this bread shall liue for euer.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> Therfore this place of S. Ihon can in no wise be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande of the sacramentall bread, which neither came from heauen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giueth life to all that eate.</q>
Nor of such bread Christ could haue then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sayd, This is my flesh, except they will say, that Christ did than conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate so many yeares before the institution of his holy Supper.</p>

                  <p>And as for Cirill is clearly agaynst you,<note place="margin">Cyrill.

For if Christ had geuen to vs life in his supper, what should he haue needed after to dye for the same purpose?
The wordes of Cirill be these vpon the wordes of Christ<q> 
                        <hi>Panis quem ego dabo, caro mea est quam ego dabo pro mundi vita.

that when he sayd: I will geue, he did not fulfill that promise in his spuper, but in the crosse, giuing vs life by his death not by eating and drinking of him in his supper, as you most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

There be chiefely three places, which at the first shew, seeme much to make for their intent, but when they shallbe throughly wayed, they make nothing for them at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cyprianns de coena nomini.</note>The first is a place of Ciprian, in his sermon of the Lords supper, where he sayth, as is alledged in the Detection of the deuils Sophistry.</p>
                  <p>This bread which our Lord gaue to his disciples, changed in Nature but not in outward forme, is by the omnipotency of gods word, made flesh.</p>
                  <p>Here the Papists sticke tooth and nayle to these wordes, <hi>Changed in nature,</hi> Ergo say they,<note place="margin">The aunswerr .</note> the nature of the bread is changed. Here is one chiefe poynt of the diuels sophistry vsed, who in the allegation of Scripture vseth euer eyther to adde therto, or to take away from it, or to alter the sence therof. And so haue they in this author left out those wordes, which would open playnly all the whole matter.
For next the wordes, which be here before of them reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do follow these wordes.<q> As in the person of Christ the humanity was seene, and the diuinity was hid, euen so did the diuinity ineffably put it selfe into the visible sacrament.</q>
Which wordes of Ciprian do manifestly shew, that the sacrament doth still remayne with the diuinity: and that sacramentally the diuinity is poured into the bread and wine, the same bread &amp; wine still remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: like as the same diuinity by vnity of person was in the humanity of Christ, the same humanity still remayning with the diuinite.</p>
                  <p>And yet the bread is changed, not in shape nor substance, but in nature, (as Ciprian truly sayth) not meaning that the naturall substance of bread is cleane gone, but that by Gods word, there is added therto an other higher propertie, nature and condition, farre passing the nature and condition of common bread, that is to say, that the bread doth shew vnto vs, (as the same Ciprian sayth) that we be partaker of the spirite of God, and most purely ioyned vnto Christ, and spiritually fead with his flesh and bloud, so that now the sayde misticall bread is both a corporall food for the body, and a spirituall foode for the soule.</p>
                  <p>And likewise is the nature of the water changed in baptisme, for as much as beside his common nature (which is to wash and make cleane the body) it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth vnto vs that our soules be also washed and made cleane by the holy ghost: And thus is answered the chiefe authoritie of the doctours, which the Papists take for the principall defence of their errour.

changed in nature, but not in outward forme, is by the omnipotencye of gods word made flesh. These be Ciprians wordes, and then follow these, As in the persone of Christ the humanity was seene and the diuinity hidden, euen so the diuinite ineffably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> infused it selfe into the visible Sacrament, Thus sayth Ciprian as I can English him to expresse the word <hi>(Infudit)</hi> by (Latin English) not liking the English word shed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in our English tongue it resembleth spilling &amp; euacuation of the whole, and much lesse I can agree to vse the word powring, although <hi>(Iufundo)</hi> in Latine, may in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vse of earthly thinges signifie so, bicause powring noteth a successiue working, wheras gods worke is in an instant and for that respect neuer shedding, But this author had a fansie to vse the sound of the word powring, to serue in freede of an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to improue Transubstantiation, meaning the hearer or reader in the conceauing of the sence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Ciprian thus termed, should fansye the bread in the visible Sacrament, to be like a soppe wherupon liquor were powred, which is a kind of deprauation, as thou reader by consideration of Ciprians wordes and meaning mayst perceaue, which Ciprian, hauing shewed how the bread is made flesh by the omnipotency of gods word, and made by change: Then bicause this mistery of the Sacrament, in consideration of the two natures, celestiall and earthly, resembleth the principall mistery of Christes person S. Ciprian sayth in sence, that as in the person of Christ the humanity was seene, and the diuinity hidden, so likewise in this Sacrament visible is also the diuine nature hidden. This is the sence where for declaration of the worke of God presenting his diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is vsed the verbe <hi>(Infundit)</hi> in Latine, by which word the motion of the diuine nature is spoken of in scriptures, not bicause it is a liquidde substance to bee poured, as the author of this booke englisheth it signifying a successiue operation; but rather as a word if we should scan it as this author would, signifying the continuance of the terme from whence, to the terme wherunto, without leauing the one, by moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the other: for there is in the godly nature no locall motion, and therfore we say, Christ not leauing his father, descended from heauen, and being in earth was also in heauen, which infution in some parte resembleth, but mans wordes can not expresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Gods diuine operations. To the purpose, the first wordes of Ciprian shew the maner of the constitution of this Sacrament to be by mutation of the earthly creatures into the body and bloud of Christ. And than by the wordes following sheweth the truth of the substance of the Sacrament, to the intent we might vse our repayre to it, and frame our deuotion according to the dignitie of it, esteeming as S. Paule sayth, our Lordes body. For the more euident declaration wherof S. Ciprian by example of the mistery in Christes person, sheweth Christes humanity and diuinity present in the visible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, of which diuinity there is speciall mention agaynst such, which fansied the flesh of Christ to be geuen, to be eaten: as diuided from the diuine nature, which was the heresy of the Nestorians, and such other, denying therby the persite vnity of the two natures in Christ, which the holy Sinode of Ephesus did specially condemne, as other fathers in their writings old specially preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with distinct writing agaynst that errour. And therfore S. Ciprian not content to shew the presence of Christes flesh by mutation of the bread, doth after make speciall mention of Christes diuinity, not concerning that he had sayd before, but further opening it. And so vtterly condemneth the teaching of the author of this booke, touching the presence of Christ to be onely figuratiuely. Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sayth, that in the Sacrament is the truth and then there is present the true flesh of Christ, and the Godhead truely, which deuotion should knowledge. And as for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation according to the first wordes of S. Ciprian, the bread is changed not in forme, but in nature, which is not in the properties of nature, nor in the operation of nature, neither in quantity or quality of nature, and therfore in the inward nature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> which is properly substance. This is the playne direct vnderstanding, not by way of addition, as this author of his imagination deuiseth, who vseth the word Spirituall, as a stop and opposition to the catholique teaching, which is not so, and clearly without learning compareth with this Sacrament the water of Baptisme, of which we reade not written that it is changed, as we reade of the bread, and therfore the resemblance of water in Baptisme, is vsed onely to blynde the rude reader, and serueth for a shift

                  <p>WHere in my former booke I found a fault in the allegation of Ciprian it was in deede no little fault, to alleadge those wordes that speake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the change of bread, and to leaue out the example most necessary to be rehersed, which should declare how it was changed, which change is not by Transubstantiation (as the example sheweth) but as it is in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, whose humanity was not transubstantiate, although it was inseparabely annexed vnto the deity.</p>
                  <p>And the wordes following do not once touch the reall and corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christes flesh in the bread, so farre it is from the ouerthrowing of the true catholike fayth by me taught. But Ciprian in that place quite and cleane ouerthroweth, as well your reall presence, as your imagined tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, as hereafter by Gods grace shall be declared. But first it semeth to me a strange thing, that such a learned man as you take your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> selfe to be in the tongues, can not English this verbe <hi>Infundo,</hi> where as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Gramarian can tell the signification of <hi>Fundo, Effundo,</hi> and <hi>Infundo.</hi> But it semeth you haue so deinty a stomacke,that you can brooke no meat, but of your owne dressing, though it be neuer so well dressed of other, yea you had rather eate it rawe, then to take it of an other mans dressing. And so much misliketh you all thinges that other men doe, that you be ready to vomite at it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Infudir.</hi> Smyth vseth the word powring.</note>No English can please you to this word <hi>(Infundo)</hi> but Latine English (as you call it) and that is such English as no English man can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, nor Latine man neither, but onely in that sense that I haue engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it. And I pray thee gentill reader, consider the great weighty cause, why no English can please in this place, and thou shalt finde it nothing els but ignorance,<note place="margin">Pouring.</note> eyther of the speach or of God. Powring (sayth he) maketh a successiue working, So doth infusion say I, and therfore in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that respect as vnfitte a terme as Powring. But Gods worke (sayth he) is in an instant. So is his powring (say I) and all that he doth, euen as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as his infusion. All mans workes be done in succession of tyme (for a carpenter can not build a house in a day) but God in one moment could make both heauen and earth. So that God worketh without delay of tyme such thinges as in vs require leasure and tyme. And yet God hath tempered his speach so to vs in holy scripture, that he speaketh of himselfe in such wordes, as be vsuall to vs, or els could we speake here and learne nothing of God. And therfore whether we say infusion or pouring, all is one thing, and one reason. For in vs they be done by little and little, but God worketh the same sodenly in one moment.</p>
                  <p>And yet if you had well considered the matter, you should not haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> found the sacraments of God likesoppes, wherin licour is poured, but you should haue found (pouring) an apt word to expresse the abundance of gods working by his grace in the ministration of his holy sacraments. For when there cometh a small rayne then we say, it droppeth, or there is a few droppes: but when there cometh a great multitude of rayne togither


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7682:183"/>
for the great abundance of it, we vse in common speach to say, it poureth downe, So that this word (pouring) is a very apt word to expresse the multitude of Gods mercies and the plentifulnes of his grace poured into them, whome he loued, declared and exhibited by his wordes and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And howsoeuer you be disposed by iesting and scoffing to mocke out all thinges (as your disposition hath bene euer giuen to reprehend thinges that were well) yet the indifferent reader may iudge by this one place, among many other, that you seeke rather an occasion to brable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, and with idle wordes to draw your booke out at length, then to seeke or teach any truth.</p>
                  <p>And if I should play and scoffe in such a matter (as you doe) I might dally with the word of Infusion,<note place="margin">Infusion.</note> as you do with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word powring. For as you reiect my word of powring, bicause some fond reader might fantasy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bread in the sacrament to be like a soppe, wherin licour were powred, by like reason may I reiect your English Latin of (infuding) bicause such a reader might fantasy therby, the bread to be like water, wherin the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is stieped or infuded. As infused rubarbe is called, when it is stieped certayne houres in stilled water or wine without seething, and so be roses and violets likewise infused, when they be stieped in warme water to make inlep therof. But as poticaries, phisitions, surgions and Alcumists vse wordes of Greeke, Arabike and other strange langwages, purposely therby to hide their sciences from the knowledge of others (so farre as they can) so do you in many partes of your booke deuise many strange termes, and strange phrases of speach, to obscure and darken therby the matter of the sacrament, and to make the same meete for the capacities of very few, which Christ ordayned to be vnderstanded and exercised of all men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> At the last (as you say) you come to your purpose, not to open the truth, but to hide it as much as you may, and to gather of Ciprians wordes your owne faining and not his meaning, who ment nothing lesse then eyther of any Transubstantiation, or of the corporall presence of Christ in the bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>And to set out Ciprians mynde in few wordes,<note place="margin">Ciprians meaning.</note> he speaketh of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and not of the keeping of the bread, which when it is vsed in the Lordes holy supper, it is not onely a corporall meate to norish the body, but an heauenly meate to nourish the soules of the worthy receauors, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maiesty inuisibly being present, and by a spirituall transition and change, vniting vs vnto Christ, feeding vs spiritually with his flesh and bloud vnto eternall life, as the bread being conuerted into the nature of our bodies fedeth the same in this mortall life.</p>
                  <p>And that this is the mynd of S. Ciprian, is euident aswell by the wordes that go before, as by the wordes following, the sentence by you alleadged.
For a little before Ciprian writeth thus.<q> There is geuen to vs the foode of immortall life differing from common meates, which retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the forme of corporall substance, and yet proueth Gods power to be present by inuisible effect. And agayne after he sayth, This common bread after it is changed into flesh and bloud, procureth life and increase to our bodyes. And therfore the weakenes of our fayth, being holped by the customable effect of thinges is taught by a sensible argument, that in


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7682:184"/>
the invisible sacraments is the effect of euerlasting life, and that we be made one by a Transition or change, not so much corporall as spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. For he is made both bread, flesh and bloud, meate, substance, and life, to his church (which he calleth his body) making it to be partaker of him.</q>
Note well these wordes (good reader) and thou shalt well perceaue, that Ciprian speaketh not of the bread kept and reserued, but as it is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nourishment receaued in the Lordes supper, and as it is frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully broken and eaten in the remembrance of Christes death, and to them that so eate it, Ciprian calleth it the foode of immortall life. And therfore when he sayth that in the inuisible sacrament is the effect of euerlasting life, he vnderstandeth of them that worthely receaue the sacrament: for to the bread and wine pertayneth not eternall life. Neuertheles the visible sacrament teacheth vs, that by a spirituall change we be vnited to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes flesh and bloud, (who is the meate and sustenance of his church) and that we be made partakers of the life euerlasting by the power of God, who by his effectuall working is present with vs, and worketh with his Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>And here is agayn to be noted, that Ciprian in this place speaketh of no reall presence of Christes humanitie, but of an effectuall presence of his diuine maiestie, and yet the breade (sayth he) is a foode and nourishment of the body. And thus Ciprian proueth nothing agaynst my sayinges, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the reall presence of Christes flesh and bloud, nor of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Spirituall.</note>And where you be offended with this word (spirituall) it is not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but vsed of S. Ciprian him selfe, not past .vi. or vii. lines, before the wordes by you cited, where he declareth the spirituall mutation or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in the Sacraments. And of the change in the sacrament of baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as well as in the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, speaketh not onely this author, but also Nazianzen, Emissene, Chrisostome, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, with all the famous auncient ecclesiasticall authors. And this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth well, to delay your hotte wine, wherof you haue drunken so much, out of the cuppe of the great whore of Babilon, that the true wine (representing to vs our whole redemption by the true bloud of Christ) you haue clearly transubstantiate and taken away. Now followeth my answere vnto Chrisostome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 22.</note>An other authority they haue of S. Ihon Chrisostome, which they boast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be inuincible.<note place="margin">Chrisostomus.</note>
                     <q>Chrisostome (say they) writeth thus in a certayne homily <hi>De Eucharistia. Doest thou see bread? Doest thou see wine? Do they auoyde beneth, as other meates do? God forbid, thinke not so.</hi> For as waxe (if it be put into the fire) it is made like the fire no substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce remayneth, nothing is lefte here: so also thinke thou that the misteries be consumed by the substance of the body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At these wordes of Chrisostome the Papists do triumph, as though they had won the field. Loe (say they) doth not Chrisostomus the great clerke say most playnly, that we see neither bread nor wine? but that (as waxe in the fier) they be consumed to nothing,<note place="margin">The answer.</note> so that no substance remayneth? But if they had rehersed no more, but the very next sentence that followeth in Chrisostome (which craftely and maliciously they leaue out) the meaning of S. Ihon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome would easely haue appeared, and yet will make them blush, if they be not vtterly past shame. For after the foresayd wordes of Chrisostome, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7682:184"/>
follow these wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Wherfore (sayth he) when ye come to these misteries, do not thinke, that you receaue by a man, the body of God, but that with tongues, you receaue fier by the angelles Seraphin. And straight after it followeth thus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thinke that the bloud of Saluation floweth out of the pure and godly side of Christ, and so comming to it, receaue it with pure lippes. Wherfore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, I pray you and beseech you, let vs not be from the church, nor let vs not be occupied there with vayne communication, but let vs stand fearefull and trembling, casting downe our eies, lifting vp our mindes, mourning pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily without speach, and reioysing in our hartes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These wordes of Chrisostom do follow immediately, after the other words, which the Papistes before rehersed. Therfore if the Papistes will gather of the wordes by them recited, that there is neither bread nor wine in the sacrament, I may aswell gather of the wordes that follow, that there is neither priest nor Christes body.</p>
                  <p>For as in the former sentence, Chrisostome sayth, that we may not thinke what we see bread wine: so in the second sentence he sayth, that we may not thinke that we receaue the body of Christ of the priestes handes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if vpon the second sentence (as the Papists them selues will say) it cannot be truly gathered, that in the holy communion there is not the body of Christ ministred by the priest: then must they confesse also, that it cannot be well and truely gathered vpon the first sentence, that there is no bread nor wine.</p>
                  <p>But there be all these thinges togither in the holy communion, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe spiritually eaten and drunken, and nourishing the right beleuers: the bread and wine as a sacrament declaring the same: and the priest as a minister therof. Wherfore S. Ihon Chrisostome ment not absolutely, to deny that there is bread and wine or to deny vtterly the priest and the body of Christ to be there, but he vseth a speach which is no pure Negatiue, but a Negatiue by comparison.<note place="margin">Negatiues by comparison.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which fashion of speach is commonly vsed, not onely in the Scripture, and among all good authors, but also in all manner of languages. For when two thinges be compared togither, in the extolling of the more excellent, or abasing of the more vile, is many tymes vsed a Negatiue by comparison, which neuerthelesse is no pure Negatiue, but onely in the respect of the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or the more base.</p>
                  <p>As by example.
When the people reiecting the prophet Samuell,<note place="margin">1. Reg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue a king, almighty God sayd to Samuell:<q> They haue not reiected thee, but me. Not meaning by this negatiue absolutely, that they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected Samuell (in whose place they desired to haue a king) but by that one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue by comparison he vnderstood two affirmatiues, that is to say, that they had reiected Samuell, and not him alone, but also that they had chiefely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when the Prophet Dauid sayd in the persone of Christ: I am a worme and not a man: by this negatiue he denyed not vtterly, that Christ was a man, but the more vehemently to expresse the great humiliation of Christ, he sayd that he was not abased onely to the nature of man, but was brought so low, that he might rather be called a worme, then a man.</p>
                  <p>This maner of speach was familiar and vsuall to S. Paule, as when he sayd: It is not I that do it, but it is the sinne that dwelleth in me.
And in an other

place he sayth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> 
                     <q>Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach the gospell. And agayne he sayth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> My speach and preaching was not in wordes of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, but in manifest declaration of the spirite and power. And he sayth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> Neither he that grafteth, nor he that watereth, is any thing, but God that giueth the increase. And he sayth moreouer: It is not I that liue, but Christ liueth within me.<note place="margin">Gala. 2. Gala. 6.</note> And, God forbid, that I should reioyce in any thing, but in the crosse of our Lord Iesu Christ. And further, We do not wrastle agaynst flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.</note> but agaynst the spirites of darkenes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all these sentences, and many other like, although they be negatiues, neuertheles S. Paule ment not, clearly to deny that he did that euill wherof he spake,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> or vtterly to say, that he was not sent to baptise (who in deede did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise at certayne times, and was sent to do all thinges that pertayned to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or that in his office of setting forth of Gods word he vsed no witty perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (which in deede he vsed most discretely) or that the grafter and waterer be nothing, (which be Gods creatures, made to his similitude, and without whose worke there should be no increase) or to say, that he was not aliue (who both liued,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> and ranne from countrey to countrey, to set forth Gods glory) or clearly to affirme, that he gloried and reioysed in no other thing, than in Christes crosse (who reioyced with all men that were in ioy, and sorowed with all that were in sorrow) or to deny vtterly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> that we wrastle agaynst flesh and bloud: (which cease not dayly to wrastle and warre agaynst our enemies, the world, the flesh, and the diuill.) In all these sentences S. Paule (as I sayd) ment not clearly to deny these thinges, which vndoubtedly were all true, but he ment that in comparison of other greater thinges, these smaller were not much to be esteemed, but that the greater thinges were the chief thinges to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. As that sinne committed by his infirmitie, was rather to be imputed to originall sinne or corruption of nature, which lay lurking within him, than to his owne will and consent. And that although he was sent to bapise yet he was chiefly sent to preach Gods word.</p>
                  <p>And that although he vsed wise and discret perswasions therin, yet the successe therof came principally of the power of God, and of the working of the holy spirite. And that although the grafter and waterer of the gardeyn be some thinges, and do not a little in their offices, yet it is God chiefly that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the increase. And that although he liued in this world, yet his chiefe life, concerning God, was by Christ, whome he had liuing within him. And that although he gloried in many other thinges, ye in his owne infirmities, yet his greatest ioy was in the redemption by the crosse of Christ. And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our spirite dayly fighteth agaynst our flesh, yet our chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall fight is agaynst our ghostly enemies,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. &amp;. 12. Gal. 5.</note> the subtill and puisant wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and diuels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note>The same manner of speach vsed also S. Peter in his first epistle, saying, That the apparaile of women should not be outwardly with brayded here, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of gold, nor in putting on of gorgious apparayle, but that the inward man of the hart should be without corruption.</p>
                  <p>In which manner of speach he intended not vtterly to forbid all broyding of here, all gold and costly apparell to all women, (for euery one must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parayled according to their condition, state and degree) but he ment hereby clerely to condemne all pride and excesse in apparayle, and to moue all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that they should study to decke their soules inwardly with all vertues, and not to be curious, outwardly to decke and adourne their bodyes with sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

apparayle. And our sauiour Christ himselfe was full of such maner of speaches. Gather not vnto you (sayth he) treasure vpon earth,<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> willing therby," rather to set our mindes vppon heauenly treasure, which euer indureth, than vppon earthly treasure, which by many sundry occasions perisheth and is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from vs. And yet worldly treasure must needes be had and possessed of some men, as the person, tyme, and occasion doth serue.</p>
                  <p>Likewise he sayd:
<q>When you be brought before kinges and princes, thinke not what and how you shall answer.<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> Not willing vs by this negatiue, that we should negligently and vnaduisedly answere we care not what, but that we should depend of our heuenly father, trusting that by his holy spirite, he will sufficiently instruct vs of answer, rather then to trust of any answer to be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by our owne witte and study.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the same maner he spake, when he sayd:
<q>It is not you that speake but it is the spirite of God that speaketh within you.<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> For the spirite of God is he that principally putteth godly wordes into our mouthes, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thelesse we do speake according to his mouing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to be short, in all these sentences following,<note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> that is to say:
<q>
                        <note n="a." place="margin">Math. 23.</note> Call no man your father vpon earth: <note n="b." place="margin">Math. 10.</note> Let no man call you lord or master: <note n="c." place="margin">Math. 10.</note> Feare not them that kill the body. <note n="d." place="margin">Math. 10.</note> I came not to send peace vpon earth. <note n="e." place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> It is not in me to set you at my right hand or left hand. <note n="f." place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> You shall not worship the father neyther in this mountnor in Ierusalem. <note n="g." place="margin">Iohn. 7.</note> I take no witnes at no man. <note n="h." place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> My doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine is not mine.

                  </p>
                  <p>In all these negatiues, our sauiour Christ spake not precisely and vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all the foresayd thinges, but in comparison of them to prefer other thinges, as to prefer our father and Lord in heauen, aboue any worldly father, lord or master in earth, and his feare aboue the feare of any creature, and his word and gospell aboue all worldly peace. Also to prefer spirituall and inward hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring of God in pure hart and mynd, aboue locall, corporall and outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that Christ preferred his fathers glory aboue his owne.</p>
                  <p>Now for as much as I haue declared at length, the nature and kind of these negatiue speaches (which be no pure negatiues but by comparison) it is easye hereby to make answer to S. Iohn Chrisostom, who vsed this phrase of speach most of any author. For his meaning in his foresayd Homily, was not that in the celebration of the Lordes supper is neyther bread nor wine, neither priest nor the body of Christ, (which the Papistes themselues must needes confesse) but his intent was to draw our mindes vpward to heauen, that we should not consider so much the bread, wine, and priest, as we should consider his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and holy spirite giuen vnto vs to our eternall saluation.</p>
                  <p>And therfore in the same place he vseth so many tymes these wordes <hi>Thinke and thinke not,</hi> willing vs by these wordes, that we should not fixe our thoughts and myndes vpon the bread, wine, priest, nor Christes body: but to lift vp our hartes higher vnto his spirite and diuinity, without the which his body auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing, as he sayth himselfe:
<q>It is the spirite that giueth life, the flesh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth nothing.<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>

Art not thou ashamed and afrayd being at that same houre found a liar? A wonderfull thing. The table is set forth, furnished with Gods misteries, the Lambe of God is offered for thee, the priest is carefull for thee, spirituall fier cometh out of that heauenly table, the angels Seraphin be there present, couering their faces with vi. winges. All the angelicall power with the priest be meanes aud intercestors for thee, a spirituall fyer cometh downe from heauen, bloud in the cup is druncke out of the most pure side vnto thy purification. And art not thou ashamed, afrayd and abashed, not endeuoring thy selfe to purchase Gods mercy? O man, doth not thyne owne conscience condemne thee?

And thus is answered this place of Chrisostom, which the Papists tooke for an insoluble, and a place that no man was able to answere.

                     <note place="margin">Chrisostomus.</note>Answering to Chrisostome this author complayneth as he did in Ciprian, of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> leauing out of that, which when it is brought in, doth nothing empayre that went before. Chrisostome would we should consider the secret truth of this mistery, where Christ is the inuisible Priest, and ministreth in the visible church by his visible minister the visible priest, wherof Chrisostome would by his wordes put vs in remembrance, not denying therby the visible ministry no more then he doth in his other wordes deny the visible forme of bread, and yet would not that we should looke only vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> but whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fayth directeth vs, that is to say, vpon the very body of Christ there inuisibly present, which fayth knoweth, and knoweth it to be there the very body, and there therfore to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be no bread, which bread this true confession of Christes body present by fayth excludeth. But touching the priest, S. Chrisostomes wordes do by no meane teach vs that there is no visible priest, but to thinke that the body of Christ is deliuered of Christes handes, which excludeth not in like sort the minister visible as fayth doth the substance inuisible of bread in the Sacrament. The one saying in Chrisostome is a godly exhortation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth, the other is a doctrine of fayth in the truth, we be not taught that the priest is Christ, but we be taught that the substance of the bread is made Christes body. And then the question in the wordes of Chrisostome (Seest thou bread) is as much to say, as remembrest the fayth: as being one of the faythfull that know? which terme S. Augustine vsed. And then Chrisostome to confirme our fayth in so high a mistery, declareth how we should thinke Christ to deliuer his body him selfe as a thing farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding mans power to do it. And with other heauenly wordes setteth forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7682:186"/>
of that mistery, which be wordes of godly and good meditation conuenient for so high a matter to adorne it accordingly, which bicause they be holsome, and meete alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, wherwith to draw and lift vp our myndes to celestiall thoughtes, we may not therby esteeme the substance of that mistery to be but in allegory. Here in steed of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the author filleth three whole leaues with profe of that is not necessary, how a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison is not vtterly a deniall, which is in deed true. And as one was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at Cambridge when he pressed the responsall, What say ye to myne argument, which was not in deede of his making. The responsall left his Latin, and told the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent before all his country friendes in playne English: It is a good argument syr (quoth he,) but nothing to the purpose. And so is the intreating of this matter of deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by comparison good, but nothing to the purpose here, and it is an obseruation that requireth good iudgement, or els may therby be induced many absurdities. Chrisostom as I sayd before speaking to the Christen man, seemeth to aske whither he vseth his fayth or no. For if he seeth bread, he seeth not with fayth, which seeth the body of Christ there present, and so no bread. If the christen man thinke of passage through him of the celestiall foode, he hath therin no spirituall thought such as fayth engendreth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sayth Chrisostome (<hi>absit.</hi>) here in these wordes of Chrisostom is no deniall with comparison, and therfore this author myght haue spared his treatise in these thrée leaues. For in those wordes, when Chrisostome sayth, Thinke not thou receauest the body of Christ by a man. There this author neglecteth his owne rule, as in his third booke he maketh a solemne argument that by those S. Chrisostoms wordes we receaue not the body of Christ at all, seing Chrisostome sayth, we may not thinke we receaue it by man. So little substantially is this matter handled, as a man might say here were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accidentall wordes without a substance or miracle, how strange soeuer the same seeme to this author otherwise.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I Complayned not of your crafty handling of Chrisostome without a iust cause, for when you had alleadged the wordes that seemed to make for your purpose, you left out the wordes that make clearly agaynst you, or which wordes at the least would open all the whole matter. And yet the wordes which you leaue out, follow immediately the wordes by you alleadged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where to discusse this whole matter, you say in the beginning, that Chrisostome doth not deny the visible minister, no more then he doth the visible forme of bread, here at the first chop, you vse an other pollicie, not much commendable, altering pretely the wordes of Chrisostom, making of bread the forme of bread. For Chrisostome speaketh of bread and wine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and not of the formes and accidents of them. And if the bread be no more but the visible accidents of bread, then is the minister also no more but the visible accidents of a minister, and so is the priest nothing els, but the puppy of a priest. And then the communicants receaue no bread of the priest, but a puppy of bread of a puppy of a priest. For Chrisostome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in like forme of wordes of the bread, as he doth of the priest, with these wordes (thinke not) Thinke not that thou seest bread, thinke not that thou receauest of a priest. And therfore if this forme of speach exclude the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread, it excludeth likewise the substance of the priest. And if the priest remayne still, not withstanding that speach, then may the bread remayne also with the same speach. And if your argument be good, there is Christes body, ergo there is no bread, then may I conclude in the same forme of reasoning, there is bread, ergo there is not Christes body. And so this author maketh nothing for you, but ouerthroweth your foundation

cleane, both of transubstantiation, and of the reall presence.</p>
                  <p>But to make the mind of Chrysostome somewhat more playne, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them that come to that holy mistery, with what things their minds should be chiefly occupyed, not about earthly and visible thinges but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thinges celestiall and inuisible, and not to consider so much what we see with our eies, as what we beleue in our hartes, not so much what wee receiue bodily, as what we receiue spiritually. And he teacheth not onelye what we should thinke we receiue, but also of whome we should thinke to receiue it, saying, When you come to the misteries, do not thinke that you receiue by a man the body of God, but that you receiue fyre by the Aungell Seraphin. The thing that we receiue (sayth he) is not the body of God, and the person of whome we receiue is not a man, like as before immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately he sayd, that the thing which we see is not bread. Now if it be not bread in deed that is seen, then it is not the body of Christ indeed that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor he is not a priest indeed, of whom we receiue it: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther syde, if it be the very body of Christ that is receiued, and a very man of whom it is receiued, then it is very bread in deed that is seene. And where becommeth then your Transubstantiation?</p>
                  <p>But to declare brieflye and playnelye the very trueth according to the minde of Chrisostome, as we see with our eyes, and eat with our mouthes very bread, and see also and drinke very wine, so we lift vp our hartes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, and with our fayth wee see Christ crucified with our spirituall eyes, and eat his flesh, thrust thorow with a speare, and drinke his bloud springing out of his side with our spirituall mouthes of our fayth. And as Emissene sayd, when we go to the reuerend aultar to feede vpon spirituall meat, with our fayth we looke vpon him that is both God and man, wee honour him, we touch him with our minds, we take him with the hands of our hartes, and drinke him with the draught of our inward man. So that although we see, and eat sensibly very bread and drinke very wine, &amp; spiritually eat and drinke Christes very flesh and bloud, yet may wee not rest there, but lift vp our mindes to his deity, without the which his flesh auaileth nothing, as he sayth himself. Further au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere needeth not to any thing that you haue here spoken.

went away, and the nature of water came agayne. The people of the Hebrues were compassed about,<note place="margin">Exo. 14.</note> on the one syde with the Egyptians, and on the other side with the sea. Moyses lifted vp his rod, the water deuided it selfe, and stood vp like a wall, and betwene the waters was left a way for them to passe on foot. And Iordan agaynst nature turned backe to the head of his spring. Doth it not appeare now, that the nature of the Sea flouds, or of the course of fresh water was chaunged? The people was dry, Moyses touched a stone, and water came out of the stone. Did not grace her worke aboue nature, to make the stone to bring forth the water,<note place="margin">Exo. 17.</note> which it had not of nature? Marath was a most bitter floud, so that the people being dry, could not drinke thereof. Moyses put wood into the water,<note place="margin">Exo. 15.</note> and the nature of the water lost his bitternes, which grace infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, did sodenly moderate.

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es of S. Ambrose, if the sayd book be his (which they that be of greatest learning and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do not thinke) by which wordes the Papists would proue, that in the supper of the Lord after the words of Consecration (as they be commonly called) there remayneth neither bread nor wine, because that S. Ambrose sayth in this place, that the nature of the bread and wine is chaunged.</p>
                  <p>But to satisfy their mindes, let vs graunt for their pleasure,<note place="margin">The aunswere.</note> that the foresayd booke was S. Ambrose owne worke, yet the same booke maketh nothing for their purpose, but quite agaynst them. For he sayth not, that the substaunce of bread and wine is gone, but he sayth, that their nature is chaunged, that is to say, that in the holy communion we ought not to receiue the bread and wine, as other common meates and drinkes, but as thinges cleane chaunged into a higher estate, nature and condition, to be taken as holy meates and drinkes, whereby we receiue spirituall feeding, and supernaturall nourishment from heauen, of the very true body and bloud of our sauior Christ, through the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power of God, and the wonderful working of the holy ghost. Which so well agreeth with the substaunce of bread and wine still remayning, that if they were gone away, and not there, this our spiritual feeding could be taught vnto vs by them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the most part of the examples, which S. Ambrose allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for the wonderfull alteration of natures, the substances did still remayne, after the nature and properties were chaunged. As when the water of Iordane


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7682:188"/>
(contrary to his nature) stood still like a wale, or flowed agaynst the streame to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the head and spring, yet the substaunce of the water remained the same that it was before. Likewise the stone, that aboue his nature and kinde flowed water, was the self same stone that it was before. And the floud of Marath, that chaunged his nature of bitternesse, chaunged for all that no part of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce. No more did that yron, which contrary to his nature, swam vpon the water, lose thereby any part of the substaunce thereof. Therefore as in these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of natures, the substances neuertheles remayned the same, that they were before the alterations, euen so dooth the substaunce of bread and wyne remayne in the Lords supper, and be naturally receiued and disgested into the body, notwithstanding the sacramentall mutation of the same, into the bodye and bloud of Christ. Which sacramentall mutation declareth the supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, spirituall and explicable eating and drinking, feeding and disgesting of the body and bloud of Christ, in all them, that godly and according to their duety do receiue the sacramentall bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>And that S. Ambrose thus ment, that the substaunce of bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne still after the consecration, it is most clere by three other examples of the same matter, following in the same chapter. One is of them that be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, in whom after their regeneration doth still remayn theyr former naturall substaunce. An other is of the incarnation of our sauiour Christ, in the which perished no substaunce, but remayned aswell the substaunce of his godhead, as the substaunce which he tooke of the blessed virgine Mary. The third example is of the water in baptisme, where the water still remaineth water, although the holy ghost come vpon the water, or rather vpon him that is baptised therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 4. de sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis. cap. 4.</note>And although the same S. Ambrose in an other booke entituled <hi>de sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> doth say, that the bread is bread before the wordes of consecration, but <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the consecration is done, of bread is made the body of Christ:</hi> Yet in the same booke, &amp; in the same chapter, he telleth in what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ner and forme the same is done by the wordes of Christ, not by taking away the substaunce of the bread, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bread the grace of Christes body, and so calling it the bodye of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And hereof he bringeth foure examples. The first of the regeneration of a man: the second is of the standing of the water of the red sea: the third is of the bitter water of Marath: and the fourth is of the yron that swam aboue the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In euery of the which examples, the former substaunce remayned still, not withstanding alteration of the natures. And he concludeth the whole matter in these few wordes.</p>
                  <p>If there be so much strength in the wordes of the Lord Iesu, that things had their beginning, which neuer were before, how much more be they able to worke, that those thinges that were before, should remayne, and also be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into other thinges? Which wordes do shew manifestly, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this wonderfull sacramentall and spirituall chaunging of the bread into the body of Christ, yet the substaunce of the bread remayneth the same that it was before.</p>

As among other, in one place where S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ambrose sayth. This Sacrament which thou receiuest, is made by the word of Chryst. This author translateth, Is done by the word of Christ, because making must be vnderstanded in the substaunce of the Sacrament chiefly before it is receiued, and doing may be referred to the effect chiefly, for which purpose it should seeme the author of this book ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not away with the word made, whereat it pleaseth him in an other place of this book to be mery, as at an absurdity in the Papistes, when in deed both S. Ambrose here, S. Cyprian, and S. Hierome also in their places vse the same word speaking of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the wonderfull worke of God in ordayning the substaunce of it, by such a conuersion as bread is made the body of Christ. But as touching the answere of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to S. Ambrose, it is diuers. For first he doth trauerse the authority of the book, which allegation hath bene by other heretofore made, and aunswered vnto in such wise, as the book remayneth S. Ambroses still, and Melancthon sayth it séemeth not to him vnlike his, and therefore alleadgeth this very place out of him agaynst Decolampadius. Thys author will not sticke in that allegation, but for aunswere sayth that S. Ambrose sayth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not that the substaunce of the bread and wine is gone, and that is true, he sayth not so in sillables, but he sayth so in sence, because he speaketh so plainly of a chaunge in the bread into that it was not, whereunto this author for declaration of chaunge, sayth the breade and wine be chaunged into an higher estate, nature and condition, which thrée words of estate, nature and condition, be good wordes to expresse the chaunge of the bread into the body of Christ, which body is of an other nature, an other state and condition, then the substaunce of the bread, without comparison hier.</p>
                  <p>But then this author addeth to be taken as holy meates and drinkes, wherin if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mean to be taken so, but not to be so, as his teaching in other places of this booke is, the bread to be neuer the holier, but to signifie an holy thing: then is the change nothing in deed touching the nature, but onely as a coward may be changed in apparayle to play <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Hercules or Sampsons part in a play, himselfe therby made neuer the hardier man at all, but onely appoynted to signifie an hardy man, of which mans change although his estate and condition might in speach be called changed for the tyme of the play, yet no man would terme it thus to say, his nature were changed, whether he ment by the word nature the substance of the mans nature or property: for in these two poyntes he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wer still the same man in Hercules coate, that he was before the play in his owne: so as if ther be nothing but a figure in the bread, then for so much this authors other teaching in this booke where he sayth, the bread is neuer the holier, is a doctrine better then this, to teach a change of the bread to an higher nature, when it is onely appoynted to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie an holy thing. And therfore this authors answer garnished with these three gay wordes of estate, nature and condition, is deuised but for a shift, such as agreeth not with other places of this booke, not it selfe neyther. And where S. Ambrose meruayleth at gods worke in the substance of the sacrament, this author shifteth that also to the effect in him that receaueth, which is also meruaylous in deede, but the substance of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> sacrament is by S. Ambrose specially meruayled at, how bread is made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, the visible matter outwardly remayning, and onely by an inward change, which is of the inward nature, called properly substance in learning, and a substance in deede, but perceaued onely by vnderstanding, as the substance present of Christes most precious body, is a very substance in deede of the body inuisibly present, but present indeede, and onely vnderstanded by most true and certayne knowledge of fayth. And although this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> author noteth how in the examples of mutation brought in by S. Ambrose, the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neuertheles remayned the same, that skilleth not: for the wonder of those meruayles serue for an induction to releeue the weake fayth of man in this miracle of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7682:189"/>
and to represse the arrogancy of reason, presuming to search such knowledge in Gods secret workes, whereof if there might be a reason geuen, it néeded no fayth. And where there is a like, there is no singularity, as this miracle in the sacrament is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly singuler, and therefore none other found like vnto it. The Sacramentall mutation, which this author newly so termeth, is a mere shift to auoyd among such as be not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the truth of Gods miracle in this chaunge, which is in déed such as S. Ambrose spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, that of bread is made the body of Christ, which S. Ambrose in an other place, termeth it the grace of the body of Christ, and all is one, for it is a great grace, to haue the body of Christ for our food present there. And out of Christes mouth, calling the bodye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> of Christ, is making the body of Christ, which wordes calling, signifying, naming, vsed in S. Ambrose writinges, do not limitte Christes wordes, and restraynt them to an onely calling, an onely signifiyng, or an onely naming, but geue an vnderstanding agréeable to other of S. Ambrose wordes, that shew the bread after consecration to be the body of Christ, the calling to be vnderstanded a real calling of the thing that so is made, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a reall signifying of the thing in déed present, and a reall naming as the thing is in déed. As Christ was named Iesus, because he is the sauiour of his people in déede. And thus perusing this authors answeres, I trust I haue noted to the reader, with how smal substaunce of matter this author impugneth transubstantiation, and how slenderly hée goeth about to aunswere such authors as by their seuerall writinges confyrme the same, besydes the consent of Christendome vniuersally receiuing the same. And how in the meane way, this author hath by his owne handes pulled downe the same vntrue doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the fyguratiue speach, that himselfe so lately hath deuised, or rather because this matter in his booke goeth before, he hath in his second booke marred his frame, or euer be commeth to the third booke to set it vp.</p>

                  <p>OH what a capitall cryme is here committed, that I haue englished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this word <hi>(conficere)</hi> to do, whose proper signification is to accomplish or make an end of a thing, which being once brought to passe, we vse in common spech to say, I haue done: as I haue done my house, I haue done my booke, I haue done my worke, I haue done my dayes iourney, that is to say, I haue perfectly done and finished. And is not this fully as much in spech, as to say, I haue made my dayes iourney, or I haue made my house or my booke? But some fault you must finde, where none is, partly to keep in vse your old custome of calumniatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and partly to satisfy a new toy that you haue in your head, that making is in the substaunce of the sacrament, and doing is in the effect. But whether it be translate, making or dooing, S. Ambrose spake of the wonderfull effectuall working of God in the vse and ministration of the sacramentes, and that as well in baptisme, as in the Lordes supper, and not of his working in the substaunces of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes reserued. As for the authority of the booke, I stand not in it, so that all your wordes therein be more then nedeth, but to length your book, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yet was the book neuer allowed amongst men learned and of iudgement, to be S. Ambroses. And Melancthon whome you alleage for the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of it, geueth it two nips, which you haue left out of purpose, to serue your affection. For he saith not (as you report) that it seemeth not to him vnlike, but that it seemeth not to him farre vnlike, and yet he confesseth that it is confusedly written, which is a slender approbation that it should be S. Ambroses.</p>
                  <p>And where you confesse, that S. Ambrose sayth not in wordes, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> substances of bread and wine be gone, and yet sayth so in effect, because he speaketh of chaunge, either you know that your argument is naught, and


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7682:189"/>
yet bring it in purposely to deceiue some simple reader, or your ignoraunce is more then I would haue thought, that of this word (chaunge) woulde argue chaunge in substaunce, as though there could be no chaunge, but it must be in substaunce. But if you had well considered the examples of S. Ambrose by me alleadged (which he bringeth forth for the proofes and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of the chaunge of bread and wine in the sacrament) you should haue found that in all the sayd examples remayne the substaunces,<note place="margin">Chaunges of things the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the chaunge. As in the water of Iordane staying to runue after the naturall course, in the dry stone that contrary to his nature flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out water, in the bitter water of Marath that was turned into sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the yron that contrary to nature swame aboue the water, in the spirituall generation of man aboue all naturall operation, in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mutation of the water of baptisme, and in the incarnation of our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, which all being brought by S. Ambrose for example of the chaunge in bread and wine, as in them the substaunces remayned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the chaunges, so is it in the bread and wine, whereof other were brought for examples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But in your handling here of S. Ambrose, you seem to be vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, and not to know difference betweene sacramentall signes (in the vse whereof almighty God inwardly worketh) and other vayne signes which be nothing els but outward shewes to the eye. For if you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the matter, would you resemble a knaue playing in a princes coate (in whom nothing is inwardly wrought or altered) vnto a man beyng baptised in water, who hath put vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him outwardly water, but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is aparelled with Christ, and is by the omnipotent working of God spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually regenerated, and chaunged into a new man? Or would you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him that banketeth at a feast to represent an anniuersary, or try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, vnto that man that in remembraunce of Christes death eateth and drinketh at his holy supper, geuing thankes for his redemption, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting himselfe with the benefyte thereof? If you haue this opinion and veneration of the sacramentes, it is well knowen what spirite you haue, how ignoraunt you be, and what is to be iudged of you. And if you haue no such opinion, becommeth it you then to dally with such profane exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, tending to the profanation of the Sacraments, and deceiuing of the readers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And as for the holines of bread, I say now as I said before,<note place="margin">Holy bread.</note> that neither bread, wine nor water, haue any capacity of holinesse, but holines is onely in the receauers, and by the bread, water and wine is sacramentally sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. And therefore the marueilous alteration to an hyer estate, nature and condition, is chiefly and principally in the persons, and in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall signes it is none otherwise but sacramentally and in significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whether this be matter of trueth or a thing deuised onely for a shift, let the reader iudge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And where you say in your further aunswere here to S. Ambrose, that,<note place="margin">Uisible matter Formes.</note> the visible matter of the bread outwardly remayneth, it seemeth you haue not well marked the wordes of S. Ambrose, who sayth that the words of Christ chaungeth <hi>species elementorum.</hi> And then if <hi>species</hi> (as you haue sayd before in many places) signify the visible matter, then the visible matter remayneth not (as you say) but is changed as S. Ambrose sayth. And so


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7682:190"/>
S. Ambrose wordes, that <hi>species elementorum mutantur,</hi> be cleane contrary to your wordes, that the visible matter remayneth. I will passe ouer here how you call accidents of bread the matter of bread, agaynst all order of speach, bicause I haue touched that matter sufficiently before.</p>
                  <p>And yet this is not to be passed ouer, but to be noted by the way, how playnly S. Ambrose speaketh agaynst the Papistes, which say, that the body and bloud of Christ remayne <hi>sub speciebus panis &amp; vini,</hi> vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> formes of bread and wine. And S. Ambrose sayth, that <hi>species elementorum mut an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> the formes of bread and wine be changed.</p>
                  <p>Aud where you say, that in the examples of mutation brought in by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> S. Ambrose, although the substance remayne still the same, yet that skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not: your answer here seemeth very strange, to say that that thing skilleth not, which skilleth all togither, and maketh the whole matter. For if in the examples the substances remayne, notwithstanding the mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the natures by benediction, then do not these examples proue, that the substance of bread and wine remayne not. And if this were singuler from the examples (as you say it is) then were not the other examples of this. For if the substances remayne in them, how can they be brought for examples to proue that the substances of bread and wine remayne not? when they be brought for examples, and thinges that be like, and not that the one should be singular, and vnlike from the other. And where you alleadge this place of S. Ambrose for you, nothing can be spoken more directly agaynst you. For the natures (sayth S. Ambrose) of bread and wine, be changed. And the nature (say you) is the outward visible formes, and that that is changed remayneth not (say you also) and so follo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth then, that the substances of bread and wine remayne, and not the outward visible formes, which is directly agaynst your fayned Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, and agaynst all that you sayd hitherto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that matter.</p>
                  <p>And wher a sacramentall mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to you a new tearme, it declareth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> nothing els but your ignorance in the matter. And although you seeme to be ignorant in other authors, yet if you had expended diligently but one chapter of S. Ambrose, you should haue found three examples of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall mutation, wherin the substances remayne entier and whole: one is in the sacrament of Christes incarnation, an other is in a person that is baptised, and the third in the water of baptisme, which three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples I alleadged in my booke, but you thought it better slightly to passe them ouer, then to trouble your brayne with answering to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Calling. Making.</note>And where you say that calling bread the body of Christ, is making it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> in deed the body of Christ, as Christ was called Iesus, bicause he is the sauiour of all men in deed here it appeareth, that you consider not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a sacrament. For when sacraments be named or called by the names of the thinges which they signifie, yet they be not the same thinges indeed, but be so called (as S. Augustine sayth) bicause they haue some similitude or likenes to the thinges which they be called. But Christ was called Iesus our Sauiour, as the very true Sauiour in deed, not as a sacrament or figure of saluation, as the bread is the sacrament of Christes flesh, and wine the sacrament of his bloud, by which names they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet be not the very thinges in deed. Thus haue I answered to the chiefe authors, which you alleadge for Transubstantiation, making


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7682:190"/>
your owne authors not onely to ouerthrow your building, but to digge vp your foundation cleane from the botome, and nothing is left yon, but arrogancy of mynd, and bosting of words (as men say that you still phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye with your selfe, and bragge that you be bishop of Winchester) euen as a captayne that glorieth in his folly, when he hath lost his castle with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce and all that he had.</p>
                  <p>And at length you be driuen to your church, which you call the consent of christendome vniuersall, when it is no more but the Papisticall church, that defendeth your transubstantiation. Now declareth my booke the absurdities that follow the errour of Transubstantiation.</p>
                  <p>And now I will reherse diuers difficulties, absurdities and inconueniences,<note place="margin">Chap. 14. <hi>Absurdities that follow of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
                     </note> which must needes follow vpon this errour of Transubstantiation, wherof not one doth follow of the true &amp; right fayth, which is according to Gods word.</p>

For (as they say) bread and wine be not the visible elements in this sacrament, but one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly their accidents. And so they be forced to say, that accidentes be broken, eaten, drunken, chawen, and swallowed without any substance at all: which is not onely agaynst all reason, but also agaynst the doctrine of all auncient authors.</p>

                  <p>In the second volume of the 43. leafe, the author goeth about to note 6. absurdities in the doctrine of Transubstantiation, which I entend also to peruse. The first is this.</p>
                  <p>First if the Papistes be demaunded. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is accompted by this author the first absurditie and inconuenience which is by him rhetorically set forth with lippes, and mouth, and chawing, not substanciall termes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the matter, but accidentall. For opening of which matter, I will repeate some part agayne of that I haue written before, when I made the scholler answer the rude man in declaration of substance, which is, that albeit that sensible thing which in speach vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered after the capacity of common vnderstanding is called substance, be comprehended of our sences, yet the inward nature of euery thing which is in learning properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led substance, is not so distinctly knowen of vs, as we be able to shew it to the sences, or by wordes of difference to distinct in diuers kindes of thinges one substance from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Basilius hom. 1. exhameron.</note> And herin (as Basill sayth) if we should goe about by separation of all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to discerne the substance by it selfe alone, we should in the experience fayle of our purpose and ende in nothing indeede. There is a naturall consideration of the abstract <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that can not be practised in experience. And to me if it were asked of commen bread, when we breake it, whether we breake the substance or onely the accidents, First I must learnedly say, If the substance be broken, it is by meane of the accident in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and then if it liked me to take my pleasure without learning in philosophye, as this author doth in diuinity agaynst the catholique fayth, to say in diuision we breake not the substance of bread at all; the heresie in philosophy were not of such absurditye, as this author mayntayneth in diuinity. For I haue some probable matter to say for me, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as he hath none. For my strange answer I would say, that albeit a naturall thing as bread consisting of matter and essenciall forme with quantity, and therby other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents cleauing and annexed may be well sayd to be in the whole broken, as we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it is? Yet speaking of the substance of it alone, if one should aske whether that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be broken, and it should be answered, yea, then should the substance appeare broken and whole all at one tyme, seeing in euery broken peece of bread is a whole substance of bread, and where the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ece of bread broken is so little a crumme, as can no more in deed


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7682:191"/>
be deuided, we say neuertheles the same to be in substance very bread, and for want of conuenient quantity bread indiuisible: and thus I write to shew that such an aunswere to say the accidents be broken, hath no such clere absurdity, as this author would haue it séeme. But leauing of the matter of Philosophy to the scholes. I will graunt that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to be without substaunce is agaynst the common course of naturall thinges, and therefore therein is a speciall miracle of God. But when the accidentes be by miracle without substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as they be in the visible part of the sacrament, then the same accidents to be broken, eaten, and drunken with all additions this author for his pleasure maketh them, is no miracle, or maruaile: and as for absurdity no point at all, for by quantitye which remayneth is all diuision, we ought to confes and good christen men do profes the mistery of the sacrament to be supernaturall, and aboue the order of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a trauaile in vayne to frame the consideration of it to agrée with the termes of philosophy. But where this author sayth that nothing can be aunswered to be broken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> but the accidents: yes verely, for in time of contention, as this is, to him that would aske what is broken, I would in other termes aunswere thus, that thou seest is broken. And then if he would aske further, what that is, I would tell him, the visible matter of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, vnder which is present inuisibly the substaunce of the most precious bodye of Christ. If he will aske yet further, is that body of Christ broken? I wil say, no. For I am learned in fayth, that that glorious body now impassible cannot be deuided, or broken, and therefore it is whole in euery part of that is broken, as the substaunce of bread is in common bread in euery part that is broken.<note place="margin">The booke of Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praier.</note> According whereunto it is in the booke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> common prayer sette forth howe in ech part of that is broken of the consecrate bread, is the whole body of our sauior Christ. If this questioner be further curious and say, Is not that, that is broken, bread? I would aunswere as a beleuing man by fayth, truely no. For in fayth I must call it, because it is truely so, the bodye of Christ inuisibly there, and the breaking to be not in it, but in the visible figure. Yea ye will call it so sayth this questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> but yet it is bread: Nay quod I, my fayth is a most certayne truth, &amp; beleueth things as they verely be, for Christs word is of strength, not onely to shew and declare as other mens wordes do, but therewith effectuall to make it so to be, as it is by him called. And this I write because howsoeuer clarks soberly entreat the matter (such as minde well I meane) to consider accidentes and substance which termes the rude vnderstand not, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> is not necessary therefore in those termes, to make aunswere to such as be contentiously curious, who labour with questions to dissolue the trueth of the mistery, in declaration whereof if we as men stumble and terme it otherwise then we should, that is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience in the mistery, but an imperfection in vs that be not able to expresse it not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such giftes of God as other haue, nor studying to attayne learning as other haue done. And whatsoeuer in scholes with a deuoute minde to aunswere all captious questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> hath for the exercitation of mens sences bene moued soberly and by way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obiected, that is now picked out by this author, and brought to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eares, in which it might sound euill they not being able to make aunswere therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, wereby they might be snarled and intangled with vayne fansies against that trueth, which before without curiosity of questions, they truely and constantly beleued. Finally the doctrine of the sacrament is simple and playne, to haue the visible formes of bread &amp; wine for signification, the thing whereof is the very body and bloud of Christ, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trueth of the whole, it is no absurdity to confes truely the partes as they be, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion require, howsoeuer it soundeth to the Ethnike or carnall mans eares, for whose satisfaction there is no cause why the trueth should be altered into a lye, wherewith to make melody to theyr vnderstandinges. For howsoeuer carnal reason be offended with spirituall truth, it forceth not, but agaynst the whole consent of the auncient doctors, no doctrine can be iustified, with whose testimonye, how the fayth of the church in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament now agréeth, it is manifest, howsoeuer it liketh this author to reporte the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And here you fall into the same folly,<note place="margin">Substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces can not be without accidentes.</note> that Basill speaketh. For if he that goeth about to seperate accidentes from their substaunce, fayle of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, &amp; end in nothing indeed, then you separating the accidentes of bread from their substaunce, and the substaunce of Christes body from the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, by your owne saying alleadged of Basill, you must fayle of your purpose, &amp; in the end bring both the bread and body of Christ to nothing in deed. For the abstraction of accidentes from their proper substaunces and of substances fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their proper accidentes (as you truely say in that poynt) can not be practised in experience, but is a corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or adnihilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And where to excuse this absurdity, that accidentes in the sacramental bread should be broken alone without any substaunce, you bring in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absurdity, that in common bread the substaunce is not broken at all: this is no taking away of the first absurdity, but of one absurdity to make two, as once I knew a man, that when he had made a lye, and perceiued that he was suspected, by and by, he would make two or three much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lyes to excuse the first withall. But if you should say, that we break not the substaunce of bread at all, it were no more vnlearnedly said in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, then it is vntruely sayd in diuinity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And where you say that you haue probable matter for you, and I haue none for me, it is cleane contrary. For you haue vtterly nothing for you but all the whole world agaynst you, if you say that the substaunce of common bread is not broken at all. And I haue for me the very playne wordes of Christ, of the Apostle, &amp; of the Euangelistes.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luke. 22.</note> The bread which wee breake (sayth S.

And if the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of bread might be alone, yet your reason agaynst the breaking of it, is so far from all reason, that it should proue aswell, that the substaunce ioined to the quantity and accidentes cannot be broken, as the substaunce alone. For in euery peece of bread is a whole substaunce, and then by your argument, it cannot be broken.</p>

substaunces, is not onely agaynst the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon course of natural things, but also against the very nature of accidentes (which haue none other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in substaunces as they be defyned, <hi>accidentis esse, estinesse</hi>) and is also against all philosophy, reason and working of god sithens the world bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

It should séeme by this conclusion all altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be in accidents, and the corruption of accidentes to be the generation of new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes, the same <hi>Materia prima,</hi> being as it were <hi>substantia,</hi> that altereth not. And this I write that may be sayd as it were to make a title to this authors certainety, which is


<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7682:194"/>
not so sure as he maketh it. Amonges men haue bene maruailous fansies in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of naturall thinges, and it is to me a very great absurdity of that secret, and therfore to our certaine fayth. But to come nerer to the purpose, it is wrong borne in hand, that we affirme wormes to be engendred of accidentes, but when the wormes be ingendred, we graunt the wormes to be, and will rather say, whereof they be we cannot tell, then to say that substaunce is made of accidents, and that doctrine is not annexed to the faith of transubstantiation, and such as intreat those chaunces and accidentes doe not induce that conclusion, but do reasonably auoyd it. And yet by the way in moulding and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it should me séemeth be properly sayd that the accidentes mould, and the accidents sower, because we call mould bread, bread: sower wine, wine, and in wine as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> made vineger, the former substaunce hath bene in learning accounted in maner to remayne, so as this author ouershooteth himself, when he matcheth generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of worms with moulding and sowring, which differ so farre in the speculation.

                  <p>I know not to what purpose you haue written all this fond matter, except it be, that you would the world should know how ignorant you be in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> philosophy, which haue not learned so much, as to know the diuersity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the vi. kindes of mornings, generation, corruption, augmentation, diminution, alteration, and mouing from place to place. Wherof the iiii. last be from accidents to accidents, and the two first from substance to substance. So that all mutation is not in accidents, and the corruption of accidents to be the generation of new accidents, as you vnlearnedly imagine, both of that, and of <hi>materia prima,</hi> which neuer was no such thing in deede, but by imagination.</p>
                  <p>But bicause you beare me in hand, that I beare the papistes wrong in hand, that they affirme wormes to be ingendred of accidents, I shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> reherse their owne wordes, that the readers may know your ignorance herein, or els how loud a lye you make willingly. <hi>Ex speciebus sacramentali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> (say they) <hi>generantur vermes, siputre fiant.</hi> Of the sacramentall formes, if they be rotten, be gendred wormes. But it is no poynt of true meaning men, now to deny that euer they sayd any such things, as they haue taught in their scholes these foure or fiue hundred yeares, as their owne books do playnly testefy. And be these Papistes to be credited, which haue taught vntruely so many yeares, and now when they be pressed with all, goe cleane from it, and say they neuer sayd so, but he wrong borne in hand.</p>
                  <p>And bicause Smith denieth here the same that you doe, that wormes be ingendred of the accidents in the sacrament, let him helpe you to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere this matter. And for as much as he sayth that when the host reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued beginneth to moule and to putrify,<note place="margin">Smith.</note> and should ingender wormes, then an other substance succeedeth it, of which such thinges are made, let him tell what substaunce that is which succedeth, and whereof that substance is made.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to you agayne, such philosophy as you make here, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I neuer in Aristotle, Plato, nor Pliny, nor I trow none such to bee found in any that euer wrote. But as you delight all in singularity, and haue made strange diuinity, so must you inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as strange philosophy.

                  <p>And it is the simplest reason that euer was made, that the accidentes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> moule and sower, because the substaunce remayneth, so as mouled bread is called bread, and sower wine is called wine. For so is colde water and hoat water both, called water. And yet it is the water that is now hoate now colde, and not the accidentes. For neyther can hote be colde nor colde be hoat, nor heat go into coldnes, nor coldnes into heat, but the subiect that receiueth them, is now hoat, now cold by alteration, as yron that is now colde, is soone made hoat, but coldnes can neuer be hotenes by no arte nor science, forasmuch as they be contrary qualities. And likewise purenes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moul, nor sweetnes cannot be sower, but wine that is sweet may turn into sower wine, &amp; bread that is pure may be chaunged into mouly bread. But the more you striue in the matters of philosophy, the more appeareth your ignoraunce therein, euen as it did before in the matters of our fayth. And who can condemne your doctrine more clearely then your owne <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doth, as you do here alleadge him? that in vineger remayneth in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the same substaunce that was in the wine, wherof it must folow, that when the sacramentall wine is turned into vineger, there must be a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce remaining, which is in manner the same with the substaunce of the vineger. The sixt absurdity.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that substaunce is norished without substance, by accidents onely, if it chaunce any Catte, Mouse, Dogge, or other thing, to eate the Sacramentall bread.</p>
                  <p>These inconueniences and absurdities do follow of the fond papistical tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, with a number of other errours, as euill or worsse then these, whereunto they be neuer able to aunswere, as many of them haue confessed themselues.</p>
                  <p>And it is wonder to see, how in many of the foresayd thinges, they vary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues. Where as the other doctrine of the scripture and of the old catholick church, but not of the lately corrupted Romish church is plaine and easy, as well to be vnderstanded, as to aunswere to all the aforesayd questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any absurdity or inconuenience folowing thereof, so that euerye aunswere shall agree with gods word, with the olde church, and also with all reason and true philosophy.</p>
                  <p>For as touching the first poynt, what is broken, what is eaten, what drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and what chawen in this sacrament, it is easy to aunswere. The bread and wine, as S. Paule sayth: The bread which we breake.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the second and third poyntes, neither is the substaunce of bread and wine without their proper accidents, nor their accidentes hange alone in the ayre without any substance, but according to all learning, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the bread and wine reserue their owne accidents and the accidents do rest in their owne substaunces.</p>
                  <p>And also as concerning the fourth poynt, there is no place left voyd after consecration (as the Papistes dreame) but bread and wine fulfill their place as they did before.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the fift poynt (whereof the wormes or mouling is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and wherof the vineger commeth) the aunswere is easy to make (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7682:195"/>
to all learning and experience) that they come according to the course of nature, of the substance of the bread and wine, to long kept, and not of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes alone, as the Papistes do fondly phantasy.</p>
                  <p>And likewise the substances of bread and wine, do feed and nourish the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them that eat the same, and not onely the accidents.</p>
                  <p>In these answeres is no absurdity nor inconuenience, nothing spoken either contrary to holy scripture, or to naturall reason, Philosophy, or experience, or agaynst any old auncient author, or the primitiue or catholicke church, but onely agaynst the malignant and Papisticall church of Rome. Where as on the other side, that cursed synagog of Antichrist, hath defyned and determined in this matter, many thinges contrary to Christes words, contrary to the old ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick church, and the holy martirs and doctors of the same, and contrary to all naturall reason, learning, and philosophy.</p>
                  <p>And the final end of al this Antichristes doctrine is none other, but by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and craft, to bring christen people from the true honoring of Christ, vnto the greatest idolatry, that euer was in this world deuise: as by Gods grace shal be plainly set forth hereafter.</p>

And in gold and certayne precious stones, that they geue a kinde of nurriture to an other substance, without diminution of their substance, experience hath shewed it so, and therefore the principle or maxime that this author gathereth hath no such absurdity in it, as he noteth, to say that substaunce is nourished without substance. But when vermin by chaunce happen to deuour any host, as I am sure they cannot vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Christes most precious body, so what effect foloweth of the rest, what néedeth it to be discussed? If it nourisheth, then doth that effect remaine, although the substaunce be not there. If euery nurriture must néedes bee of substaunce, then would those that discusse those chances say the substaunce to returne, but hell gates shall not make me speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst my fayth. And if I be asked the question, whether the visible matter of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nourish. I will answere, yea Ergo sayth he, there is substaunce, I deny it.

And if in nature many things be in experience contrary to the generall rules, why may not one singular condition be in this visible matter of the sacrament, that the onely substaunce being chaunged, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes, properties and effectes may remayne? Is it an absurdity for a mayde to haue a child, because it is against the rules of nature? Is it an absurdity the world to be made of nothing, because the philosopher sayth: Of nothing commeth nothing? The principle of nature is that whatsoeuer hath a beginning, hath an end, and yet it is no absurditye to beléeue our soules to haue a beginning without end, and to be immortall.

And now to returne to this author, whiles he seeth a mate in an other mans iye, he feeleth not a beame in his owne. Who recommendeth vnto vs specially Theodoret, whome he calleth an holy Bishop, and with him doth bring forth a pece of an Epistle of S. Chrisostome. The doctrine of which two ioyned with the doctrine of this author, in such sence as this author would haue all vnderstanded to be called catholike, touching the fayth of the sacrament, hath such an absurdity in it, as was neuer hard of in religion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For this author teacheth for his part that the body of Christ is onely really in heauen and not indeed in the sacrament, according wherunto this author teacheth also the bread to be very bread still, which doctrine if it be true as this author will needes haue it, then ioyne vnto it the doctrine of the secret Epistle of Chrisostome and Theodoret,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whose doctrine is that after the consecration, that is consecrate, shalbe called no more bread, but the body of Christ. By these two doctrines ioyned togither it shall apeare that we must call that is consecrate, by a name that we be learned by, this author it is not, and may not by the doctrine of Theodoret call it by the name of the which this author teacheth vs in deede it is. And thus: It is in deede bread quoth this author, but call it not so quoth this Theodoret: It is not in deede the body of Christ quoth this author, but yet in any wise call it so quoth Theodoret. Here is playne simulation and dissimulation

both togither. For by forbidding of the name of bread, according to Theodorets teaching we dissemble and hide that it is by this authors teaching, and by vsing the name of our Lordes body, according to Theodorets teaching, we fayne it to be that it is not by this authors teaching, which sayth, there is onely a figure, and by this meanes in so high a mistery we should vse vntruthes on both sides, in simulation and dissimulation, which is a meruaylous teaching.</p>
                  <p>I deny not but thinges signifying may haue the name of that they signify by a figure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of speach, but we read not in any doctrine giuen that the thing signifying should haue the name by figure, and be deliuered from the name of that it is in deede. And yet this is now the teaching of this author in defence of his new Catholike fayth ioyned with the teaching of Theodoret, and the secret Epistle of S. Chrisostom, as this author would haue them vnderstanded. But those men Theodoret and Chrisostome in the sence they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ment, as I vnderstand them, taught a true doctrine. For they take the name of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ in the sacrament to be a reall naming of the body of Christ there present in deede, and therfore a true perfect name, which as S. Chrisostomes secret Epistle sayth, the thing is worthy to haue declaring, by that worthines the thing named to be there in deed. And likewise I vnderstand the other name of bread worthely done away, bicause the substance wherupon in reason the name was grounded, is changed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true doctrine of Transubstantiation, therfore that name of bread in their doctrine is truely layd away although Theodoret writeth the visible matter of bread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and wine to be seene and felt as they were before, and therfore sayth their substance which there signifieth the outward nature is séene and felt to remayne, which termes with conuenient vnderstanding may thus agrée with the catholicke teaching of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and so in the sacrament on euery part, but in the heauenly and earthlye part to be a full, whole and perfect truth, as the high mystery being the sacrament of our perfect vnity in body and soule with Christ, doth require. Wherby in my iudgement as this author hath agaynst his owne determination in this enterprise vttered that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the truth of the reall presence of Christes most precious bodye in the sacrament, which he doth in speciall entreating the wordes of S Augustine in the xxvii. leafe of hys book besides that in diuers other places he doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like: so bringing vs forth this Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret and his secret epistle of S. Chrisostome, he hath brought forth that may serue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince him in transubstantiation. Howbeit as for transubstantiation Zuinglius taketh it truely for a necessary consequence of the trueth, if there bee in the sacrament the reall presence of Christes body, as there is in déed. For as a carnall man not instruct by fayth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> aswell after consecration as before as he is of the earth, speaketh and calleth it bread and asking him what it is, will neuer aunswere otherwise, and if one asked him whether it were the body of Christ, would thinke the questioner mocked him, so the faythfull spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man answering to that question what it is, would after consecration according to fayth, aunswere the body of Christ, and thinke himself mocked if he were asked is it not bread? vnles he had bene taught Christ to haue sayd it had bene both his body and bread. As for calling it by the name of bread which it was, he would not greatly stick, and one thing may haue many names, but one thing is but one substance, whereby to aunswere to the question what it is, sauing onely in the person of Christ, wherein we know vnited the two substances of god and man. And this matter I repeate and summarily touch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to leaue in the readers brest the principall poynt of our beliefe of this mistery to be of the reall presence, that is to say, vnfayned substantiall presence, and therefore the true presence of Christes most precious body in the Sacrament, which hath bene in al ages taught, and bene as it is the Catholick fayth of Christendome, as appeareth by the testimony of the old authors in all ages.</p>

And yet in the sacramentes is neither simulation nor dissimulation, except you will call all figuratiue speaches, simulation, and say that Christ simuled, when he sayd, he was a vine, a dore, a herdman, the light of the world, and suche like speaches. But it pleaseth you for refreshing of your wit (being now so sore trauailed with impugning of the truth) to deuise a prety mery dialog


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7682:197"/>
of Quoth he and quoth he. And if I were disposed to dally and trifle, I could make a like dialogue of simulation or dissimulation, of quoth he and quoth you, euen betwene you and Christ.</p>
                  <p>But (as I haue declared before,) all thinges which be exalted to an hier dignity, be called by the names of their dignity (So muche the many times their former names be forgotten,) and yet neuertheles they be the same thinges that they were before, although they be not vsually so called, As the surnames of Kinges and Emperours, to how many be they kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen? or how many doe call them thereby? but euery man calleth them by their royall and imperiall dignities. And in like maner is it of fygures and sacramentes, sauing that their exaltation is in a figure, and the dignities royall and imperiall be reall and indeed. And yet he should not offend that should call the princes by their original names, so that he did it not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their estates. And no more should he offend that did call a figure by the name of the thing that it is indeed, so that he did it not in contempt of the thing that is signified. And therefore Theodoret sayth not, that the bread in the sacrament may not be called bread, and that he offendeth that so calleth it, for he calleth it bread himselfe, but with this addition of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, calling it the bread of life, which it signifieth. As the cap of maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not called barely and simply a cap, but with addition of maintenaunce. And in like manner we vse not in common speach to call bread, wine and water in the sacraments, simple and common water, bread and wine: but according to that they represent vnto vs, we call them the water of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, the water of life, sacramentall water, sacramentall and celestiall bread and wine, the bread of lyfe, the drinke that quencheth our thirst for euer. And the cause Theodoret sheweth, why they be so called, that we hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring those names should lift vp our mindes vnto the thinges that they bee called, and comfort our selues therewithall. And yet neither in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, iu the cap of maintenaunce, nor in the imperiall or royall maiesties is any simulation or dissimulation, but all be playn speaches in common v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, which euery man vnderstandeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But there was neuer man that vnderstood any author further from his meaning, then you do Theodoret and Chrysostome in this place. For they ment not of any reall calling, by chaungyng of substances, but of a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall chaunge of the names remaining the substaunces. For Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret sayth in playne wordes, that as Christ called bread his body, so he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his body corne, and called himselfe a vine. Was therefore the substance of his body transubstantiated and turned into corne, or he into a vine? And yet this must needes follow of your saying, if Christes calling were a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of the former substance, according to the doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation. But that Theodoret ment not of any such chaunging of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but of chaunging of names, he declareth so playnely, that no man can doubt of his meaning. These be Theodorets owne wordes.
<q>Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour without doubt chaunged the names and gaue to his body the name of the signe, and to the signe the name of his body, and yet (sayth he) they kept their former substaunce, fashion, and figure.</q>
And the cause wherfore Christ doth vouchsafe to call the sacramental bread by the name of hys bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; to dignify so earthly a thing by so heauenly a name, Theodoret shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be this, that the godly receiuers of the Sacrament, when they heare


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7682:198"/>
the heauenly names, should lift vp their mindes from earth vnto heauen, and not to haue respect vnto the bread outwardly only, but principally to looke vpon Christ, who with his heauenly grace and omnipotent power feedeth them inwardly.</p>
                  <p>But there was neuer such vntrueth vsed, as you vse in this author, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> hide the trueth, and to set forth your vntrueth. For you alter Theodoretes wordes, and yet that suffiseth not, but you geue such new and straunge significations to wordes, as before was neuer inuented. For where The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret sayth, that the sacramentes remayne, you turne that into the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, and then that visible matter (as you take it) must signify acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And where Theodoret sayth in playne termes, that the substaunce remayneth, there must substaunce also by your saying signify accidentes, which you call here outward nature, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to your own doctrine, which haue taught hetherto, that substaunce is an inward nature, inuisible and insensible. And thus your saying here neither agreeth with the trueth nor with your selfe in other places.</p>
                  <p>And all these cantelless and false interpretations, altering of the words, and corrupting of the sence both of all authors and also of scripture, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but shameles shiftes to deceiue simple people, and to draw them from the olde Catholicke fayth of Christes Churche, vnto your newe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish errors, deuised by Antichrist, not aboue foure or fiue hundred yeares passed.</p>
                  <p>And where you say, that in the sacrament, in euery part both in the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> &amp; earthly part, is an whole &amp; perfect truth. Now is perfect truth in the earthly part of the sacrament, if there be no bread there at all, but the color and accidents of bread? For if there be none other truth in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of the sacrament, then is not Christ there at all, but onely his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and accidentes.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning your vniust gathering of mine owne wordes vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> S. Augustine, I haue aunswered thereunto in the same place.</p>
                  <p>And where you haue set out the aunswere of the carnall and spirituall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> man, after your owne imagination, you haue so well deuised the matter, that you haue made ii. extremities without any meane. For the true fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man would answere, not as you haue deuised, but he would say (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old catholick fayth and teaching of the Apostles, Euangelists, Martyrs and confessours of Christes Churche) that in the Sacrament or true ministration thereof be two parts, the earthly and the heauenly. The earthly is the bread and wine, the other is Christ himselfe: The earthly is without vs, the heauenlye is within vs: The earthlye is eaten with our mouthes, and carnally feedeth our bodies, the heauenly is eaten with our inward man, and spiritually feedeth the same: The earthly feedeth vs but for a tyme, the heauenly feedeth vs for euer. Thus would the true faythfull man answere, without leaning vnto any extremity, either to deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread or inclosing Christ really in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of bread, but professing &amp; beleuing Christ really and corporally to be ascended into heauen, and yet spiritually to dwell in his faythfull people, and they in him vnto the worldes ende. This is the true catholicke fayth of Christ, taught from the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and neuer corrupted but by Antichrist and his ministers.</p>

And if you had beene learned in philosophy, you would haue founde your saying false also in euery corporall thing, which consisteth of ij. sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces, of the matter, and of the forme.

So vntrue it is that you moste vainely boast here, that your doctrine hath bene taught in all ages, and bene the catholicke faith, which was neuer the catholique, but onely the Papisticall fayth, as I haue euidentlye proued by holy scripture and the old catholick authors, wherein truely and directly you haue not aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to one.</p>

The first marke is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of arguing vsed by them to the conuiction of heretiques by the truth of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein I note not the particuler sentences, which sometime be daungerous spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but their whole doinges. As Irene who was in the beginning of the church, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth agaynst the Ualentinians that denied the resurrection of our flesh, whome Irene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth by the féeding of our soules and bodies with the diuine glorified fleshe of Christ in the Sacrament, which flesh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t be there but in a figure, then it should haue proued the resurrection of our flesh slenderly as it were but figuratiuely. And if the Catholicke fayth had not bene then certainely taught, and constantly beleued without varience, Christes very flesh to be indeede eaten in that mistery, it would haue beene aunswered of the heretickes, if had bene but a figure, but that appeareth not, and the other appeareth, which is a testimony to the truth of matter indéed.</p>
                  <p>Hylary reasonyng of the naturall coniunction betwene vs and Christ by meane of this Sacrament, expresseth the same to come to passe by the receiuyng truely the very flesh of our Lord in our Lordes meate, and thereupon argueth agaynst the Arrians, which Arrians if it had not bene so really in déede, would haue aunswered, but all was spiritually, so as there was no such naturall and corporall Communion in déede as Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary supposed, but (as this author teacheth) a figure; and it had bene the Catholicke doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: so that argument of Hylary had bene of no force. Saint Chrisostome, Gelasius and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Theodorete argue of the truth of this mystery to conuince the Appolinaristes and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichians, which were none argument if Christes very body were not as really present in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the truth of presence, as the Godhead is in the person of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the effect of the argument this: that as the presence of Christes body in this mistery doth not alter the propertie of the visible natures, no more doth the Godhead in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ extinguish his humanitie, which agaynst those heretickes serued for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to exclude confusion of natures in Christ, and had bene a daungerous arguyng to be embraced of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nestorians, who would hereby haue furthered their heresie, to proue the distinction of natures in Christ without any vnion, for they would haue sayd: As the earthly and heauenly natures be so distinct in the Sacrament, as the one is not spoken of the other: so be the natures of the humanitie and Godhead not vnited in Christ, which is false, and in the comparynges we may not looke that all should aunswere in equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but onely for the point that it is made for, that is, as in the Sacrament the visible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement is not extinguished by the presence of Christes most precious body, no more is Christes humanitie by his Godhead: and yet we may not say, that as in the Sacrament be but onely accidents of the visible earthly matter, that therfore in the person of Christ be onely accidentes of the humanitie. For that mistery requireth the whole truth of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> nature, and therfore Christ tooke vpon him the whole man, body and soule. The myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sacrament requireth the truth of the accidentes onely, beyng the substaunce of


<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7682:199"/>
the visible creatures conuerted into the body and bloud of Christ. And this I write to preuent such cauillations as some would search for. But to returne to our matter, all these argumentes were vayne, if there were not in the Sacrament the true presence of Christes very body, as the celestiall part of the Sacrament, beyng the visible formes therthly thyng. Which earthly thyng remayneth in the former proprietie with the very presence of the celestiall thyng. And this suffiseth concernyng the first marke.</p>

And therfore as that foode is euerlastyng, so it beyng ioyned vnto his eternall deitie, giueth to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies euerlastyng lyfe. And if the beyng of Christes body in any creature should geue the same lyfe, then it might peraduenture be thought of some fooles, that if it were in the bread, it should giue life to the bread. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason, learnyng nor fayth beareth, that Christes body beyng onely in bread, should gyue life vnto a man. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it were an Article of our faith, to beleue that Christ is present in the formes of bread and wine, it were an vnprofitable Article, seyng that his being in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread, should profit no man.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The meaning of Irene and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>Irenee therefore meaneth not of the beyng of Christ in the bread and wyne, but of the eatyng of him. And yet he meaneth not of corporall eating (for so Christ sayth him selfe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> that his flesh auayleth nothing) but spirituall eatyng by fayth. Nor he speaketh not of spirituall eatyng in receauyng of the Sacrament onely, for then our lyfe should not be eternall, nor endure no longer then we be eating of the sacrament: for our spirituall life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our spirituall feedyng.

                  <p>But the true meaning of Irenee, Hilary, Cyprian, Cyrill, and other that treated of this matter was this, that as Christ was truely made man and crucified for vs, and shed his bloud vpon the Crosse for our redemption, &amp; now reigneth for euer in heauen, so as many as haue a true fayth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe in him, chawyng their cuddes, and perfectly remembryng the same death and passion (which is the spirituall eatyng of his flesh and drinkyng of his bloud) they shall reigne in euerlastyng lyfe with him. For they spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and truely by faith eate his flesh and drinke his bloud, whether they were before the institution of the Sacrament or after. And the beyng or not beyng of Christes body and bloud really and corporally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder the formes of bread and wine, neither maketh nor marreth, nor is to no purpose in this matter. But for confirmation of this our fayth in Christes death and passion, &amp; for a perpetuall memory of the same, hath Christ ordeined this holy Sacrament, not to be kept, but to be ministred among vs, to our singular comfort, that as outwardly and corporally we eate the very bread and drinke the very wine, and call them the body and bloud of Christ, so inwardly and spiritually we eate &amp; drinke the very body


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7682:199"/>
and bloud of Christ. And yet carnally and corporally he is in heauen, and shall be vntill the last Iudgement, when he shall come to Iudge both the quicke and the dead. And in the Sacrament, (that is to say, in the due mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacrament) Christ is not onely figuratiuely, but effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vnto euerlastyng lyfe.</p>
                  <p>And this teachyng impugneth the heresies of the Ualentinians, Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and other heretickes, and so doth not your fayned doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, of the reall presence of Christes flesh and bloud in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, vnder the formes of bread and wine: and that vngodly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men eate and drinke the same, which shall be cast away from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe, and perish for euer. And for further aunswere to Hilary, I referre the Reader to myne other aunswere made to him before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And for S. Chrisostome, Gelasius, and Theodorete, if there be no bread and wine in the Sacrament, their Argumentes serue for the heretickes purpose, and cleane directly agaynst them selues. For their entent agaynst the heretickes, is to proue that to the full perfection of Christ is required a perfect soule, and a perfect body, and to be perfect God and perfect man. As to the full perfection of the Sacrament is required pure and perfect bread and wine, and the perfect body and bloud of Christ. So that now turnyng the Argument, if there be no perfect bread and wine (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes falsely surmise) then may the heretickes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude agaynst the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke fayth, and conuince Chrisostome, Gelasius &amp; Theodorete with their own weapon, that is to say, with their own similitude, that as in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lacketh the earthly part, so doth in Christ lacke his humanitie. And as to all our senses seemeth to be bread and wine, and yet is none in deede, so shall they argue by this similitude, that in Christ seemed to all our senses flesh and bloud, and yet was there none in very deede. And thus by your deuilish Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiation of bread and wine, do you tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the body and bloud of Christ, not conuincyng but confirmyng most hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous heresies. And this is the conclusion of your vngodly fayned doctrine of transubstantiation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And where you would gather the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, if Christes flesh and bloud be not really present, it seemeth that you vnderstand not the purpose and intent of these Authors. For they bring not this similitude of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for the reall presence, but for the reall beyng. That as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consisteth in two partes, one earthly &amp; an other heauenly, (the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part beyng the bread and wine, and the heauenly the body and bloud of Christ) and these partes be all truely and really in deede, without colour, or simulation (that is to say very true bread and wine, in deede, the very true body and bloud of Christ in deede:) eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewise in Christ be two natures, his humanitie and earthly substaunce, and his diuinitie and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, and both these be true natures and substaunces, without colour or dissemblyng. And thus is this similitude of the Sacrament brought in, for the truth of the natures, not for the presence of the natures. For Christ was perfect God and perfect man, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his soule went downe to hell, and his body lay in the graue (bycause the body and soule were both still vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto his diuinitie) and yet it was not required that his soule should be present with the body in the sepulture, no more is it now required that his body should be really present in the Sacrament, but as the soule was then


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7682:200"/>
in hell, so is his body now in heauen. And as it is not required, that where so euer Christes diuinitie is, there should be really and corporally his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode: so it is not required, that where the bread and wyne be, there should be corporally his flesh and bloud.</p>
                  <p>But as you frame the Argument agaynst the heretickes, it serueth so litle agaynst them, that they may with the same frame and engine, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole Catholicke Church. For thus you frame the Argument: As the presence of Christes body in this mystery doth not alter the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the visible natures, no more doth the Godhead in the person of Christ extinguish his humanitie. Marke well now good Reader what foloweth hereof. As the presence of Christes body in this mysterie, doth not alter (say you) the proprietie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> visible natures, no more doth the Godhead in the person of Christ extinguish his humanitie. But the presence of Christes body in this mystery doth so alter the visible natures (as the Papistes say) that the substaunces of bread and wyne be extinguished, and there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but of the body of Christ, <hi>Ergo</hi> likewise in the mysterie of Christes incarnation the humanitie is extinguished by the presence of his Godhead, and so there remayneth no more but the substaunce of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as the Eutichians sayd.</p>
                  <p>And thus the similitude of Chrisostome, Gelasius, and Theodorete ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the saying of the Papistes, frameth a good Argument for the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes. But those Authours framed their Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, on this wise: that the bread and wyne be not transubstantiate or extinguished, but continue still in their owne substaunces, figures, fashion, and all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proprieties, and therfore doth the humanitie of Christ likewise endure and remayne in proper substaunce with his naturall proprieties, without extinction or transubstantiation. For those Authours take no bread and wyne for the visible proprieties onely of bread and wyne, but for very true bread and wyne, with all their naturall qualities and conditions.</p>
                  <p>And the heretickes shall soone finde out your cauillation, where (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the matter) you say that the mysterie of the Sacrament requireth not the truth of the substaunce. For why should the Authours bryng them forth, to proue the truth of the substaunce in Christ, if there were no true substaunce in them? Thus all your shiftes and Sophistications be but wynde, or colours cast ouer the truth to bleare mens eyes, which colours rubbed of, the truth appeareth cleare and playne. And your first marke is not clearely put out, but turned to a marke &amp; spectacle for your selfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may clearely see your owne errour, and how foule you haue bene deceaued in this matter, and open your eyes, (if God will geue you grace to put away your inducate hart) to see the cleare truth.</p>

                  <p>An other certaine token is the wondryng and great marueling that the old authors make, how the substaunce of this Sacrament is wrought by Gods omnipotencie. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is marueiled at, for the wonderfull effect that is in man by it, how man is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not how the water, or the holy Ghost is there. But the wonder in this Sacrament is specially directed to the worke of God in the visible creatures, how they be so chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the body &amp; bloud of Christ, which is a worke wrought of God before we receiue the Sacrament. Which worke Cyprian sayth is ineffable, that is to say, not speakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is not so if it be but a figure, for then it may be easely spoken, as this authour


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7682:200"/>
speaketh it with ease (I thinke) he speaketh it so often, of a presence by signification (if it may so be called) euery man may speake and tell how, but of the very presence in déede, and therfore the reall presence of Christes body in the Sacrament, no creature can tell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how it may be, that Christ ascended into heauen with his humaine body, and therewith continually reignyng there, should make present in the Sacrament the same body in déede, which Christ in déede worketh, being neuerthelesse then at the same houre present in heauen, as S. Chrisostome doth with a maruaile say. If the maruaile were onely of Gods worke in man in the effect of the Sacrament, as it is in Baptisme, it were an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, but I sayd before, the wonder is in the worke of God, in the substaunce of the Sacrament, before it be receiued, which declareth the old authours that so wonder to vnderstand the reall presence of Christes very body, and not an onely signification, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which hath no wonder at all. And therfore seyng S. Cyprian wondreth at it, and calleth the worke ineffable, S. Chrisostome wondreth at it, S. Ambrose wondreth at it, Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sene wondreth at it. Cyrill wondreth at it. What should we now doubt whether their sayth were of a signification onely as this authour would haue it, which is no wonder at all, or of the reall presence, which is in déede a wonderfull worke. Wherfore where this manifest token and certaine marke appeareth in the old fathers, there can no constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sillables or wordes disswade, or peruert the truth thus testified.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> AS touchyng this your second marke in the ministration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, aswell of the Lordes holy Supper as of Baptisme, God worketh wonderfully by his omnipotent power in the true receauers, not in the outward visible signes. For it is the person Baptised, that is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, that he is made a new creature, without any reall alteration of the water. And none otherwise it is the Lordes Supper, for the bread &amp; wine remaine in their former substaunce, &amp; neither be fed nor nourished, &amp; yet in the man that worthely receiueth them, is such a wonderfull nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty power of God, that he hath thereby euerlasting life. And this is the ineffable worke of God, wherof Cyprian speaketh.</p>
                  <p>So that aswell in the Lords Supper as in Baptisme, the marueilous workyng of God (passing the comprehension of all mans wit) is in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall receiuers, not in the bread, wine &amp; water, nor in the carnall &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly receauers. For what should it auayle the liuely members of Christ that God worketh in his dead and insensible creatures? But in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he is present, not figuratiuely, but effectually, and effectually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effably worketh in them, nourishyng and feedyng them so wonderfully, that it passeth all wittes and toungues to expresse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And neuerthelesse corporally he is ascended into heauen, and there shall tarry vntill the world shall haue an end. And therfore sayth Chrisostome, that Christ is both gone vp into heauen, and yet is here receaued of vs, but diuersly. For he is gone vp to heauen carnally, &amp; is here receaued of vs spiritually. And this wonder is not in the woorkyng of God in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the Sacrament before it be receaued, (as you fayne it to be) nor in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vnworthely receaue it carnally, but in them that receaue Christ spiritually, beyng nourished by him spiritually as they be spiritually by him regenerated, that they may be fed of the same thyng wherof they be regenerated, and so be throughly <hi>Os ex ossibus eius, &amp; caro ex carne eius:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And consideryng deepely this matter,<note place="margin">The wonder in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> Cyprian wondreth as much at Gods worke in Baptisme, as in the Lordes Supper, Chrisostome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth

as much, Emissene wondreth as much, Cyrill wondreth as much, all Catholicke writers wonder as much, as well how God doth spiritually regenerate vs to a new lyfe, as how he doth spiritually feede and nourish vs to euerlastyng lyfe. And although these thyngs be outwardly signified vnto vs by the Sacramentall bread, wine and water, yet they be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wrought in vs by the omnipotent power of God. Therefore you had neede to seeke out some other marke or token for your purpose, for this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothyng at all.

                  <p>Fourthly an other certaine marke is, where the old authors write of the adoration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of this Sacrament, which can not be but to the thynges godly, really present. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint Augustine writyng in his booke <hi>De Catechisandis rudibus,</hi> how the inuisible thynges be honoured in this Sacrament, meanyng the body and bloud of Christ, and in the 98. Psalme speaketh of adoration. Theodoretus also speakyng specially of adoration of this Sacrament. These authors by this marke that is most certaine, take away all such ambiguitie as men might by suspicious diuination gather sometyme of their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wordes, and declare by this marke of adoration playnly their fayth to haue bene, and also their doctrine vnderstanded as they ment of the reall presence of Christes very body and bloud in the Sacrament, and Christ him selfe God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be there present, to whose diuine nature, and the humanitie vnite thereunto, adoration may onely be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of vs. And so to conclude vp this matter, for as much as one of these foure markes and notes maybe founde testified and apparaunt in the auncient writers, with other wordes and sentences conformable to the same, this should suffice to exclude all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of any by sentences and ambiguous speaches, and to vphold the certaintie of the true Catholicke fayth in déede, which this author by a wrong name of the Catholicke fayth impugneth, to the great slaunder of the truth, and his owne reproch.</p>

And no lesse ought he that is Baptised to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that in Baptisme he doth presently in deede and in truth put Christ vpon him, and apparell him with Christ, then he that receaueth the holy Communion ought to beleue, that he doth presently feede vpon Christ, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng his flesh and drinkyng his bloud: which thyng the Scripture doth


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7682:201"/>
playnly declare, and the old authours in many places do teach. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the forme of Baptisme doth so manifestly declare Christ to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth the Deuill therein to honour him by these wordes: <hi>Da honorem Deo: Da gloriam Iesu Christo.</hi> With many other wordes declaryng Christ to bee honored in Baptisme. And although our Sauiour Christ is specially to be adored and honored, when he by his holy word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes doth assure vs of his present grace &amp; benefites, yet not onely then, but alway in all our actes and deedes, we should lift vp our hartes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ther glorifie Christ with his celestiall father and coeternall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So vntrue it is, that you say, that adoration can not be done to Christ, but if he be really present. The Papistes teach vs to haue in honour and reuerence the formes and accidentes of bread and wyne (if they be vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp) after the body and bloud of Christ be gone away, and say, that they must be had in great reuerence, bicause the body and bloud of Christ had bene there. And not onely the formes of bread and wyne (say they) must be kept with great reuerence, but also the ashes of them (for they commaund them to be burned into ashes) must be kept with like reuerence. And shall you than forbid any man to worshyp Christ him selfe, when he doth spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and effectually eate his very flesh and drinke his very bloud, when you will haue such honour and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce done to the ashes, which come not of the body and bloud of Christ, but onely (as you teach) of the accidents of bread and wyne? Thus haue I confuted your confutation of my second book, concernyng Transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, wherin you be so far from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my booke (as you promised) that you haue done nothyng els but confounded your selfe, studying to seeke out such shiftes and cauillations, as before your tyme were neuer deuised, &amp; yet constrayned to graunt such errours and monstrous speaches as to Christen eares be intollerable.

Wherfore he is able perfectly to saue them that come to God by him, for asmuch as he liueth euer to make intercession for vs. For it was meete for vs to haue such an high priest, that is holy, innocent, with out spot, separated from sinners, and exalted vp aboue heauen: who needeth not dayly to offer vp sacrifice (as Aarons priestes did:) first for his owne sinnes, and then for the people.

He was so perfect a priest, that by one oblation he purged an infinite heape of sinnes, leauing an easy and a ready remedy for all sinners, that his one sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice should suffice for many yeares, vnto all men that would not shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnworthy. And he tooke vnto himselfe, not onely their sinnes that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares before were dead, and put their trust in him, but also the sins of those that vntill his comming agayne, should truely beleue in his gospell. So that now we may looke for none other priest nor sacrifice, to take away our sinnes, but onely him and his sacrifice. And as he dying once, was offered for all, so as

So that now there remaineth no moe sacrifices for sinne, but extreme iudgement at the last day, when he shall appeare to vs agayne; not as a man to be punished agayne, and to be made a sacrifice for our sinnes (as he was before) but he shal come in his glory without sinne,<note place="margin">

                              <p>Thus the scripture teacheth; that if Christ had made any oblation for sinne more then once; he should haue dyed more then once: forasmuch as there is none oblation and sacrifice for sinne, but onely his death.

                              <p>And for this signification they had the name of a sacrifice propitiatory, and were called sacrifices for sinnes, not because they indeed toke away our sinnes, but because they were images, shadowes, and figures, wherby godly men were admonished of the true sacrifice of Christ then to come, whiche should truely abolish sinne and euerlasting death.</p>
                              <p>And that those sacrifices, which were made by the priestes in the olde lawe, could not be able to purchase our pardon; and deserue the remission of our sinnes, S.

Wherefore all godly men, although they did vse those sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ordayned of God, yet they did not take them as thinges of that value and estimation, that thereby they should be able to obtayne remission of their sins before God.</p>
                              <p>But they tooke them partly for figures and tokens ordained of God, by the which he declared, that he would send that seed, which he promised to be the very true sacrifice for sinne, and that he would receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that trusted in that promise, and remit their sinnes for the sacrifice after to come.</p>
                              <p>And partly they vsed them as certayne ceremonies, whereby such persons as had offended agaynst the law of Moyses, and were cast out of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, were receiued agayne among the people, and declared to be absolued.</p>

                              <p>But all such priestes, as pretend to be Christes successours in makyng a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of him, they be his most haynous and horrible aduersaries.

And yet they were not such priestes that by their offerynges and sacrifices they could take away the peoples sinnes, but they were shadowes and figures of Christ our euerlastyng priest, which onely by one oblation of him selfe taketh away the sinnes of the world.

Nor Christ neuer gaue this honour to any creature, that he should make a sacrifice of him, nor did not ordaine the Sacrament of his holy Supper, to the intent that either the priest or the people should sacrifice Christ agayne, or that the priestes should make a sacrifice of him for the people: but his holy Supper was ordeined for this purpose, that euery man, eatyng and drinkyng therof, should remember that Christ dyed for him, and so should exercise his fayth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him selfe by the remembraunce of Christes benefites, and so geue vnto Christ most harty thankes, and geue him selfe also clearely vnto him.</p>

                  <p>FOr aunswere to Nicene councell, it speaketh of a sacrifice of laudes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thankes giuing (which is made by the Priest in the name of the whole church, and is the sacrifice as well of the people as of the priest) this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I say, the counsell of Nice speaketh of, but it speaketh not one word of the sacrifice propitiatory, which neuer none made but onely Christ, nor he neuer made it any more then once, which was by his death, And where so euer Christ shal be herafter in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or in earth, he shal neuer be sacrificed agayne, but the church continually in remembraunce of that sacrifice, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a sacrifice of laud and prayse, geuing euermore thanks vnto him, for that propitiatory sacrifice. And in the third chapter of my booke here reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the difference of these ii. sacrifices is playnely set out.</p>

But here (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your accustomed maner) you alter some wordes of the counsell, and adde also some of your owne, For the councell sayd not that the Lamb of God is sacrificed of the priests, not after the manner of other sacrifices: but that he is sacrificed not after the manner of a sacrifice.<note place="margin">De conse. dist. 2. cap. Semel: &amp; est prosperj.

Christ made the bloudy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which tooke away sinne, the priest with the church make a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration thereof with laudes and thanksgeuing, offering also themselues obedient to God vnto death. And yet this our sacrifice taketh not away our sinnes, nor is not accepted but by his sacrifice. The bleeding of him took away our sinnes, not the eating of him.</p>
                  <p>And although that Counsell say, that Christ is situate in that table, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it sayth not that he is really and corporally in the bread and wine. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that counsell would not haue forbid vs to direct our mindes to the breade and cup, if they had beleued that Christ had bene really there. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the counsell commaundeth, that we shall not direct our mindes downeward to the bread and cup, but lift them vp to Christ by fayth, they geue vs to vnderstand by those wordes, that Christ is really and corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ascended vp into heauen, vnto which place we must lift vp our mindes, and reach him there by our fayth, and not looke downe to find him in the bread. And yet he is in the bread sacramentally, as the same counsel sayth, that the holy ghost is in the water of baptisme. And as Christ is in his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per present to feed vs, so is he in baptisme present to clothe and apparell vs with his owne selfe, as the same counsell declareth, whose words be these:
<q>He that is baptised, goeth downe into the water, being subiect to sinne, and held in the bands of corruption, but he riseth vp free from bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage and sinne, being made by the grace of God his sonne and heir, and coinheritor with Christ, and apparelled with Christ himself as it is written: As many of you as be baptised vnto Christ, you haue put Christ vpon you.</q>
These wordes of the counsell I reherse onely in english,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> because I wil not let nor

                  <p>But to returne to the matter, Christ is present in his holy supper (as that holy Councell sayth) euen as he is present in Baptisme, but not really, carnally, corporally, and naturally, as you without ground imagine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And if he were to present, yet is he not there sacrificed agayne for sinne. For then were his first sacrifice vpon the Crosse in vayne, if it sufficed not therefore.</p>
                  <p>And as for Dionyse, Irenee, Tertullian, with all your other authors, I haue aunswered them in the thirtenth chapiter of this my laste booke.

The English hereof is this. <hi>After this it is asked whether that the Priest doth, may be sayd properly a sacrifice or immolation: and whether Christ be dayly immolate or onely once? Whereunto it may be shortlye aunswered, that which is offered and consecrate of the priest, is called a sacrifice and oblation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a memory and representation of the true sacrifice and holye immolation done in the aultar of the crosse. And Christ was once dead on the crosse, and there was


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7682:209"/>
offered in himselfe, but he is dayly immolate in the sacrament, because in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is made a memory of that is once done. Whereupon S. Augustine. We are assured that christ rising from death dieth not now, &amp;c. Yet least we should forget that is once done, in our memory euery yere is done, videl, as often as the pascha, is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, is Christ as often killed? onely a yerely remembraunce, representeth that was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> once done, and so causeth vs to be moued as though we saw our Lord on the crosse. Also Christ was once offered in himselfe, and is offered dayly in the sacrament, which is thus to be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that in open shewyng of his body and distinction of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he did hang onely once vpon the crosse, offering himselfe to God the father an host of redemption effectuall for them whome he hath predestinate. Also S. Ambrose: In Christ the host was once offred being of power to helth, what do we then? doe we not offer euery day? and if we offer euery day, it is done to the remembraunce of the death of him, and the host is one, not many. How one and not many? because Christ is once offered, this sacrifice is the example of that, the same, and alwayes the same is offered, therfore this is the same sacrifice. Or els it may be sayd, because offering is in many places, there be many Christes, which is not so, but one Christ is ech where, and here ful, and there full, so as that which is offered euery where, is one body, and so also one sacrifice: Christ hath offered the host, we do offer the same also now: But what we do, is a remembraunce of the sacrifice. Nor there is no cause found of the owne inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, because it perfiteth the man, but of vs, because we dayly sinne: Hereof it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that to be a sacrifice and to be so called that is done in the alter, and Christ to be once offered and dayly offered, but otherwise then, and otherwise now, and also it is shewed what is the vertue of this Sacrament, that is to say, remission of veniall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> sinne and perfection of vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus writeth Petrus Lombardus, whose iudgement because this author alloweth, he must graunt that the visible church hath Priestes in ministery, that offer dayly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes most precious body and bloud in mistery, and then must it be graunted, that Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> so offered himselfe in his supper. For otherwise then he did cannot now be done. And by the iudgement of Petrus Lombardus, the same most precious body and bloud is offered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> dayly, that once suffered and was once shed. And also by the same Petrus iudgement, which he confirmeth with the saying of other, this dayly offering by the priest is daylye offered for sin, not for any imperfection in the first offering, but because wee daylye fall. And by Petrus iudgement appeareth also how the priest hath a speciall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this offering, by whose mouth god is prayed vnto (as Hesychius sayth) to make this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which Emissene noteth to be wrought by the great power of the inuisible priest. By Petrus Lombardus also, if his iudgement be true (as it is in deed, and the author co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth it so to be) that is done in the aultar is not onely called a sacrifice, but also is so, &amp; the same that is offered once and dayly to be the same but otherwise then and otherwise now. But to the purpose, if the author will stand to the iudgement of Petrus Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, all his fift booke of this treaty is clerely defaced. And if he will now call backe that agayne, he might more compendeously do the same in the whole treatise, being so far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseene as he is therein.</p>

                  <p>HOw is it possible, to set out more playnely the diuersity of the true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ made vpon the aulter of the crosse (which was the propitiation of sinne) from the sacrifice made in the sacrament, then Lom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bardus hath done in this place? For the one he calleth the true sacrifice,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the other he calleth but a memoriall or representation thereof, likening the sacrifice made in the lordes supper to a yeares mind or anniuersary, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at is made a memoriall of the death of a person, and yet it is not his death indeed. So in the Lords supper according to his commaundement we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his death, preaching and commending the same vntill his return agayne at the last day.</p>

For his sacrifice was the redemption of the world, ours is not so: his was death, ours is but a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce thereof. Hys was the taking away the shines of the world, ours is a praising and thanking for the same, and therefore his was satisfactory, ours is gratulatory. It is but one christ y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was offred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is offred now, yet the offeringes be diuers, his was the thing, and ours is the figure. His was the originall and ours is as it were a patterne. Therefore concludeth Lombardus, that Christ was otherwise offered then and otherwise now. And seing then that the offeringes and sacrifices be diuers, if the first was propitiatory and satisfactory, ours cannot be so, except we shall make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sacrifices propitiatory. And then as S. Paule reasoneth, either the first must be insufficient, or the other in vayne.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.8.</note> And as Christ onely made thys propitiatory sacrifice, so he made but one, and but once. For the making of any other, or of the same agayne, should haue beene (as S. Paule reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) a reprouing of the first, as vnperfect and insufficient.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.8.</note> And therefore at his last supper although Christ made vnto his father sacrifices of lauds and thankesgeuing (as these wordes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> do declare) yet he made there no sacrifice propitiatory, for then either the sacrifice vpon the crosse had bene voyd, or the sacrifice at the supper vnperfect, and vnsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. And although he had at his supper made sacrifices propitiatory, yet the priests do not so, who do not the same that Christ did at his supper. For he ministred not the sacrament in remembrannce of his death (which was not then brought to passe) but he ordained it to be ministred of vs in remembraunce thereof. And therfore our offering after Lombardus iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, is but &amp; remembraunce of that true offering wherein Christ offered himselfe vpon the crosse. And so did Christ institute it to be.</p>
                  <p>And Lombardus sayth not that Christ is dayly offered for proportion of our sinnes,<note place="margin">The sacrifice of the church.</note> but because we dayly sinne, wee dayly bee put in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Christes death, which is the perfect proportion for sinne. And the priest (as Lombardus sayth) maketh a memoriall of that oblation of Christ, and (as Hesechius sayth) he doth in the name of the people, so that the sacrifice is no more the priestes then the peoples. For the priestes speak the wordes, and the people should aunswere (amen) as Iustinus sayth. The priest should declare the death and passion of Christ, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should looke vpon the crosse in the mount of Caluary, &amp; see Christ there hanging, and the bloud flowing out of his side into theyr wounds to heale all their sores, and the priest and people altogether should laud and thanke instantly the Chyrurgion and Phiscycion of their soules. And this is the priestes and peoples sacrifice, not to be propitiators for sinne, (but as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missene sayth) to worship continually in mistery, that was but once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the price of sinne: and this shortly is the mind of Lombardus, that the thing which is done at gods boord is a sacrifice, &amp; so is that also which was made vpon the crosse, but not after one manner of vnderstanding. For this was the thing in deed, and that is the anniuersary or commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the thing.</p>
                  <p>And now haue I made it euident, that Petrus Lombardus defaceth in no poynt my saying of the sacrifice, but confirmeth fully my doctrine, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7682:210"/>

                  <p>TO defend the Papisticall errour, that the dayly offering of the Priest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the Masse is propitiatory, you extend the word Propitiation other wise then the Apostles do, speakyng of that matter. I speake playnly (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to S. Paule and S. Iohn) that onely Christ is the propitiation for our sinnes by his death.<note place="margin">Rome. 3. 1. Iohn. 2.

I call a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice propitiatory (accordyng to the Scripture) such a sacrifice as pacifieth Gods indignation agaynst vs, obteineth mercy and forgiuenes of all our sinnes, and is our raunsome and redemption from euerlastyng damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And on the other side I call a sacrifice gratificatory of the sacrifice of the Church, such a sacrifice as doth not reconcile vs to God, but is made of them that be reconciled to testifie their dueties, and to shewe them selues thankefull vnto him. And these sacrifices in Scripture be not called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, but sacrifices of Iustice, of laude, prayse and thankes geuyng. But you confounde the wordes,<note place="margin">Psal. 49. Heb. 13.</note> and call one by an others name, callyng that propitiatory whiche the Scripture calleth but of Iustice, laude and thankyng. And all is nothyng els but to defend your propitiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Priestes in their Masses, whereby they may remit sinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme soules out of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>And yet all your wyles and shiftes will not serue you, for by extendyng the name of a propitiatory sacrifice vnto so large a signification as you do, you make all maner of Sacrifices propitiatory, leauyng no place for any other sacrifice. For (say you) all good deedes and good thoughtes be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices propitiatorie, and then be the good workes of the lay people Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices propitiatorie, as well as those of the Priest. And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then made you in the begynnyng of this booke a distinction betwene sacrifices propitiatorie and other? Thus for desire you haue to defend the Papisticall errours, you haue not fallen onely into imaginations contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth of Gods word, but also contrary to your selfe.</p>
                  <p>But let passe away these Papisticall inuentions, and let vs humbly professe ourselues with all our Sacrifices, not worthy to approche vnto God, nor to haue any accesse vnto him, but by that onely propitiatorie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which Christ onely made vpon the Crosse. And yet let vs with all deuotion, with whole hart and mynde, and with all obedience to Gods will, come vnto the heauenly Supper of Christ, thankyng him onely for propitiation of our sinnes. In which holy Communion the act of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and other be all of one sort, none propitiatorie, but all of laudes and thankes geuyng. And such sacrifices be pleasaunt and acceptable to God (as S. Paule sayth) done of them that be good,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. &amp;. 5. Actes. 4.</note> but they winne not his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fauour, and put away his indignation from them that be euill.

now you sayd, that the acte of the Priestes must needes bee a Sacrifice propitiatorie, and now to haue an vnderstandyng for the same; you bee driuen to so shamefull a shift, that you say either cleane contrary that it is not the action of the Priest but the presence of Christ, or els that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Priest is none otherwise satisfactorie then all other Christen mens workes be. For otherwise (say you) the dayly Sacrifice in respect of the action of the Priest, can not be called satisfactorie. Wherefore at length, knowledgyng your Popish doctrine to sound euill fauoredly, you confesse agayne the true Catholicke teachyng, that this speach is to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and vsed, that the onely immolation of Christ in him selfe vpon the aultar of the Crosse, is the very satisfactorie Sacrifice for reconciliation of mankynde to the fauour of God.</p>

For by such exposition as you make of the satisfactory singyng of the Priest, in doyng his duetie in that he was required to do, by this exposition he singeth aswell satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in saying of Mattens as in saying of Masse (for in both he doth his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that he required vnto) and so might it be defended that the Player vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Orgaines playeth satisfactory, when he doth his duety, in playing as he is required. And all the singyng men in the Church that haue wages thereto, sing satisfactory aswell as the Priestes, when they sing accordyng to that they be hyered vnto. And then as one singyng man or player on the Orgaines, receauyng a stipende of many men to play or sing at a certaine tyme if he do his duety, satisfieth them all at once, so might a priest sing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory for many persons at one tyme, which the teachers of satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Masses vtterly condemne.

This saying of Chrisostome doth not empayre his former wordes where he sayth, the host is the same offered on the cros and on the aulter, and therefore by him the body of Christ that died but once is dayly present in déed, and (as the councell of Nice sayth) sacrificed not after the manner of other sacrifices and (as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome sayth) offered, but the death of that precious body onely dayly remembred and not agayne iterate.</p>

For the sacrifice made vpon the crosse doth both geue vs life, and also encrease and continue the same, and the priestes oblation doth neither of both. For our redemption and eternall saluation standeth not onely in geuing vs life, but in continuing the same for euer.<note place="margin">Ihon. 10.</note> As Christ sayd that he came not onely to geue vs life, but also to make vs increase and abound therein.

For the effect of his booke is cleane contrary, which he wrote to reproue the propitiatory sacrifice, which the Papistes fayne to be in the Masse. Thus in deede <hi>Hipinus</hi> writeth in one place:

And if the Sacrifice made by the Priest both geue lyfe and encrease lyfe, then is the Priest both the mother and nurse, and Christ hath nothyng to do with vs at all, but as a straunger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And the sacrifice that Malachie speaketh of,<note place="margin">Mala. 1.</note> is the sacrifice laud and thankes, which all deuoute Christian people geue vnto God, whether it be in the Lordes Supper, in their priuate Prayers, or in any worke they do at any tyme or place to the glory of God, all which Sacrifices, not of the Priestes onely, but of all faythfull people, be accepted of God through the sacrifice of Christ, by whose bloud, all their filthy and vnpurenes is cleane sponged away.</p>
                  <p>But in this last booke,<note place="margin">Inconstancy.</note> it seemeth you were so astonied and amased, that you were at your wits end, &amp; wist not where to become. For now the Priest maketh a Sacrifice propitiatory, now he doth not: now he giueth lyfe, now he giueth none: now is Christ the full Sauiour and satisfaction, now the Priest hath halfe part with him: now the Priest doth all. And thus you are so inconstant in your selfe, as one that had bene netteled, and could rest in no place, or rather as one that had receaued such a stroke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, that hee staggered with all, and reeled here and there, and could not tell where to become.</p>
                  <p>And your doctrine hath such ambiguities, such perplexities, such absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and such impieties in it, and is so vncertaine, so vncomfortable, so contrary to Gods word and the old Catholicke Church, so contrary to it selfe, that it declareth from whose spirite it commeth, which can be none other but Antichrist him selfe.</p>
                  <p>Where as on the other side the very true doctrine of Christ and his pure Church from the begynnyng, is playne, certaine, without wrynkels, without any inconuenience or absurditie, so chearefull and comfortable to all Christen people, that it must needes come from the spirite of God, the spirite of truth and all consolation. For what ought to be more certaine and knowen to all Christen people, then that Christ dyed once and but once, for the redemption of the world? And what can be more true, then that his onely death is our lyfe? And what can be more comfortable to a penitent sinner that is sory for his sinne, and returneth to God in his hart and whole mynde, then to know that Christ dischargeth him of the heauy lode of his sinne, and taketh the burden vpon his owne backe? And if we shall ioyne the Priest herein to Christ in any part, and giue a portion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to his sacrifice (as you in your doctrine giue to the priest the one halfe at the least) what a discourage is this to the penitent sinner, that he may not hang wholly vpon Christ? what perplexities and doubtes rise hereof in the sinners conscience? And what an obscuryng and darkenyng is this of the


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7682:214"/>
benefite of Christ? Yea what iniury and contumely is it to him?</p>
                  <p>And furthermore when we heare Christ speake vnto vs with his own mouth, and shew him selfe to be seen with our eyes (in such sorte as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for him of vs in this mortall lyfe to be heard and sene:) what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can we haue more? The Minister of the Churche speaketh vnto vs Gods owne wordes, whiche we must take as spoken from Gods owne mouth, because that from his mouth it came, and his word it is, and not the Ministers. Likewise when he ministreth to our sightes Christes holy Sacramentes, we must thinke Christ crucified and presented before our eyes, because the Sacraments so represent him, and be his Sacraments and not the Priestes. As in Baptisme we must thinke, that as the Priest putteth his hand to the child outwardly, and washeth him with water, so must we thinke that God putteth to his hand inwardly and washeth the infant with his holy spirite, and moreouer that Christ him selfe commeth downe vpon the child, &amp; apparelleth him with his own selfe. And as at the Lordes holy Table the Priest distributeth wine &amp; bread to feede the body, so we must thinke that inwardly by fayth, we see Christ feedyng both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule to eternall lyfe. What comfort can be deuised any more in this world for a Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man? And on the other side, what discomfort is in your papisticall doctrine? what doubtes? what perplexities? what absurdities? what iniquities? what auayleth it vs that there is no bread, nor wyne? or that Christ is really vnder the formes and figures of bread and wyne, and not in vs? or if he be in vs, yet he is but in the lippes or the stomacke, and tarieth not with vs. Or what benefite is it to a wicked man to eate Christ, and to receaue death by him that is lyfe?

            <head>THE Aunswere of Thomas Archebishop of Caunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury &amp;c. agaynst the false calumniations of doctour Richard Smith, who hath taken vpon him to confute the defence of the true &amp; catholik doctrine of the body and bloud of our Sauiour Christ.</head>
            <p>I Haue now obtayned (gentle reader) that thing, which I haue much desired, which was, that if all men would not imbrace the truth lately set forth by me, concerning the Sacrament of the body and bloud of our Sauiour Christ, at the least some man would vouchsafe to take penne in hand, and write against my booke, bicause that therby the truth might both better be serched out and also more certaynly knowen to the world. And herein I hartely thanke the late Bishop of Winchester and doctor Smith, who partely haue satisfied my long desire, sauing that I would haue wished aduersaries more substantially learned in holy scriptures, more exercised in the olde auncient ecclesiasticall authors, and hauing a more godly zeale to the triall out of the truth, than are these two, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crafty sophisters (the one by art, and the other by nature) both also being drowned in the dregges of papistry, brought vp and confirmed in the same, the one by Duns and Dorbell, and such like Sophisters, the other by the Popish Canon law, wherof by his degree taken in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity he is a professor. And as concerning the late bishop of Winchester, I will declare his craftye Sophistications in myne aunswere vnto his booke.</p>
            <p>But doctour Smith (as it appeareth by the title of his preface) hath craftely deuised an easy way to obtayne his purpose, that the people being barred from the serching of the truth, might be stil kept in blindnes and er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour, as wel in this as in al other matters, wherin they haue bene in times past deceaued.</p>
            <p>He seeth full well that the more diligently,<note place="margin">Falshood fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the light, but light desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be tryed.</note> matters be serched out and discussed, the more clearly the craft and falsehode of the subtill Papistes will appeare. And therfore in the preface to the reader, he exhorteth all men to leaue disputing and resoning of the fame by learning, and to giue firme credite vnto the church, as the title of the sayd preface declareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly. As who should say, the truth of any matter that is in question, might be tryed out, without debating and reasoning by the word of God, wherby (as by the true touchstone) all mens doctrines are to be tryed and examined. But the truth is not ashamed to come to the light, and to be tryed to the vttermost. For as pure golde, the more it is tryed, the more pure it apeareth, so is all manner of truth. Where as on the other side all maskers, counterfayters, and false deceiuors abhorre the light, and refuse the triall. If all men without right or reason would geue credite vnto this Papist and his Romish church, agaynst the most certayne word of God and the olde holye and Catholicke Churche of Christ, the matter should be soone at an end, and out of all controuersie. But for as muche as the pure word of God, and the first church of Christ from the beginning,


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7682:215"/>
taught the true catholike fayth, and Smith with his church of Rome do now teach the cleane contrary, the chaffe can not be tryed out from the pure corne (that is to say, the vntruth discerned from the very truth) without threshing, windowing, and fanning, serching, debating and reasoning.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fayth ought to be grounded vp on Gods word, but the Papists ground their faith vpon them selues.</note>As for me I ground my beleefe vpon gods word (wherin can be no errour) hauing also the consent of the primatiue church, requiring no man to beleue me further, then I hane gods word for me. But these Papistes speake at their pleasure what they lift, and would be beleeued without godes word, bicause they beare men in hand, that they be the church. The church of Christ is not founded vpon it selfe, but vppon Christ and his word, but the Papistes build their church vpon them selues, deuising new articles of the fayth from tyme to tyme, without any scripture, and founding the same vpon the Pope and his cleargy, monkes and fryers, and by that meanes they be both the makers and Iudges of their fayth themselues. Wherfore this Papist like a politike man, doth right wisely prouide for himselfe and his church, in the first entry of his booke, that all men should leaue searching for the truth, and sticke hard and fast to the church, meaning himselfe and the church of Rome. For from the true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, the Romish church (which he accomteth catholike) hath varied and dissented many yeares passed, as the blindest that this day do liue, may well see and perceaue, if they will not purposely winke and shut vp their eyes. This I haue written to answere the title of his preface.</p>

And beside that, he doth it so craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to serue his purpose, that he cannot be excused of wilfull deprauation of the wordes, calling celebration an offering, and referring the participle (made) to Christ, which should be referred to the word (partakers) and leauing out those wordes that should declare, that the sayd counsell spake of no propiciatory sacrifice in the Masse, but of a sacrifice of laud and thankes, which christen people geue vnto God at the holy communion, by remembrance of the death resurrection and ascention of his sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Christ, and by confessing and setting forth of the same.</p>
            <p>Heare by the vngodly handeling of this godly councell at his first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it may appeare to euery man, how sincerely this Papist enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to proceede in the rest of this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Smith beleueth the counsell.</note>And with like sinceritie he vntruly belieth the sayd counsell, saying that it doth playnly set forth the holy sacrifice of the Masse, wich doth not so much as once name the Masse, but speaketh of the sacrifice of the church, which the sayd councell declareth to be the profession of christen people in setting forth the benefite of Christ, who onely made the true sacrifice pro, piciatory for remission of sinne. And whosoeuer else taketh vpon him to make any such sacrifice, maketh himselfe Antichrist.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Smith belieth me twise in one place.</note>And than he belyeth me in two thinges, as he vseth commonly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole booke. The one is, that I deny the sacrifice of the Masse,<note place="margin">The first lye.</note> which in my booke haue most playnly set out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of christen people


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7682:215"/>
in the holy communion or masse (if D. Smith will needes so terme it) and yet I haue denyed that it is a sacrifice propitiatory for sinne, or that the priest alone maketh any sacrifice there. For it is the sacrifice of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten people to remember Christes death, to laude and thanke him for it, and to publish it and shew it abroad vnto other, to his honor and glory.</p>
            <p>The controuersy is not, whether in the holy communion be made a sacrifice or not (for herein both D. Smith and I agree with the foresayd councell at Ephesus) but whether it be a propitiatory sacrifice or not, and whether onely the priest make the sayd sacrifice, these be the poyntes wherin we vary. And I say so far as the councell sayth, that there is a sacrifice, but that the same is propitiatory for remission of sinne, or that the priest alone doth offer it, neyther I nor the counsell do so say, but D. Smith hath added that of his owne vayne head.</p>
            <p>The other thing wherin D. Smith belyeth me is this:<note place="margin">The second ly.</note> He sayth that I deny, that we receaue in the sacrament that flesh which is adioyned to Gods owne sonne. I meruaile not a little what eyes Doctor Smith had, when he red ouer my booke. It is like that he hath some priuy spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles within his head, wherwith when soeuer he loketh, he seeth but what he list. For in my booke I haue written in moe then an hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we receaue the selfe same body of Christ that was borne of the virgine Mary, that was crucified and buried, that rose agayne, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen, and sitteth at the right hand of God the father almighty. And the contention is onely in the manner and forme how we receaue it.</p>
            <p>For I say (as all the olde holy Fathers and Martirs vsed to say) that we receaue Christ spiritually by fayth with our myndes, eating his flesh and drincking his bloud: so that we receaue Christes owne very naturall body but not naturally nor corporally. But this lying papist sayth, that we eate his naturall body corporally with our mouthes, which neyther the counsell Ephesine, nor any other auncient councell or doctor euer sayd or thought.</p>
            <p>And the controuersy in the councell Ephesine, was not of the vniting of Christes flesh to the formes of bread and wine in the sacrament, but of the vniting of his flesh to his diuinity at his incarnation in vnity of person. Which thing Nestorius the heretike denyed, confessing that Christ was a godly man as other were, but not that he was very God in nature: which heresy, that holy counsell confuting, affirmeth that the flesh of Christ was so ioyned in person, to the dyuine nature, that it was made the proper flesh of the sonne of God, and flesh that gaue life: but that the sayd flesh was present in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t corporally, and eaten with our mouthes, no mention is made therof in that councell.</p>
            <p>And here I require D. Smith (as proctor for the Papists) eyther to bring forth some auncient councell or doctor, that sayth as he sayth, that Christs own naturall body is eaten corporally with our mouthes (vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the very body in deed, and not the signes of the body as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome doth or els let him confesse that my saying is true, and recant his false doctrine the third tyme, as he hath done twise already.</p>
            <p>THan forth goeth this Papist with his preface, and sayth,<note place="margin">Smith sayth that Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not bread his body.</note> that these wordes (This is my body that shall be giuen to death for you) no man can truely vnderstand of bread. And his profe therof is this, bicause that


<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7682:216"/>
bread was not crucified for vs.<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> First here he maketh a lye of Christ. For Christ said not (as this papist alleadgeth.) This is my body, which shalbe giuen to death for you, but onely he sayth: This is my body which is giuen for you, which wordes some vnderstand not of the giuing of the body of Christ to death, but of the breaking and giuing of bread to his apostles as S. Paule sayd:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> The bread which we breake. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But let it be that he spake of the geuing of his body to death, and said of the bread, This is my body, which shal be geuen to death for you, by what reason can you gather hereof, that the bread was crucified for vs?</p>
            <p>If I looke vpon the image of kinge Dauid, and say: This is he that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Goliath, doth this speach mean, that the image of King Dauid killed Goliath? Or if I hold in my hand my booke of S. Iohns gospell, and say: This is the gospell that S. Iohn wrote at Pathmos (which fashion of speach is commonly vsed) doth it folow hereof that my booke was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at Pathmos? Or that S. Iohn wrote my booke which was but new<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly printed at Paris by Robert Stephanus? Or if I say of my booke of S. Paules epistles. This is Paule that was the great persecuter of Christ: Doth this manner of speach signify, that my booke doth persecute Christ? Or if I shew a booke of the new testament, saying: This is the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which brought life vnto the world, by what forme of argument can you induce hereof, that my booke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I bought but yesterday, brought life vnto the world? No man that vseth thus to speake doth meane of the bookes, but of the very thinges themselues, that in the bookes be taught and contayned. And after the same wise, if Christ called bread his body, saying: This is my body, which shall be giuen to death for you, yet he ment not, that the bread should be giuen to death for vs, but his body which by the bread was signified.</p>
            <p>If this excellent clarke and doctor vnderstand not these maner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (that be so playne) then hath he doth lost his sences, and forgotten his gramer which teacheth to referre the relatiue to the next antecedent. But of these figuratiue speaches, I haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at large in my third booke. First in the viii. chap. prouing by authority of the oldest authors in Christs church, that he called bread his body and wine his bloud. And agayne in the ix. x. xi. and xii. chapters, I haue so fully intreated of such figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speaches, that it should be but a superfluous labour here to speake of any more: but I referre the reader to those places.</p>
            <p>And if M. doctor require a further answere herein, let him looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the late bishop of Winchesters booke, called the detection of the diuels sophistry, where he writeth plainly, that when Christ spake these wordes, This is my body, he made demonstration of the bread.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Setting of the cart before the Horses.</note>THan further in this prologue this Papist is not ashamed to say, that I set the cart before the horses, putting reason first, and fayth after: which lye is so manifest, that it needeth no further proofe, but onely to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my booke, wherein it shall euidently appeare, that in all my fiue bookes I ground my fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation vpon gods word. And least the Papistes should say, that I make the expositions of the scripture my selfe (as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vse to do) I haue fortified my foundation by the authority of all the best learned and most holy authors and martyrs, that were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the church and many yeares after, vntill the Antichrist of Rome


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7682:216"/>
rose vp and corrupted altogither.</p>
            <p>And as for naturall reason, I make no mention therof in all my v. bookes but in one place onely, which is in my second booke speaking of Transubstantiation. And in that place I set not reason before fayth, but (as an handmayden) haue appoynted her to do seruice vnto fayth, and to wayte vpon her. And in that place she hath done such seruice, that D. Smith durst not once looke her in the face, nor find any fault with her seruice, but hath flylye and craftely stolen away by her, as though he saw her not.</p>
            <p>But in his owne booke he hath so impudently set the cart before the horses in Christes owne wordes, putting the wordes behind that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; the wordes before that goe behind, that (except a shameles Papist) no man durst be so bolde to attempt any such thing of his owne head. For where the Euangelist and S. Paule rehearse Christes wordes thus: Take, eate, this is my body:<note place="margin">Math. 26. 1. Cor. 11.</note> he in the confutation of my second booke turneth the order vpside downe, and sayth, This is my body, take &amp; eate.</p>
            <p>After this in his Preface hee rehearseth a great number of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes of God,<note place="margin">Of the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes of God.</note> as that God made all the world of nought, that he made Adam of the earth and Eue of his side, the bush to flame with fire and burne not, and many other like, which be most manifestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in holy scripture. And vpon these he concludeth most vainly and vntruly, that thing which in the scripture is neyther expressed nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, that Christ is corporally in heauen and in earth, and in euery place where the sacrament is.</p>
            <p>And yet D. Smith sayth, that Gods word doth teach this as playnly as the other: vsing herein such a kind of sophisticall argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as all Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do reprehend, which is called <hi>petitio principij,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing for a supposition and an approued truth, which is in controuersy. And so doth he in this place when he sayth: Doth not Gods word teach it thee as playnly as the other? Here by this interrogatory he required that thing to be graunted him as a truth, which he ought to proue, and whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon dependeth the whole matter that is in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to say, whether it be as playnly set out in the scripture, that Christes body is corporally in euery place where the sacrament is, as that God created all thinges of nothing, Adam of the earth, and Eue of Adams side &amp;c. This is it that I deny and that he should proue. But he taketh it for a supposition, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by interrogation, doth not the word of God teach this as playnly as the other? Which I affirme to be vtterly false as I haue shewed in my third boobe, the xi. and twelfe chap. where I haue most manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as well by Gods word as by au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient authors, that these wordes of Christ, This is my body, and, This is my bloud, be no playne speaches, but figuratiue.</p>
            <p>THen forth goeth this papist vnto the vi. chap. of S. Thou saying, Christ promised his disciples, to geue them such bread as should be his owne very naturall flesh,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> which he would geue to death for the life of the world. Can this his promise (sayth M. Smith) be verified of common bread? Was that giuen vpon the crosse for the life of the world?</p>
            <p>Wherto I answer by his owne reason. Can this his promise be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of sacramentall bread? was that geuen vpon the crosse for the life of


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7682:217"/>
the world? I meruayle here not a little of M. Smithes eyther dulnes or maliciousnes, that cannot or will not see, that Christ in this chap. of S. Ihon spake not of Sacramentall bread, but of heauenly bread: nor of his flesh onely, but also of his bloud and of his godhead, calling them heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread that giueth euerlasting life. So that he spake of him selfe wholy, saying: I am the bread of life. He that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to me, shall not hunger: and he that beleueth in me, shall not thirst for euer. And neyther spake he of common bread, nor yet of sacramentall bread. For neyther of them was giuen vpon the crosse for the life of the world.</p>
            <p>And there can be nothing more manifest then that in this vi. chap. of Ihon Christ spake not of the sacrament of his flesh, but of his very flesh. And that aswell for that the sacrament was not then instituted, as also that Christ sayd not in the future tense the bread which I will giue, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be my flesh, but in the present tense, the bread which I will geue, is my flesh, which sacramentall bread was neyther then his flesh, nor was then instituted for a Sacrament, nor was after giuen to death for the life of the world.</p>
            <p>But as Christ, when he sayd vnto the woman of Samaria. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I will geue,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> shall spring into euerlasting life he ment neyther of materiall water, nor of the accidents of water, but of the holy ghost, which is the heauenly fountayne, that springeth vnto eternall life: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when he sayd: The bread which I will geue, is my flesh which I will geue for the life of the world, he ment neyther of the materiall bread, neither of the accidents of bread,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> but of his owne flesh. Which although of it selfe it auayleth nothing, yet (being in vnity of perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ioyned vnto his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity) it is the same heauenly bread that he gaue to death vpon the crosse for the life of the world.</p>
            <p>But here M. Smith asketh a question of the tyme, saying thus: When gaue Christ that bread which was his very flesh that he gaue for vs to death, if he did it not at his last supper, when he sayd: <hi>This is my body, that shalbe giuen for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer (according to Cirils mynd vpon the same place) that Christ alone suffered for vs all, and by his woundes were we healed, he bearing our sinnes in his body vpon a tree, and being crucified for vs, that by his death we might liue.</p>
            <p>But what need I, M. Smith, to labor in answering to your question of the tyme, when your question in it selfe contayneth the aunswere, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth the tyme of Christ giuing himselfe for the life of the world, when you say, that he gaue himselfe for vs to death, which (as you confes skant three lines before) was not at his supper, but vpon the crosse.</p>
            <p>And if you will haue none other giuing of Christ for vs, but at his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as your reason pretendeth or els it is vtterly naught) then surely Christ is much bound vnto you, that haue deliuered him from all his mocking, whipping, scourging, crucifying, and all other paynes of death which he suffered for vs vpon the crosse, and bring to passe that he was giuen onely at his supper without bloud or payne, for the life of the world. But then is all the world litle beholding vnto you, that by deliuering of Christ from death, will suffer all the world to remayne in death, which can haue no life, but by his death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:7682:217"/>AFter the gospell of S. Ihon, M. Smith aleadgeth for his purpose S. Paule to the corinthians,<note place="margin">The place of S. Paule. 1. Cor. 11.</note> who biddeth euery man to examine him selfe, before he receaue this sacrament, for he that eateth and drinketh it vnworthely, is gilty of the body and bloud of Christ, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne damnation, bicause he discerneth not our lordes body.</p>
            <p>Here by the way it is to be noted, that D. Smith in reciting the words of S. Paule, doth alter them purposely, commonly putting this word sacrament, in the steede of these wordes, bread and wine (which wordes he semeth so much to abhorre, as if they were toades or serpents, bicause they make agaynst his Transubstantiation) where as S. Paule euer vseth those wordes, and neuer nameth this word, Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But to the matter: What need we to examine our selues (sayth D. Smith) when we shall eate but common bread and drincke wine of the grape? Is a man gilty of the body and bloud of Christ which eateth and drinketh nothing els, but onely bare bread made of corne, and meare wine of the grape? Who sayth so good syr? Do I say in my booke, that those which come to the Lordes table, do eate nothing els, but bare bread made of corne, nor drinke nothing but meare wine, made of grapes? How often do I teach and repeate agayne and agayne, that as corporally with our mouthes we eate and drincke the sacramentall bread and wine, so spiritually with our hartes, by fayth, do we eate Christes very flesh, and drincke his very bloud, and do both feed and liue spiritually by him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though corporally he be absent from vs, and sitteth in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his fathers right hand. And as in baptisme we come not vnto the water as we come to other common waters, when we washe our handes, or bath our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but we know that it is a misticall water, admonishing vs of the great and manifold mercies of God towards vs, of the league and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made betwene him and vs, and of his wonderfull working and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in vs. Wherfore we come to that water with such feare, reuerence and humility, as we would come to the presence of the father, the sonne and the holy ghost, and of Iesus Christ himselfe both God and man: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be not corporally in the water, but in heauen aboue. And who soeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to that water (beyng of the age of discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) must examine himselfe duely, least if hee come vnworthely (none otherwise then hee would come vnto other commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waters) he be not renewed in Christ: but in steede of saluation receaue his damnation.</p>
            <p>Euen so it is of the bread and wine in the Lordes holy supper. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery man (as S. Paule sayth) must examine himselfe, when he shall aproche to that holy table, and not come to gods borde, as he would do to common feastes and bankets, but must consider, that it is a misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call table, where the bread is misticall, and the wine also misticall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we be taught that we spiritually feed vpon Christ, eating him and drincking him, and as it were sucking out of his side the bloud of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption &amp; foode of eternall saluation, although he be in heauen at his fathers right hand. And whosoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto this heauenly table, not hauing regarde to Christes flesh &amp; bloud (who should be there our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all foode) but commeth therto without fayth, feare, humility &amp; reuerence (as it were but to carnall feeding) he doth not there feed vpon Christ, but the deuill doth feede vpon him, and deuoureth him, as he did Iudas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:7682:218"/>And now may euery man perceaue, how fondly and falsly M. Smith concludeth of these wordes of S. Paule, that our Sauiour Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud is really and corporally in the sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Master Peter Martyr.</note>AFter this he falleth to rayling, lying and sclaundering of M. Peter Martir, a man of that excellent learning and godly liuing, that hee passeth D. Smith as farre, as the sunne in his cleare light passeth the moone being in the Eclipse.</p>
            <p>Peter Martyr (sayth he) at his first coming to Oxford when he was but a Lutherian in this matter, taught as D. Smith now doth. But when he came once to the Court, &amp; saw that doctrine misliked them, that might do him hurt in his liuing, he anone after turned his tippet, and sang an other song.</p>
            <p>Of M. Peter Martyr his opinion and iudgement in this matter no man can better testify than I. For as much as hee lodged within my house long before he came to Oxford, and I had with him many confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in that matter, and know that he was then of the same mynd that he is now, and as hee defended after openly in Oxford, and hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his booke. And if D. Smith vnderstode him otherwise in his Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at the beginning, it was for lacke of knowledge, for that then D. Smith vnderstoode not the matter, nor yet doth not, as it appeareth by this folish and vnlearned booke which he hath now set out.</p>
            <p>No more than he vnderstood my booke of the Cathechisme, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reporteth vntruly of me, that I in that booke did set forth the reall presence of Christes body in the sacrament. Unto which false report I haue aunswered in my fourth booke the eight chapiter.</p>
            <p>But this I confesse of my selfe, that not long before I wrot the sayd Cathechisme, I was in that error of the real presence, as I was many yeares past in diuers other errors as of Transubstantiation, of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice propitiatory of the priestes in the Masse, of pilgrimages, purgatory, pardons, and many other superstitions and errors that came from Rome being brought vp from youth in them, and nouseled therin for lacke of good instruction from my youth, the outragious fluds of Papisticall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at that tyme ouerflowing the world. For the which and other mine offences in youth, I do dayly pray vnto God for mercy and pardon, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Delicta inuentutis meae &amp; ignorantias meas, ne memineris Domine.</hi> Good Lord remember not mine ignorances and offences of my youth.</p>
            <p>But after it had pleased God to shew vnto me by his holy word a more perfect knowledge of his sonne Iesus Christ, from tyme to tyme as I grew in knowledge of him, by little and little I put away my former ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. And as God of his mercy gaue me light, so through his grace I opened myne eyes to receaue it, and did not wilfully repugne vnto God and remayne in darkenes. And I trust in gods mercy and pardon for my former errors, bicause I erred but of frailnes and ignoraunce. And now I may say of my selfe as S. Paule sayd: When I was like a babe or childe in the knowledge of Christ, I spake like a childe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood like a child: But now that I come to mans estate and growing in Christ through his grace and mercy,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> I haue put away that childishnes.</p>
            <p>Now after that D. Smith hath thus vntruely belyed both me and master Peter Martir, he falleth into his exclamations, saying: O Lord


<pb n="403" facs="tcp:7682:218"/>
what man is so mad to beleue such mutable teachers, which chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their doctrine at mens pleasure, as they see aduauntage and profit? They turne and will turne as the winde turneth.</p>
            <p>Do you not remember M. Smith the fable how the olde crab rebuked her young, that they went not straight forth: and the common experience, that those that look a squint, sometimes find fault with them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> look right? You haue turned twise, &amp; retracted your errours, and the third time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and breaking your promise ran away. And find you fault with me and M. Peter Martyr, as though we for mens pleasures turne like the winde, as we see aduauntage? Shall the wethercocke of Paules that tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth about with euery wind, lay the fault in the church, &amp; say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it turneth?</p>
            <p>I will not here aunswere for my selfe, but leaue the iudgement to God (who seeth the bottome of all mens hartes, and at whose onely iudgement I shall stand or fall) sauing that this I will say before God (who is euery where present, and knoweth all thinges that be done) that as for seeking to please men in this matter, I thinke my conscience cleare, that I neuer sought herein but onely the pleasure and glory of God. And yet will I not iudge my selfe herein, nor take D. Smith for my iudge, but will refer the iudgement to him that is the rightfull iudge of all men. But as for D. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr, hath hee sought to please men for aduauntage? who hauing a great yearly reuenue in his owne countrey, forsooke all for Christes sake, and for the truth and glory of God came into straunge countries, wher he had neither land nor frendes, but as God of his goodnes (who neuer forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them that put their trust in him) prouided for him.</p>
            <p>BUt after this exclamation, this papist returneth to the matter, saying:<note place="margin">The Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the doore and Sepulchre.</note> Tell me, why may not Christes body be as well in the sacrament &amp; in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both at once, as that his body was in one proper place, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye of the stone, that lay still vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his graue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he rose from death to life? &amp; as his body was in one proper place at once with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of the doore or gate, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same being shut, he entred into the house where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles were?</p>
            <p>Make you these two thinges all one, M. Smith, diuers bodies to be in one place, and one body to be in diuers places? If Christs body had bene in one place with the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the stone or doore, and at the same time, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you might well haue proued thereby, that his body may as well be in one place, with the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread &amp; wine. But what auayleth this to proue, that his body may be in diuers places at one time? which is nothing like to the other, but rather cleane contrary. Marry when Christ arose out of the sepulchre, or came into the house when the dores were shut, if you can proue that at the same time he was in heauen, then were that to some purpose, to proue that this dodye may bee corporally in heauen and earth both at one tyme.</p>
            <p>And yet the controuersy here in this matter, is not what may bee, but what is, God can do many thinges, which he neither doth nor will doe. And to vs his will (in thinges that appear not to our sences) is not known but by his word: Christes body may be aswell in the bread and wine, as in in the dore and stone, and yet it may be also in the dore and stone, and not in the bread and wine.</p>
            <p>But if we will stretch out our faith no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods word doth lead vs, neither is Christs body corporally present in one proper place with the


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:7682:219"/>
bread and wine, nor was also with the stone or doore. For the Scripture sayth in no place,<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> that the body of Christ was in the doore, or in the stone that couered the Sepulchre, but it sayth playnly, that an Aungell came downe from heauen, and remoued away the stone from the Sepulchre, &amp; the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that came to see the Sepulchre,<note place="margin">Mar. 16. Iohn. 20.</note> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the stone remoued away. And although the Gospell say, that Christ came into the house when the doore was shut, yet it sayth not that Christes body was within the doore, so that the doore and it occupyed both but one place.</p>
            <p>But peraduenture M. Smith will aske me this question. How could Christ come into the house, the doore being shut, except he came through the doore, &amp; that his body must be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doore? To your wise questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. Smith I will aunswere by an other question: Could not Christ come aswell into the house whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doore was shut, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles could go out of prison, the doore beyng shut?<note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> Could not God worke this thyng, except the Apostles must go through the doore, &amp; occuyy the same place that the doore did? Or could not Christ do so much for his own selfe, as he did for his Apostles?</p>
            <p>But M. Smith is so blynd in his owne phantasies, that he seeth not how much his owne examples make agaynst him selfe. For if it be lyke in the Sacrament, as it was in the stone and doore, and Christes body was in one propre place, with the body and substaunce of the stone and doore, then must Christes body in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be in one propre place, with the body and substaunce of bread and wine. And so he must then confesse, that there is no Transubstantiation.</p>

               <note place="margin">The appearyng of Christ in his Ascention.</note>THen from the doore and sepulchre, Doct. Smith commeth to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of Peter and Paule, which saw Christ (as he sayth) bodily vpon earth after his Ascention. Whiche declareth, that although Christ departed hence at the tyme of his Ascention into heauen, and there sitteth at the right hand of his father, yet he may be also here in the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the aultar. I am not so ignorant, but I know that Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to S. Paule, and sayd to him: Saule Saule, why doest thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me?<note place="margin">Actes. 13. S. Augustine.</note> But S. Augustin sayth that Christ at his Ascention spake the last wordes, that euer he speake vpon earth. And yet we finde that Christ speaketh (sayth he) but in heauen and from heauen, and not vpon earth. For he spake to Paule from aboue, saying: Saule Saule why doest thou persecute me? The head was in heauen, and yet he sayd: why doest thou persecute me? bycause he persecuted his members vpon earth.</p>
            <p>And if this please not Maister Smith, let him blame S. Augustin and not me, for I fayne not this my selfe, but onely alledge S. Augustin.</p>
            <p>And as the father spake from heauen, whan he sayd: This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sonne,<note place="margin">Math. 3. &amp;. 17.</note> in whom I am pleased, and also S.

From which broode of vypers &amp; Serpentes, what thyng can be thought to come, but that dyd proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spirite of their most holy father, that first begat them, that is to say, from the spirite of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>And yet I know this to bee true, that Christ is present with his holy Churche (whiche is his holy elected people) and shall be with them to the worldes end, leadyng &amp; gouernyng them with his holy spirite, &amp; teachyng them all truth necessary for their saluation. And when so euer any such be gathered together in his name, there is he among them, &amp; he shall not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the gates of hell to preuaile agaynst them. For although he may suffer them by their owne frailenes for a tyme to erre, fall, and to dye, yet finally, neither sathan, hell, sinne, nor eternall death, shall preuaile agaynst them.</p>
            <p>But it is not so of the Church and sea of Rome, whiche accompteth it selfe to be the holy Catholicke Churche, and the Byshop therof to be most holy of all other. For many yeares ago Sathan hath so preuailed agaynst that stinkyng whore of Babylon, that her abhominations be knowen to the whole world, the name of God is by her blasphemed and of the cup of her dronkennes and poyson, haue all nations tasted.</p>
            <p>AFter this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth Smith to <hi>Bere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>garius, Almericus, Carolostadius, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius</hi> &amp; <hi>Zuinglius,</hi>

            <p>But in my booke I haue proued by Gods word &amp; the old auncient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that Christ is not in the sacrament corporally, but is bodily &amp; corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ascended into heauen, &amp; there shall remaine vnto the worldes end.</p>
            <p>And so the true Church of Christ euer beleued from the beginnyng with out repugnaunce, vntill Sathan was let louse, and Antichrist came with his Papistes, which fayned a new and false doctrine contrary to Gods word, and the true Catholicke doctrine.</p>
            <p>And this true fayth God preserueth in his holy church still, and will doe vnto the worldes end, maugre the wicked Antichrist and all the gates of hell.

Augustine and Tertullian meane, in the place by M. Smith alleadged.</p>
            <p>And as the register keepeth all mens wils, and yet hath none authority to adde, change, or take away any thing, nor yet to expound the wils fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the very words of the will extend vnto, (so that he hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer the will, but by the will,) euen so hath the church no further pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer the holy scripture (which conteyneth the will and testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god) but onely to keepe it, and to see it obserued and kept. For if the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede further, to make any new Articles of the fayth, besides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or contrary to the Scripture, or direct not the forme of life accordyng to the same, then it is not the piller of truth, nor the Church of Christ, but the sinagogue of Sathan, and the temple of Antichrist, which both erreth it selfe, and bringeth into errour as many as do folow it.</p>
            <p>And the holy Church of Christ is but a small herd or flocke, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the great multitude of them that folow Sathan and Antichrist, as Christ him selfe sayth,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> and the word of God, and the course of the world from the begynnyng vntill this day hath declared.</p>
            <p>For from the creation of the world vntill Noes floud, what was then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> open face of the Church? How many godly men were in those thousand and sixe hundred yeares and moe?<note place="margin">Gene. 7.</note> Dyd not iniquitie begyn at Cain to rule the worlde, and so encreased more and more, that at the length God could no lenger suffer, but drowned all the world for sinne, except viij. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which onely were left vpon the whole earth?</p>
            <p>And after the world was purged by the floud, fell it not by and by to the former iniquitie agayne?<note place="margin">Gene. 12.</note> so that within few yeares after, Abraham could find no place, where he might be suffered to worshyp the true liuyng God, but that God appointed him a straunge countrey, almost clearely desolate and vnhabited: where hee and a fewe other, (contrary to the vsage of the world) honored one God.</p>
            <p>And after the great benefites of God, shewed vnto his people of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and the law also geuen vnto them (wherby they were taught to know him, and honor him) yet how many tymes did they fal from him? Did they not from tyme to tyme make them new Gods, &amp; worshyp them? Was not the open face of the Church so miserably deformed, not onely in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

and in the tyme of the Iudges, but also in tyme of the kynges, that after the diuision of the kyngdome,<note place="margin">Eccle. 49.</note> amongest all the kyngs of Iuda, there was but onely three, in whose tymes the true Religion was restored, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the kynges of Israell not somuch as one. Were not all that tyme the true Priestes of God, a few in number? Did not all the rest maintaine Idolatry and all abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in groues and mountaines, worshippyng Baal and other false Gods? And did they not murther and slea all the true Prophetes, that taught them to worshyp the true God? In so much that Helias the Prophet, knowyng no mo of all the whole people that folowed the right trade, but him selfe alone, made his complaint vnto almightie God, saying: O Lord, they haue slayne thy Prophetes, and ouerthrowen thine aultars,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 19.</note> &amp; there is no mo left but I alone, and yet they lye in wayte to flea me also. So that although almighty God suffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie at Babylon no more but lxx. yeares, yet he suffered them in their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry (folowyng their owne wayes and inuentions) many hundred yeares,<note place="margin">Iere. 25. and. 29</note> the mercy of God beyng so great, that their punishment was short and small,<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> in respect of their long and greeuous offences. And at the tyme of Christes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng the hygh Priests came to their offices by such fraude, simony, murther and poysonyng, that the like hath not bene often read nor heard of, except onely at Rome.</p>
            <p>And when Christ was come, what godly religion found he? What An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses and Cayphasses? what hypocrisie, superstition and abhomination before God, although to mens eyes thyngs appeared holy and godly? Was not then Christ alone &amp; his Apostles, with other that beleued his doctrine, the holy &amp; true Church? Although they were not so take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for heretickes, seditious persons, &amp; blasphemers of God, &amp; were extremely persecuted and put to vilanous death, by such as accompted them selues, &amp; were taken for the Church, which fulfilled the measure of their fathers that persecuted the Prophets.<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> Upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came al the righteous bloud, that was shed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth from the bloud of iust Abell, vnto the bloud of Zachary, the sonne of Barachie, whom they slew betwene the Temple and the aultar?</p>
            <p>And how many persons remayned constantly in the true liuely fayth, at the tyme of Christes passion? I thinke M. Smith will say but a very fewe, seyng that Peter denyed Christ his Maister three tymes,<note place="margin">Math. 26. Mar. 24.</note> and all his Apostles fled away, and one for hast without his clothes.</p>
            <p>What wonder is it then, that the open church is now of late yeares fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into many errours and corruption, and the holy church of Christ is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and vnknowne? seing that Sathan these 500. yeares hath beene let lose, and Antichrist raigneth, spoyling and deuouring the simple flocke of Christ. But as almighty God sayd vnto Helias: I haue reserued and kept for mine ownne selfe seuen thousand,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 19.</note> which neuer bowed their knee to Baall, so it is at this present. For although almighty God hath suffered these foure or fiue hundred yeares, the open face of his church to be vggely deformed, and shamefullye defiled by the sects of the Papistes (which is so manifest that now all the world knoweth it) yet hath God of his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercy, euer preserued a good number (secret to himselfe) in his true religion, although Antichrist hath bathed himselfe in the bloud of no small number of them.</p>
            <p>And although the Papistes haue ledde innumerable people out of the


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7682:221"/>
right way, yet the church is to be folowed, but the Church of Christ, not of Antichrist: the church that concerning the fayth contayneth it selfe with in gods word, not that deuiseth daily new artcles contrary to gods word. The church that by the true interpretation of scripture, and good example gathereth people vnto Christ, not that by wrasting of the scripture and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill example of corrupt liuing, draweth them away from Christ. And now forasmuch as the wicked church of Rome (counterfayting the church of Christ) hath in this matter of the sacrament of the blessed bodie and bloud of our sauior Christ, varied from the pure and holy Church in the Apostles tyme, and many hundred yeares after (as in my booke I haue plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, &amp; manifestly proued) it is an easy matter to discerne, which church is to be folowed. And I cannot but maruaile, that Smith alleadgeth for for him, <hi>Vincentius Lirenensis,</hi> who (contrary to D. Smith) teacheth playnly that the canon of the Bible is perfect and fufficient of it selfe, for the truth of the Catholicke fayth: and that the whole church cannot make one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the fayth, although it may be taken as a necessary witnes, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and establishing of the same with these three conditions, that the thing which we would establish thereby, hath bene beleued in all places, euer and of al men. Which the Papistical doctrine in this matter hath not bene, but came from Rome sins Beringarius time by Nicolas the ii. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius the third, and other of their sort: where as the doctrine which I haue set forth, came from Christ and his Apostles, and was of all men eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where with one consent taught and beleued (as my book sheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly) vntill the Papistes did transforme and transubstantiate the chiefe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our christen fayth.</p>
            <p>Thus is an aunswere made vnto the false calumniations of Smith in the preface of his book, or rather vnto his whole booke, which is so full of bragging, boasting, slaundering, misreporting, wrangling, wrasting, false construing, and lying, that those taken out of the booke, there is nothing worthy in the whole book to be aunswered. Neuertheles in answering to the late byshop of Winchesters book. I shall fully aunswere also D. Smith in all points that require aunswere. And so with one answere shal I dispatch them both.

            <p>He saith, that the onely immolation of Christ in him selfe vpon the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the Crosse, is the very satisfactory sacrifice for the reconciliation of mankynd to the fauour of God, pag. 437. lin. 1.2. &amp;. 31.</p>

               <p>IT may please your Maiesty to pardon my presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I dare be so bold to write to your highnes, but very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity constrayneth me, that your Maiesty may know my minde rather by mine owne writing, then by other mens reportes. So it is that vpon Saturday being the 7. day of this moneth, I was cited to appeare at Rome, the lxxx. day after, there to make aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to such matters as should be obiected agaynst me, vpon the behalfe of the King and your most excellent Maiesty: which matters the Thursday following were obiected agaynst me by Doctor Martin and Doctor Story your maiesties Proctors, before the Bishop of Blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester sitting in iudgement by commission from Rome.<note place="margin">The kyng and Queene make themselues no better then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of their owne subiect to an outwarde iudge as thogh they had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to punishe him.</note> But alas, it can not but greue the hart of any naturall subiect, to be accused of the King and Queene of his owne Realme, and specially before an outward iudge, or by authority comming from any person out of this Realme, where the king and Queene, as if they were subiectes within theyr owne Realme, shall complayne and require iustice at a straungers handes agaynst theyr owne subiect, being already condemned to death by their owne lawes: as though the King and Queene could not do nor haue iustice within their owne Realme, agaynst their owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, but they must seeke it at a straungers hands in a straunge land, the like whereof (I thinke) was neuer seene. I would haue wished to haue had some meaner aduersaryes, &amp; I thinke that death shall not greeue me much more, then to haue my most dread and most gratious soueraygne Lord and Lady (to whom vnder God I do owe all obedience) to be mine accusers in iudgement within their owne realme before any straunger and outward power.<note place="margin">The first cause why hee would not make aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the Popes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde periury.</note> But forasmuch as in the time of the Prince of most famous memory King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. your graces father, I was sworne neuer to consent, that the byshop of Rome should haue or exercise any authoritie or iurisdiction in this realme of England, therefore least I should allow his authority contrary to mine oth, I refused to make aunswere to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Gloucester sitting here in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the Popes authority, least I should runne into periury.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The second cause is for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes lawes are contrary to the crowne and lawes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note>An other cause why I refused the popes authority is this, that his authority as he clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, repugneth to the crowne imperiall of this realme and to the lawes of the same, which euery true subiect is bound to defend. Fyrst for that the Pope sayth, that all manner of power, aswell temporall as spirituall, is geuen first to him of God and that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power he geueth vnto Emperours and Kinges to vse it vnder him, but so as it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement &amp; becke. But contrary to this clayme, the Emperial crowne and iurisdiction temporall of this Realme, is taken immediately from God to be vsed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him onely, and is subiect vnto none but to God alone.</p>

Now by these lawes, if the Byshop of Romes authority which be claymeth by God, bee lawfull, of your graces lawes and customes of your Realme being contrary to the Popes lawes be naught, and aswell your maiesty as your iudges, iustices and all other executors of the same, stand accursed among heretickes, which God forbid. And yet this curse can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be auoyded (if the Pope haue such power as he claymeth) vntil such times as the lawes and customes of this Realme,<note place="margin">The Popes lawes and the lawes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> beyng contrary to his lawes, bee taken away and blotted out of the law bookes. And although there bee many lawes of this Realme contrary to the lawes of Rome, yet I named but a few: as to conuict a Clarke before any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iudge of this Realme, for debt, felony, murther or for any other crime, which Clarkes by the Popes lawes be so exempt from the Kynges lawes, that they can be no where sued but before their Ordinary.</p>
               <p>Also the pope by his lawes may geue all byshoprickes and benefices sprituall which by the lawes of this Realme, can be geuen but onely by the Kinges and other patrones of the same, except they fall into the <hi>lapse.</hi> By the Popes lawes <hi>ius patronatus</hi> shalbe sued one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the ecclesiasticall iudge: but by the lawes of this realme, it shall be sued before the temporall iudge, and to be short the lawes of this realme do agree with the Popes lawes like fire and water. And yet the Kinges of this Realme haue prouided for their lawes, by the <hi>premunire</hi>: so that if any man haue let the excution of the lawes of this Realme, by any authority from the sea of Rome, he falleth into the <hi>premunire.</hi> But to meete with this, the popes haue prouided for their lawes by cursing. For whosoeuer letteth the Popes lawes to haue full course within this realme, by the Popes power standeth accursed: So that the popes power treadeth all the lawes and customes of this Realme vnder his feete, cursing all that execute them, vntill such time as they geue place vnto his lawes. But it may be said that notwithstanding all the popes decrees, yet we do execute still the lawes and customes of this Realme. Nay not all quietly without interruption of the Pope. And where we do execute them, yet we do it vniustly, if the popes power be of force, and for the same we stand excommunicate, and shall doe, vntill we leaue the execution of our owne lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes. Thus we be wel reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to Rome, allowing such authority, wherby the Realme standeth accursed before God, if the Pope haue any such authority.</p>
               <p>These thinges (as I suppose) were not fully opened in the parliament house, when the popes authority was receiued agayne within this Realme, for if they had, I do not beleue that either the King or Queenes maiesty or the nobles of this Realme, or the commons of the same would euer haue consented to receiue agayne such a forrayne authority, so iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hurtfull and preiudiciall, aswel to the crowne, as to the lawes and customes, and state of this realme, as whereby they must needes acknowledge themselues to be accursed. But none could ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this matter wel but the clergy, and that such of them as had read the popes lawes, whereby the pope hath made himselfe as it were a God. These seeke to maintayne the Pope, whome they desired to haue their chiefe head, to the intent they might haue, as it were, a kingdome and lawes within themselues, distinct from the lawes of the crowne, and wherewith the crowne may not meddle, and so being exempted from the lawes of the crowne might liue in this realme like Lordes and Kinges,<note place="margin">The Papistes to set vp a king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of their owne, dissemble the knowne truth and are false to the crowne.</note> without daminage or feare of any man, so that they please their high and supreame head at Rome. For this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration I weene, some that knew the truth, held their peace at the Parliament, whereas if they had done their dueties to the crowne and whole realme, they should haue opened their mouthes, declared the truth, and shewed the perils an daungers that might ensue to the crowne and realme. And if I should agree to allow such authority within this realme, whereby I must needes confesse that your most gracious, highnes and also your realme should euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue accursed vntill you shall cease from the execution of your owne lawes &amp; customes of your realme: I could not thinke my selfe true, either to your highnes, or to this my naturall countrey, knowing that I do know. Ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I know may excuse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, but he that knoweth how preiudiciall and iniurious the power and authority which he chalengeth euery where, is to the crowne, lawes and customes of this Realme, &amp; yet will allow the same, I cannot set in any wise how he can keepe his due allegeaunce, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and truth to the crowne and state of this Realme.</p>
               <p>An other cause I alleadged, why I could not allow the authority of the pope,<note place="margin">The third cause why he could not allow the Pope.</note> which is this. That by his authority he subuerteth not onely the lawes of this realme, but also the lawes of God, so that whosoeuer be vnder his authority, he suffereth them not to be vnder Christes religion purely, as Christ did commaund.<note place="margin">The Popes Religion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christes Religion.</note> And for one example I brought forth, that whereas by Gods lawes all Christian people bee boundeth diligently to learne his word, that they may know how to beleue and liue accordingly, for that purpose he orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holy dayes when they ought, leauing apart all other busines, to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues wholy to know and serue God.<note place="margin">Why Latin seruice ought not to be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in English.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Gods will and commaundement is, that when the people be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Ministers should use such language as the people may vnderstand, and take


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7682:228"/>
profite thereby, or els hold their peace. For as an harpe or lute, if it geue no certayne sound that men may know what is stricken, who can dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce after it, for all the sound is in vaynes: So is it vayne and profiteth nothing, sayth almighty God, by the mouth of S. Paule, if the priest speake to the people in a language which they know not, for els he may profite himselfe, but profiteth not the people sayth S. Paule. But herein I was aunswered thus, that S. Paule spake onely of preaching, that the preacher should speake in a tongue which the people did know, or els his preaching auayleth nothing. But if the preaching auaileth nothing, being spoken in a language, which the people vnderstand not, how should any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seruice auayle them, being spoken in the same language: And that yet S. Paule mene not onely of preaching, it appeareth playnely by his owne words, for he speaketh by name expressely of praying, singing, lauding, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kyng of God, and of all other things which the priestes say in the churches, whereunto the people say <hi>Amen,</hi> which they vsed not in preaching, but in other diuine seruice: that whether the Priestes rehearse the wonderfull workes of God, or the great benefites of God; vnto inankinde aboue all other creatures, or geue thankes vnto God, or make open profession of their fayth, or humble confession of theyr sinnes, with earnest request of mercy and forgeuenes, or make sute or request vnto God for any thing: then all the people vnderstanding what the Priestes say, might ioyne their mindes and voyces with them and say Amen, that is to say, allow what the Priestes say, that the rehearsall of Gods vniversall workes and benefites, the geuing of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes the profession of fayth, the confession of sinnes, and the requestes and petitions of the Priestes and the people, might ascend vp into the eares of God altogether, and be as a sweet sauor, odour, and incense in his nose: And thus was it vsed many hundred yeares after Christes ascension. But the aforesayd thinges cannot be done, when the priestes speake to the people in a language not knowen, and so they, or their clarke in their name say, Amen, but they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tell whereunto: where as S. Paule sayth, how can the people say Amen to thy well saying, when they vnderstand not what thou sayd: And thus was S. Paule understanded of all interpretours, both the Greekes and Latins, old and new, Scholeauthors &amp; others, that I haue red, vntill about xxx. yeares past, at which time one Eckius with other of hys sort began to deuise a new exposition, vnderstanding S. Paule of preaching onely. But when a good number of the best learned men reputed within this realme, some fauouring the old, some the new learning, as they terme to (where indeed that which they call the olde is the new and that which they call the new, is indeed the old) but when a great number of such learned men of both forces, were gathered together at winsor, for the reformation of the seruice of the Church: It was agreed by both without controuersy, (not one saying co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) that the seruice of the Church ought to be in the mother tongue and that S. Paule in the 14. chapter to the Corinthians was so to be vnderstanded. And so is S. Paule to be vnderstanded in the ciuill law more then a thousand yeares past, where <hi>Iustinianus</hi> a most godly Emperour, in a synode writeth on this maner.
<q>Iubenius vt omnes Episcopi pariter &amp; pras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri non tacito modo, sed clara vocequa a fidels populo exaudiantur, sacram oblationem &amp; preces in sacro baptismate adhibitas celebrent, quo maiori exinde deuotione in depromendis Domini Dei laudibus audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium animi effera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur.

Tu quidem pulchre gratias agis, alter autem non adificatur.</q>
That is to say: we commaunde that all Bishops and Priestes celebrate the holy oblation, &amp; prayers vsed in holy baptisme, not after a still and close maner, but with a cleare loud voyce, that they may be playnly, heard of the faythfull people, so as the hearers mindes may be lifted vp thereby with the greater deuotion; in vttering the prayses of the Lord God. For so Paule teacheth also in the Epistle to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> If the spirite doe onely blesse or say well, how shall he that occupieth the place of a priuate person, say Amen to thy thanksgeuing, for he perceiueth not what thou sayth?

                  </gap>. And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ciuill law, and all other writers a thousand and fiue hundred yeares co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue expounded S. Paule not of preaching onely, but of other Seruice sayd in the church: but reason also geueth the same, that if men be commaunded to heare any thing, it must be spoken in a language which the hearers vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">The Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth both agaynst God &amp; naturall reason. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be receaued in both kyndes of all Christians.</note> or els as S. Paule sayth what auayleth it to heare? So that the pope geuing a contrary commaundement, that the people comming to the church shall heare they wer not what, and aunswere they know not whereto, taketh vpon him to commaunde not onely agaynst reason: but also directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst God.</p>
               <p>And agayne I sayd, whereas one sauiour Christ ordayned the Sacrament of his moste precious body and bloud, to be receiued of all Christian people, vnder the formes both of bread and wine, and sayd of the cup, drinke ye all of this: the Pope geueth a cleane contrary commaundement, that no lay man shall drinke of the cup of their saluation: as though the cup of Saluation by the bloud of Christ, pertayneth not to lay men. And wherefore as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus Alexandrinus,</hi> (whose works S. Hierome did translate about eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred yeares


<pb n="423" facs="tcp:7682:228"/>
passed) sayth that if Christ had bene crucified for the Deuils, his cup should not be denied them: yet the Pope denieth the cup of Christ to christen people, for whome Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: so that if I should obay the Pope, in these thinges I must needes disobay my sauior Christ. But I was au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swered hereto (as commonly the Papistes do au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere,) that vnder the forme of bread, is whole Christs flesh and bloud, so that whosoeuer receiueth the forme of bread, receiueth aswell christes bloud as his flesh. Let it be so: yet in the forme of breade onely, Christs bloud is not drunken but eaten, nor receiued in the cup vnder forme of wine as Christ commaunded, but eaten with the flesh vnder forme of bread, and moreouer the bread is not the sacrament of his bloud, but of his flesh only, nor the cup is not the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his flesh, but of his bloud onely, and so the pope keepeth from all lay persons, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their redemption by Christes bloud, which Christ commaunded to geue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And furthermore Christ ordayned the sacrament in two kindes, the one seperated from the other, to be a representation of his death, where his bloud was separated from his flesh, which is not represented in one kind alone: so that lay people receiue not the whole sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, whereby Christes death is represented as he commaunded.</p>
               <p>Moreouer as the pope taketh vpon him to geue the temporall sword, or royall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall power to kinges and princes: so doth he likewise take vpon him to depose them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their imperiall states, if they be disobedient to him, and commaundeth the subiectes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obay their princes, assoyling the subiects aswell of their obedience, as of their lawfull othes made vnto their true Kinges and princes directly contrary to Gods commaundement, who commaundeth all subiectes to obay their kinges or other rulers vnder them. One Iohn Patriarche of Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople in the time of S. Gregory, claymed superiority aboue all other bishops, to whom S. Gregory writeth, that therein he did iniury to his iii. bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which were equall with him, that is to say, the bishop of Rome, of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which iii. were Patriarchall seas, aswell as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and were brethren one to an other. But sayth S. Gregory, if any one shall exalt himselfe aboue all the rest to be the vniuersall Byshop, the same passeth in pride: but now the bishop of Rome exalteth himselfe not onely aboue all Byshops, but also aboue all Kinges and Emperours, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the whole world, taking vpon him to geue and take away, to set vp and put downe, as he shall thinke good. And as the deuill hauing no such authority, yet tooke vpon him to geue vnto Christ all the kingdomes of the world,<note place="margin">The deuill and the Pope are like.</note> if he would fall down and worship him, in like manner the Pope taketh vpon him to geue Empyres and Kingdomes being none of his, to such as will fall downe and worship him and kisse his feete. And moreouer his Lawyers and glosers so flatter him, that they say he may commaund Emperours and Kinges to hold his stirrop, when he lighteth vpon his horse and to be his footemen, and that if any Emperour or King geue him any thing, they geue him nothing but that is his owne, and that he may dispense agaynst Gods word, against the old and new Testament, agaynst S. Paules Epistles and agaynst the Gospell.</p>
               <p>And furthermore whatsouer he doth, although he draw innumerable people by heapes with himselfe into hell: yet may no mortall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reproue him, because he being iudge of all men, may be iudged of no man, and thus he sitteth in the temple of God, as he were a God and nameth himselfe Gods Uicar, and yet be dispenseth agaynst God.<note place="margin">The Pope is Antichrist, that is Christs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> If this be not to play Antichristes part, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tell what is Antichrist, which is no more to say, but Christs enemy and aduersary, who shall sit in the temple of God, aduauncyng himselfe aboue all other, yet by hipocrisy and fayned Religion, shall subuert the true Religion of Christ, and vnder pretense and colour of Christian religion, shall worke agaynst Christ and therefore hath the name of Antichrist.<note place="margin">Wherfore the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now if any man lift him selfe higher then the Pope hath done, who lifteth him selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the world, or can bee more aduersary to Christ then to dispense agaynst Gods lawes, and where Christ hath geuen any commaundement, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde directly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that man must needes be taken for Antichrist. But vntill the tyme that such a person may bee founde, men may easly coniecture where to finde Antichrist. wherefore seyng the Pope thus, to ouerthrow both Gods lawes and mans lawes, taketh vppon him to make Emperours and Kyngs to be vassals and subiectes vnto him, specially the crowne of this Realme, with the lawes and customes of the same. I see no meane how I may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to admit this vsurped power within this Realme, contrary to myne othe, myne obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods law, myne allegeaunce and duetie to your Maiestie, and my loue and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to this Realme.</p>
               <p>This that I haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynst the power &amp; authoritie of the Pope, I haue not spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (I take God to record and iudge) for any malice I owe to the Popes person, whom I know not, but I shall pray to God to geue him grace, that he may seeke aboue all thynges to promote Gods honour and glory, and not to follow the trade of his predecessours in these latter dayes, nor I haue not spoken it for feare of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and to auoyde the same, thinkyng it rather an occasion to aggrauate, then to diminish my trouble: but I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it for my most bounden duetie to the crowne, liberties, lawes, and customes of this


<pb n="424" facs="tcp:7682:229"/>
Realme, but most especially to discharge my conscience in vttering the truth to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, castyng away all feare, by the comfort whiche I haue in Christes wordes, who sayth:<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Feare not them that kill the body and can not kill the Soule, but feare him that can cast both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule into hell.</hi> He that for feare to lose this life will forsake the truth, shall lose the euerlastyng life: and he that for the truthes sake will spend his life, shall finde euerlastyng life.<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> And Christ promiseth to stand fast with them, before his Father, which will stand fast with him here: which comfort is so great, that whosoeuer hath his eyes fixed vpon Christ, can not greatly passe of this life, knowing that he may be sure to haue Christ stand by him, in the presence of his Father in heauen.</p>
               <p>As touching the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I sayd that forasmuch as the whole matter sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of these wordes of Christ:<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue the names of those thinges wherof they are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body, This is my bloud,</hi> I say that Christ in these words made demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stration of the bread &amp; wine, and speake figuratiuely, calling bread his body, &amp; wine his bloud, bycause he ordeined them to be the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of his body &amp; bloud. And where the Papistes say in these two points co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto me, that Christ called not bread his body, but a substaunce vncertaine, nor spake figuratiuely, herein I sayd I would be iudged by the old Churche, and which doctrine could be proued the elder, that I would sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto. And forasmuch as I haue alledged in my booke many old Authors both Greekes &amp; Latins, which about a M. yeares after Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually taught as I do, if they could bryng forth but one old Author that sayth in these two pointes as they say, I offred vj. or vij. yeares agoe, &amp; do offer yet still, that I will geue place to them. But when I bring forth any Author that sayth in most playne termes as I do, yet sayth the other part, that the Authors meant not so: as who should say, that the Authours spake one thyng and meant cleane contrary. And vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other part, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not finde any one Authour that sayth in wordes as they say, yet say they that the Authors meant as they say.</p>
               <p>Now whether they or I speake more to the purpose herein, I referre it to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all indifferent hearers. Yea the old Church of Rome about a thousand yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, neither beleued nor vsed the Sacrament as the Church of Rome hath done of late yeares. For in the begynnyng the Church of Rome taught a pure &amp; a sound doctrine of the Sacrament, but that after the Church of Rome fell into a new doctrine of Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with the doctrine they chaunged the vse of the Sacrament, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that Christ commaunded, and the old Church of Rome vsed aboue a M. yeares. And yet to deface the old they say that the new is the old: wherein for my part I am content to the triall to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: But their doctrine is so fonde and vncomfortable, that I marueile that any man would allow it, if he knew what it is, &amp; what soeuer they beare the people in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that which they write in their bookes hath neither truth nor comfort. For by their doctrine, of one body of Christ is made two bodies:<note place="margin">The Papistes make Christ two bodyes.</note> one naturall hauing distance of members with forme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a mans perfect body, and this body is in heauen, but the body of Christ in the Sacrament by their owne doctrine, must needes be a monstruous body, hauyng neither distance of members nor forme, fashion or proportion of a mans naturall body, and such a body is in the Sacrament (teach they) and goeth into the mouth with the forme of bread, and entreth no farther then the forme of bread goeth, nor tarieth no longer then the forme of bread is by naturall heate in digestyng, so that when the forme of bread is digested, that body of Christ is gone.</p>
               <p>And for asmuch as euill men be as long in digestyng as good men, the body of Christ (by their doctrine) entreth as farre, and tarieth as long in wicked as in godly men. And what comfort can be herein to any Christian man, to receaue Christes vnshapen body, and it to enter no farther than the stomacke, and to depart by and by, as soone as the bread is consumed? It seemeth to me a more sound and comfortable doctrine, that Christ hath but one body, and that hath forme and fashion of a mans true body, which body spiritually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the whole man body and soule, and though the Sacrament be consumed, yet whole Christ remaineth and feedeth the receauer vnto eternall life, if he continue in godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; neuer depart, vntill the receauer forsake him. And as for the wicked, they haue not Christ within them at all, who can not be where Belial is. And this is my fayth, and as me seemeth a sound doctrine accordyng to Gods word, and sufficient for a Christian to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in that matter. And if it can be shewed vnto me, that the Popes authoritie is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the thyngs before mentioned, or that my doctrine in the Sacrament is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (which I thinke ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be shewed) then I was neuer nor will be so peruerse, to stand wilfully in myne owne opinion, but I shall (with all humilitie) submit my selfe vnto the Pope not onely to kisse his feete, but an other part also.</p>
               <p>An other cause why I refused to take the Byshop of Gloucester for my Iudge, was the respect of his owne person, beyng more then once periured. First, for that he beyng diuers tymes sworne, neuer to consent that the G. of Rome should haue any iurisdiction within this Realme, but to take the kyng and his successours for supreme heades of this Realme, as by Gods lawes they be: contrary to this lawfull oth the sayd B. sate then in iudgement by authoritie from Rome, wherein he was periured, and not worthy to sit as a Iudge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:7682:229"/>The second periurie was, that he tooke his Byshopricke both of the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and of the Pope, makyng to eche of them a solemne othe: which othes be so contrary, that in the one he must needes be periured. And furthermore in swearyng to the Pope to maintayne his lawes, decrees, constitutions, ordinaunces, reseruations, and prouisions, he declareth him selfe an enemy to the Imperiall crowne and to the Lawes and state of this Realme, whereby hee declared him selfe not woorthy to sit as a Iudge within this Realme, and for these considerations I refused to take him for my Iudge.</p>

               <p>I Learned by Doct.

And if your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie did make an othe to the Pope; I thinke it was accordyng to the other othes, which he vseth to minister to Princes, which is to be obedient to him, to defend his person, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his authoritie, honour, lawes, landes, and priuileges. And if it be so, then I beseech your Maiestie to looke vpon your othe made to the crowne and the Realme, and to expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and way the two othes together, to see how they agree, and then to do as your graces co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Some of you know by what meanes I was brought and trayned vnto the will of our late soueraigne Lord kyng <hi>Edward</hi> the vi. &amp; what I spake agaynst the same: wherein I referre me to the reportes of your honours. Furthermore this is to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie vnto your Lordshyps that vpon Monday, Tuesday, and Wednisday, last past were open disputations here in Oxford agaynst me,<note place="margin">They put to hym three que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions but they suffred him not to aunswere fully in one.</note> 
                  <hi>M. Ridley,</hi> and <hi>M. Latymer</hi> in three matters concernyng the Sacrament. First of the reall presence, secondly of Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiation, and thyrdly concernyng the Sacrifice of the Masse. How the other two were vsed I can not tel, for we were separated, so that none of vs knew what the other said, nor how they were ordered. But as concernyng my selfe I can report, that I neuer knew nor heard of a more confused disputation in all my lyfe. For albeit there was one appointed to dispute agaynst me, yet euery man spake his mynde and brought forth what him lyked without order, and such hast was made, that no aunswere could be suffered to be geuen fully to any argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; in such weighty &amp; large matters there was no remedy, but the disputations must needes be ended in one day, whiche can scantly well be ended in three monethes. And when we had aunswered them, then they would not appoint vs one day to bring forth our proofes, that they might aunswere vs agayne, beyng required of me thereunto, whereas I my selfe haue more to say then can be well discussed in .xx dayes. The meanes to resolue the truth, had bene to haue suffered vs to aunswere fully to all that they could say, and then they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to aunswere to all that we could say. But why they would not aunswere vs, what other cause can there be, but that either they feared the matter that they were not able to aunswere vs, or els (as by their hast might well appeare) they came, not to speake the truth, but to condemne vs in post hast,<note place="margin">Behold Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sleepeth not.</note> before the truth might be throughly tryed and heard, for in all hast we were all three condemned of heresie vpon Friday.</p>
               <p>This much I thought good to signifie vnto your Lordshyppes, that you may knowe the indifferent handlyng of matters,<note place="margin">Their cruell desire to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge could abide no delay.</note> leauyng the iudgement thereof vnto your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and I beseech your Lordshyppes to remember me a poore prisoner vnto the Queenes Maiestie, and I shall pray, as I doe dayly, to God for the long preseruation of your good Lordshyppes in all godlynesse and felicitie.</p>

               <head>¶An Epistle to a certaine Lawyer for his aduise and counsell touchyng his Appeale.</head>
               <p>THe law of nature requireth of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that so farforth as it may be done without offence to God, euery one should seeke to defend and preserue his owne life. Which thyng, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I about three dayes agoe bethought my selfe of, and there withall remembred how that <hi>Martin Luther</hi> appealed in his tyme from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, to a generall Councell (least I should seeme rashly and vnaduisedly to cast away my selfe) I determined to Appeale in like sort to some lawfull and free generall Counsell. But seyng the order and forme of an Appeale pertaineth to the Lawyers, wherof I my selfe am ignoraunt, and seyng that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Appeale commeth not to my hand: I purposed to breake my mynde in this matter to some faythfull frend and skilfull in the law, whose helpe I might vse in this behalfe, and you onely among other came to me remembraunce as a man most meete, in this Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie for that purpose. But this is a matter that requireth great silence, so that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know of it, before it be done. It is so, that I am summoned to make myne answere at Rome, the xvi. day of this moneth, before the which day I thinke it good after sentence pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to make myne Appeale. But whether I should first Appeale from the Iudge delegate to the pope, &amp; so afterward to the generall Councell, or els leauyng, the Pope, I should Appeale immediatly to the Councell: herein I stand in neede of your counsell. Many causes there


<pb n="427" facs="tcp:7682:230"/>
be for the whiche I thinke good to Appeale.</p>
               <p>First, because I am by an Othe bound neuer to consent to the receiuyng of the Byshop of Romes authoritie into this Realme. Besides this, whereas I vtterly refused to make aunswere to the Articles obiected vnto me, by the Byshop of Gloucester appointed by the Pope to be my Iudge, yet I was content to aunswere <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Story,</hi> with this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, that myne aunswere should not be taken as made before a Iudge, nor yet in place of Iudgement, but as pertainyng nothyng to Iudgement at all: and moreouer after I had made myne aunswere I required to haue a Copy of the same, that I might, either by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng thereunto, by alteryng or takyng from it; correct and amend it, as I thought good. The which though both the Byshop of Gloucester and also the kyng and Queenes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors promised me, yet haue they altogether broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promise with me, and haue not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to correct my sayd aunsweres accordyng to my request, and yet notwithstandyng haue (as I vnderstand) Registred the same as actes formally done in place of iudgement.</p>
               <p>Finally, forasmuch as all this my trouble commeth vpon my departyng from the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, and from the popish Religion, so that now the quarell is betwixt the Pope him selfe and me, and no man can be a lawfull and indifferent Iudge in his owne cause: it seemeth (me thinke) good reason that I should be suffered to Appeale to some generall Councell in this matter: specially seyng the law of nature (as they say) denieth no man, the remedy of Appeale in such cases. Now, since it is very requisite that this matter should be kept as close as may be, if perhaps for lacke of perfect skill herein, you shall haue neede of further aduise: then I beseech you, euen for the fidelity and loue you beare to me in Christ, that you will open to no creature aliue whose the case is. And for asmuch as the tyme is now at hand, and the matter requireth great expedition, let me obtaine this much of you, I beseech you, that laying aside all other your studies and businesse for the tyme, you will apply this my matter onely till you haue brought it to passe.</p>
               <p>The chiefest cause in very deede (to tell you the truth) of this myne Appeale is, that I might gayne tyme (if it shall so please God) to liue vntill I haue finished myne aunswere agaynst <hi>Marcus Antonius Constantius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This <hi>Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Gardiner</hi> as constant in deede as a we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercocke, who thus named him selfe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng agaynst this good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> which I haue now in hand. But if the aduersaryes of the truth will not admit myne Appeale (as I feare they will not) Gods will be done: I passe not vpon it, so that God may therein be glorified, be it by my life or by my death. For it is much better for me to dye in Christes quarell and to raigne with him, then here to be shut vp and kept in the prison of this body; vnlesse it were to continue yet still a while, in this warrefare for the commoditie and profite of my brethren, and to the further aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng of Gods glory, to whom be all glory for euermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is also yet an other cause why I thinke good to Appeale, that whereas I am ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe to Rome to aunswere there for my selfe, I am notwithstandyng kept here fast in prison, that I can not there appeare at the tyme appointed. And moreouer for asmuch as the state I stand in, is a matter of lyfe and death, so that I haue great neede of learned cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell for my defence in this behalfe: yet when I made my earnest request for the same, all maner of counsell and helpe of proctors, aduocates, and lawyers was vtterly denied me.</p>
