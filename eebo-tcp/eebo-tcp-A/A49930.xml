            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable CHARLES, Earl of <hi>DORSET</hi> &amp; <hi>MIDDLESEX,</hi> One of the Gentlemen of His MAJESTIES BED-CHAMBER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHen I call to mind what I have observ'd of your Wit and Judgment, the truest and most impartial I ever knew, my thoughts of writing after my loose manner to your Lordship are a little dash'd, and the meanest of 'em has the sense to tell me, I ought to be as curious and correct in a Dedication to one Man, as in that of a Play to a whole Nation. There is no doubt a Transport in ev'ry Poet who writes an Epistle, but for the most part they are
<pb facs="tcp:95679:3"/>
dazl'd with the Eminence of their Patrons, and at best we can but call it an Awful Delight. But I profess, what those to whom I am disagreeable, will impute to want of Modesty, I make this Tragedy an Off'ring to your Lordship with as much freedom, pleasure, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect satisfaction, as ever <hi>Mithridates</hi> receiv'd when he found himself in the Arms of his Fairest Mistress. You stand Equal with the Greatest, and your Quality shou'd cause a Dread in the hardiest Writers: But on the other hand, there is such an innate sweetness of temper, such a most remarkable goodness in all your Actions, a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter peculiar to you more than any man alive, that the meanest, modestest of Poets may approach you. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks <hi>I</hi> feel a sort of chearful springing Pride, when <hi>I</hi> see your Lordship stand forth to this last Birth, which sure if <hi>I</hi> had ever any lovely, is much the Fairest Child. Happy Fortune must attend it, and Heav'n and Earth be pleas'd where you approve. <hi>I</hi> accost you, my Lord, without Formality, and wou'd appear before the severest Judge in the plainest Garb, or rather nakedness of thought; as some, and those not of the least courage, go to the most bloody Test of valour, all unarm'd. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-care in things of this nature does often turn to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, and what was meant a Guard, proves an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance: We may stiff'n our imaginations with making 'em too quaint; and polish, till we are nothing else but gloss: <hi>I</hi> am infinitely pleas'd, to be as plain as <hi>I</hi> can, nor care <hi>I</hi> how it pleases others, tho <hi>I</hi> am sure it does, that <hi>I</hi> have laid this Play at your Lordships feet. All my Acquaintance that wish me well applaud my choice;
<pb facs="tcp:95679:3"/>
for <hi>I</hi> may safely affirm by the judgment of the Town, without being censur'd for a Dawber, there's not a man whom all men love but you, you are beheld in all the Company you Honour, as if you were the Genius of that Prince who was call'd the <hi>Delight of Mankind,</hi> and are ador'd with all the love and admiration which e're the Noble <hi>Titus</hi> found in <hi>Rome. Ziphares</hi> is an imperfect Figure of your self; <hi>I</hi> cast him in your Mould, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion'd him as well as my weak Fancy cou'd, to that Perfection the Court so universally allows you: When <hi>I</hi> design'd to draw him for the Ladies, endearing, soft, and passionately loving, <hi>I</hi> thought on you, and found the way to Charm 'em. And 'tis most certain, he who obliges those Fair Criticks to be of his Party, has the surest Cards that ever Poet plaid: <hi>I</hi> cannot but own the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours they have done me, and entreat your Lordship to secure 'em my Friends. There is yet a greater Honour I wou'd beg of your Lordship, and so important, <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not name it without apprehension: <hi>Mithridates</hi> being in your hands, desires to be laid at the Feet of the Queen. Her Majesty, who is the Sublimest Goodness, and most merciful Vertue that ever blest a Land, has been pleas'd to grace him with her Presence, and promis'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with such particular praises, the effects of her pure Bounty, that shou'd he not express his Gratitude almost to adoration, he wou'd deserve another Fate, when he is next represented, than what he has hitherto receiv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have endeavour'd in this Tragedy to mix <hi>Shakespear</hi> with <hi>Fletcher;</hi> the thoughts of the former, for Majesty and true <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness, and the softness and passionate
<pb facs="tcp:95679:4"/>
expressions of the latter, which makes up half the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are never to be match'd: How have <hi>I</hi> then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be like 'em? O faint Resemblance! As <hi>Pizarro</hi> says of the <hi>Mexicans,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—And those who now remain,</l>
               <l>Appear but as the Shadows of the Slain.</l>
            </q>
            <p>It may be objected, <hi>I</hi> broke the <hi>Scenes</hi> in the beginning of the Third and Fifth Acts; those who are so nicely curious to be offended at this over-sight, may for their satisfaction leave 'em out, and the Play will be entire. <hi>I</hi> apply my self to your Lordship, as <hi>Montaign</hi> does to his Reader in his Chapter of Books; <hi>I will,</hi> says he, <hi>love the Man that shall trace me!</hi> For <hi>I</hi> have many times found fault with an Expression, as <hi>I</hi> pretended was in a Play of my own, and had it dam'd by no indifferent Criticks, tho the immortal <hi>Shakespear</hi> will not blush to own it. But <hi>I</hi> am confident your Lordship will find me out, and <hi>I</hi> desire to be so found a Refiner on those admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Writers; the Ground is theirs, and all that serves to make a rich Embroidery! <hi>I</hi> hope the World will do me the Justice to think, I have disguiz'd it into another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion more suitable to the Age we live in; for if <hi>I</hi> cou'd perswade my self there were nothing of mine extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in the Play, <hi>I</hi> wou'd not have dedicated it to the best of Men.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Mediocribus esse Poetis,</l>
               <l>Non dii non homines non concessere columne.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95679:4"/>
Here you must give me leave to tell the World, that Pillars and Altars too ought to be rais'd to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, if the greatest Genius of Poetry deserves em: Your thoughts in some select Poems I have seen, are rich and new, as the Golden <hi>American</hi> World, your Expressions justly strong, your words Emphatical, as chosen men for an Enterprize of Glory: As it was observed of the Army of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> every Souldier look'd like a Commander, and every Commander like an <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> so in your admirable Draughts, all things are so excellent, we know not where to fix; we stand on Hills of so vast a breadth, that the Valleys are not seen; it looks like Heaven all about us, and Fancy is lost in the infinite Beauty of the Prospect: Your Writing dazles with clearness and Majesty; you draw, like <hi>Holbin,</hi> without Shadows.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Qui Genus humanum ingenio superavit &amp; omnes</l>
               <l>Praestrinxit stellas, exortus uti Aetherius Sol.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Your Images are so great, we look like Dwarfs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath you; and then so lively represented, tho of dead, low Objects, animated by your Genius,</p>

                  <l>My blood leaks fast; and the great heavy lading,</l>
                  <l>My Soul will quickly sink; therefore revenge:</l>
                  <l>Yes, you pale figures, you most precious forms,</l>
                  <l>Who, where you walk, for sure you tread the Stars,</l>
                  <l>Shame brightest Gods, and add new light to Heav'n,</l>
                  <l>First, in most dreadful manner, will I give</l>
                  <l>Those Traytors lives, who drew me to your ruine.</l>
                  <l>Hence, burn the Slaves; the curs'd <hi>Pelopidas,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And Villain <hi>Andravar:</hi> away with 'em.</l>

            <head>Epilogue, by Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>YO've seen a Pair of faithful Lovers die:</l>
               <l>And much you care; for, most of you will cry,</l>
               <l>'Twas a just Judgment on their Constancy.</l>
               <l>For, Heav'n be thank'd, we live in such an Age</l>
               <l>When no man dies for Love, but on the Stage:</l>
               <l>And ev'n those Martyrs are but rare in Plays;</l>
               <l>A cursed sign how much true Faith decays.</l>
               <l>Love is no more a violent desire;</l>
               <l>'Tis a meer Metaphor, a painted Fire.</l>
               <l>In all our Sex, the name examin'd well,</l>
               <l>Is Pride, to gain; and Vanity to tell:</l>
               <l>In Woman, 'tis of subtil int'rest made,</l>
               <l>Curse on the Punk that made it first a Trade!</l>
               <l>She first did Wits Prerogative remove,</l>
               <l>And made a Fool presume to prate of Love.</l>
               <l>Let Honour and Preferment go for Gold;</l>
               <l>But glorious Beauty is not to be sold:</l>
               <l>Or, if it be, 'tis at a rate so high,</l>
               <l>That nothing but adoring it shou'd buy.</l>
               <l>Yet the rich Cullies may their boasting spare;</l>
               <l>They purchase but sophisticated Ware.</l>
               <l>'Tis Prodigality that buys deceit;</l>
               <l>Where both the Giver, and the Taker cheat.</l>
               <l>Men but refine on the old Half-Crown way:</l>
               <l>And Women fight, like <hi>Swizzers,</hi> for their Pay.</l>

            <head>Prologue, by Mr. <hi>Lee.</hi>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>NOt careful Leaders, when the Trumpets call</l>
               <l>Their Martial Squadrons on, to stand or fall,</l>
               <l>Toss'd with more doubts, than careful Poets are</l>
               <l>When vent'rous Wit for Sally does prepare;</l>
               <l>When Humming Voices bid the Play begin,</l>
               <l>And the last flourish calls the Prologue in.</l>
               <l>Here you, like dreadful Warriours, judging sit;</l>
               <l>And, in full Councel, try all Writers Wit.</l>
               <l>To some for Sense Renown'd, our Authors bow;</l>
               <l>And what you Doom, for a just Fate allow:</l>
               <l>But sure far less such Judges Poets dread,</l>
               <l>Than those Raw Blades who will not let 'em Plead,</l>
               <l>But, e're they can be heard, cry, shoot 'em dead.</l>
               <l>These Pyrats, they both Arms and Wits debase;</l>
               <l>Who Fields and Poems, with their Spleen, disgrace,</l>
               <l>Poets and Warriours both shou'd have in Chase:</l>
               <l>These Libellers who noblest Fights despise,</l>
               <l>Yet, when a Pan but flashes, shut their Eyes.</l>
               <l>They who write <hi>Lampoons,</hi> vilely get a Name</l>
               <l>By others Infamy, and live in shame;</l>
               <l>Fifes, Whiflers, and the silly'st Sense, not fit</l>
               <l>To be the Powder-Monkeys of true Wit:</l>
               <l>Mimies, like Apes, what's ill, for head they cover,</l>
               <l>And live upon the Vermin of a Lover:</l>
               <l>Nauseous to all, like Pills, by Fortune hurl'd,</l>
               <l>And coated o're with Gold, to Purge the World.</l>
               <l>Neglecting these, and rusting to your aid,</l>
               <l>To Beauty our last Vows, like yours, are made:</l>
               <l>Beauty, which still adorns the op'ning List,</l>
               <l>Which <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Heart vouchsafes not to resist:</l>
               <l>To that alone devoted is this day;</l>
               <l>For, by the Poet, I was bid to say,</l>
               <l>In the first draught, 'twas meant the <hi>Ladies Play.</hi>
