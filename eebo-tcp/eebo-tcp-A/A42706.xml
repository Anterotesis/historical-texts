            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN relation to this Treatiſe I think my ſelf
obliged to account for two things; Firſt,
<hi>why</hi> I publiſh any thing of this nature; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
why <hi>in Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt;</hi> I muſt confeſs it was not
any Ambition to become an Author that put
me upon it; but another occaſion. The Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
for whom this is printed, (my particular
Friend) thinking to make a new Impreſſion of
a Book intituled <hi>The Manual of the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
or Diſſection of the Body of Man,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Dr. <hi>Alexander Read,</hi> a Fellow of the
College of Phyſicians, <hi>London,</hi> deſired me
to peruſe it, and if in any place I obſerved it
erroneous, to alter it. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding that
the Book had been writ many years agoe,
(that which was brought to me being the fifth
Impreſſion, and that printed in 55.) I was
unwilling to meddle with it, ſuſpecting that
<pb facs="tcp:49419:3"/>
there muſt needs be very conſiderable Errors in
it, ſo many new things in Anatomy having been
diſcovered ſince that time. However at his
importunity I undertook it: and before I had
lookt over a Sheet, I ſaw I was not deceived.
For though I had reſolved to give my ſelf no
further trouble than was neceſſary, yet I found
that if I would mend all that was amiſs, I
muſt in effect write a new Book. Which I
have really done, as any one will find that will
take the pains to compare this with that writ
by Dr. <hi>Read,</hi> for he will ſee very little of that
retained except the method, which indeed is
but little alter'd; for though it differ pretty
much from the modern, yet I think 'tis every
whit as convenient.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> Why I ſhould write it <hi>in
Engliſh;</hi> I have two things to alledge: Firſt,
The example of him that has gone before me,
who was a perſon (as I am informed) eminent
in his time. Secondly, to avoid the injury of
a paltry Tranſlator, if it ſhould be well accepted.
For we ſee there is no Man that publiſhes any
thing in the Latin tongue, that is received with
any applauſe, but preſently ſome progging Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
or other finds out an indigent Hackney
ſcribler to render it into Engliſh. But with
what diſ-reputation and abuſe to the worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
every learned perſon cannot but obſerve.
So that he that ſhall think to redeem the noble
<pb facs="tcp:49419:3"/>
faculty and art of Phyſick out of the hands of
the Mechanical Quacking Tribe by publiſhing
every thing in a language above their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
will not only fail of his end, but find
himſelf abuſed and diſgraced into the bargain.</p>
            <p>And now as to the Work it ſelf, the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of it is to pleaſure thoſe that are entring
upon the ſtudy of Phyſick; for herein they may
ſee in ſhort, what afterwards they ſhall find more
largely treated of in other Authors. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may not be altogether unuſefull even for
ſuch as have made ſome proficiency in that ſtudy;
for it will ſerve at leaſt as an Index to bring to
their remembrance what they have read more
fully elſewhere; and will ſave them the labour
to make ſuch a <hi>Compendium</hi> for their own uſe.
There is little that is new in Anatomy, but the
Reader will find a taſte of it here. Which he will
the rather expect to meet with, when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
that moſt of theſe following learned Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts
are in ſome meaſure Epitomiz'd in it.</p>

placed upon the Skin as a cover. It is termed
<hi>cuticula</hi> in Latine, and is as large as the Skin, and
more compact; for wateriſh ſharp humours, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through the Skin, are ſtayed by the thickneſs
of this, and ſo puſtules are cauſed. In Man it is
as the peeling of an Onion. It is without bloud
and without feeling.</p>
                  <p>The material cauſe of it is a viſcous and oleous
vapour of the bloud, raiſed by the natural heat of
the ſubjacent parts, and dried and condenſed by the
external cold, as moſt Anatomiſts have taught;
but Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> not improbably thinks it to be a
ſoft, ſlippery, viſcid and tranſparent juice (like
the white of an Egge) iſſuing out of the capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
extremities of the Nerves which end in the
outer ſuperficies of the true Skin, where it is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,

hot water. It ſometimes alſo almoſt wholly
peels off in burning fevers, and the ſmall pox;
but a new one preſently ſucceeds it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> of it is Firſt,<note place="margin">Its uſes.</note> to defend the Skin, which
is of an exquiſite ſenſe, from external immoderate
either heat or cold. In cold weather it breaketh
the cold, that the perſpiration ſhould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
hindred: In hot weather by its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs
it hindreth too great perſpiration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to be a middle between the Skin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the object to be felt; for when it is rubb'd
off, the true Skin cannot endure the touch of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Fourthly, to make the Body more beautifull;
which it does by ſmoothing the aſperities of the
true Skin, and inducing a comely colour of white
and red. Whiteneſs is natural to this part, and
the redneſs is owing to the bloud that is affus'd to
the outward ſuperficies of the true Skin; which
being ſeen through the Skarf-skin makes that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid

in Children, Women, and thoſe which
are born in hot Countries, it is thinner; but in
Men, and in thoſe who inhabit cold Countries,
it is thicker.</p>
                  <p>It is naturally white,<note place="margin">Its colour.</note> as other membranes;
but in living and healthfull perſons, and ſuch as
live in a temperate or ſomewhat cold climate,
from the afflux of the bloud towards it, it is of a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49419:9"/>
reddiſh roſie colour. But in thoſe that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Aequinoctial Line and in exceſſively hot
climates it appears black in the outer ſuperficies,
becauſe they having a ſofter Skin, and large pores
and looſe, many vapours of the aduſt humours
are raiſed with the ſweat; the groſſer ſubſtance
whereof, (being ſtopt by the Scarf-skin, and)
by reaſon of the exceſſive heat, being dried and
burned, cauſeth that blackneſs; for their infants
are not born black but reddiſh.</p>
                  <p>It is made up of nervous fibres very cloſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
one with another, and of a parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
that fills up the interſtices and inequalities
thereof. That it has ſuch a parenchyma may
appear by this, that when a Sheep-skin (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)
has been ſome while ſteept in water, one
may with an ivory knife or the like ſcrape a great
deal of mucous ſlimy matter off it, whereby it
becomes much lighter, thinner and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
tranſparent, as we ſee in Parchment.</p>
                  <p>The Skin in the Fore-head and Sides is thin,
thinner yet in the palm of the Hand, but thinneſt
of all in the Lips and Cods. In the Head, Back,
and under the Heel it is thickeſt. Under the
Heel the <hi>cuticula</hi> in ſome will be as thick as a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
corn, and may more truly be called a <hi>callus</hi>
than a <hi>cuticula;</hi> and ſuch it is in the palms of the
Hands of ſuch as much handle hard things, as
Smiths, and the like. It is thinner in Children
and in Women than in Men; in thoſe that live in
hot Countries, than thoſe that live in cold. And
this (as <hi>Spigelius</hi> obſerves) is the reaſon why
thoſe that are born in cold Countries, when they
come under the Aequinoctial Line, are often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with fevers; becauſe that great heat that is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49419:9"/>
there excited in the Body by the outward air, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exhale through the too thick Skin, but being
retained induces a preternatural heat, and ſo a
fever.</p>
                  <p>The pores will appear in the Skin in the winter
time, it being bared; for where they are, the
<hi>cuticula</hi> will appear as a Gooſes Skin.</p>
                  <p>The Skin hath an action,<note place="margin">Its action.</note> to wit, the ſenſe of
feeling.</p>
                  <p>Its uſe is,<note place="margin">Its uſes.</note> firſt, to cloath the whole Body, and
defend it from injuries. Secondly, to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
vent or emunctory to the Body, by which all
its exhalations may fitly tranſpire. Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be done onely through its pores, as moſt
Anatomiſts have affirmed; or alſo through its
very ſubſtance, as Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> has of late aſſerted,
is a controverſie hardly worth the inſiſting on.</p>
                  <p>In the next place appears the <hi>fat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Fat.</note> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
taken to be ſomething diſtinct from the
<hi>membrana carnoſa</hi> that lies under it; but is indeed
onely a part of it: for in its outer part it is full
of membranous cells, which are fill'd with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh
fat. But however having noted this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
we ſhall ſpeak after the manner of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Anatomiſts, and conſider it as ſeparate,
and ſo define it to be <hi>an oleous humour of the Body
elevated by the moderate heat of the parts lying under
it, and concreted betwixt the carnous membrane and
the Skin in membranous cells.</hi> Now though in Men
this fat is immediately next to the Skin, yet in
Beaſts the <hi>membrana carnoſa</hi> comes between, and
is indeed muſculous, and ſo cloſe joyned to the
Skin that by the help of it they can (many of them)
move the Skin ſo as to ſhake off flies or any thing
that offends them: but it is not ſo in Men in any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49419:10"/>
place ſave the Fore-head, which therefore they
can move in like manner.</p>
                  <p>This Fat is properly called <hi>pinguedo,</hi> whereas
that of the Caul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is called <hi>ſevum,</hi> Suet or
Tallow. And they differ in this, that <hi>pinguedo</hi> is
eaſily melted, but not ſo eaſily congealed; but
<hi>ſevum</hi> is not eaſily melted, but is eaſily congealed.
Beſides, <hi>pinguedo</hi> is not brittle, but <hi>ſevum</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>The uſes of it are theſe:<note place="margin">Its uſes.</note> Firſt, it defendeth the
Body from the air; ſo Apothecaries, when they
mean to preſerve juices, pour oyl upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it preſerveth the natural heat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it furthereth beauty by filling up the
wrinkles of the Skin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the Muſcles it filleth up the empty
places, rendreth the motion thereof more glib
and eaſie, (ſo it do not abound too much) and
keepeth all the parts from drineſs, or breaking.
Hence it beſmears the extremities of the Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the joyntings of the greater Bones, and the
Veſſels that they may paſs ſafely.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in a ſpecial manner it helpeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of the Stomach; whence the Caul being
taken out, there follow <hi>flatus</hi> and belchings; and
in ſuch caſe it is neceſſary to fence the Stomach
extraordinarily with outward warmth.</p>
                  <p>

in Man; not that it is in him fleſhy, (but ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and ſo ſhould rather be called <hi>Nervea;)</hi>
but becauſe in Beaſts, which the Ancients uſed
moſt commonly to diſſect, it is endued with fleſhy
Fibres. In the birth it is red, but in thoſe of
ripe age white; in the Fore-head and Neck it is
more fleſhy. Within it is bedewed with a viſcous
humour, to further the motion of the Muſcles by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49419:10"/>
keeping the ſuperficies of them from deſiccation;
which otherwiſe might fall out by reaſon of their
motion. It is of an exquiſite ſenſe, wherefore
when it is pricked with ſharp humours, it cauſeth
ſhiverings, ſuch as are felt in the beginning of
Ague-fits.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it preſerveth the heat of the internal
parts.<note place="margin">Its uſes.</note> Secondly, it furthereth the gathering of
the fat. Thirdly, it ſtrengtheneth the Veſſels
which paſs between it and the Skin.</p>
                  <p>In the next place (according to the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Anatomiſts) we ſhould come to ſpeak of
the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> with their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,

to treat of the Muſcles of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

name the Muſcles of the lower Belly here, as they
appear one after another to the diſſector. And
firſt there ſhew themſelves the obliquely deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or inmoſt coat of the Belly
(derived <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from its office of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing)
is tied above to the Midriff, below
to the Share and Flank-bones; in the fore-part
firmly to the tranſverſe Muſcles, but chiefly to
their Tendons about the <hi>Linea alba;</hi> behind to
the fleſhly heads of theſe Muſcles looſely. The end
of this firm connexion is to preſs equally the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the expulſion of the Ordure, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.
If this connexion had not been, the
<hi>Peritonaeum</hi> would have become wrinkled, the
Muſcles being contracted. If it had not been
looſe tied to the fleſhly parts, the contraction of
them in the compreſſion of the Belly had been
hindred.</p>
                  <p>Its figure is oval; its ſubſtance is membranous;
the inner ſuperficies of it, which reſpects the
Guts, is ſmooth, equal and ſlippery, bedewed
with a kind of watery humour contained in the
<hi>Abdomen:</hi> but the outer ſuperficies, whereby it
cleaves to the Muſcles of the lower Belly, is
rough and unequal.</p>
                  <p>As for the origine of it, <hi>Fallopius</hi> will have it
to proceed from that ſtrong <hi>plexus</hi> of Nerves,
from whence the <hi>Meſenterium</hi> is ſaid to have its

will have it to be framed of thoſe Nerves which
ſpring out of the <hi>ſpinalis medulla,</hi> about the firſt
and third <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins. But <hi>Fallopius</hi>'s
opinion ſeems the moſt probable; for there it
cannot be ſeparated without tearing, and is very
thick.</p>
                  <p>It is double every where, but appears ſo to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49419:11"/>
chiefly about the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the duplications lie the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> the <hi>Aorta</hi>
and the Kidneys. In the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> two Tunicles
are alſo apparently ſeen, between which the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Matrix lie. The umbilical Veſſels alſo are
placed in the duplicature of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> that
they may march the more ſafely. <hi>Above,</hi> where it
is tied to the Midriff, it has three <hi>faramina</hi> or holes;
the firſt on the right ſide, whereby the aſcending
trunk of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> paſſes; the ſecond on the
left ſide, for the Gullet (with the Nerves inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the mouth of the Stomach) to deſcend
by; the third, by which the great Artery or
<hi>Aorta,</hi> and the Nerve of the ſixth pair may paſs.
<hi>Below,</hi> it has paſſages for the ſtrait Gut, for the
neck of the Bladder, and in Women for the neck
of the Womb; alſo for the Veins, Arteries and
Nerves that paſs down to the Thighs. <hi>Before,</hi> in
the <hi>foetus</hi> for the umbilical Veſſels and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the moſt remarkable are its two <hi>proceſſes,</hi>
placed before near the <hi>os pubis,</hi> on each ſide one.
They are certain oblong productions of its outer
Membrane paſſing through the holes of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of the oblique and tranſverſe Muſcles, and
depending into the Cod, there beſtowing one
Tunicle on the Stones. There are alſo two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
in Women, but they reach onely to the <hi>ingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
or Groins, and terminate in the upper part of
the Privity or the fat of <hi>mons Veneris.</hi> The inner
Membrane of the <hi>peritonaeum</hi> (in Men) reaches
but to the very holes, which it makes very ſtrait;
but being either relaxed or broken, the outer
gives way, and ſo there follows a rupture, either
the Caul, or the Guts, or both deſcending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
By the holes of the proceſſes there deſcend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49419:12"/>
in Men the Veſſels preparing the ſeed, and the
Muſcles called <hi>cremaſteres,</hi> and by them aſcend the
Veſſels bringing back the ſeed. In Women there
paſs by them the round ligaments of the Womb,
which after growing ſomewhat broadiſh, are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the <hi>clitoris,</hi> or elſe terminate in the fat of
<hi>Mons Veneris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>peritonaeum</hi> is thickeſt below the Navel, for
that when one either ſits or ſtands, his Inteſtines
bear down heavy on that part, ſo that unleſs it
were there ſtronger than ordinary, it would be
in danger of breaking. In Women with child
alſo, it is very much extended in this region. And

                  <p>The principal efficient cauſes of <hi>ſanguification,</hi>
have been held to be the Liver and Spleen, and
the other parts to be adjuvant cauſes. But ſince

this Artery, (as ſoon as it paſſes out of

into two branches, the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left.</hi>
The <hi>right</hi> being joyned to the <hi>vena porta</hi> in the

the ligaments of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck and
Breaſt upon which it reſteth. The ſecond is the
middlemoſt, and it is fleſhy and thick, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of two ranks of fleſhy Fibres, (what Fibres
are ſee B. 5. ch. 1.) which aſcend and deſcend ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
and do mutually decuſſate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This hath been held by many (not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably)
to be a kind of Muſcle, becauſe it is
ſometimes affected with Convulſions and Palſies.
The third is the innermoſt, and it is membranous;

and hath onely ſmall and ſtraight Fibres. It is
continued to that Membrane that covereth the

which it toucheth; wherefore if it be too full it
cauſeth a difficulty of breathing, by hindring the
motion of it. In the forepart on the right ſide,
it is covered with the hollow part of the Liver;

Near the orifices and towards the bottom

the ſtraight are moſt conſpicuous and plentifull.</p>
                  <p>It is ſomething wrinkled, and its inner ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

                  <p>They are knit together by the Meſentery,<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> by

being ſeparated from the thicker maſs, might be

                  <p>They have two <hi>proper.</hi> The outer, being the
middle of the three, is carnous. It has two
ranks of moving Fibres, one lying under the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
The firſt and inner rank is annular or
tranſverſe, which encompaſſing the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
of all the Inteſtines in very cloſe order, is
inſerted into the hem or ſeam of the Meſentery as
into its Tendon. The other rank is of ſtreight
Fibres, which being ſpread above the former,
and cutting them at right angles, reach along
the whole length of the Inteſtines; and their
Tendon ſeems to be the outmoſt coat, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49419:22"/>
wholly nervous, or as it were tendinous, is
rolled about the whole rank of theſe Fibres.</p>
                  <p>The innermoſt is nervous, although it ſeem to
be fleſhy, by reaſon of the cruſty ſubſtance with
which it is lined, which is framed of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the third concoction of the Guts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
This lining is called by <hi>Pecquet</hi> a ſpongy
<hi>periſtoma,</hi> by <hi>Bilſius</hi> a woolly <hi>moſs;</hi> it ſerves as a
Filtre for the Chyle to tranſcolate through in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to its entrance into the <hi>venae lacteae;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it hindreth excoriation, which might be
cauſed when ſharp humours paſs through the
Guts. Some (as particularly Dr. <hi>Willis)</hi> take
it for a diſtinct coat, and call it <hi>glandulo ſatunica</hi> or
<hi>villoſa;</hi> but I think 'tis only an <hi>epiphyſis</hi> or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
upon the other, cauſed as aboveſaid.</p>
                  <p>This Membrane in the ſmall Guts, eſpecially
the <hi>ileum,</hi> is full of wrinkles, to ſtay the <hi>chylus</hi>
from paſſing too ſoon; which wrinkles are cauſed,
for that this inmoſt coat if it be ſever'd from the
other and the wrinkles ſtretcht open, will be (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Fallopius</hi>'s obſervation) thrice as long
as it. And the ſame Membrane is expanded in
the <hi>Colon</hi> into little cells, for the ſlower paſſing

                  <p>The uſe of theſe Veins inſerted into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines
the Ancients thought to be, both to carry
venal bloud to them for their nouriſhment, and
alſo to receive the chyle out of them and carry it
to the Liver there to be turn'd into bloud. As to
the firſt uſe, 'tis certain (by the circulation of
the bloud) that theſe Veins carry nothing to the
Guts; but the bloud in them, is all received
from the Arteries there, to be carried back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Liver and ſo to the Heart: but as to
the latter, there are ſome learned Anatomiſts
that ſtill think, though the greateſt part of the
chyle is received by the <hi>venae lacteae,</hi> yet that
ſome part is ſuckt in by theſe Veins, ſo to be more
readily convey'd into the maſs of bloud. But
this opinion is exploded by others as learned and
more numerous, who deny any ſuch office to
them, whom I believe to be in the right. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe ſanguineous Veins there are another
ſort of Veins inſerted (more or fewer) into all
the Guts, called <hi>Lacteal,</hi> but of them we will treat
in a diſtinct Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The Arteries ſpring partly from <hi>ramus coeliacus
inteſtinalis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arteries.</note> partly from both the <hi>meſentericae.</hi> To

the <hi>duodenum,</hi> and the begining of <hi>jejunum,</hi> a

the right part of <hi>colon, meſentericus ſuperior;</hi> to

the <hi>rectum</hi> to the <hi>podex,</hi> makes the <hi>internal

laſt, <hi>epiplois poſtica,</hi> which riſeth from the lower
part of <hi>arteria ſplenica,</hi> which is the left branch
of <hi>arteria coeliaca,</hi> is ſent to the middle part of

uſe is to convey nouriſhment and warmth to the
Guts; and when the Body is morboſe, to carry
thither the impurities of the bloud, upon a purge
taken, or critically, ſo to paſs out by ſtool.</p>
                  <p>Nerves they have from the inferiour ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                  <p>The ſecond is called <hi>jejunum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> or the hungry Gut;
for it is for the moſt part found empty; partly
by reaſon of the multitude of milky Veins that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it; partly by reaſon of the fermentation of
the acrimonious choler with the pancreatick
juice, which are both poured in juſt before its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
In length it is twelve hand-breadths
and three inches. It beginneth on the right ſide,
under the <hi>colon,</hi> where the <hi>duodenum</hi> endeth, and
the Guts begin to be wreathed; and filling almoſt
the whole umbilical region, eſpecially on the left
ſide, it tendeth into the <hi>ileum,</hi> from which it
may be diſtinguiſht firſt by its emptineſs; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
by its greater number of Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
from which it looks reddiſh; thirdly from
the nearneſs of the folds or wrinkles of its inmoſt
coat one to another, which are but about half an

it is the narroweſt of all, for it is not an inch in

from the <hi>colon,</hi> for it is not joyn'd to it by a

<hi>caecum</hi> are ſo united as to make one continued ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
whoſe lower ſide the <hi>ileon</hi> aſcending pierceth,

                  <p>This <hi>ileum</hi> oft falls down into the Cod, whence
ſuch a rupture is called Inteſtinal. And in this
Gut happens the diſtemper called <hi>Volvulus</hi> or <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aca

dungy excrement. This diſtemper is cauſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
either when one part intrudes into another,

when it is ſtufft with ſome matter that obſtructs

but half as long as your larger earth-worms
ſtretched out at length; but its mouth that opens

Apes have it larger than a Man, Dogs

being ſo very ſmall and commonly empty. But
in grown <hi>foetus</hi>'s or Infants new born it is full of
excrement, for which it ſerves as a ſtore-houſe
till after the birth that they go to ſtool. And in
ſuch Animals as have it large, (according to
Dr <hi>Gliſſon)</hi> it ſerves for a bag or ſecond Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
wherein the prepared aliments may be

from the <hi>ileum,</hi> but directly from the <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi>
It ariſeth at the <hi>os ileum</hi> on the right ſide,
and aſcending by its Spine it arrives at the right
Kidney; to which parts it is annex'd by a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
connexion. From thence bending left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
it creeps under the Liver by the Gali-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(which tinges it there a little yellowiſh) to
the bottom of the Stomach; to the whole length
whereof it is tied, only the Caul coming between,
(as alſo to the <hi>pancreas</hi> and Loins.) Then it
comes to the lower part of the Spleen, and is knit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49419:25"/>
to it. Then touching the left Kidney, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
firmly to it by Fibres, it comes to the left
<hi>os ileum;</hi> from which deſcending by the left
Groin to the <hi>pelvis</hi> it embraceth the bottom of
the Bladder behind on each ſide. Afterwards it
aſcends upwards by the right Groin near the place
from whence it firſt took its riſe; and thence
marching back again towards the left ſide, and
running it ſelf in betwixt the <hi>ileum</hi> and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
it reaches to the top of <hi>os ſacrum,</hi> and there
unloads it ſelf into the <hi>rectum.</hi> Its length accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> is about ſeven feet; others
reckon it ſhorter. It goeth almoſt quite about
the <hi>abdomen</hi> next to the Muſcles, that it may be
the better compreſſed by them for avoidance of
the excrements. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> has an ingenious
reaſon why it ſhould paſs under the Stomach,
<hi>viz.</hi> That as Chymiſts judge no digeſtion more
natural than that which is performed by the heat
of dung, ſo the heat of the excrements in the
<hi>colon</hi> does help the coction of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>It hath cells which ſpring from the internal
Tunicle of it: Theſe cells are kept in their figure
by a Ligament half an inch broad, which paſſeth
through the upper and middle part of it all along;
this being broken or diſſolved, the cells ſtretch
out and appear no more. Their <hi>uſe</hi> is to hinder
the flowing of the excrements into one place,
which would compreſs the parts adjacent; as alſo
for the ſlower paſſage of the <hi>faeces,</hi> that we may
not have a continual and haſty need of going to
ſtool. On its outſide from its paſſing by the
Spleen to its joyning to the <hi>rectum</hi> it has a great
many fatty knots, which ſerve to moiſten and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate
it, that the <hi>faeces</hi> may paſs the more glibly.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49419:26"/>
The <hi>rectum</hi> alſo has ſuch like, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>It hath a valve where it is joyned with <hi>ilium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its valve.</note> (as
was noted before) like to the <hi>ſigmoides</hi> in the <hi>ſinus</hi>

ſo ſtoppeth the hole which is common to the <hi>ileon</hi>
and <hi>colon,</hi> that flatuoſities cannot aſcend to the <hi>ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
much leſs excrements regurgitate. If one would
find this out, let him pour water into the <hi>inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
rectum,</hi> and hold up the Guts: The water will
ſtay when it comes to the valve, if it be ſound.
If this valve be relaxed or torn by any means, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
may regurgitate, and be expelled by
vomit, and clyſters alſo aſcend up to the Stomach,
as hath often happened in the Iliacal paſſion.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>inteſtinum rectum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Rectum.</note> the ſtreight

and is faſt tied on its <hi>back-ſide</hi> to both by the <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi>
to keep it from falling out; and on its
<hi>fore-ſide</hi> it grows in <hi>men</hi> to the neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whence in the pain of the Stone there, there
often happens a <hi>teneſmus</hi> or continual inclination
to go to ſtool; and in <hi>women</hi> to the neck of the
Womb: but in both there is a muſculous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that comes between. It is a ſpan in length,

thicker. The Muſcle <gap reason="foreign">

which encompaſſing it round, purſes it up cloſe,
ſo that nothing can paſs out, unleſs it be relaxed
voluntarily. This Gut (eſpecially its inner
Membrane) uſually bags a little out in ſtraining
at ſtool, yea ſometimes ſo much, that it requires
an artificial putting up again.</p>

of a pellucid and cryſtallin colour, like <hi>hydatides,</hi>
conſiſting of a tranſparent and moſt thin skin,
which being broken and the <hi>lympha</hi> flowing out,
utterly diſappears. Their number cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,
for they are almoſt innumerable. As to
their riſe <hi>Bartholin</hi> ſpeaks uncertainly, but <hi>Steno</hi>
and <hi>Malpighius</hi> both declare that they always
proceed from Glands. As to their inſertion or
ending, thoſe under the Midriff do diſcharge their
liquor into the <hi>receptaculum chyli</hi> (to be ſpoken
of in the next Chapter.) Thoſe in the <hi>thorax,</hi>
immediately into the <hi>thoracick duct.</hi> And thoſe of
the Neck, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the <hi>jugular</hi> vein. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholin</hi>
thought they all diſcharg'd themſelves into
theſe three channels: but <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> affirms
they open alſo into many other Veins; and
quotes <hi>Steno</hi> noting that they empty themſelves
into the jugular and other Veins; and alſo his
Countryman <hi>Frederick Ruyſch</hi> writing that by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature
and ſtructure of the Valves he has plainly
ſeen, that all the lympheducts in the Lungs do
diſcharge their <hi>lympha</hi> into the ſubclavian, axillar
and jugular Veins. There has been much diſpute
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49419:29"/>
what this <hi>lympha</hi> which they carry, is. <hi>Bartholin</hi>
thinks it to be the ſimple ſuperfluous <hi>ſerum</hi> of
each part, brought thither by the Arteries.
<hi>Gliſſon,</hi> that it is a liquor condens'd from the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus</hi>
of the bloud (like dew) driven into theſe
Veſſels, and flowing back with the vehicle of the
aliment brought by the Nerves. <hi>Segerus</hi> (and
<hi>Sylvius)</hi> that it is the animal ſpirits, or is made
of them, which after they are diſtributed into all
parts by the Nerves, are there partly conſum'd
and diſſipated, and are partly condens'd into this
water. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> quotes more opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe, but rejects them all, and eſtabliſheth
this of his own: <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a fermentaceous
liquor ſeparated from the ſerous part of the bloud
in the conglobate Glands, yet not ſimple, but
impregnated with much fus'd and volatile ſalt,
and alſo with ſome ſulphureous particles; which
when it is conveyed to the <hi>vaſa chylifera,</hi> makes
the chyle thinner, and apt to dilate eaſily in the
Heart; and when to the <hi>Veins,</hi> prepares the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
bloud (now too thick) for a quick dilatation
in the Heart.] This <hi>lympha,</hi> whatever it be,
(or be for) differs from the <hi>ſerum;</hi> for if one
gather a little of it in a ſpoon, and let it ſtand,
without ſetting it on the fire, it will turn to a
gelly, which the <hi>ſerum</hi> will not doe. And thus
much of the <hi>Lympheducts</hi> (with their <hi>lympha)</hi>
in general; as to thoſe particularly of the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
ſome only paſs through it from other
parts, as the Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but many have their riſe
in it, and both the one and other are emptied
into the <hi>receptaculum chyli.</hi>

                  <p>It hath many little ſoftiſh Glands fix'd in its

ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter, when we come
to treat of the paſſage of the Lacteals. We will
only note here, that when theſe Glands grow
ſcirrhous, or are any ways obſtructed, ſo that
the Chyle cannot tranſcolate through them, there
follows a <hi>fluxus coeliacus,</hi> or <hi>chyloſus,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing

not to mention that in Dogs, Cats, and ſuch like
Animals this part is very thin and tranſparent,

in very lean Men there is but little, though in fat

when <hi>Caſpar Aſellius</hi> found them out in diſſecting
a Live-dog well fed. But ſince him many others
have made a more accurate diſcovery of them.
They are ſlender pellucid Veſſels, having but a
ſingle Coat, diſperſed through the Meſentery,
infinite in number, appointed for the carrying
of the Chyle.</p>
                  <p>They ſpring out of the Inteſtins,<note place="margin">Riſe.</note> into whoſe

of theſe veſſels. Preſently after their riſe they
aim to that neareſt part of the Meſentery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Inteſtin from which they ariſe, is knit.
Then they go the readieſt way to ſuch Glandules
of the Meſentery as are neareſt to them: but in

their paſſage ſometimes many little branches
meeting grow into one great trunk; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they inſinuate themſelves into the Gland, to
which we ſaid they were going. But in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
entrance into the Glands, or a little before,
this trunk ſeparates again into new branches,
more and ſmaller than the other, which are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
in the very ſubſtance of the Gland. Out
of the Gland there ſpring again new capillary
Veins, which by and by meeting together make
one trunk again as before: which being carried
towards the beginning of the Meſentery, in their
march joyn to themſelves others of the ſame kind
meeting them, and ſo grow larger and larger,
and at laſt very many enter into the great or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Gland of the Meſentery (called improperly
<hi>Pancreas)</hi> in the ſame manner as they enter'd the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bartholin</hi> ſays that behind the great Gland

                  </p>
                  <p>This common Receptacle is called <hi>Receptacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum

found both it and the <hi>ductus Thoracicus</hi> (whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

the Coeliack artery and Emulgents at the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi>

thought it beſt to ſpeak of the Gullet, which is
an appendage to it, and by which the meat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends

marches further upward under the great Artery
till about the fifth or ſixth <hi>vertebra</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi>

Arteries and Veins, under the <hi>Pleura</hi> and
gland <hi>Thymus,</hi> it aſcends to the left ſubclavian
Vein, into whoſe lower ſide it opens, juſt there
where the left Jugular Vein enters into it on the
upper ſide, ſo that their Mouths face one another.
But it opens not into this Vein with any large ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but by ſix or ſeven little ones, being all cover'd
together in the interior Cavity of the <hi>Subclavia</hi>
with one broad valve, looking towards the <hi>Cava</hi>
from the Shoulder, whereby there is granted to
the Chyle and <hi>Lympha</hi> a free paſſage out of the
<hi>ductus Chyliferus</hi> into the <hi>Subclavia,</hi> but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
(or of Bloud with them) out of the Vein into
the Duct is prevented. This Duct ending thus
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49419:32"/>
in the ſubclavian Vein, the Chyle that it conveys
into it paſſes with the Bloud (returning by the
<hi>Cava)</hi> into the right ventricle of the Heart,
where we will leave it, and return to the <hi>Venae
lacteae</hi> again; having only obſerved, that this
Duct has many Valves that hinder the aſcending
Chyle and <hi>Lympha</hi> from returning down again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which Valves are manifeſt by this, that the
Chyle contained in the Duct may eaſily by the
ſinger be preſſed upwards, but by no means down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
or if one make a hole in it, the liquor
tending from beneath upwards will flow out at it,
but that which is above it, is ſo ſtopt by the Valves,
that it cannot be made to deſcend by it. And
now for the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> of the Meſentery.</p>
                  <p>They differ from the ordinary meſaraical Veins,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Venae lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teae</hi> and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meſara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Veins.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in bigneſs; for theſe are bigger, but
thoſe are more in number; for they are more
than twice as many: for more <hi>Chylus</hi> muſt paſs
by them, the way that has been ſpoken, to make
Bloud of, for the nouriſhment of the whole Body,
than there can be Bloud remaining from the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of the Inteſtins only to return by the
Meſaraicks to the Liver.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they differ in colour, by reaſon of
the great difference in colour of their contained
liquors. The Lacteals are white and limpid by
reaſon of the whiteneſs and clearneſs of the Chyle
which they contain; but the ſanguinary Veins are
of a dusky blackiſh colour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they differ in their inſertion; for the
Lacteals, as has been ſaid, are inſerted into the
great gland of the Meſentery called <hi>Pancreas,</hi> but
the Meſaraicks all terminate in the Liver.</p>
                  <p>They have a pretty many Valves, but not ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49419:32"/>
many as the <hi>ductus Thoracicus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Valves.</note> They may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the ſame ways as we intimated thoſe of

but if one preſs them from the Gland to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Inteſtins, the Chyle will ſtop and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <p>That the Ancients did not find out theſe Veins,<note place="margin">Why the Ancients did not find theſe out.</note>
the cauſe was, either becauſe they only diſſected

                  <p>THE Liver is ſeated in the upper and chief
place of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> namely about a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth diſtance from under the Midriff, in
the right Hypochondre, (under the ſhort Ribs)
which, being of a great bulk, it even fills, and
reaches from thence towards the left ſide, a little
beyond the <hi>Cartilago enſiformis,</hi> or pit of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
Its upper part is convex or round and
ſmooth, the lower ſide is hollow, lying on the
right ſide of the Stomach and <hi>Pylorus,</hi> &amp;c. Its
lower edge reaches below the ſhort Ribs (in a
healthfull Man when he ſtands upright) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the very Navel.</p>
                  <p>In Dogs and many other Brutes it is divided
into divers Lobes,<note place="margin">Lobes.</note> but in Man it is continuous;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49419:33"/>
only there is a little protuberance in its hollow
ſide, whereby it is tied to the Caul, which <hi>Spige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
called a Lobe, and from him others, but it is
improperly called ſo, and not at all like the
Lobes in the Livers of Brutes.</p>
                  <p>It has three Ligaments (properly ſo called)
which according to Dr. <hi>Gliſſon (de Hepate)</hi> are
theſe.<note place="margin">Ligaments.</note> The firſt is called <hi>Suſpenſorium,</hi> for it ties
up the Liver to the Diaphragm; it is broad,
membranous and ſtrong, ariſing from the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>erito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi>
and is not only fixed to the outer membrane
of the Liver, but does indeed make it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
even into it, and is ſtrongly faſtned to the
common ſheath or <hi>involucrum</hi> of the <hi>Vena cava</hi>
(there where the umbilical Vein is continuous to
it.) By this ſtrong inſertion it is the more able
to bear up the great weight of the Liver.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Vena umbilicalis,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the birth, cloſes up and hardens into a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is directly oppoſite to the former. It
paſſes out of the fiſſure of the Liver and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in the Navel. By this the Liver is kept
from aſcending upon the motion of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm
upwards in reſpiration.</p>
                  <p>The third is that whereby the Liver adheres to
the <hi>Cartilago enſiformis.</hi> This is thin and flaccid,
but yet ſtrong, broad and doubled, ariſing from
that Membrane wherewith the Liver is encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
(according to <hi>Spigelius)</hi> of which it is a
duplicature (according to Dr. <hi>Gliſſon.)</hi> This
hinders it from fluctuating to one or t'other ſide,
or towards the Back.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe three Ligaments, it has ſeveral
other connexions to the neighbouring parts, but
they would improperly be called Ligaments.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49419:33"/>
Thus it is connected to the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and <hi>Porta,</hi>
to the Caul, and to ſeveral other parts either
mediately or immediately.</p>
                  <p>It is covered with a very thin Membrane,<note place="margin">Its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</note> which
ſpringeth from the firſt Ligament, (as was ſaid
before) which cleaveth firmly to the ſubſtance
of the Liver. If it be ſeparate at any time by a

water falleth into the cavity of the Belly, and
cauſeth that kind of Dropſie called <hi>Aſcites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its ſubſtance or <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is red and ſoft,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like concreted bloud, and may, when it is
boiled, be eaſily ſcrap'd or bruſht off the veſſels.
But though its <hi>Parenchyma</hi> look red, that is only
from the great quantity of bloud that is poured
into it from the <hi>Vena portae:</hi> for its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is pale, a little yellowiſh, ſuch as the Liver
is of when 'tis boil'd; and yet that yellowiſhneſs
ſeems to be cauſed by the Bile paſſing through it;
ſo that <hi>Malpighius</hi> thinks white to be its proper
colour, and gives a far different account of its
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> from others, whoſe obſervations by
the Microſcope <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> thus repreſents (out
of <hi>Malpig. lib. de Hepate, cap. 2.)</hi> 
                     <q>That 1. The
ſubſtance of the Liver in Man is framed of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,
and theſe are compounded of little
Glands like the ſtones of Raiſins, which look
like bunches of Grapes, and are cloathed with
a proper circumambient Membrane—2. That
the whole bulk of the Liver conſiſts of theſe
little grape-ſtone-like Glands and divers ſorts
of Veſſels; and hence, that they may perform
together a common work, it is neceſſary that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49419:34"/>
there be a commerce betwixt theſe Glands and
Veſſels. 3. That the little branches of the
veſſels of the <hi>Porta, Cava,</hi> and <hi>Porus bilarius,</hi>
do run through all even the leaſt Lobules in an
equal number; that the branches of the <hi>Porta</hi>
do the office of Arteries, and that the <hi>Porta</hi>
has ſo great ſociety with the <hi>Porus bilarius,</hi>
that both their twigs are ſtraitly tied together
in the ſame cover. 4. That the ſhoots of the
ſaid Veſſels are not joyned by Anaſtomoſes, but
that the grape-ſtone-like Glandules, making
the chief ſubſtance of the Liver, are a medium

From theſe obſervations he concludes the Liver
to be a conglomerate Gland, ſeparating the
Bile—and becauſe it is uſual for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerate
Glands to have, beſides Arteries,
Veins and Nerves, a proper excretory Veſſel
(as in the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> &amp;c.) diſperſed through
their ſubſtance, and drawing out and carrying
away the humour deſigned for them, this kind
of Veſſel in the Liver is the <hi>Porus bilarius</hi> with
the Gall-bladder.]</q> And this is a very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
account of it.</p>
                  <p>It hath two ſorts of Veins.<note place="margin">Veins.</note> In its upper part
the <hi>Vena cava</hi> entreth into it, and ſpreads it ſelf
all through it in the lower as well as upper part.
Into the lower ſide the <hi>Vena porta</hi> is inſerted,
whoſe branches likewiſe run through its whole
<hi>Parenchyma.</hi> Of both theſe Veins more fully in
the two following Chapters.</p>
                  <p>It has but very ſmall and few Arteries,<note place="margin">Arteries.</note> for the
<hi>Porta</hi> ſerves it for an Artery, bringing bloud to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49419:34"/>
it. Thoſe which it has, do all ariſe from the
right branch of the <hi>Arteria coeliaca,</hi> (called <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patica)</hi>
there where it is joyned to the <hi>Vena por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi>
whence being ſuſtained by the coat of the
Caul it aſcends to the hollow of the Liver juſt by
the <hi>Porta,</hi> on whoſe coat, with the bilary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and the membrane of the Liver, it is wholly
ſpent. For as was ſaid, the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by the bloud brought by the <hi>Porta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has Nerves from the Intercoſtal pair,<note place="margin">Nerves.</note> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one from the ſtomachical branch thereof, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the meſenterical (called <hi>hepaticus.)</hi> But
the Nerves are extended only to the Membrane
and veſſels of the Liver, (as the Arteries were) ſo
that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> has but a very dull ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Till the <hi>ductus Thoracicus Chyliferus</hi> was found
out,<note place="margin">Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts.</note> it was ſtill believed that the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> were
inſerted into the Liver, which was looked upon
as the great organ of ſanguification; but now
'tis known for certain that no <hi>Lacteae</hi> at all go to
the Liver, but that thoſe veſſels which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for ſuch, are Lymphatick veſſels carrying
from it a moſt lympid and pellucid juice. That
they are diſperſed in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver,
has not yet been obſerved; but it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they ariſe from its Glands, and coming
out of its hollow or lower ſide, with the <hi>Porta,</hi>
they encompaſs it round as alſo the <hi>ductus Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
paſſing moſtly towards the Meſentery; and

knit to the Stomach and <hi>Duodenum)</hi> a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do paſs over a certain Gland (ſometimes two

adhering to it, and from thence with many others
paſſed by the Gland, they open themſelves into
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49419:35"/>
the <hi>receptaculum Chyli.</hi> That theſe veſſels bring
nothing to the Liver, and ſo cannot be Lacteals,
is apparent; for if in a Live-creature you make a
Ligature betwixt the Stomach and Liver, in that
part of the Meſentery that knits the Liver to the
Stomach and Inteſtins (in which Ligature let
the <hi>Vena portae</hi> and <hi>ductus Communis</hi> be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
theſe veſſels will preſently ſwell betwixt the
Ligature and the Liver, but be empty on that
ſide towards the <hi>receptaculum Chyli;</hi> and the ſame
is evident from their Valves alſo which open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſaid Receptacle, but hinder any thing
from coming back from thence to the Liver.</p>
                  <p>Concerning theſe we ſhall forbear to ſpeak here,<note place="margin">The bilary Veſſels.</note>

appear hereafter. But from <hi>Galen</hi> downwards it
was generally held that the Meſaraick Veins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Chyle from the Guts and brought it to
the Liver, where it was turned into Bloud, and
carried from thence into all the parts of the Body
by the Veins. Yea and after the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> were
found out, they would needs have them to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in it, thinking it the ſitteſt Bowel for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification,
and preſuming that that task muſt be
performed by ſome or other. It would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
here to ſtand to confute theſe opinions, now
that all the world is convinc'd of their falſity,
and by what hath been already ſaid they may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
appear to be erroneous, no Chyle at all
coming to the Liver. How and where ſanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is performed, we ſhall ſhew when we come to
the Heart, and here we ſhall declare the true uſe of
the Liver.</p>

The Liver then being diſcharged from ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,<note place="margin">The action of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note>
it ſerves to ſeparate the Bile from the

Concerning the nature of this Bile there have
been divers opinions. The Ancients (amongſt
whom was <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> thought it to be a meer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement,
and to be of no other uſe than by its
acrimony to promote the excretion of the Guts.
And this opinion prevail'd ſo long as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that the Liver had a nobler action than to
tranſcolate this Choler. But now it being found
out that it has no other office, it is believ'd that
ſo bulky a Bowel was never made for the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>meer excrement,</hi> and therefore they think
it to be a <hi>ferment</hi> for the Chyle and Bloud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
if they were not attenuated and prepared,
they could not be enſpirited in the Heart. This
new doctrine I ſhall give entirely out of <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck,

                     <q>The venous Bloud flowing into
the Liver by the <hi>Porta</hi> out of the Gaſtrick and
Meſaraick veins (and may be a little by the
Hepatick artery) is mixed with an acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſaltiſh and ſubacid juice, made in the
ſpleen of the arterious bloud flowing thither by
the Arteries, and of the animal ſpirits by the
Nerves, which is brought into the <hi>Porta</hi> by the
<hi>ramus Splenicus.</hi> Now both theſe being entred
the Liver by the branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> by
means of this ſaid acrimonious and acid juice,
and the ſpecifick virtue or coction of the Liver,
the ſpirituous particles, both ſulphureous and
ſalt, lying hid in the ſaid venous bloud, are
diſſolved, attenuated, and become alſo a little
acrimonious and fermenting; a certain thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
part whereof, like moſt clear water, being
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49419:36"/>
ſeparated from the other thicker maſs of the
Bloud by means of the conglobated Glands,
plac'd moſtly in the hollow ſide of the Liver, is
carried from thence by many Lympheducts, as
has been ſaid. But the fermentaceous ſpirits
of greater acrimony, mixed with the thicker
and more viſcid ſulphureous juices (for Sulphur
is viſcid) and more ſtrongly boiling, whenas
through the clammineſs of the juices in which
they inhere, they cannot enter the conglobated
Glands nor from them the Lympheducts, and
through their fierce ebullition are ſeparated
from the Bloud (as Yeſt from Beer) theſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaceous

it is preſently mixed with the pancreatick juice,

hence the milky juice contained in the maſs

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49419:36"/>
becauſe the fermentaceous ſpirits are a little
pall'd, the efferveſcency becomes ſlower and

they have fewer <hi>Venae lacteae.</hi> At length what

                  <p>Some think that the <hi>Vena umbilicalis</hi> ought to
be accounted its root or original,<note place="margin">Origine.</note> becauſe it is firſt
formed in the <hi>Foetus</hi> and inſerted into the <hi>Porta.</hi>
But this umbilical Vein after the birth ceaſing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49419:37"/>
from the office of a Vein, and degenerating into a
Ligament, though it might be accounted its root
then, it cannot properly now. Others think, that
becauſe its branches every where inſerted into the
Inteſtins bring bloud from thence to the Liver,
(and not <hi>vice verſa)</hi> therefore thoſe ought rather
to be accounted its roots, and its diviſions within
the Liver its branches. And indeed ſtrictly and
properly they ought to be accounted ſo, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we ſhall not think it abſurd to ſpeak with the
Ancients, who becauſe they thought the <hi>Porta</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
bloud from the Liver to the Guts for their
nouriſhment, ſuppos'd the Liver to be its root.</p>
                  <p>As it enters into the Liver, it is inveſted with
another Coat, which ſome call <hi>Vagina portae,</hi> its
Sheath, others <hi>Capſula,</hi> its Caſe, and <hi>Capſula
communis</hi> becauſe the <hi>Porus bilarius</hi> is involved in
it as well as the <hi>Porta.</hi> This outer Coat it has
from the membrane of the Liver, (as that is from
the <hi>Peritonaeum)</hi> that is, it is continued from it,
though it be of a clear other ſubſtance, namely
more denſe and carnous. It is inveſted with it in
all its ramifications, and ſo having a double Coat
is in that reſpect an Artery, as alſo in that it
brings bloud to the Liver for its nouriſhment as
well as for other uſes; and laſtly in that by means
of the <hi>Arteria hepatica</hi> inſerted into the <hi>Capſula</hi> it
has an obſcure pulſation (according to Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Gliſſon.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it is enter'd about half an inch into the
Liver,<note place="margin">Branchings in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> it is carried partly to the right hand,
partly to the left, and ſo is ſhap'd into a
<hi>Sinus</hi> as it were, and thence is divided into five
large branches, four whereof are diffuſ'd all over
the hollow ſide of the Liver, but the fifth aſcends
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49419:37"/>
ſtreight to its upper ſide where it diſperſes it ſelf.
And the ſaid <hi>Sinus</hi> is more conſpicuous in an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi>
becauſe the great influx of nutritious juice out
of the Umbilical vein enlarges it much. Moreover
in an <hi>Embryo</hi> you may eaſily ſee the <hi>Tubulus</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis
venoſus</hi> paſſing directly out of this <hi>Sinus</hi> into
the <hi>Cava</hi> (almoſt oppoſite to the mouth of the

ſame ſubſtance and texture with a Vein, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the <hi>Cava</hi> juſt where it is knit to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm;
and there alſo two other great branches
out of the Liver are inſerted into the <hi>Cava;</hi> and in
the ſame place this Pipe is alſo knit to the ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
Ligament ſpoken of before, and after the
Child is born grows it ſelf into a Ligament, being
in a manner oppoſite to the umbilical Ligament.
But to return to the diviſions of the <hi>Porta.</hi> The
Ancients taught that they were only ſpread in the
ſimous or hollow part of the Liver, but Dr. <hi>Gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
in his accurate Anatomy of it, affirms the
<hi>Porta</hi> to be diſperſed very equally in all its parts,
upper as well as lower. And whereas it has been
a conſtant doctrine, that the branches of the
<hi>Porta</hi> open by anaſtomoſes into thoſe of the <hi>Cava,</hi>
the ſame learned Author, and many others ſince
him, have obſerved that there are no ſuch anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſes
at all, but that the bloud doth ouze
through the glandulous <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver
out of the Capillary veins of the <hi>Porta</hi> into thoſe
of the <hi>Cava.</hi> He that would be fullier informed
hereof, may conſult his moſt accurate Book <hi>de
Hepate.</hi> But we will now paſs to the branches of
the <hi>Porta</hi> gone out of the Liver.</p>
                  <p>This Trunk parting a little from the Liver,<note place="margin">Its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note>
before it be ſevered into branches, puts forth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49419:38"/>
two twigs, out of its upper and fore-part, which
are inſerted into the <hi>Cyſtis fellea</hi> or Gall-bladder
(and are from thence called <hi>Cyſticae gemellae)</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the neck of it, and ſpread by innumerable
twigs, through the external coat of it.</p>
                  <p>A third twig alſo that is bigger, but lower,
ſpringeth from this ſame fore-part, yet towards
the right ſide, and is inſerted into the bottom of
the Stomach: from hence it ſendeth many ſprigs
toward the hinder-part of it, towards the Back.
This is called <hi>Gaſtrica dextra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ſent forth theſe three twigs, the
Trunk paſſeth down, and bending a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

branches; whereof the one is called <hi>ſiniſter,</hi> or

like a garland, is called <hi>Coronaria.</hi> From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

ſmall, and ſends twigs to the right ſide of the

annexed to it. This is called <hi>Epiplois,</hi> or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalis

                  <p>When the <hi>Ramus ſplenicus</hi> hath juſt approached
to the Spleen, it doth ſend out two other twigs,
the uppermoſt and the lowermoſt. The <hi>uppermoſt</hi>
is called <hi>vas breve,</hi> and is implanted into the left
part of the bottom of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>This Vein the Ancients believed to carry an
acid juice from the Spleen to the Stomach to ſtir
up appetite and to help the fermentation of the
meat; but it is certain both by Ligature (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it filleth towards the Stomach and emptieth
towards the Spleen) and alſo by the general
nature of Veins, whoſe ſmaller branches and
twigs ſtill receive the ſuperfluous arterial bloud
from the part whereinto they are inſerted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the larger chanels, and conduct it towards
the Heart; I ſay it is certain from hence, that
this ſame <hi>vas breve</hi> carries nothing to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
but only brings from thence into the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

                  <p>THE <hi>Vena cava</hi> is ſo called from its large
Cavity,<note place="margin">Its name.</note> being the moſt capacious of any
Vein of the whole Body; for into it as into a

(excepting the <hi>Pulmonaria)</hi> empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Both within and without the Liver it
hath but a ſingle Coat.</p>
                  <p>Its root may very properly be ſaid to be in the
Liver;<note place="margin">Its riſe.</note> for by its Capillaries it receives the
Bloud that is tranſcolated through the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the Liver from the Capillaries of the <hi>Porta,</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49419:40"/>
and by its aſcending trunk conveys it to the
Heart. Now theſe roots may in ſome regard be
commodiouſly enough alſo called branches;
for the roots of a Tree in the Earth, as well as
its boughs in the Air are ſpread into many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
only there is this difference, that roots
bring juice to the trunk, but boughs carry it from
the ſame. However we ſhall call them indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
roots or branches. The capillary bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
then of the <hi>Cava</hi> are ſpread through the
whole ſubſtance of the Liver, and not its upper
or gibbous part only, as has formerly been taught;
even as we ſaid before that the Capillaries of the
<hi>Porta</hi> were indifferently diſpers'd all over it.
Betwixt theſe Capillaries (much leſs betwixt
their larger branches) there are no inoſculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or anaſtomoſes, but thoſe of the <hi>Porta</hi> being
quite obliterated in the glandulous <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of
the Liver, theſe of the <hi>Cava</hi> ariſe out of the

of them meeting together make a twig, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
twigs in like manner concurring make a
branch, which ſtill proceeding further by the
acceſſion of new twigs and branches encreaſeth
its chanel, untill at length it diſchargeth it ſelf
into the <hi>Cava.</hi> And thus do all the roots of the
<hi>Cava</hi> in the Liver. Wherein they do not all
meet together in one common trunk as thoſe of
the <hi>Porta</hi> do, but empty themſelves apart into
the <hi>Cava</hi> without the Liver. And ſtill the further
diſtance the Capillaries have their origine from
the <hi>Cava,</hi> the larger their chanel comes to be at
their arrival towards it. The ſmaller twigs are
innumerable; the larger roots joyning immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

                  </p>
                  <p>The Choler is conveyed into the <hi>Veſica</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
very ſmall roots,<note place="margin">How the choler is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</note> diſperſed in the Liver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the branches of the <hi>Porta</hi> and <hi>Cava;</hi> they
are ſo very ſmall that they are ſcarcely diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but when they meet together, they make
one pretty notable Trunk which is inſerted into
the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> near its Neck, with a Valve before its
Mouth to hinder the regurgitation of the Choler.
(For in the Jaundice the Choler does not return
out of the Gall-bladder into the Bloud again, but
either for want of a convenient ferment it is not
ſeparated from the Bloud, or when the neck of
the <hi>Veſica</hi> is ſtopt that none can paſs out of it into
the Guts, then the Gall-bladder is preſently ſo
fill'd that it cannot receive any more; and ſo the
Choler being forc'd to ſtagnate in its roots, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in by the branches of the <hi>Cava,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
contaminates the whole maſs of Bloud.) But
though it be evident that the Choler is brought
into the <hi>Veſica</hi> by this Pipe, yet if one open the
Bladder to look for its Mouth in the Cavity, one
ſhall hardly find where it is; which is no wonder,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49419:43"/>
ſeeing it is ſo difficult to find the inſertions of
the Ureters into the urinary Bladder, which are
vaſtly larger than this. But Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> ſays,
that near its neck in the inſide, there is a little
ſpongy protuberance, into which this Trunk is
pretty plainly inſerted; and this protuberancy
is the ſame that we called before a Valve.</p>
                  <p>It has been taught by ſeveral Anatomiſts,<note place="margin">Its valves.</note> that
its Neck or <hi>Meatus</hi> has ſometimes two, ſometimes
three Valves to hinder the recourſe of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler:
but <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> profeſſes he could never
find any, but only that the egreſs of the <hi>Veſica</hi>
was very ſtrait, and its Neck wrinkled. Dr. <hi>Gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
declares alſo that he could never diſcover any
in it, but on the contrary, he has often with a
ſlight compreſſion of his fingers found, that the
Choler will fluctuate to and again, out of the
<hi>Cyſtis</hi> into the <hi>Meatus,</hi> and on the contrary, as
alſo out of the <hi>Meatus</hi> into the <hi>Ductus communis</hi>
and back again; ſo that he cannot believe there is
any thing of a Valve in the whole paſſage. But
one thing which he thinks has impos'd upon Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts,
is a certain fibrous Ring (or <hi>Sphincten</hi>
as it were) which is ſeated juſt at the end of the
Bladder and beginning of its Neck, which makes
the paſſage betwixt them exceeding ſtrait; but
this cannot be a Valve, becauſe as he obſerves the
Choler will go either way through it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Veſica fellea</hi> hath two Veins called <hi>Cyſtica

                     <note place="margin">Its veſſels.</note> which ſpring from the <hi>Porta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath ſprigs of Arteries proceeding from the

                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49419:43"/>
Many times ſtones are found in it,<note place="margin">Of the ſtones in it.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>The other paſſage which carrieth the thicker
ſort of Choler,<note place="margin">Porus bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius.</note> is called <hi>Porus bilarius,</hi> or <hi>Meatus
hepaticus,</hi> becauſe it paſſeth directly from the
Liver to the <hi>Ductus communis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within the Liver its Trunk and Branches are
inveſted with a double coat; its proper one,
which it retains without the Liver alſo, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is common to it with the <hi>Porta</hi> called
<hi>Capſula communis,</hi> which it has from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
of the Liver. In this common coat this
<hi>Porus</hi> and the <hi>Porta</hi> are ſo cloſely enwrapped that
you would take them but for one Veſſel, till you
either hold it up to the light, (which will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Veſſels of two colours in it) or very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly
rip up the <hi>Capſula,</hi> and ſo lay them open.
Its roots within the Liver are equally divided
with thoſe of the <hi>Porta</hi> every where, ſaving that
little ſpace where the roots of the <hi>Veſica</hi> are
ſpread, in the ſimous and right ſide of the Liver.
So that having ſpoken above of the diviſions of
the roots of the <hi>Porta,</hi> I ſhall refer the Reader
thither for theſe of the <hi>Porus.</hi> I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that they are far larger and more numerous
than thoſe of the <hi>Veſica,</hi> drawing Choler from
all the parts of the Liver (ſaving whither the
roots of the Bladder reach) and that more
thick and viſcous, yet leſs acrimonious.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Porus</hi> ſeems to be a more neceſſary part
than the <hi>Veſica;</hi> for many Creatures, as Harts,
Fallow-deer, the Sea-calf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thoſe which
have a whole Hoof, have no Gall-bladder, but
there is none that is deſtitute of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49419:44"/>
Without the Liver it is as wide again as the
<hi>Meatus cyſticus,</hi> with which it is joyned at two
inches diſtance from the Liver, and both make
the <hi>Ductus communis choledochus.</hi> It has no Valve
in its whole progreſs; only the <hi>Ductus communis,</hi>
where it enters the Inteſtin, having pierced the
outer coat, paſſes betwixt that and the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
about the twelfth part of an inch, and then
piercing that alſo marches down further betwixt
it and the innermoſt coat about half an inch, and
at laſt opens with a round mouth into the Inteſtin.
So that this oblique inſertion (as that of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter
into the urinary Bladder) ſerves inſtead of
a Valve to hinder any thing from regurgita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of the Gut into this Duct, eſpecially the
inmoſt Tunicle of the Inteſtin hanging ſo flaggy
before its mouth, that when any thing would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in, it claps cloſe upon it and ſtops it.</p>
                  <p>As to any anaſtomoſes of the roots of either of
theſe Bilary veſſels with thoſe of the <hi>Vena portae,</hi>
ſuch indeed have been much talkt of, but without
truth, for their extream Twigs or Capillaries
terminate in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver, out of
whoſe grape-ſtone-like Glandules they imbibe the
Choler there ſeparated from the Bloud; even as
was ſaid before of the Capillaries of the <hi>Cava,</hi>
that they received the Bloud it ſelf imported by

                  <p>Very many have been the differences of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

have thought it to be only of uſe to ſuſtain the
diviſions of the Veſſels, and to ſerve the Stomach
for a Cuſhion; others that it miniſters a ferment
to the Stomach; others that it receives the
Chyle, and brings it to greater perfection; and
others that it ſerves as a Gall-bladder to the
Spleen, or ſometimes ſerves in its ſtead. Which
opinions being all very unlikely, I ſhall not ſpend
time to examine them. There are two other
opinions, for the former whereof let the credit
of the learned Author <hi>(viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wharton)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it as it can, but to me it ſeems impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
and it is this, That it receives the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or ſuperfluities of the ſuperiour <hi>plexus</hi> of
the Nerves of the ſixth pair (Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal)
being united with ſome branches from
the ſpinal marrow, and by its proper Veſſel or
Duct diſcharges them into the Inteſtins. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
unto which I ſhall only ſay this, That I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how thick Excrements ſhould be convey'd
by the Nerves that carry ſuch pure animal ſpirits,
and have no viſible Cavity; nor ſecondly how
theſe Nerves in particular ſhould <hi>electivè</hi> (as he
ſpeak) ſend the Excrements hither, and all the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49419:46"/>
reſt be diſcharged from any ſuch Office. The
laſt opinion, and to me the moſt probable, is
defended by famous Phyſicians and Anatomiſts,
as <hi>Franc. Sylvius, Bern. Swalve, Regn. de Graef</hi>
and <hi>Isbrand de Diemerbroeck,</hi> from which laſt I ſhall
tranſcribe it. <q>I have found, ſaith he, in the
diſſections of Brutes both alive, and newly
ſtrangled, a certain liquor ſublimpid and as it
were ſalivous, (ſomething auſtere and lightly
ſubacid, and having ſometimes ſomething of
ſaltiſhneſs mixed) to flow out of the <hi>Ductus
pancreaticus</hi> into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> ſometimes in a
pretty quantity. Whence I judged—that
there is excocted in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> a peculiar hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
from the ſerous and ſaltiſh part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
bloud brought into it, having ſome few
animal ſpirits convey'd thither by ſmall Nerves
mixed with it, and that this liquor flowing into
the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and there preſently mixed with
the Bile, and the meat concocted in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
gliding by the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into the Guts, does
cauſe a peculiar efferveſcency in thoſe aliments,
whereby the profitable chylous particles are
ſeparated from the unprofitable, are attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and being brought to greater fuſion
(This operation of it, ſays he, is ſhewn by the
diverſity of the ſubſtance of the aliments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
in the Stomach and ſtill there contained,
from that of thoſe that have already flow'd into
the Inteſtins: for the former are viſcid and
thick, and have the various colours of the food
taken; but the latter on the contrary are more
fluid, leſs viſcid, and more white) are withall
made apt to be impelled by the periſtaltick
motion of the Guts, through their inner mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49419:46"/>
coat into the Lacteal veſſels, the other
thicker by little and little paſſing down to the
thick Guts, to be there kept till the time of
excretion. Now this efferveſcency is cauſed
through the volatile ſalt and ſulphureous oyl
of the Bile meeting with the acidity of the
pancreatick juice; as in Chymiſtry we obſerve
the like efferveſcencies to be cauſed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of ſuch things.]</q> Thus he. So that he
will not have this juice to be any thing excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious,
nor to be ſo very little in quantity as
ſome have affirmed; to demonſtrate which he
cites the experiment of <hi>de Graef,</hi> who in live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſections
could gather ſometimes an ounce of it
in ſeven or eight hours time, which he has taſted,
and found it of the taſt before-mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>

ſcope has diſcover'd it to be a <hi>Congeries</hi> of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
form'd and diſtinguiſh'd into cells like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-combs.
And in theſe cells there are very many
Glands. He deſcribes them thus <hi>(lib. de Liene
cap. 5.)</hi> 
                     <q>In the Spleen, ſays he, there may
be obſerved numerous bunches of Glands, or
if you will, of Bladders or little Bags diſperſed
all over it, which do exactly reſemble a bunch
of Grapes. Theſe little Glands have an oval
figure, and are about as big as thoſe of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys:
I never ſaw them of other colour
than white; and though the Bloud-veſſels of
the Spleen be fill'd with ink, and play about
them, yet they always keep the ſame colour.
Their ſubſtance is membranous as it were, but
ſoft and eaſily crumbled; their Cavity is ſo
ſmall that it cannot be ſeen, but it may be gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
in that when they are cut they ſeem to fall
into themſelves. They are almoſt innumerable,
and are placed wonderfully in the aforeſaid cells
of the whole Spleen, where vulgarly its <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi>
is ſaid to be; and they hang upon fibres
ariſing from their caſe, and conſequently on the
utmoſt ends of the Veins and Arteries, yea the

Tendrils of Vines, or clinging Ivy.—Each
bunch conſiſts of ſeven or eight.]</q> Thus he.

ariſing from the outer Membrane of the

of a Woman that was troubled with a Tumour
there, which was taken by her Phyſicians for a
Mole, but dying of it, and being opened, it was
found to be occaſioned by the Spleen fallen out of
its place and lying upon the Womb. And as it
very much endangers life when it falls out of its
place, ſo can it not with ſafety be quite cut out
of the Body, whatever ſome have boaſted of. But
none but obſcure Men (of no credit) have
bragg'd of ſuch feats; and how can one imagine
that a part ſo difficult to come at, and that has
ſuch large veſſels inſerted into it, (not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Body? Wounds in it are commonly mortal; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,

afflict the Patient and ſometimes kill him: ſure
then the total ablation of it muſt be very fatal.

throughout its <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and come out
of its hollow ſide in three or more branches,
which unite preſently into the aboveſaid <hi>Ramus.</hi>
The ſaid branches at their coming out of the
Spleen have each one a Valve which look from the
Spleen outwards, permitting the humours to
flow from the Spleen to the <hi>Ramus ſplenicus,</hi> but
hindering them from returning back. And
though one cannot diſcover any anaſtomoſes of
the Veins with the Arteries in the ſubſtance of
the Spleen (the Bloud paſſing out of one into the
other in like manner as in the Liver, namely
through and by help of the Glands) yet there is
one notable one of the Splenick artery with this
<hi>Ramus ſplenicus</hi> before it enter the Spleen. Whoſe
uſe muſt be, partly to further the motion of the
humours contained in the <hi>Ramus</hi> towards the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
partly that the ſuperfluous plenty of Bloud,
which perhaps cannot paſs quick enough through
the narrow paſſages of the Spleen, may return
back again by help of this anaſtomoſis, through
the <hi>Ramus</hi> to the Liver. There is alſo another
Vein called <hi>vas breve,</hi> which ariſing out of the
bottom of the Stomach is inſerted into the <hi>Ramus</hi>
juſt as it comes out of the Spleen or a little after.
The errour of the Ancients as to the uſe of this
Veſſel was detected before, chap. 12. and its true
uſe declared.</p>
                  <p>It hath two Arteries,<note place="margin">2. Arteries.</note> entring one at its upper,
the other at its lower part. Theſe commonly
ſpring from the left Coeliack branch, which is
called the <hi>Splenick artery;</hi> but ſometimes (ſaith
<hi>Diemerbroeck)</hi> from a certain branch ariſing out
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49419:49"/>
of the very trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and proceeding
by a bending Duct along the ſide of the <hi>Pancreas</hi>
to the Spleen, where they are branched into a
thouſand Twigs. By theſe Arteries the Bloud
flows to it, where if it have not a free paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the roots of the Veins and into the <hi>Ramus ſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi>
it cauſeth a great pulſation, ſo high that as
<hi>Tulpius</hi> relateth <hi>(lib. 2. obſervat. 28.)</hi> it has
been heard by thoſe that have ſtood 30 foot off.</p>
                  <p>Nerves it hath from one of the meſenterical
branches of the Intercoſtal pair,<note place="margin">3. Nerves.</note> which are not all
ſpent on its inveſting Membrane (as has been
thought) but ſome enter into its ſubſtance, which
yet has a very dull ſenſe; but that proceeds not
from defect of Nerves (for it has a pretty many
Twigs) but from that <hi>ſtupor</hi> or numbneſs which
that acid juice that is bred in the Spleen, muſt be
conceived to induce upon them.</p>
                  <p>Though Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> in his <hi>Adenographia,</hi>

                  <p>The Ancients knowing neither the true paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

They thought that it attracted a more feculent
and melancholick part of the Chyle, by the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

it ſent it out again partly by the <hi>vas breve,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49419:49"/>
partly by the internal hemorrhoidal; but it is
certain, both that no Chyle, nor indeed Bloud
paſſeth by the <hi>Ramus ſplenicus</hi> to the Spleen, as
neither any thing from the Spleen by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Veſſels; but whatever they contain comes
towards the Spleen, namely into the <hi>Ramus,</hi> and
what is in it goes to the Liver. One need add
no further reaſon to evince the errour of their
opinion; nor that of thoſe that would make it a
ſanguifying Bowel. Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> (in <hi>lib. de He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,

them received into the Nerves, by which it is firſt
carried to the <hi>Glandulae renales;</hi> where being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
it is received again by the Nerves, and is
carried to the Brain and Spinal marrow, and
from thence by the Nerves again into all the parts
of the Body. We will not here enter into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about the nutritious juice of the Nerves;
but ſuppoſing it, certainly this ſeems an odd way
of conveying either it or its Vehicle thus to and
again by the ſame ſort of Veſſels; not to ſay that
ſo acid a juice as is excocted in the Spleen, one
ſhould think would be no very welcome gueſt to
the Nerves, nor be ſuffer'd to march ſo quietly,
eſpecially paſſing againſt the current of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſpirits that continually flow from the Brain
and Spinal marrow. This opinion therefore we
ſhall paſs by as very improbable, having little elſe
to recommend it ſave the credit of its learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
And its true uſe we believe to be, to make
a ſubacid and ſaltiſh juice of the Arterial bloud
that flows plentifully into it, which paſſing by the
<hi>Ramus ſplenicus</hi> to the Liver ſerves there to make
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49419:50"/>
(and further the ſeparation of) the Bile. Now
this juice is thus elaborated: There are a great
many Glands in the ſubſtance of the Spleen
(which being boil'd taſts ſomething acid.) Into
theſe Glands is the Arterial bloud poured by the
capillary Arteries, wherewith are mixed ſome
animal ſpirits depoſited into the ſame Glandules
by the ends of the Nerves, which bridling the
ſulphureous ſpirit of the Bloud, induce on it a
little acidity; and then being driven out of the
Glandules by the beating of the Arteries and the
preſſure of the adjacent parts, it is received by
the roots of the Splenick vein, and ſo by the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ſplenicus</hi> it flows to the <hi>Porta</hi> and the Liver.
But before it enter into the roots of the Veins,
it ſeems to ſtay a little in the abovementioned
Cells, (whoſe ſubſtance is acid) that it may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſome more acidity by that ſtay in them: as
Wine ſtanding in a Vinegar-veſſel ſowrs more
and more; and as the Bile by ſtaying in the Gall-bladder
gets a greater acrimony.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Kidneys, and the Glandulae renales.</head>
                  <p>THE Kidney is called in Latin <hi>Ren,</hi>

to flow; becauſe the ſeroſity of the Bloud
doth flow through the Kidneys to the Ureters,
and through them to the Bladder. By the Greeks
they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>mingere,</hi> to make
water.</p>
                  <p>They are in number two,<note place="margin">Number.</note> both becauſe of the
great quantity of the ſerous excrement that is to
be diſcharged by them; and alſo that one being
ſtopped, the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the Bloud might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colated
by the other.</p>
                  <p>They are ſeated in the Loins behind the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Inteſtins,<note place="margin">Places.</note> and under the Liver and
Spleen, between the membranes of the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
their lower end reſts on the head of the
Muſcle <hi>Pſoas</hi> (which is one of the movers of the
Thigh) juſt where the Nerve enters into it,
which is the cauſe that a big ſtone being in the
Kidney, and preſſing on the Nerve, a numbneſs
is felt in the Thigh of the ſame ſide. In Man the
right Kidney is loweſt, by reaſon of the greatneſs
of the Liver, and commonly bigger alſo than the
left; yet it has not ſo much fat about it as the
left, by reaſon of the vicinity of the Liver, whoſe
heat hindereth the encreaſe of fat.</p>
                  <p>In figure they reſemble the <hi>Aſarum</hi> leaf or Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-bean:<note place="margin">Figure.</note>
towards the Loin or outwards they
are gibbous; and alſo in their ends on the inſide;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49419:52"/>
but in the midſt where the Veſſels enter in and go
out, they are hollow.</p>
                  <p>As for their connexion,<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> by the external fat
Membrane they are tied to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and
the Loins; by the emulgent Veſſels, to the <hi>Vena
cava,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta;</hi> and by the Ureters to the
Bladder. The right hath the <hi>Inteſtinum caecum</hi>
join'd to it, and ſometimes the Liver; the left
hath the Spleen and the <hi>Colon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are in length about five inches,<note place="margin">Bigneſs.</note> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as far as three and ſometimes four <hi>vertebrae;</hi>
three fingers breadth broad, and one inch thick.
In ſalacious or luſtfull Men they are commonly
larger than in others.</p>
                  <p>Their Membranes are two.<note place="margin">Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note> The one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and external,<note place="margin">1. Common.</note> borrowed from the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
within the reduplication of which the whole
Kidney is lapped; and therefore it is called <hi>Renis
faſcia.</hi> This Membrane is beſmeared with copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fat; whence it is called <hi>Tunica adipoſa;</hi> and
into it entreth the <hi>Arteria adipoſa</hi> from the <hi>Aor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi>
as alſo the <hi>Vena adipoſa,</hi> which on the right
ſide commonly ariſeth from the Emulgent, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the <hi>Cava;</hi> but on the left, always from
the <hi>Cava.</hi> By means of this Membrane 'tis that
they are both joined to the Loins and Midriff;
the right, to the <hi>Caecum</hi> and ſometimes to the
Liver; the left, to the Spleen and <hi>Colon,</hi> as was
noted before. Although they be exceeding fat,
yet ſome part of the Kidney will remain uncovered
about the middle.</p>
                  <p>Their inner and proper Membrane is made of
the outer Coat of thoſe Veſſels that enter into
them,<note place="margin">2. Proper.</note> (for they enter the Kidney with only one
Coat) and this adhereth very cloſe to them,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49419:53"/>
having inſerted into it ſmall Nerves from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal
pair, and one from that branch of it
which goes alſo to the Stomach; whence that
conſent betwixt the Kidneys and it, that in the
pain of the Stone in the Kidneys a vomiting is
cauſed. But theſe Nerves enter the ſubſtance of
the Kidneys in very few but by ſmall ſlips, whence
they have but a dull ſenſe as to their <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the Kidneys,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> as it appears to
the bare eye, looks fibrous, compacted of the
concourſe and commixture of very ſmall Veſſels
joined together by a fleſhy <hi>Parenchyma</hi> that has
divers ſmall chanels; outwardly to feel upon,
it is pretty hard, but within, it is indifferent
ſpongie; its circumference is of a dull red colour,
but towards the <hi>Pelvis</hi> it is more pale. Thus the
Kidneys appear to the ſight; but <hi>Malpighius</hi> with
his Microſcope hath made a far more accurate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of their ſubſtance. He ſays <hi>(lib. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus)</hi>
                     <q>That though in grown Men their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
ſeems commonly plain, yet it is unequal
in Infants new born; and that in adult perſons
the conjunction of Globules does ſtill appear
within from the diverſity of colour, which in
the ſeveral Globules outwardly and towards the
ſides, to which they are joined, is red, but
more pale on the inner ſide. And as in Brutes
theſe Globules being round outwards, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
inwards into an obtuſe narrowneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
quadrangular, quinquangular or ſexangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and ſo are joined together; ſo alſo in Men
there may from the diverſity of colour be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
obſerved a like but more firm conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
—If one take off the Membrane from a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49419:53"/>
freſh and as yet ſoft Kidney, there may by a
good Microſcope be diſcovered certain round
and ſhort Bodies roll'd about like little worms,
not unlike thoſe that are found in the ſubſtance
of the Kidneys being cut through the middle;
and under the outmoſt ſuperficies one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
wonderfull branches of Veſſels, with their
Globules hanging at them, which run towards
the <hi>Pelvis;</hi> as alſo certain continued winding
ſpaces and ſinus's running through all the outer
ſuperficies of the Kidneys, that become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
by injecting ink through the emulgent
Arteries: and moreover, innumerable ſmall
pipes which look ſomething like fibrous or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymatous
fleſh, but are indeed membranous
and hollow; theſe make up a great part of the
ſubſtance of the Kidneys, and are the excretory
Veſſels of the Urine. Moreover he ſays, that
if (after the Membrane is removed) one make
injection into the emulgent Artery with the
ſpirit of Wine tinged black, he may diſcern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
very ſmall Glandules hanging upon
forked Arteries, which by the injection are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
coloured black; as alſo many others in the
interſtices of the Urinary veſſels, which hang
like Apples upon the Arteries, (now fill'd
with the black liquor, and branched like a
Tree.) He thinks that from theſe Glands into
which the extremities of the Arteries end, the
roots of the Veins ariſe, and that the Nerves
reach to them too; and that it is probable that
the excretory Veſſels of the Ureter are extended
ſo far alſo, ſeeing this is conſtant in all Glands,
that every little Globule has beſides the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Veins, a proper excretory Veſſel, as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49419:54"/>
the Bilary in the Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he has obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that thoſe ſame Pipes or Urinary fibres do
many of them terminate in one of the <hi>Papillae,</hi>
(twelve into one) through which the Urine is
tranſcolated into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> for into it they
jet out; and that the ſame ſiphons or urinary
Veſſels are produced from the circumference to
theſe <hi>Papillae</hi> as to their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and accurate deſcription of their ſubſtance he
has greatly diſpelled that miſt of ignorance that
Anatomiſts hitherto were in as to their frame and
<hi>Parenchyma.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Emulgent artery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</note> ſpringing from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> goes into the hollow
ſide of the Kidney,<note place="margin">1. Arteries.</note> being firſt divided into two;
but in the Kidney it is ſpread in divers branches
through its whole ſubſtance, and ends in it in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſmall and inviſible Capillaries. By it much
bloud is conveyed to the Reins (for it is a great
Artery) partly to nouriſh them and the Urinary
veſſels, partly that in their Glandules a good
part of the <hi>Serum</hi> may be ſeparated from it, which
being carried by the Urinary fibres to the <hi>Papillae</hi>
ouzes through them into the <hi>Pelvis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emulgent vein is a little larger than the
Artery.<note place="margin">2. Veins.</note> Its roots ſpring from the Glandules in
the Kidney, which being united into one Trunk
comes out where the Artery goes in, and opens
into the <hi>Cava,</hi> into which it diſcharges the Bloud
remaining from the nouriſhment of the Kidney,
now freed from a good quantity of <hi>Serum</hi> in the
Glands. For that there paſſes nothing by this
Vein to the Kidney is plain, as from the general
office of Veins, which always carry from the part
where their Capillaries are ſpread (excepting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49419:54"/>
the <hi>Vena portae,</hi> which indeed has the office of an
Artery) ſo from that notable Valve that is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at its entrance into the <hi>Cava,</hi> looking towards
it from the Kidney, ſo that the Bloud may freely
paſs out of the Emulgent into the <hi>Cava,</hi> but not
back again. The Emulgent vein ſometimes comes
divided out of the Kidney, as the Artery goes in;
but both the branches are preſently united into
one, and always open by one orifice into the
<hi>Cava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Nerves we have ſpoken before, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the proper Membrane of the Kidneys;
and as to Lympheducts there has no certain diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
been yet made of any in them.</p>
                  <p>Within the Kidney there is a membranous Cell
or <hi>Sinus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Pelvis.</note> called <hi>Pelvis</hi> or <hi>Infundibulum (i. e.</hi> the
Baſon or Tunnel) which is made of the Ureter
expanded and dilated, and comes into the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Kidney with eight or ten open and large
Pipes. Into this <hi>Pelvis</hi> does the <hi>Serum</hi> iſſue from
the Urinary ſiphons through the <hi>Caru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>culae Papil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares</hi>
or <hi>Mammillares,</hi> for one of theſe ſtands at
the head of each of the ſaid eight or ten Pipes,
(being of an equal number with them) and are
like Glandules, of a fainter colour but harder
than the reſt of the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> they are about
as big as a Peaſe, flattiſh above, but round or
bunching out on that ſide next the <hi>Pelvis;</hi> their
perforations are exceeding narrow, ſo that they
will hardly admit the ſmalleſt hair.</p>
                  <p>The action of the Reins is to ſeparate and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
the ſerous humour from the Bloud,<note place="margin">Their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which,
as was ſaid, is brought to them together with the
Bloud by the Emulgent arteries; which is done
in this order. After the two branches of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49419:55"/>
Emulgent artery are enter'd the Kidneys, they
are preſently each of them divided into four or
five, and thoſe again into many more, till at
laſt they end in the ſmalleſt Capillaries which
terminate in the Glandules towards the outer ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,
whereinto they infuſe their liquor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame Glandules are inſerted alſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
veins, and the Uinary ſiphons, each of
which imbibe thence their proper liquor. By
the Veins the Bloud returns into the larger bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Emulgent veins, from thence into the
ſingle Trunk, and by it to the <hi>Cava,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
it to the Heart: But by the Urinary pipes
does the <hi>Serum</hi> drill to the <hi>Papillae</hi> or <hi>Carunculae</hi>
placed at the entrance into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> through
which it diſtills into it. And this <hi>Pelvis</hi> being
the head of the Ureter, the <hi>Serum</hi> glides readily
out of it down by the Ureter into the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>But now it is very difficult to determine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this ſeparation of the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Kidneys
be procured by any kind of efferveſcency or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
or whether they ſerve meerly as a
ſtrainer, through which it is ſqueezed or tranſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
If it be ſeparated only this laſt way, how
admirable is the configuration of the Pores, that
the <hi>Serum</hi> with all its contents ſhould paſs by
them without the leaſt drop or ſtain of bloud,
when yet often purulent matter, brought out of
the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and throughly mixed with the Bloud,
and which is far thicker than the Bloud it ſelf,
paſſes through them with the <hi>Serum,</hi> and not any
thing of Bloud at the ſame time! That ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
matter paſſes by Urine, is frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
but whether it be abſorbed out of the
Cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> by the mouths of the Veins
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49419:55"/>
gaping into it, as the Ancients thought it might;
or it be bred in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Lungs apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemating,
as is more probable, 'tis not a fit place
here to inquire. As neither would it ſignifie
much to give you the conjectures of ſome learned
Men, that becauſe ſuch <hi>Pus,</hi> and much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Pins, Needles, an Iron nail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Urine; that therefore there muſt be ſome
more direct and patent way for part of the <hi>Serum</hi>
to be convey'd by to the Bladder; and therefore
have imagined that ſome Lacteals have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
into the Bladder, as others have ſuppoſed
other ways: for as far as could ever be diſcover'd
by Anatomiſts, there is no footſtep of any ſuch
paſſage, how plauſible ſoever ſuch an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>
may ſeem. And therefore we ſhall ſay no further
of it.</p>
                  <p>Some have thought the Kidneys to have other
Actions beſides the ſeparating of the <hi>Serum;</hi> as
further to elaborate the Bloud, to prepare the
Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe opinions are grown obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete,
and therefore rather to be neglected than
examin'd.</p>
                  <p>Above each Kidney at about half an inch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
there ſtands a Gland,<note place="margin">Glandulae renales.</note> by ſome called <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula
renalis;</hi> by others <hi>Ren ſuccenturiatus;</hi> by
<hi>Bartholin, Capſula atrabilaria;</hi> by Dr. <hi>Wharton,
Glandula ad plexum nerveum ſita.</hi> Which ſeveral
names they have had given them, from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
uſes the Impoſers have aſcribed to them.</p>
                  <p>They are commonly but two,<note place="margin">Their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</note> and are placed
over (but towards the inſide of) the Kidneys,
having the fat about the Kidney coming between.
The left is nearer to the Diaphragm, ſtanding
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49419:56"/>
higher than the right, but the right is nearer to
the <hi>Vena cava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are ſeldom of the ſhape of the Kidneys,<note place="margin">Figure and Subſtance.</note>
but are of not much an unlike ſubſtance. Their
figure is often three corner'd, having the ſhape of
a Satchel with its bottom upward. Sometimes
they are oval but flattiſh.</p>
                  <p>They are bigger in Children proportionably
than in Men;<note place="margin">Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> for in the former they are near the
bigneſs of the Kidneys; but they do not increaſe
as other parts do, ſo that in adult perſons they
are not above two inches long and one broad.
Commonly the right is bigger than the left.</p>
                  <p>They are covered with a thin Membrane which
is knit very faſt to the outer or adipoſe Membrane
of the Kidneys.<note place="margin">Membrane.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have a manifeſt Cavity in their larger
end,<note place="margin">Cavity.</note> in which is contained a black and feculent
humour, that tinges the ſides of the Cavity. Into
it there are a great many little holes gaping out
of the ſubſtance of the Gland, according to
Dr. <hi>Wharton;</hi> and it ſelf opens into a Vein, but
has a Valve placed juſt at the entrance, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the humour contained in the Cavity to flow
out by the Vein, but hinders its return.</p>
                  <p>They have Veins and Arteries commonly from
the Emulgents,<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> ſometimes from the <hi>Cava</hi> and
<hi>Aorta,</hi> and ſometimes from the <hi>Vaſa adipoſa.</hi>
Their Nerves come from the ſtomachick branch
of the Intercoſtals that runs to the proper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
of the Kidneys and to the Spleen alſo.
Lacteals they have none. <hi>Bartholin</hi> affirms they
have Lymphaticks.</p>
                  <p>There have been divers conjectures of the uſe
of theſe Glands,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> but none generally conſented to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49419:56"/>
as true. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi>'s gueſs is, that ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is imbib'd from the Spleen by the Nerves
that are common to the Spleen and theſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
(being both from one branch) and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in their Cavity, which being not purely
excrementitious (though perhaps unprofitable
to the Nerves) is reſtored again to the Veins.
Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> alſo thinks they receive ſomething
from the Spleen, which being refin'd here is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd
again by the Nerves, by which it aſcends to
the Brain or Spinal marrow, and deſcends again
by them, being either it ſelf a <hi>Succus nutritius,</hi>
or elſe a Vehicle for it. <hi>Riolanus</hi> thinks they are
of no uſe at all in Men, but only in the <hi>Foetus</hi> in
the Womb. <hi>Veſlingius, Bartholin</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
think that they make a ferment or <hi>Coagulum</hi>
for the uſe of the Kidneys to help the ſeparation
of the <hi>Serum</hi> from the Bloud. And this indeed
were a probable uſe if there could be found out
any way whereby ought could conveniently paſs
from hence to the Kidneys. But the Veins that
go out of them are inſerted either into the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
vein or the <hi>Cava,</hi> whoſe Bloud is flowing
from the Kidneys, ſo that it cannot paſs this way,
unleſs one would ſuppoſe a contrary courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in the ſame Veſſel, which ſeems abſurd.
And there are no other Veſſels to ſerve this turn.
<hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> conjectures that their black juice is
made of the Arterial bloud, and acquires a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fermentative power neceſſary for the Venous
bloud, into which it is received by the <hi>Cava</hi>
from the Veins that go out of theſe Glandules.
But this, ſays he, is but a conjecture. And in
truth all the other opinions are no more, nor
very probable ones neither; ſo that we muſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49419:57"/>
ſtill acknowledge our ignorance of their
true uſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is from the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

                  <p>The <hi>bottom</hi> comprehends the upper and larger
part of the Bladder, to which the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> being
tied reaches to the Navel, which together with
the bordering Umbilical arteries becomes a

                  <p>The <hi>neck</hi> is lower than the bottom, and

very many Fibres, eſpecially tranſverſe or orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which lie hid within the ſtreight Fibres that
ſurround the whole body of the Bladder, and
theſe make the Sphincter muſcle, which conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
the neck of the Bladder ſo, as no Urine can
paſs out againſt ones will, unleſs when it is affected

The Arteries are two,<note place="margin">Arteries.</note> and ſpring from the
Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> commonly two fingers
breadth under the Emulgents, not juſt from its
ſide but out of its fore-part, the right whereof
climbing over the trunk of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> runs
obliquely to the Vein of the ſame ſide; as alſo the
left, marches to the Vein of that ſide.</p>
                  <p>The Veins are alſo two.<note place="margin">Veins.</note> The right ariſes uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from the trunk of <hi>Vena cava,</hi> a little below
the Emulgent; the left from the Emulgent it
ſelf, for otherwiſe it muſt have gone over the
<hi>Aorta,</hi> whereby it might have been in danger of
breaking; or rather by the continual pulſe of the
Artery the recourſe of the Venal bloud might
have been retarded. Now both theſe Veins and
Arteries a little after their riſe meet, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
both in one Membrane made of the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi>
and then run ſtreight through the region
of the Loins above the Muſcles <hi>Pſoae</hi> on each ſide,
and above the Ureters, as they go beſtowing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſlips here and there upon the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whoſe duplicature they deſcend, and ſo
arrive at its proceſſes. The Veins divide very
often into many branches, and by and by inoſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and unite again; but the Arteries go along
by one Pipe only, on each ſide, untill within
three or four fingers breadth of the Stones, where
each is divided into two branches, the leſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
runs under the <hi>Epididymis,</hi> the larger to the
Teſticle. And as I ſaid they deſcended betwixt
the Membranes of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> ſo they paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Scrotum</hi> between them, not perforating
them in the proceſſes, as in Dogs and other
Creatures, wherein the proceſſes of the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
are hollow like a Quill; but in Man the inner
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49419:62"/>
Membrane of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> ſhuts the hole leſt the
Inteſtins fall by it into the Cod; of which there
is great danger in him (and we ſee it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)
becauſe of his going upright. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the <hi>Vaſa praeparantia.</hi> It has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taught that there are divers inoſculations of
the Arteries with the Veins in their paſſage,
whereby the Venal and Arterial bloud are
mixed; but this opinion is now exploded, for
that, granting the circulation of the Bloud, it is
impoſſible. For the Bloud in the Arteries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
towards the Teſticles, and that in the
Veins aſcends from them, ſo that if theſe two
Veſſels ſhould open one into the other, the Bloud
in one of them muſt needs be driven back, or elſe,
ſtagnating, diſtend and break the Veſſels. But
the truth is, the Bloud both for the nouriſhment
of the Teſticles and the making of Seed flows
down by the Arteries only, and that in an even
undivided courſe, without any of thoſe windings
and twirlings like the Tendrels of Vines talkt ſo
much of, (as the curious <hi>de Graef</hi> by his own fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
inſpection teſtifies:) But the Veins bring
back from the Teſticles what of the Bloud remains
from their nouriſhment and making of Seed, and
theſe indeed come out of the Teſticles by almoſt
innumerable roots by which they imbibe the ſaid
Bloud, and are moſt admirably interwoven and
inoſculated one with another till about four or
five fingers breadth above the Teſticle, which
ſpace is called <hi>Corpus pyramidale, Plexus pampini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis,</hi>
or <hi>Varicoſus;</hi> but theſe Veins are ſo far
from preparing the Seed, as that they only bring
back what was ſuperfluous from the making of it.
And indeed the <hi>Arteries</hi> in Men do no more merit
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49419:62"/>
the name of <hi>Praeparantes</hi> in reſpect to the Seed,
than the <hi>Gullet</hi> in reſpect of the Chyle, or the
<hi>Ductus thoracicus chyliferus</hi> in regard to the Bloud.
But however, we continue the old names, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
only againſt the reaſon of them. And we
will only note two things more. Firſt, that
theſe Spermatick veins have from their riſe to
their end ſeveral Valves which open upwards,
and ſo ſuffer the Bloud to aſcend towards the <hi>Cava,</hi>
but not to ſlide back again. Secondly, that
though the Spermatick Arteries go ſuch a direct
courſe in Men, as has been ſaid; yet in Brutes
they are more complicated and twiſted with the
Veins, but without any anaſtomoſes of one into
the other.</p>
                  <p>There are Nerves and Lympheducts that paſs

veſſels: there is no Cavity in them; but
thoſe ſaid Veſſels are continued to one another,
and carry the Seed in their undiſcernible hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The way to make theſe Veſſels viſible, <hi>de

<hi>Abdomen,</hi> at the root of the Yard, in the Cod.
Their figure is oval, only a little flattiſh. Their
bigneſs differs very much in ſeveral perſons; as
big as a Dove's Egg is reckon'd a mean ſize. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
held the right to be bigger and hotter

But theſe are fanſies that are obſolete,

Which ſome have thought to reach only to the
inmoſt Coat called <hi>Tunica albuginea,</hi> becauſe they
are not conſpicuous in the inner ſubſtance of the
Teſticles. But that comes to paſs by reaſon that
the Arterial bloud preſently loſes its colour, and
by the ſeminiſick faculty of the Stones is turned
into Seed, which being whitiſh, of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
with the Veſſels, makes them undiſcernible.
Yet in thoſe Men that have died of languiſhing
Diſeaſes, and whoſe <hi>Teſtes</hi> have their faculty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49419:63"/>
                     <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> affirms that he has oft diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
Sanguiferous veſſels in the inmoſt parts of
the Stones, and has ſhew'd them to many in the
publick Anatomical Theatre. As for <hi>Nerves,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays he could never obſerve more to go
to them than one from a Vertebral pair, and
that that too was moſt of it ſpent upon the Muſcle
<hi>Cremaſter. Diemerbroeck</hi> agrees to one Nerve,
but thinks it proceeds from the ſixth pair, (which
is Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s Intercoſtal, as diſtinguiſht from
that commonly call'd the ſixth, but his eighth.)
Others will have branches from both theſe Nerves
to go to them. Concerning the uſe of theſe
Nerves there is great controverſy. Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,
Wharton,</hi> &amp;c. will have them to convey a <hi>Succus
genitalis,</hi> which makes the greateſt part of the
Seed. Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> as he denies <hi>(in Cerebri ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
cap. 27.)</hi> any <hi>Succus nutritius</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by the Nerves to other parts, ſo that any
<hi>Succus genitalis</hi> is brought by them hither, but
only animal ſpirit. And whereas to ſtrengthen
the former opinion 'tis uſually objected, That
the Seed muſt needs conſiſt of a nervous juice and
plenty of ſpirits brought from the Brain, becauſe
of the great debility and enervation that is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon the Brain and Nerves by the too great
expenſe of it: he thus anſwers, That this comes
to paſs, becauſe after great profuſions of Seed,
for the reſtauration of the ſame humour (whereof
Nature is more ſolicitous than for the benefit of
the individual) a greater tribute of ſpirituous
liquor is required from the Bloud to be beſtowed
on the Teſticles: wherefore the Brain being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
of a due income and afflux of the ſaid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
liquor, languiſhes; and ſo the animal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49419:64"/>
ſpirits failing in the fountain, the whole Nervous
ſyſtem becomes depauperated and flaggy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
may be added, that alſo the animal ſpirits
themſelves that actuate the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> being deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Spinal marrow, are much waſted
by venereal acts; ſo that for this reaſon beſides,
the Loins are enervated.] In this anſwer <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholin</hi>
acquieſces. And <hi>de Graef, Diemerbroeck,</hi> &amp;c.
confeſs indeed that the ſpirituous Arterial bloud
is impregnated with Animal ſpirits from the
Nerves, but affirm that the matter out of which
the Seed is elaborated is only the ſaid Bloud; and
to theſe we ſubſcribe. <hi>Lympheducts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Upon the Stones,<note place="margin">Epididy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midae.</note> as yet clad with the <hi>Tunica

<hi>Paraſtatae)</hi> enwrapped in the ſame Coat with
the Spermatick veſſels. They adhere cloſer to
the Teſticles at their ends than in the midſt.
<hi>De Graef</hi> defines them to be <hi>Veſſels making with
their various windings that Body that is fixt on the
back of the Teſticles.</hi> To find out their ſubſtance
he directs us thus. <q>Firſt take off the Membrane
that encompaſſes them and knits them to the
Stones, and then there will appear many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
which with the edge of a knife may
without hurting the Veſſels be ſo eaſily ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from one another, that they may be drawn
out into a length like a thing folded: for they
are only folded from one ſide to the other, and
are kept in that ſite by the Membrane received
from the <hi>Tunica albuginea, (or Spermatick veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.)</hi>
But when you have unravel'd half of
them you muſt cut another very thin Membrane,
and then you will ſee the Veſſels lie juſt like
theſe, and may be diſſolved like them. And
the whole being unravel'd, the thicker they
are by how much further from their origine,
which is implanted into the upper part of the
Teſticle by ſix or ſeven ramifications: which
having run ſo far as where they join into one
duct, make it as thick as a ſmall thread; and
this by degrees ſo thickens, that being increas'd

                  <p>OUT of the <hi>Epididymidae</hi> at their ſmaller end
ariſe the two <hi>Vaſa deferentia,</hi>

being but a continuation of them. They are
white, hardiſh bodies, like a pretty large Nerve,
with a Cavity not very diſcernible, but which
may be made ſo, if one open one of them ſix or
ſeven fingers breadth above the Teſticle, and then
either blow into it with a ſmall pipe, or ſquirt
ſome colour'd liquor into it with a Syringe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Teſtis,</hi> for then the Veſſel will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,

the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Veſiculae</hi> will

<hi>Vaſa deferntia</hi> aſcend, and paſs out of the Cod

they are carried preſently over the Ureters,
and turning back again they paſs to the backſide
of the Bladder; between which and the <hi>Inteſtinum
rectum</hi> they march till about the neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
being ſomewhat ſevered, where they grow
wider and thicker; and then juſt as they are going
to meet, their ſides open into the <hi>Veſiculae ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
in which they depoſite the Seed; but not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49419:68"/>
here, but coming cloſe together and
growing ſmaller and ſmaller, they go on and end
at the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> are little Cells like thoſe in a
Pomegranate,<note place="margin">Veſiculae ſeminales.</note> or ſomething like a bunch of
Grapes; <hi>De Graef</hi> compares them to the Guts of
a little Bird diverſly contorted. They conſiſt of
one thin Membrane, through which ſome ſmall
twigs of both Veins, Arteries and Nerves run.
They are about three fingers breadth long, and
one broad; but in ſome places broader and ſome
narrower, as they run in and out. They are
two, (one for each <hi>Vas deferens)</hi> divided from
one another by a little interſtice; and they do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
by a peculiar paſſage emit the Seed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> They are very
anfractuous and winding, and (as was ſaid) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of many little Cells, that they ſhould not pour
out all the Seed contained in them, in one act of
copulation, but might retain it for ſeveral. They
have no communication one with another; not
even in their very opening into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra;</hi> but
the Seed that is brought to the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales</hi>
on the right ſide by the right <hi>Vas deferens,</hi> iſſues
by its proper paſſage into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra;</hi> and that
which is brought to the left, likewiſe. So that if by
any accident the <hi>Veſiculae</hi> on one ſide be burſt or cut
(as in cutting for the Stone they muſt needs be) yet
thoſe on the other being entire may ſtill ſuffice
for generation. Now when the Seed is emitted
out of theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> in the act of generation, it
paſſes out the ſame way it came in; which in this
caſe may eaſily be, (though it be unuſual there
ſhould be a contrary motion in the ſame Veſſel)
for as it comes in from the <hi>Vaſa deferentia,</hi> it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49419:69"/>
drills along gently without any force; but <hi>in Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu</hi>
when the Muſcles of the Yard and all the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
parts are much tumified, it is expreſſed or
ſquirted out of them with ſome violence, and
paſſing along their neck, (which is a continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Vaſa deferentia)</hi> ouzes through a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle
(like Quick-ſilver through Leather) into
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> or the Duct of the Yard that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
both to the Seed and Urine. I ſay it ouzes
from the necks of the <hi>Veſiculae</hi> through a Caruncle
into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> for there is one plac'd as a
Valve before the orifice of each of them; partly
to hinder the coming of the Urine into them, partly
to hinder the involuntary effuſion of the Seed.</p>
                  <p>Now though naturally the little holes through
which the Seed paſſes out of the necks of the <hi>Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> be almoſt imperceptible;
yet if they be either eroded by the acrimony of
the Seed (ſuch acrimony as is contracted by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
embraces, or in Claps as we call them) or
if of themſelves they be debilitated and ſo become
more lax (as ſometimes happens to old or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Men that meddle too much) then there
happens a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> or continual efflux of Seed.
And ſo <hi>Veſalius</hi> and <hi>Spigelius</hi> have obſerved them
much dilated, in diſſecting ſuch as have died with
a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proſtatae</hi> (in Engliſh <hi>ſtanders by</hi> or <hi>waiters)</hi>

                     </gap>hite, ſpongy and glandulous ſubſtance, about
as big as a ſmall Walnut, encompaſs'd with a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49419:69"/>
ſtrong and fibrous Membrane from the Bladder,
to the beginning of whoſe neck they are joined
at the root of the Yard. In ſhape they come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to an oval, ſave that on their upper and
lower part they are a little depreſt, and in that
end by which the <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> enter, they are
ſomething hollow like a Tunnel. The Sphincter
muſcle of the Bladder encompaſſes them, ſo that
for ſo far as they cover the neck of the Bladder,
the Sphincter touches it not, they coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.
They have all ſorts of Veſſels, which
run moſtly on their outer ſide. In their inner
part they have ten or more ſmall Ducts which all
unload themſelves into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> by the ſides
of the great Caruncle (through which the Seed
paſſes from the <hi>Veſiculae</hi> into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra)</hi> but
themſelves have each one a ſmall one to ſtop its
orifice leſt the liquor that is contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
ſhould continually flow out, or the Urine
ſhould flow in. And theſe ſmall Ducts I ſuppoſe are
continued from thoſe ſmall <hi>Veſiculae</hi> which appear
in the Proſtates of thoſe that die (any way) ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
after having had to doe with a Female. For
in ſuch, the ſpongy part of the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> is very
turgid with a ſerous liquor, and in their inner
part may be found theſe ſame <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> like to
<hi>Hydatides,</hi> which if you preſs upon, they will
diſcharge themſelves into the aboveſaid Ducts.</p>
                  <p>What the liquor they contain ſhould be,<note place="margin">Their uſe.</note> or
what is their uſe, there is great variety of opinions.
Some think that the Seed that flows from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles
is further elaborated here. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be; for that the <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> depoſite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them, but all into the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales.</hi>
Others think that from the Bloud there is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49419:70"/>
in them an acrimonious and ſerous humour,
which ſerves for titillation or cauſing the
greater pleaſure in venery. As to this, <hi>de Graef</hi>
appeals to the taſt of it, which has nothing of
acrimony. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> thinks they make a
particular kind of Seed, as the Teſticles do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales</hi> a third. That
theſe laſt make a Seed different from that made
in the Teſticles is grounded on a miſtake in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with the <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> whereas they appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
open into them, and depoſite in them all
the Seed they contain. That the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> make a
peculiar ſort, he endeavours to prove, becauſe
gelded Animals emit ſome Seed. But that is but
precarious; for though they emit ſomething, 'tis
not neceſſary it ſhould be any true Seed. Or if
it be, it may well be ſuppoſed to proceed from
the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales</hi> that have been full when the
Animal was gelt. For, for this reaſon it has
been obſerved that preſently after gelding they
have ſometimes got the Female with young, but
not afterwards when that ſtock was ſpent. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholin</hi>
with many others thinks they make an oily,
ſlippery and fat humour, which is preſſed out, as
there is need, to beſmear the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> whereby
to defend it from the acrimony of the Seed and
Urine, and leſt it ſhould dry up. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi>
confeſſes that it is neceſſary the inſide of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra</hi>
ſhould be kept moiſt and ſlippery, but thinks
that that is done here as in the Bladder, Inteſtins
and many other places, namely from ſome mucid
part of the nouriſhment of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> it ſelf;
and concludes that the <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> depoſite

denies that the <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> convey any thing
to them or have any communication with them;
and therefore believes, that the humour that is
ſeparated in the <hi>Corpus glandoſum</hi> (as he calls the

the Seed, which flowing but in ſmall quantity

that this humour ſhould be mixt with it
that it might better reach the Womb. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this humour be, it is ſqueezed out partly by
the intumeſcence and erection of the <hi>Penis,</hi> and
partly by the compreſſion of the Sphincter of the
Bladder that girds the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> about.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Proſtates are often (at leaſt partly)
the ſeat of the <hi>Gonorrhoea;</hi> and the humour that
they contain, that which is ſhed: for, if it were
true Seed, they could never endure a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ſo

                  <p>THE Seed being elaborated and treaſured up
in the aforeſaid Organs, there was need of
a peculiar Inſtrument whereby it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into the Womb of the Female; and to this
purpoſe Nature has furniſhed the Male with a
Yard which we come now to anatomize.</p>
                  <p>It is called in Latin <hi>Penis,</hi>

                  <p>As to its thickneſs or length,<note place="margin">Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> it differs much in
divers Men. But it is generally obſerved to be

erection into that ſtiffneſs that is neceſſary; and
ſecondly would have occaſion'd it to grow too

pleaſure that in Venery the Male is affected with
in this part.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proper</hi> or internal parts are theſe: the two
Nervous bodies, the <hi>Septum,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> the
<hi>Glans,</hi> four Muſcles and the Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The Nervous bodies (ſo called) are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with a thick,<note place="margin">The ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> white, nervous and very
firm Membrane (like an Artery) but their inner
ſubſtance is ſpongious, being moſtly a contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Veins, Arteries and Nervous fibres, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
one with another like a Net; and when the
Nerves are filled with Animal ſpirit, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
with hot and Spirituous blood, then the
<hi>Penis</hi> is diſtended and becomes erect: but when
the Spirits ceaſe to flow in, then the Bloud and
remaining Spirits are abſorbed by the Veins, and
ſo the <hi>Penis</hi> becomes limber and flaggy.</p>
                  <p>They ſpring from the lower ſide of the <hi>Os pubis</hi>
at diſtinct originals, where they appear like two
horns, or are of a figure reſembling the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Y, that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> may have room to paſs
between them. When they leave the <hi>Os pubis</hi>
they are each covered with a ſeveral Membrane,
and are afterwards joined together with only the
<hi>Septum</hi> between, which the nearer it comes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Glans,</hi> is the thinner, ſo that before it
come to the middle of the <hi>Penis</hi> its Fibres extend
towards the back of the Yard from the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> in
order like a Weaver's Slay, and while it ſtill goes
further, its Fibres by degrees grow ſo very ſmall,
that near the <hi>Glans</hi> the <hi>Septum</hi> is almoſt oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49419:72"/>
and the two Nervous bodies grow into
one. Whence it is that the <hi>Penis</hi> is equally erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for if the <hi>Septum</hi> had exactly diſtinguiſht
one part from the other, it might ſometimes
have ſo happened by the compreſſion or obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Arteries of the one or the other ſide,
that one part of it would have been extended,
and the other remained flaggy.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> affirms, theſe Nervous bodies have
Glandulous fleſh within them, which keeps the
Yard ſomething plump even when it is not erect.
But <hi>de Graef</hi> denies this, and demonſtrates that
they have no other ſubſtance than beforeſaid, thus.
Let the Yard be prepared thus: Firſt gently ſqueez
the bloud out of it, which it always has in greater
or leſſer plenty, and then put a little Tube into
the ſpongy ſubſtance, namely in at that end that
is next to the <hi>Os pubis;</hi> and let the Cavity of the
<hi>Penis</hi> be half fill'd with water by the help of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,
and ſhake the <hi>Penis</hi> with the water in it:
pour out that bloudy water, and fill it again with
clear, and ſo three or four times till the water is
no longer ſtain'd with bloud. Then betwixt two
Linen cloths ſqueez out what water is in the
Nervous bodies, and at length blow up the <hi>Penis</hi>
ſo long till it have its natural bigneſs; in which
poſture if you will keep it, you muſt tie it hard.
When the <hi>Penis</hi> is thus diſtended and dried, you
may examin it as you pleaſe, and will find no
other ſubſtance than was mentioned. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi>
ſays that their ſubſtance is not a meer texture of
Veſſels, but is fibrous, fungous and cavernous
(ſuch as is the ſubſtance of the Lungs) receiving
in their hollow Interſtices Bloud and Spirits out
of the Veſſels that are diſperſed through their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49419:72"/>
Below theſe Nervous bodies lies the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra.</note>
being of a much like ſubſtance to them, ſaving
that its ſpongy part, which is outer and lower,
hath leſs pores becauſe of its ſmaller and more
plentifull Fibres. This part does tumefy when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the Nervous bodies do. Its inner part is
membranous, round and hollow, and exceeding
ſenſible. It is of an equal largeneſs from one end
to the other, ſave in its fore-part, where the
<hi>Glans</hi> is joined to the Nervous bodies, for there
it hath a ſmall Cavern, into which the acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Urine lighting in the Stone of the Bladder,
while it wheels about in it, cauſeth pain, and is
a great ſign of the Stone. Sometimes alſo the
acrimonious eroding liquor in a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, doth cauſe a moſt tormenting ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It is continuous to the neck of the Bladder, but
has not its riſe from it, nor is of the ſame kind of
ſubſtance. If you boil the Bladder and it, it will
eaſily ſeparate, and appears of a clear other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and colour. It begins at the neck of the
Bladder and reaches to the end of the <hi>Glans,</hi>
which it ſeems to beſtow a Membrane upon from
its own inner one, for it is plainly continued
from it.</p>
                  <p>Its uſe is to convey along the Seed and Urine.
And to that end there open into it ſmall pores
that tranſmit the Seed into it from the necks of
the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales</hi> (of which in the foregoing
Chapter;) and alſo the neck of the <hi>Veſica <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
which pours out the Urine into it, at which
place it has a membranous Valve, of which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
before in Chap. 19.</p>
                  <p>The Muſcles are two in each ſide,<note place="margin">Muſcles.</note> and ſo four
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49419:73"/>
in all. Of theſe one pair are called Collateral
muſcles, by others <hi>Erectores.</hi> Theſe are ſhorter
and thicker, and ſpring from the <hi>appendix</hi> or
knob of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> under the beginning of
the Nervous bodies, and are inſerted into the
ſame, a little from their beginning. Theſe
ſerve for erection of the <hi>Penis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond pair is longer and ſmaller, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the ſphincter of the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe paſs ſtreight by the ſides of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi>
and are inſerted about the middle of it, which
they ſerve to dilate for miction and ejaculation of
the Seed, and are called <hi>Dilatantes,</hi> wideners,
and <hi>Acceleratores</hi> or haſtners.</p>
                  <p>Theſe have been generally held to be the uſes
of theſe Muſcles, but <hi>de Graef</hi> (as alſo <hi>Swammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
not. in prodr. p. 35.)</hi> aſſigns a clear contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to them, and that with great ſhew of reaſon.
For ſeeing the action of a Muſcle is contraction,
how ſhould the former pair extend the <hi>Penis,</hi> and
not rather draw it back towards their original?
Or how ſhould the latter ſerve to dilate the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi>
and not rather ſtraiten it, ſeeing in the
action or contraction of a Muſcle its Belly or
Middle ſwells? Therefore he ſays that the Muſcles
only contribute thus far or in this reſpect to the
extenſion or erection of the <hi>Penis,</hi> in as much as
by their ſwelling (partly by bloud and ſpirit
flowing into them, partly by their proper action)
they ſerve to ſtraiten and compreſs the roots of
the Nervous bodies and the ſpongy part of the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and ſo drive the Bloud that flows in by
the Arteries towards the <hi>Glans,</hi> and hinder its
returning back again by the Veins: even as we
daily ſee in a piece of a Gut, which if we fill with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49419:73"/>
wind or water, and then compreſs one end, we
ſhall ſee the other ſtrut out and be more diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>The end or head of the <hi>Penis</hi> is called <hi>Glans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Glans.</note>
and <hi>Balanus.</hi> Into this the Nervous bodies termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and being a little thicker (on that ſide
next them) than they, it encompaſſes them with
a circle like a Crown. On its fore-part it is
ſmaller and ſharper. It has a peculiar ſubſtance
(Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ſays glandulous) ſoft and ſpongy,
and being covered with a very thin Membrane
produced from the internal one of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi>
(which coming out of its hollow, dilates it ſelf
ſo as to cover all the <hi>Glans)</hi> it thereby and from
its proper ſubſtance, much interwoven with
Nerves, becomes moſt exquiſitely ſenſible, and is
the principal ſeat of pleaſure in copulation.
Which if it had not been very great, who would
have taken delight in ſo brutiſh a thing as Venery?
To this purpoſe <hi>Andreas Laurentius</hi> elegantly,

                        <hi>(viz.</hi> that the Nerves from the Brain ſerve for

And yet through the turgeſcency of
the Genital humour, it is often erected and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Spirit againſt ones mind; which is
from hence, becauſe from this Vertebral pair,
whence the Nerves of the <hi>Penis</hi> ſpring, a ſprig

obſerve, as much as may be, the ſame order in
Women as we have in Men, we ſhall firſt begin
with the Spermatick veſſels, which are of two
ſorts, <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arteries are two,<note place="margin">Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> as in Men. They ſpring
from the great Artery a little below the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
(very rarely either of them from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgent
it ſelf) and paſs down towards the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi>
not by ſuch a direct courſe as in Men, but
with much twirling and winding amongſt the
Veins, with which tho' they have no inoſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as has been generally taught. But for all
their winding, when they are ſtretcht out to their
full length, they are not ſo long as thoſe of Men;
becauſe in them they deſcend out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi>
into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but in Women they have a far
ſhorter paſſage, reaching only to the <hi>Teſtes</hi> and
Womb within the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Veins are alſo two,<note place="margin">Veins.</note> ariſing, as in Men, the
right from the trunk of the <hi>Cava</hi> a little below the
Emulgent, the left from the Emulgent it ſelf.
In their deſcent they have no more bendings than
in Men, and therefore are conſiderably ſhorter.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:49419:77"/>
Both the Arteries and Veins as they paſs down
are cover'd with one common Coat from the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum;</hi>
and near the <hi>Teſtes</hi> they are divided
into two branches, the upper whereof is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Teſticle by a triple root; and the
other is ſubdivided below the <hi>Teſtes</hi> into three
twigs, one of which goes to the bottom of the
Womb, another to the <hi>Tuba</hi> and round Ligament,
the third creeping by the ſides of the Womb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its common Membrane, ends in its neck,
where it is woven with the Hypogaſtrick veſſels
like a Net. By this way it is that the <hi>Menſtrua</hi>

the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus:</hi> but yet that Bloud does not flow at
that time ſo much by the Spermatick Arteries as
by the Hypogaſtrick.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of theſe Spermatick veſſels is to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

inaſmuch as Bloud is conveyed by the Arteries to
all thoſe parts to which their ramifications come,
in which parts they leave what is to be ſeparated
according to the law of Nature, the remaining
bloud returning by the Veins.</p>

When this cover is removed,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> their ſubſtance
appears whitiſh, but is wholly different from the
ſubſtance of Mens Teſticles. For Mens (as was
ſaid above) are compoſed of Seminary veſſels,
which being continued to one another are twenty
or thirty Ells long if one could draw them out
at length without breaking: But Womens do
principally conſiſt of a great many Membranes
and ſmall Fibres looſely united to one another;
amongſt which (in the outer ſuperficies of the
<hi>Teſtes)</hi> there are ſeveral little Bladders (like to
<hi>Hydatides)</hi> full of a clear liquor, through whoſe
Membranes the Nerves and <hi>Vaſa praeparantia</hi> run,
and are obliterated in them. The liquor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in theſe Bladders had always been ſuppoſed
by the followers of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> to be
Seed ſtored up in them, as if they ſupplied the
place of the <hi>Veſiculae ſeminales</hi> in Men. But from
Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> downwards many learned Phyſicians
and Anatomiſts (according to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> have
denied all Seed to Women. Of which the ſaid

                     <q>Some Women ſend forth no ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
as is called Seed, and yet is not concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereby neceſſarily fruſtrated; for I have
known ſeveral Women (ſays he) that have
been fruitfull enough without ſuch emiſſion;
yea, ſome that after they begun to emit ſuch
humour, though indeed they took greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in copulation, yet grew leſs fruitfull than
before. There are alſo infinite inſtances of
Women, who though they have pleaſure <hi>in
coitu,</hi> yet ſend forth nothing, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
conceive. I greatly wonder that they that
think this emiſſion neceſſary to generation,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49419:79"/>
have not obſerved, that the humour is caſt out,
and iſſues moſt commonly from about the <hi>Clito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and orifice of the Privity; very ſeldom
from any depth within the neck of the Womb,
but never within the Womb it ſelf, ſo as that it
ſhould there be mixed with the Man's Seed; and
that it is not ropy and oyly like Seed, but ſerous
like Urine. Now to what purpoſe ſhould that
be caſt out, whoſe uſe is neceſſarily required
within? Ought that humour to be ſent to the
mouth of the Privity, (bidding farewell as it
were to the Womb) that it might be drawn
back again with the greater kindneſs and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?]</q>
And indeed whatever that humour
be that the more ſalacious Women emit in copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
(of which afterwards) it cannot be that
which is contained in theſe <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſent forth in greater quantity than that
it can be ſupplied from them, and alſo the <hi>Veſiculae</hi>
are deſtitute of any ſuch pore or paſſage whereby
the liquor contained in them might iſſue out;
for if you preſs them never ſo hard, unleſs you
burſt them, there will nothing paſs out of them.
We muſt therefore ſubſcribe to that new but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
opinion that ſuppoſes theſe little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to contain nothing of Seed, but that they
are truly Eggs, analogous to thoſe of Fowl
and other Creatures; and that the Teſticles
(ſo called) are not truly ſo, nor have any
ſuch office as thoſe of Men, but are indeed
an <hi>Ovarium</hi> wherein theſe Eggs are nouriſhed
by the Sanguinary Veſſels diſperſed through
them, and from whence one or more (as they
are fecundated by the Man's Seed) ſeparate,
and are conveyed into the Womb by the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49419:79"/>
                     <hi>Tubae Fallopianae,</hi> of which by and by.</p>
                  <p>That theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> are analogous to the little
Eggs in the <hi>Ovarium</hi> of Fowl, <hi>de Graef</hi> evinces
by this Experiment, That if you boil them, their
liquor will have the ſame colour, taſte and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency
with the white of Birds Eggs. And their
difference in wanting ſhells is of no moment; for
Birds Eggs had need of a ſhell, becauſe they are
hatched without the Body, and therefore are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to external injuries; but theſe of Women
being foſtered within their Body, have no need
of other fence than the Womb, by which they
are ſufficiently defended.</p>
                  <p>Having compared theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> to the Eggs of
Fowls, I might here follow the method of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>de Graef,</hi> and deſcribe the <hi>Ovari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
&amp;c.</hi> in Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that from thence theſe in
Women might the better be conceived of and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended;
but to the curious and learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
I ſhall recommend the ſaid Authors for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and avoiding all unneceſſary and (to
this Epitome) unſuitable excurſion, I ſhall only
further note two things: Firſt, that theſe Eggs
in Women are commonly towards the number of
twenty in each Teſticle or <hi>Ovarium,</hi> of which
ſome are far leſs than others. And ſecondly,
that the objection of the Galeniſts againſt the
Ariſtotelians, <hi>(viz.</hi> that the <hi>Teſtes</hi> of Females
muſt needs make Seed, becauſe when they were
cut out, barrenneſs always follow'd) will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
obviated by this new Hypotheſis, that
agrees to the neceſſity of the Teſticles ſo far as to
affirm that the <hi>Veſiculae</hi> contained in them become
(when they are impregnated by the Maſculine
Seed) the very conceptions themſelves, which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49419:80"/>
therefore it would be in vain to expect if the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male

therefore can have nothing of Seed in them) we
muſt conclude with <hi>de Graef</hi> that they are only
Ligaments of the Teſticles to keep them in their
place; which he evinces further by obſerving,
that they come not to the inner Cavity of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi>
but are knit only to its outer Coat: for he
ſays, there are only two holes in the <hi>Fundus uteri</hi>
that admit a Probe, and thoſe lead to the <hi>Tubae
Fallopianae</hi> and not to theſe Ligaments.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that thoſe which have been
accounted <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> either are not to be
found at all,<note place="margin">Tubae Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopianae.</note> or are found uncapable of ſuch an
office; and having withall rejected the opinion
of Womens having Seed, and affirmed that that
which makes the conception is one of thoſe <hi>Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
in the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> dropping from thence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into the Womb, we muſt inquire by what
way they can paſs. For if the aboveſaid Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(reputed <hi>Vaſa deferentia)</hi> have no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
whereby even the <hi>Semen,</hi> if there were any,
might paſs; much leſs could one of theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi>
be conveyed that way. And therefore for <hi>Vaſa
deferentia</hi> we aſſign thoſe ducts that <hi>Fallopius</hi> in
his Anatomical obſervations calls <hi>Tubae,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
thus: <q>They are very ſlender and narrow
ducts, nervous and white, ariſing from the
horns (or ſides) of the Womb, and at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
diſtance from it they become larger, and
twiſt like the tendrel of a Vine, till near their
end, where ceaſing their winding they grow
very large, and ſeem membranous and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.
Which end is very much torn and jagged
like the edge of rent Clothes: and has a large
Foramen, which (ſays he) always lies cloſed,
becauſe thoſe jags fall together; but yet being</q>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:49419:81"/>
                     <q>opened they are like the utmoſt orifice of a
Braſs Trumpet.]</q> But <hi>de Graef</hi> ſays, though
they grow very large towards their end, yet of a
ſudden the very extreme part is narrowed before
it is divided into the aforeſaid jags, which he
reſembles unto leaves. Who alſo appeals unto
experiment for theſe <hi>Tubae</hi>'s being pervious, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that if one put a little Tube into the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of one of theſe ſame Trumpets and blow it,
the wind will preſently break through it, which
he ſaith he has obſerved in all the kinds of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
that he has diſſected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Theſe <hi>Tubae</hi> (according to Dr. <hi>Harvey)</hi> are
the ſame in Women that the <hi>Cornua</hi> or Horns
of the Womb are in other Creatures. For they
anſwer to thoſe both in ſituation, connexion,
amplitude, perforation, likeneſs and alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
for as other Animals always conceive in
the <hi>Cornua,</hi> ſo it has been ſometimes obſerved
(as by <hi>Riolanus</hi> from others; and by himſelf)
that a conception has in a Woman been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in one of the <hi>Tubae.]</hi>
                     </q> Which muſt have
happened, when the <hi>Ovum</hi> being received out of
the <hi>Teſtis</hi> into it, has been ſtopt in its paſſage
to the Womb, either from its own bigneſs, or
ſome obſtruction in the <hi>Tubae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their ſubſtance is not nervous (as <hi>Fallopius</hi> in
the above-recited deſcription affirms) but mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous.<note place="margin">Their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note>
For they conſiſt of two <hi>Membranes,</hi>
the <hi>outer</hi> and <hi>inner.</hi> The <hi>inner</hi> ſprings from (or
at leaſt is common with) that which covers the
inner ſubſtance of the Womb; but whereas it is
ſmooth in the Womb, it is very wrinkled in the
<hi>Tubae.</hi> The <hi>outer</hi> is common with the outmoſt of
the Womb; and this is ſmooth.</p>

The capacity of theſe ducts varies very much:<note place="margin">Width.</note>
for in the beginning as it goes out of the Womb,
it only admits a briſtle, but in its progreſs where
it is largeſt it will receive ones little finger. But
in the utmoſt extremity where 'tis divided into

                  <p>They are very uncertain alſo in their length;<note place="margin">Length.</note>
for from four or five, they ſometimes encreaſe to

to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus.</hi> For Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> affirms that
they have a worm-like or periſtaltick motion like
that of the Guts <hi>(de Cervarum &amp; Damarum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

<hi>Swammerdam, Not. in Prodr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt this uſe two objections may be made;
Firſt, that the end of the <hi>Tuba</hi> not adhering cloſe
to the <hi>Teſtis,</hi> when one of the <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> (or <hi>Ova,</hi>
as we think they are) ſhall drop off from the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis,</hi>
it would more probably fall into the Cavity
of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> than light juſt pat in the mouth
of the <hi>Tuba.</hi> Secondly, That when it is received
by it, its duct is ſo narrow, that 'tis hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how it can paſs by it.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>firſt;</hi> the ſame objection may lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the uſe of the Oviduct or <hi>Infundibulum</hi> in
Hens, for neither in them does it join quite cloſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49419:82"/>
to the <hi>Ovarium,</hi> (as <hi>Swammerdam,</hi> &amp;c. truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
and yet it is certain that the <hi>Vitelli</hi> or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Yelks (or rudiments of the Eggs) do all paſs
by them to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus.</hi> The ſame, <hi>Swammerdam</hi>
obſerves alſo in Frogs, in one of whom there are
many hundreds of Eggs, which all paſs one after
another from the <hi>Ovarium</hi> by the Oviduct or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundibulum,</hi>
and yet the mouth of the Oviduct is
almoſt two fingers breadth from the <hi>Ovarium,</hi>
and beſides is immovable, whereas the <hi>Tubae</hi> in
Women are at liberty (and are more than long
enough) to embrace the <hi>Ovarium</hi> with their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
and we muſt believe that they do ſo when a
conception is made; for it is not improbable
that when all the other parts of the Genital are
turgid in the act of Copulation, theſe <hi>Tubae</hi> alſo
may be in ſome meaſure erected, and extend their
opened mouth to the Teſticle, to impregnate the
<hi>Ova</hi> with the Seminal air ſteaming through their
duct, and if any one be fecundated and ſeparate,
to receive it afterwards by its orifice.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>ſecond</hi> objection, which urges the
narrowneſs of theſe <hi>Tubae;</hi> He that conſiders the
ſtraitneſs of the inner orifice of the Womb, both
in Maids and in Women with Child, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
it to dilate ſo much upon occaſion as to
permit an egreſs to the Child out of the Womb,
cannot wonder that to ſerve a neceſſary end of
Nature the ſmall duct of the <hi>Tubae</hi> ſhould be ſo far
widen'd as to give paſſage to an <hi>Ovum,</hi> ſeeing its
proportion to their duct is many times leſs than
of the Child to the uſual largeneſs of the ſaid ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:49419:83"/>
The <hi>firſt pair</hi> are further from the <hi>Os internum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ligaments.</note>
and are broad, ariſing from the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> They
have a membranous, looſe and ſoft ſubſtance,
and for their ſhape are reſembled to Bats wings.
They tie the ſides of the <hi>Fundus,</hi> the <hi>Teſtes</hi> and a
good part of the <hi>Tubae</hi> together, and are faſten'd
to the <hi>Oſſa Ilii,</hi> whereby the Womb is kept from
falling down. But if they be either immoderately
relaxed, or by any violence broken, then the
Womb deſcends and ſometimes falls out (turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſide outwards) if the ſubſtance of the
Womb happen to be relaxed alſo.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond pair</hi> ariſe nearer to the inner orifice
of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> about where the <hi>Tubae</hi> do, and are
called the round Ligaments, or worm-like. From
their origine which is broad, they aſcend on each
ſide between the duplicature of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>
towards the Groins, and running out of the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> become round, and then paſs
obliquely above the <hi>Os pubis</hi> towards the fat that
is plentifull there (and makes the <hi>Mons Veneris)</hi>
in which they terminate near the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> being
divided into many parts. They conſiſt of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Membrane, the inner whereof has all ſorts of
Veſſels, Nerves Arteries, Veins and <hi>Vaſa lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatica;</hi>
and are about a ſpan long. <hi>Veſtingius,
Diemerbroeck,</hi> &amp;c. ſay that they receive a ſmall
Seminal veſſel from the <hi>Teſtes</hi> and <hi>Tubae,</hi> which
they conduct to the <hi>Clitoris</hi> into which they are
inſerted, and ought rather to be accounted <hi>Vaſa
deferentia</hi> than Ligaments. So that what Women
emit from about the <hi>Clitoris</hi> in copulation, they
think to be true <hi>Semen</hi> conducted hither by thoſe
ſeminal ducts. But <hi>de Graef</hi> denies any ſuch
ducts, and affirms that theſe Ligaments reach
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49419:83"/>
not the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> but are terminated in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
fat. And that humour which Women emit
(ſometimes) he thinks doth iſſue out of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunae</hi>
in the orifices of the <hi>Vagina</hi> and urinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
or alſo from the <hi>Meatus</hi>'s in the neck of the
Womb. Which humour is ſupplied to the former
parts from the thick and membranous body that
is about the urinary paſſage; and to the latter
from the nervoſe-membranous ſubſtance of the
neck of the Womb. And indeed who can think
Nature ſo prodigal of ſo ſpirituous and noble a
liquor as Seed, as to ordain it to be ſhed at the
orifice of the <hi>Pudendum,</hi> and ſo to be quite loſt,
and never mixed with the Mans, which is ejected
into the bottom of the Womb? But we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
denied all Seed to Women; and therefore
believe that the liquor they emit is only for the
lubricating of the <hi>Vagina</hi> to cauſe the greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<hi>in coitu.</hi> But to this purpoſe more before.</p>
                  <p>Its <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is whitiſh,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> nervous or rather mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous;
denſe and compact in Virgins, but in
Women with Child a little ſpongy and ſoft.</p>
                  <p>It hath two <hi>Membranes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note> The <hi>outer</hi> is ſtrong
and double, ariſing from the <hi>Peritonaeum:</hi> the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
being proper, is fibrous and more porous.
Betwixt theſe Membranes there is a certain car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and fibrous contexture, which in Women
with Child, together with the ſaid Membranes,
does imbibe ſo much of the nutritious humours
that then ſlow thither, that the more the <hi>Foetus</hi>
encreaſeth, the more fleſhy, fibrous and thick
doth the Womb grow; ſo that in the laſt months
it becomes an inch thick, and ſometimes two
fingers breadth, though it be extended to ſo much
greater compaſs than it has when a Woman is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49419:84"/>
not with Child. And yet (which is ſtrange)
within ſixteen or twenty days after a Woman is
brought to Bed, it becomes as thin as before
<hi>(viz.</hi> about half a fingers breadth) and the whole
contracts into ſo little a compaſs as to be held in
ones hand.</p>
                  <p>In Virgins it is about two fingers breadth
broad,<note place="margin">Bigneſs.</note> and three long. In thoſe that have lain
with a Man it is a little bigger, and ſomething
larger yet in thoſe that have born Children.</p>
                  <p>In ſhape it is ſomething like a Pear,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> only a

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lattiſh above and below. But in Women
with Child it becomes more round.</p>
                  <p>In Maids its Cavity is ſo ſmall that it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold a large hazel nut.<note place="margin">Cavity.</note> In thoſe that have had
Children it will hold a ſmall walnut. It is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into no Cells as it is in moſt viviparous
Brutes, but only into the right and left ſide by a
Suture or line that goes lengthways, much like
that in a Man's Cod. Its Cavity is not quite
round, but jets out a little towards each ſide;
which jetting ſome call its Horns, but improperly:
for though <hi>Galen</hi> (and many after him) having
never diſſected any Woman, preſuming that their
Womb was like that of other viviparous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
attributed <hi>Cornua</hi> thereto, yet in truth
they have none, but the <hi>Tubae Fallopianae</hi> (as was
noted before) anſwer to them and do their office.
Only in Brutes <hi>(viz.</hi> ſuch as have <hi>Cornua)</hi> the
conception is always formed in the <hi>Cornua,</hi> as
being the greateſt part of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> (which
from the very orifice of its <hi>Fundus</hi> is preſently
divided into them, as when one parts the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
the middle finger as wide as one can) but
very rarely in the <hi>Tubae</hi> in Women, but moſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49419:84"/>
an end in the <hi>Fundus</hi> it ſelf. Of which more in
Chap. 30.</p>
                  <p>Its Arteries ſpring partly from the Spermatick
or <hi>Praeparantes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arteries.</note> and partly from the Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick.
Theſe two Arteries do on each ſide by a
notable branch inoſculate one with the other.
And both their branches that run on one ſide the
Womb, do inoſculate with thoſe of their own
ſtock on the other. Which may plainly be ſeen
by blowing into the trunk of either of them on
which ſide you will, for then the branches on the
other ſide will be puffed up, as well as thoſe on
that ſide you blow.</p>
                  <p>They run along the Womb not with a ſtreight
or direct courſe but bending and winding, that
they may be extended without danger of breaking
when the Womb is enlarged to ſo great a bulk by
the <hi>Foetus.</hi> By theſe Arteries it is that the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Courſes flow, in greateſt quantity out of thoſe
that open into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> it ſelf, but in leſſer out
of thoſe branches that reach and open into the
<hi>Cervix</hi> or neck of the Womb, and in leaſt (if at
all) out of the <hi>Vagina.</hi> Now whether the
Bloud be ſent forth this way at ſuch times only
from the two great quantity of it; or whether at
ſuch ſtated ſeaſons there is alſo a fermentation of
the Bloud whereby the orifices of the Arteries are
unlocked, is a controverſie of two large conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for this place. We will only ſay that the
latter is more probable, becauſe when a Woman
feeds high, and ſo breeds much Bloud, they flow
never the ſooner (though it may be in greater
quantity) and when ſhe uſes the greateſt abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and ſpareneſs of diet (if ſhe be healthfull)
they will be never the longer of coming. So
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49419:85"/>
that when through ſuch efferveſcency the Bloud
flows plentifully into the Uterine veſſels, and the
Veins of the Womb being too few (for they are
fewer than the Arteries) to return it all back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by the circulation, it burſts forth of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the Arteries ſo long, till the too great
quantity of the Bloud be leſſen'd and the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ceaſes, which it does after three or four
days, and ſo the flux ſtops till the next period.
In Women with Child they ſeldom flow, becauſe
then the redundant Bloud is beſtowed on the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of the <hi>Foetus:</hi> and it is the wanting of
the <hi>Menſes</hi> at the uſual ſeaſon, that commonly
gives Women the firſt <hi>Item</hi> of their having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
But of this alſo more in Chap. 30.</p>
                  <p>The Veins do likewiſe ſpring from the <hi>Praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes</hi>
and from the Hypogaſtrick.<note place="margin">Veins.</note> There are
many anaſtomoſes of theſe Veins one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(as there was noted of the Arteries) but
eſpecially in the ſides of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> which do
more readily appear by blowing of them up,
than thoſe of the Arteries above ſpoken of. The
Bloud brought hither by the Arteries, that is not
ſpent on the ordinary nutrition of the Womb, or
is not caſt out when the <hi>Menſes</hi> flow, returns by
theſe Veins back to the Heart.</p>
                  <p>It has Nerves from the <hi>Plexus meſenterii maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
of the Intercoſtal pair,<note place="margin">Nerves.</note> and from the loweſt
<hi>Plexus</hi> of the ſame. As alſo from the Nerves of
<hi>Os ſacrum.</hi> And the ſame run alſo to the <hi>Teſtes</hi>
or <hi>Ovaria.</hi> Now it is theſe <hi>Plexus</hi> of Nerves
that are chiefly affected in the Hyſterical paſſion,

ſuch Fits is uſual, namely when ſomething like a

                  <p>The <hi>Cervix</hi> or <hi>Os internum</hi> of the Womb being

                     <note place="margin">The neck of the Womb.</note> we will treat of it in this Chapter. It
ſeems to be a part of the <hi>Fundus</hi> or of the Womb
properly ſo called, only it is much narrower, for
its Cavity is no wider in Virgins than a ſmall
Quill, and in Women with Child its inner orifice
doth either quite cloſe its ſides together, or is
daub'd up with a ſlimy yellowiſh humour, ſo
that nothing can then enter into the Womb, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in very luſtfull Women it be ſometimes open'd

in ſuperfoetation. It is an inch or more in length.
Its Cavity as it opens to the <hi>Vagina</hi> is compared
to the mouth of a Tench; <hi>Galen</hi> likens it to the
<hi>Glans</hi> of a Man's <hi>Penis;</hi> for its Cavity is not round,
but long and tranſverſe. It is wrinkled, and has
many ſmall ducts opening into it, out of which
one may preſs a pituitous ſerous matter. It has

ſeven fingers breadth long, and as wide as

width and looſeneſs differ in reſpect of age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and as a Woman is inflam'd more or leſs with luſt.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49419:86"/>
So alſo the aforeſaid wrinkles are much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and cloſe ſet in Virgins, and in Women
that ſeldom accompany with a Man, and that
have never born Children, than in thoſe that
have born many Children, and in Whores that
uſe frequent copulation, or thoſe that have long
laboured under the <hi>fluor albus,</hi> for in all theſe
three ſorts they are almoſt obliterated.</p>
                  <p>It has very many Arteries and Veins, ſome of

not: By the Arteries that open into it do the

moſt from thoſe of <hi>Os ſacrum. De Graef</hi> ſays
that all along the <hi>Vagina</hi> there are abundance of
pores, out of which a ſerous pituitous humour
always flows to moiſten it, but eſpecially <hi>in coitu,</hi>
when it is ſometimes offenſive to the Man through
its quantity, but encreaſes the pleaſure of the
Woman, and is that which is taken for her Seed,
as has been noted already.</p>
                  <p>Near its outer end, under the <hi>Nymphae</hi> (of
which in the next Chapter) in its fore and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49419:87"/>
whereto in its hinder or lower part it is ſtrongly

                  <p>In Virgins its duct is ſo ſtrait, that at their

more pain than pleaſure through the extenſion of
it by the <hi>Penis,</hi> whereby ſome ſmall Veſſels break,
out of which Bloud iſſues as out of a ſlain Victim
(to ſpeak with <hi>Diemerbro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ck:)</hi> unleſs we ſhould
rather think that the Bloud proceeds from the
rupture of the <hi>Hymen,</hi> which we now come to
deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hymen</hi> is a thin Nervous membrane inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with carnous Fibres,<note place="margin">Hymen.</note> and endowed with
many little Arteries and Veins, ſpread acroſs the
duct of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> behind the inſertion of the
neck of the Bladder, with a hole in the midſt that
will admit the top of ones little finger, by which
the <hi>Menſes</hi> flow. It is otherwiſe called the Zone
or Girdle of Chaſtity. Where it is found in this
form deſcribed, it is a certain note of Virginity;
but upon the firſt admiſſion of a Man's Yard it is
neceſſarily broke and bleeds, which Bloud is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Flower of Virginity;</hi> and of this the holy
Text makes mention in <hi>Deuteron. 22.</hi> verſes 13.—
21. And when once it is broke, it never cloſes
again.</p>
                  <p>But though a Bridegroom when he finds theſe
ſigns of Virginity may certainly conclude he has
married a Maid; yet it will not follow on the
contrary, that where they are wanting, Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is alſo wanting. For the <hi>Hymen</hi> may be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by acrimonious fretting humours flowing
through it with the <hi>Menſes,</hi> or from the falling
out or inverſion of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> or the <hi>Vagina</hi> at
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49419:87"/>
leaſt, which ſometimes happens even to Maids.
Or if a Maid be ſo indiſcreet as to become a Bride
while her Courſes flow or within a day after,
then both the <hi>Hymen</hi> and the inner wrinkled
Membrane of the <hi>Vagina</hi> are ſo flaggy and relaxed,
that the <hi>Penis</hi> may enter glibly without any lett,
and ſo give ſuſpicion of Unchaſtity, when indeed
ſhe's unblameable ſaving for her imprudence to
marry at that ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes in elderly Maids the <hi>Hymen</hi> grows
ſo ſtrong that a Man is glad to make many eſſays
before he can penetrate it. Yea in ſome naturally
it is quite cloſed up, and theſe by this means ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their <hi>Menſes</hi> ſtopt, are in great peril of
their life if they be not relieved by Surgery, <hi>viz.</hi>
opening it with ſome ſharp Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>Cloſe to the <hi>Hymen</hi> lie the four <hi>Carunculae myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiformes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caruncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae myrti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes.</note>
ſo called from their reſembling Myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries.
The largeſt of them is uppermoſt, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
juſt at the mouth of the urinary paſſage
which it ſhuts after water is made. Oppoſite to
this in the bottom of the <hi>Vagina</hi> there is another,
and on each ſide one, ſo that they ſtand in a ſquare.
But of theſe there is only the firſt in Maids; the
other three are not indeed Caruncles, but little
knobs made of the angular parts of the broken
<hi>Hymen</hi> roll'd into a heap by the wrinkling of the
<hi>Vagina,</hi> according to <hi>Riolanus</hi> and <hi>Diemerbroeck.</hi>
Theſe three when the <hi>Vagina</hi> is extended in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
labour, loſe their aſperity and become
ſmooth, ſo that they diſappear, untill it be again
contracted to its natural ſtraitneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>De Graef</hi> affirms, <q>that the <hi>Vagina</hi> near its
outer orifice has a Sphincter muſcle almoſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49419:88"/>
three fingers broad, that upon occaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringes
or contracts it. So that he ſays Men
and Women need not be ſolicitous concerning
the Genitals being proportionable one to the
other; for the <hi>Vagina</hi> is made ſo artificially
<hi>(affabrè</hi> is his word) that it can accommodate
it ſelf to any <hi>Penis,</hi> ſo that it will give way to
a long one, meet a ſhort one, widen to a thick
one, conſtringe to a ſmall one: ſo that every
Man might well enough lie with any Woman,
and every Woman with any Man.]</q> Thus he.</p>
                  <p>Having thus deſcribed the parts of the <hi>Vagina,</hi>
its uſe is eaſily declared to be, to receive the Man's
Yard being erect, to direct and convey the Seed
into the Womb, to ſerve for a Conduit by which
the <hi>Menſes</hi> may flow out, and to afford a paſſage
to the <hi>Foetus</hi> in its birth, and to the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of a Conception.</head>
                  <p>HAving deſcribed all the parts that ſerve for
Generation both in Man and Woman; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would, that we ſhould ſpeak of the efficient
cauſes, matter or principles from whence that
which is generated by and in them, doth proceed.
And in the firſt place there occurs the Man's Seed,
which is the <hi>active</hi> principle or efficient cauſe of
the <hi>Foetus;</hi> but when we diſcourſed of the <hi>Teſtes,</hi>
we ſhewed what the matter of it was, <hi>viz.</hi> Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
bloud and Animal ſpirits; and as to the
manner of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecundating the <hi>Ovum,</hi> we omit
that as being too philoſophical for this place.
In the next place therefore we muſt come to the
matter or <hi>paſſive</hi> principle of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and this
is an <hi>Ovum</hi> impregnated by the Man's Seed. And
here becauſe in Women it cannot be obſerved by
what degrees and in what time an <hi>Ovum</hi> in the
<hi>Ovarium</hi> or <hi>Teſtis</hi> becomes a Conception in the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> we muſt be forced to gueſs at that by the
analogy in other Creatures. To this purpoſe
Dr. <hi>Harvey de generatione Animalium</hi> is worthy to
be read of the curious; eſpecially concerning the
manner and order of the generation of the parts
of a Chicken in an Hens Egg, in his <hi>Exercit. 56.</hi>
But when he comes to apply this to the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of viviparous Animals, being ignorant that
there was any formal <hi>Ovum</hi> pre-exiſting in them,
and only then ſecundated, he runs into great
errours and odd notions about Conception: ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49419:93"/>
an analogy betwixt the Brain's forming its
Phantaſms or Conceptions, (which he calls Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal)
and the Wombs forming hers, which he
calls Natural. He rightly indeed rejects the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
of the Womans having true Seed, as alſo
the notion that the Man's Seed is any part of the
Conception: but then he gives an unſatisfactory
account of it when he ſays it is formed of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meval
albugineous humours that tranſude into
the <hi>Cornua</hi> in Brutes or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> in Women, after
they are impregnated or matur'd, as he ſpeaks.
I ſhall not therefore rehearſe the hiſtory of
generation in Harts that he has given us, for an
analogical explication of that in Women; but
ſhall tranſcribe the obſervations of the curious
<hi>de Graef</hi> concerning the generation of Rabbets,
as being more adapted to our purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We made the firſt trial, (ſays he) on a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Rabbet that had not yet accompanied with
the male. Diſſecting which we obſerved a very
wide <hi>Vagina</hi> and about eight fingers breadth
long, which being opened lengthways, there
ſtood out two narrow mouths in its upper part
divided with a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>milunar partition, namely the
beginning of each <hi>Cornu:</hi> for the Womb in
Conies is preſently from the very <hi>Vagina</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into two parts, one of which bends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the right hand, the other towards the
left about three fingers breadth aſunder, where
they are preſently contracted and continued
with the Oviducts, which in theſe Animals
have a peculiar ſituation (or make) becauſe
if you lightly blow up the <hi>Cornua</hi> theſe will not
ſwell, nor the wind penetrate them becauſe of
ſome looſe <hi>Fimbriae</hi> or rags cloſing like the valve
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49419:93"/>
of the Gut <hi>Colon.</hi> Theſe Oviducts being ſmall
at their riſing from the <hi>Cornua,</hi> for five fingers
breadth run with a winding duct beyond the
Teſticles, widening more and more by degrees,
and then they turn back towards them and end
in the form of a Tunnel..... The Teſticles are
ſmall, but contain very many limpid Eggs,
which being cut open there iſſued out a clammy
liquor like the white of an Egg. This being
premiſed,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We opened another half an hour after the
<hi>coitus,</hi> the <hi>Cornua</hi> of whoſe <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> lookt a little
redder, but the <hi>Ova</hi> in the Teſticles were not
yet chang'd, unleſs they had remitted a little
of their clearneſs: but neither in the <hi>Vagina</hi>
nor in the <hi>Cornua</hi> could we perceive any Seed or
any thing like it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>About ſix hours after the coupling we diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
another, in whoſe Teſticles the <hi>Folliculi</hi> (or
Caſes) of the <hi>Ova</hi> inclined to redneſs, out of
which being pricked with a needle a clammy and
clear liquor iſſued firſt, but bloud followed,
flowing out of the Sanguinary veſſels diſperſed
through the <hi>Folliculi:</hi> We could find no Seed
neither in this Coney.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Four and twenty hours after the <hi>coitus</hi> we
opened another, in one of whoſe Teſticles we
found three, and in the other five <hi>Folliculi</hi> of
the <hi>Ova</hi> very much changed; for being before
limpid and colourleſs, they were now turn'd
duskiſh and of a faint red, in the middle of
whoſe ſuperficies a little <hi>Papilla</hi> (or Teat)
as it were diſcover'd it ſelf: when the <hi>Folli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>
were cut open, there appear'd a little
limpid liquor in their middle, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d in their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49419:94"/>
circumference a certain thicker and reddiſh
matter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Twenty ſeven hours after the <hi>coitus</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
another, the <hi>Cornua</hi> of whoſe <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi>
with the Oviducts looked more bloudy, alſo
the extremity of the Oviduct did on every ſide
embrace the <hi>Teſtes</hi> like a Tunnel; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſuperficies of the <hi>Folliculi,</hi> as in thoſe
before, there ſtood out little <hi>Papillae,</hi> through
which by preſſing the ſubſtance of the Teſticles
there iſſued a limpid liquor, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by another redder and thicker. Opening
the <hi>Cornua</hi> of the Womb we found no Eggs,
but the inner wrinkled tunicle of the <hi>Cornua</hi>
was a little more tumid.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Eight and forty hours after the <hi>coitus</hi> we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
another, in one of whoſe Teſticles we
found ſeven, in the other three <hi>Folliculi</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
in whoſe middle the <hi>Papillae</hi> were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more eminent, through which, by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſubſtance of the Teſticles, there iſſued
a little liquor like the white of an Egg, but
the remaining reddiſh ſubſtance of the <hi>Ova,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now become ſomething thicker, was not
ſo eaſily preſſed forth as in thoſe before.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Two and fifty hours after the <hi>coitus</hi> we view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another, in one of whoſe Teſticles we found
one, in the other four <hi>Folliculi</hi> altered; cutting
open which we found a glandulous-like matter,
in the middle of which there was a little Cavity,
wherein finding no notable liquor, we begun to
ſuſpect whether or no their limpid ſubſtance,
which is contained in proper Membranes, were
burſt forth or expelled: wherefore we ſearched
carefully both the Oviducts and the <hi>Cornua,</hi> but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49419:94"/>
we could find nothing; only the inner tunicle
of the <hi>Cornua</hi> being much pufft up ſhined.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Seventy two hours (or three days and
nights) after the <hi>coitus</hi> we inſpected another,
which exhibited a far other and moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
change; for the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> did embrace
the Teſticles on every ſide moſt cloſely, which
being pull'd off we found in the Teſticle of the
right ſide three <hi>Folliculi</hi> a little greater and
harder, in the middle of whoſe ſuperficies we
ſaw a tubercle with a little hole in it like a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla;</hi>
but diſſecting the ſaid Caſes through the
middle, their Cavity was quite empty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſearched the ways through which the
<hi>Ova</hi> muſt paſs, again and again, and found in
the middle of the right Oviduct one, and in
the outer end of the <hi>Cornu</hi> of the ſame ſide two
very ſmall Eggs, little bigger than ſmall pins
heads, which notwithſtanding their ſmallneſs

Eggs being pricked there iſſued a moſt limpid
liquor...... In the very beginning of the
<hi>Cornu</hi> of the left ſide we found only one Egg,
juſt like thoſe ſmall ones of the other ſide:
whence it is clear that the <hi>Ova</hi> excluded out of
the <hi>Teſtes</hi> are ten times leſs than thoſe that yet
ſtick in the <hi>Teſtes;</hi> which ſeems to us to come
to paſs inaſmuch as thoſe that are ſtill in the

and in the <hi>Cornua</hi> of the reſpective ſides
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49419:95"/>
we found as many Eggs, greater than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
which did not ſtick in the Oviducts or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the <hi>Cornua,</hi> but were now rolled on
towards their middle: in their Cavity we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
as it were another Egg ſwimming, far
clearer than in the other before.....</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>The fifth day from the <hi>coitus</hi> we diſſected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
in whoſe <hi>Ovaria</hi> or Teſticles we told ſix
emptied <hi>Folliculi,</hi> that had each a notable <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla,</hi>
through whoſe Foramen we eaſily put an
ordinary briſtle into their Cavity: we found
alſo the ſame number of Eggs (bigger than
thoſe the day before) in divers parts of the
<hi>Cornua,</hi> in which they lay ſo looſely, that by
blowing only, one might drive them this way
or that way. The inner tunicle of theſe (or
the Egg within an Egg as it were) was become
yet more conſpicuous.</q>

                     <q>The ſixth day after the <hi>coitus</hi> we examin'd
another, in one of whoſe Teſticles we obſerv'd
ſix Caſes emptied, and in the <hi>Cornu</hi> of the ſame

the <hi>Vagina,</hi> brought as it were upon a heap:
but in the Teſtiole of the other ſide we found
four <hi>Folliculi</hi> emptied, and in the <hi>Cornu</hi> of that
ſide only one Egg: The cauſe of which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
we ſuppoſe to be, either becauſe ſome
Eggs by the wave-like motion of the <hi>Cornua</hi>
(not unlike the periſtaltick motion of the
Guts) being carried downwards towards the
<hi>Vagina</hi> were driven forth; or becauſe being
conſumed in the <hi>Folliculi</hi> they came not to the
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus;</hi> or light on ſome other miſchance.
Theſe Eggs were as big as ſmall Peaſe.</q>

another, in whoſe <hi>Ovaria</hi> we found ſome <hi>Folli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>

<hi>Ova</hi> as big as Pocket-piſtol Bullets, in
which we beheld nothing but the Inner tunicle
very conſpicuous and a moſt limpid humour.
It is to be wondred at, that in ſo ſhort a ſpace
of time the Eggs ſhould imbibe ſo great plenty
of liquor, that whereas before they might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be taken out of the Womb, now they could
very difficultly.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>The eighth day from the <hi>Coitus</hi> we opened

we ſaw one, in the left two Cells; one of theſe
was almoſt twice as big as the other: for Nature
doth ſometimes ſo vary, that there are Eggs of
divers bigneſs found not only in divers Animals
of the ſame ſpecies diſſected at the ſame diſtance
from the <hi>coitus,</hi> but alſo in one and the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual.
In the horns of the Womb being
opened we ſaw the Eggs a little bigger than the
day before, but all of them, their tunicles
breaking, poured out their clear liquor before
we could take them quite out: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

whoſe <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> we ſaw ſwelled up into two, and
the left into four tranſparent Tumours or Cells,
out of which that we might take the <hi>Ova</hi> we
uſed the greateſt diligence and attention; but
as ſoon as we came to them, their tunicles were
ſo very tender that they burſt as the former:
which when we ſaw, the Eggs that remained
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49419:96"/>
we boiled with the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> whereby their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
harden'd like the whites of Hens Eggs.
The inner ſubſtance of the Cells, on that ſide

emptied, and beſides theſe, others that lookt
very pale, which we judged to be thoſe that had
been emptied the <hi>coitus</hi> before this, although
for the moſt part they leave only ſome paliſh
points or ſpecks, to which the increaſe of the
Teſticles is owing. The <hi>Folliculi</hi> of the laſt
<hi>coitus</hi> were each beſet with a <hi>Papilla,</hi> but the
others were ſmooth. In the right <hi>Cornu</hi> there
were two, and in the left five Cells, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
being more rare and pellucid than the
other parts of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> was interwoven with
many twigs of Veins and Arteries. Opening
ſome of theſe Cells, we could ſee the <hi>Ova,</hi> but
could not take them out whole; wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compelled to examine the content of the
Eggs in the very hollow of the Cells, we found
it clear like Cryſtal; in the middle whereof a
certain rare and thin cloud was ſeen to ſwim,
which in other Conies diſſected likewiſe on the
ninth day after the <hi>coitus</hi> for its exceeding fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
eſcaped our ſight. The inner ſubſtance of
the Cells, namely that which receives the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtrick

another, in whoſe right Teſticle we found one

through it was redder and had a leſs <hi>Papilla;</hi>
in the middle of this pale ſubſtance there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

rounder than the foregoing, in the middle of
which the <hi>Embryo</hi> was ſo conſpicuous, that one
might in a ſort diſcern its Limbs, in the region
of whoſe Breaſt two ſanguineous ſpecks and as

to be yet greater, and the Sanguineous
veſſels more, and more turgid: we alſo noted
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49419:97"/>
that the Cells the larger they grew, came alſo
nearer to one another, and their Interſtices
were leſſened. The Membranes <hi>Amnios</hi> and
<hi>Chorion</hi> were knit together, which though they
appear thicker and ſtronger, are yet more hard
to be ſeparated from one another than in the
<hi>Ova</hi> taken intirely out of the Womb; tearing
theſe we ſaw an <hi>Embryo</hi> with a great and pellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Head, with the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> copped; its
gogle Eyes, gaping Mouth, and in ſome ſort
its little Ears might be diſcovered alſo. Its
Back-bone was drawn out, of a white colour,
which bending in about the <hi>Sternum</hi> reſembled
a Ship; by whoſe ſides moſt ſlender Veſſels run,
whoſe ramifications were extended to the Back
and Feet. In the region of the Breaſt two ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous
ſpecks greater than the foregoing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the rudiments of the ventricles of the
Heart; at the ſides whereof were ſeen two
whitiſh ſpecks for Lungs. In the <hi>Abdomen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opened, there firſt ſhew'd it ſelf a reddiſh
Liver; then a white Body, to which was knit
a mucilaginous matter like a writhed thread,
being the rudiments of the Stomach and Guts.
All which in thoſe that we diſſected afterwards
had acquired only a greater bulk and perfection.
And therefore to prevent tediouſneſs by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the ſame things, we will on purpoſe
paſs by all the other diſſections we made in this
kind of Creature, excepting only one which we
made the day before the kindling; that thoſe
things that in the former were only confuſedly
diſcerned,</q> may appear plain in this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>At length on the twenty ninth day after the
<hi>coitus</hi> we inſpected another, that had kindled
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49419:97"/>
ſix weeks before, and in the <hi>coitus</hi> by which ſhe
was impregnated had voided all the thicker
part of the Seed of the Male, which in ſome
meaſure did reſemble the conſiſtence of a moſt
limpid jelly. In her <hi>Ovaria</hi> we found eleven
little whitiſh <hi>Folliculi;</hi> and beſides theſe, others
far leſs, little or nothing differing from the
ſubſtance of the <hi>Teſtes.</hi> The <hi>Folliculi</hi> of the
<hi>Ova</hi> in the <hi>Teſtes</hi> ſeem not to vaniſh wholly,
but to leave a certain ſpeck in them; whence it
certainly comes to paſs, that Conies, the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or the more young ones they bring forth,
have the greater and whiter Teſticles; ſo that
one may gueſs by only viewing the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have had many young ones or often.
Having view'd the <hi>Ovarium</hi> we paſt to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
which we found no longer diſtinguiſh'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Cells, but all along diſtended like a Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
which was ſo agitated with a wave-like
motion like the periſtaltick of the Guts, that
the young ones neareſt the <hi>Vagina</hi> as yet inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their Membranes were excluded, and
that ſo haſtily, that if we had not cut out the
whole <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> they had all certainly gone the
ſame way. The Womb was no thicker than
when they are not with young, otherwiſe than
we have ſaid it to be in Women. In its Cavity
we ſaw eleven <hi>Foetus</hi> ſprawling, which were all
ſo cloſely coupled together by the Membrane
<hi>Chorion</hi> (wherein all are ſeverally involved)
as if they had all been included in one and the
ſame <hi>Chorion</hi>—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much I thought fit to tranſlate of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Anatomiſts obſervations concerning the
generation of this ſort of Animal, becauſe it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49419:98"/>
gives ſo very great light into the manner of the
generation of a humane <hi>Foetus.</hi> For there is an
exact analogy betwixt them, abating ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
as <hi>Firſt</hi> that in Women the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is not formed in the <hi>Cornua,</hi> ſeeing her
Womb has none, nor in the <hi>Tubae</hi> very ſeldom
and according to Nature, for they are only the
<hi>Infundibula</hi> or Oviducts to convey the <hi>Ova</hi> from
the <hi>Teſtes</hi> to the <hi>Fundus uteri,</hi> though they bear
ſome reſemblance to the <hi>Cornua</hi> in Brutes; I ſay
the Conception is not formed in theſe, but in the
<hi>Fundus uteri</hi> or Womb properly ſo called, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
the <hi>Ovum</hi> being received preſently begins to
ſwell and grow bigger, and there appears as it
were an Egg within an Egg, by means of the two
Membranes with which it is cloathed; which
Membranes are originally in the <hi>Ovum</hi> while it is
in the Teſticle, and imbibe the moiſture that is
ſent now plentifully into the Womb, even as the
little Yelks in Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gather the white about
them in the Oviduct and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> which they have
none of in the <hi>Ovarium;</hi> or as Seeds in the
Ground do imbibe the fertile moiſture thereof to
enable them to ſprout. <hi>Another</hi> conſiderable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
wherein they differ is the ſlow proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of the formation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in Women in
compariſon of that in Conies now deſcribed. For
ſeeing theſe go with young but 29 or 30 days, and
Women nine months, we muſt imagine that the
<hi>Embryo</hi> is as perfectly formed in the former on the
tenth day as in the latter in the tenth week, or
longer. But I ſay abating theſe or if there be any
other ſuch like circumſtances, there is ſo great a
likeneſs betwixt the one and other, that without
inſiſting more on the matter or manner of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49419:98"/>
Conception, we ſhall paſs on to the deſcription
of the parts that encompaſs the <hi>Foetus,</hi> then ſhew
how it is nouriſhed, and laſtly what parts there are

only that is more brittle and this more tenacious,
ſo that it cannot ſo eaſily be ſeparated from the

by means of which Glands the ſeparation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

                  <p>It is of very different ſhapes in ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Shape and ſituation.</note>
but in Women it is circular, yet with ſome
inequalities in its circumference. It is two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth thick in its middle (but thinner
near the edges) and a ſpan or a quarter of a yard
over from one ſide to the other when the <hi>Foetus</hi> is
come to maturity ready for the birth. On that

unequal, having a great many tubercles or bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
whereby it adheres faſt and immediately to
the Womb. But to what part of it, is not agreed
among Anatomiſts, ſome affirming it to grow to
the fore-part, ſome to the hinder-part; ſome to
the left ſide, others to the right. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi>
(aſſenting to <hi>Fallopius)</hi> ſays, it always adheres
to one of the two corners of the Womb (that
anſwer in ſome manner to the <hi>Cornua</hi> in Brutes)
whereinto the <hi>Foramen</hi> of the <hi>Tuba</hi> opens; ſo
that he ſays the ſaid <hi>Foramen</hi> is as it were the
centre to the <hi>Placenta. De Graef</hi> thinks it is

the <hi>Embryo</hi> (called <hi>Chorion)</hi> about the eighth or

carnous and ſoft ſubſtance grows, but unequally

this <hi>Placenta,</hi> that out of it, as Plants by their

bigger, and riper and nearer to the birth, by ſo
much the more eaſily will it part from the Womb,
and at length, like to ripe Fruit, after the Child
is born, it falls out of the Womb and makes part
of the After-birth.</p>
                  <p>It was an old tradition continued for many
hundred years,<note place="margin">Acetabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> that the <hi>Placenta</hi> adheres to the
Womb by certain parts called <hi>Cotyledones</hi> or <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabula.</hi>
That there are ſuch in ſome Creatures it
is certain; Dr. <hi>Needham</hi> ſays they are only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo called in Sheep and Goats, in whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with young the Uterine glands are hollow like
a Saucer or an Acorn-cup, and are adapted to
the little Prominences (or <hi>Digituli)</hi> of the
<hi>Placentulae</hi> that grow on the <hi>Chorion;</hi> (though
<hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> ſay, that on the contrary the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centulae</hi>
are hollow (and ſo are truly the <hi>Acetabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la)</hi>
and the Uterine glands protuberant) and
doubts not but theſe names were firſt given by
thoſe that diſſected theſe kind of Creatures, and
were afterwards applied in following ages to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals. So that no wonder there have
been ſo great conteſts even about the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word <hi>Cotyledon</hi> (which is the Greek
word for the herb <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbilicus Veneris</hi> or Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort)
and what that was that was ſo called in
the ſeveral Creatures that were ſaid to have them.
But becauſe ſuch Controverſies are now obſolete,

that involve the whole <hi>Foetus, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi>

whole <hi>Foetus.</hi> Of each of theſe in their order,
with the liquors they contain.</p>
                  <p>The outer Membrane is called <hi>Chorion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chorion.</note> it is
pretty thick, ſmooth on the inſide, but without
ſomething unequal or rough, and in that part of
it that adheres to the <hi>Placenta</hi> and by it to the
Womb, has very many Veſſels which ſpring
from the <hi>Placenta</hi> it ſelf and the Umbilical veſſels.
It is but one even when the Mother goes with
Twins: for as in a Nut that has two Kernels in it,
they are both included within the ſame Shell, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49419:101"/>
are each inveſted in their proper Membrane; ſo
Twins are both incloſed in one <hi>Chorion,</hi> but have
each a particular <hi>Amnios.</hi> It inveſts the <hi>Ovum</hi>
originally, which <hi>Ovum</hi> being brought into the
Womb and becoming a Conception, this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
imbibes the moiſture that bedews the
Womb plentifully at that time. For whiles the
Conception is looſe in the Womb, and has no
Veſſels that reach out of it ſelf, nor is faſten'd to
any part, it muſt have its increaſe after the ſame
manner as the Egg has in Hens, <q>which while it

without, procure to themſelves Whites out of
the water; or as Beans, Peaſe and other pulſe,
and Bread-corn being ſteep'd in moiſture ſwell,
and thence acquire aliment for the bud that is
ſpringing out of them: ſo in like manner out
of the <hi>plicae</hi> or wrinkles of the Womb (as out
of a Dug or Womb-cake) does there an albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous
moiſture ſlow, whence the Yelk (by
that vegetative and innate heat, and faculty
wherewith it is endued) gathers and concocts its
White. And therefore in thoſe <hi>Plicae</hi> and the
hollow of the Womb does there plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
a liquor reſembling the taſte of the White.
And thus the Yelk deſcending by little and little
is encompaſſed with a White, till at laſt in the

outmoſt <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> having aſſumed Membranes and
a Shell,</q> it is perfected] Thus I ſay does the
<hi>Chorion</hi> imbibe that albugineous liquor that from
the firſt Conception increaſes daily in it (and
tranſudes through the <hi>Amnios</hi> wherein the <hi>Embryo</hi>
ſwims) till the Umbilical veſſels and the <hi>Placenta</hi>
are formed, from and through which the <hi>Foetus</hi>
may receive nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>This liquor that it imbibes I take to be nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
juice that ouzes out of the capillary orifices of
the Hypogaſtrick and Spermatick arteries,<note place="margin">Its liquor.</note> and is
of the ſame nature with that which afterwards is
ſeparated in the <hi>Placenta</hi> and carried to the <hi>Foetus</hi>
by the Umbilical vein, and with that alſo which
abounds in the <hi>Amnios</hi> even till the birth. For
the plaſtick or vegetative virtue is only in the
<hi>Ovum</hi> it ſelf, and the augmentation that the firſt
lineaments of the <hi>Embryo</hi> receive, is only by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of this nutritious albugineous juice. But
this Membrane <hi>Chorion</hi> by that time the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Veſſels and <hi>Placenta</hi> are formed, is grown ſo
denſe and compact, that it is not capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing
more; but that which at this time is in it,
does in ſmall time tranſude into the <hi>Amnios,</hi> and
ſo it ſelf becomes empty, and gives way to the
encreaſe of the <hi>Allantois,</hi> (which thenceforward
begins to appear) whoſe liquor augments daily
as the <hi>Foetus</hi> grows nearer and nearer to the birth.
This is my conjecture, which I ſubmit to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the learned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Amnios</hi> is the inmoſt Membrane that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
contains the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amnios.</note> It is not knit to
the <hi>Chorion</hi> in any place ſave where the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
veſſels paſs through them both into the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa.</hi>
It is very thin, ſoft, ſmooth and pellucid,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49419:102"/>
and encompaſſes the <hi>Foetus</hi> very looſly. It has
Veſſels from the ſame origines as the <hi>Chorion.</hi> It
is ſomething of an oval ſhape.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Ovum</hi> be impregnated,<note place="margin">Its liquor.</note> this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
contains a limpid liquor, which after the
impregnation is that out of which the <hi>Embryo</hi> is
formed. In it reſides the plaſtick power and the
matter alſo out of which the firſt lineaments of
the <hi>Embryo</hi> are drawn. But becauſe its liquor is
ſo very little, there tranſudes through this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
preſently part of that nutritious albugine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humour that is contained in the <hi>Chorion,</hi>
which it had imbibed out of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> as was
but even now ſhewn, and this Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> calls
<hi>Colliquamentum.</hi> And by the juxta-appoſition or
addition of this humour to the undiſcernible ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of the <hi>Embryo,</hi> it receives its encreaſe.
But though the <hi>Amnios</hi> have its additional nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
liquor at firſt only by tranſudation; yet
when the Umbilical veſſels and the <hi>Placenta</hi> are
formed, it receives it after another manner. For
then being ſeparated from the Mothers Arteries
by the <hi>Placenta</hi> and imbibed by the Umbilical
veins of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> it paſſes directly to its heart,
from whence being driven, a great part of it,
down the <hi>Aorta,</hi> it is ſent forth again by the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical
arteries, out of whoſe capillaries diſperſed
plentifully through the <hi>Amnios</hi> it iſſues into its
Cavity, even as far more groſs and viſcid juices
in taking a purge (or ſometimes critically) ouze
out of the ſmall mouths of the Arteries that gape
into the Inteſtins.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that think they have obſerved
<hi>Venae lacteae</hi> to come directly to the <hi>Placenta,</hi> and
that out of it (as out of the Glands in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49419:102"/>
there ariſe others that convey the
Chyle into the <hi>Amnios:</hi> and this indeed were a
plauſible opinion, if it were grounded on any
certain or frequent obſervation of ſuch Lacteals,
and were not rather invented to avoid ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
with which the former opinion ſeems to
be preſſed.</p>
                  <p>A third Membrane which inveſts the whole
<hi>Foetus</hi> (according to Dr. <hi>Needham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Allantoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> &amp;c.) is that
called <hi>Allantoides,</hi> though improperly as to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
For it is ſo called from its likeneſs to a
Pudding (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Farcimen)</hi> which indeed
it does reſemble in Sheep, Does, Hogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
in Women, as alſo in Mares, it has the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
as the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> betwixt which it
is placed in their whole circumference. Now
though it muſt be ſuppoſed that this as well as
the other two, is originally in the <hi>Ovum,</hi> yet
there is no appearance of it till after the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Veſſels and <hi>Placenta</hi> are formed, and the albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous
liquor (ſo often mentioned) ceaſes to
be imbibed by the <hi>Chorion</hi> out of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus.</hi> But
aſſoon as the <hi>Foetus</hi> begins to be nouriſhed by the
Umbilical veſſels, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> is permeable,
then preſently this Membrane begins to ſhew it
ſelf, containing a very thin liquor, which is the
Urine of the <hi>Foetus</hi> brought into it by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi>
from its Bladder, and with which it is filled daily
more and more till the birth. It is very thin,
ſmooth, ſoft and yet denſe. It may be known
from the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios</hi> by this, that they
have numerous Veſſels diſperſed through them,
but this has not the leaſt viſible Vein or Artery.
It is very hard to ſeparate the <hi>Chorion</hi> from it,
becauſe when it appears, the <hi>Chorion</hi> becomes void
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49419:103"/>
of all liquor, and ſo claps cloſe to it. But to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the birth of the <hi>Foetus</hi> it becomes ſo turgid
with Urine, that the <hi>Amnios</hi> (immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the <hi>Foetus)</hi> ſwims in it, and ſo may moſt
eaſily be diſtinguiſht and ſeparated from it.</p>
                  <p>The liquor that it contains is (as has been
ſaid) the Urine of the <hi>Foetus</hi> brought hither by
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its liquor.</note> For aſſoon as the <hi>Foetus</hi> is perfectly
formed, its Kidneys muſt needs perform their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of ſeparating the <hi>Serum</hi> from the Bloud, for
otherwiſe it would be affected with an <hi>Anaſarca.</hi>
I ſay the <hi>Serum</hi> is ſeparated in the Kidneys and
glides down from thence into the Bladder, in
which it is found pretty plentifull when the <hi>Foetus</hi>
is five or ſix months old. Now it flows not out
of the Bladder by its orifice, becauſe at that time
the Sphincter is too contracted and narrow, and
if it ſhould paſs that way, it would mix with that
nutritious juice in which the <hi>Foetus</hi> ſwims in the
<hi>Amnios,</hi> and wherewith, by taking it in by its
Mouth, it is partly nouriſhed, and ſo would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
and corrupt it, and make it unfit for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Nature therefore has provided it another
<hi>exit</hi> by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus,</hi> inſerted into the bottom of
the Bladder; which though after the Child is
born it grow ſolid like a Ligament, like as the
<hi>Vena umbilicalis</hi> does, yet while the <hi>Foetus</hi> is in the
Womb it is always pervious, and conveys the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
into the <hi>Allantoides</hi> that is placed betwixt the
<hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> where it is collected and
preſerved till the birth.</p>

that the Chyle is brought by Lacteal veſſels ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

indeed if any certain diſcovery had been made of
theſe ſame <hi>Lacteae,</hi> we ſhould have embraced this

to form hypotheſes out of rational notions only,

the nutritious juice ſeparated in the <hi>Placenta</hi> from
the Mothers Arteries. How this ſeparation is
made, and how it is firſt of all turned into Bloud,

which by their branches that are diſperſed
through the <hi>Amnios</hi> diſimbogue it by their little
Mouths into it; for what uſe, ſhall be declared
preſently.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall tranſcribe a material objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the anſwer to it,<note place="margin">How the veſſels paſs through the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note> out of <hi>Diemerbroeck.
Obj.</hi> 
                     <q>How can theſe Veſſels (Vein and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
when they have grown from the belly of
the <hi>Foetus</hi> to that length as to reach the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
penetrate and paſs through them to the
<hi>Placenta? Anſw.</hi> This is done in the ſame
manner as the roots of Herbs, Shurbs and Trees
penetrate into the hard Ground, yea often into
thick Planks, Walls and Stones, (which water
cannot enter) and root themſelves firmly in
them. For juſt ſo the firſt ſharp-pointed and
moſt fine ends of the Umbilical veſſels inſinuate
themſelves by little and little into the pores of
the Membranes (for the figuration of thoſe
pores are fitted for their entrance) and paſs
through them, and yet the liquors contained in
theſe Membranes cannot flow out by them: and
when thoſe Veſſels inhering in the pores grow
more out into length, by little and little the
ſaid pores are more and more widened, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the increaſe of the Veſſels) and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
united unto and grow in them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Umbilical veſſel is the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> or
Urinary veſſel,<note place="margin">Urachus.</note> and it is a ſmall, membranous,
round Pipe, endued with a very ſtrait Cavity,
ariſing from the bottom of the Bladder up to the
Navel, out of which it paſſes along within the
common cover, and opens into the <hi>Allantoides.</hi>
It is more apparently pervious in many of the
larger Brutes than it is in Man, in whom ſome
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49419:105"/>
have denied it any Cavity: but that it is hollow in
him, is confirmed by many Hiſtories of perſons
adult, who having the ordinary urinary paſſage
along the <hi>Penis</hi> ſtopt, the paſſage in this Veſſel
has been unlocked, and they have made water by
the Navel, which could not have been imagin'd
to have happen'd, if it had been originally a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament
without any <hi>Meatus. Bartholin</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have affirmed that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> in Men
reaches no further than the Navel; How then
comes that humour into the <hi>Allantois</hi> that has
perfectly the ſame taſte with the Urine in the
Bladder? But their errour ſprung from hence,
that they thought an humane <hi>Foetus</hi> had no <hi>Allan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois,</hi>
and that humour that is found in it, they
thought had been contained in the <hi>Chorion.</hi> But
this is in ſhort refuted above, but more fully and
accurately by Dr. <hi>Needham, lib. de formato Foetu,
cap. 3.</hi> As to the perviouſneſs of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> I
ſhall add this further, that in abortions of five or
ſix months old, the Bladder of the <hi>Embryo</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
full of Urine, out of which if in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
months it ſhould not be emptied by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
the Bladder would ſoon burſt, ſeeing there
is daily ſome <hi>Serum</hi> ſeparated from the Bloud in
the Kidneys, and ſent to the Bladder; and the
more the <hi>Foetus</hi> increaſes, the more muſt needs be
ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>Its uſe has been ſufficiently declared in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Paragraph;<note place="margin">Its uſe.</note> as alſo above, when we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the uſe of the <hi>Allantoides,</hi> which we ſhall
not repeat.</p>
                  <p>Theſe four Veſſels (as has been ſaid above)
have one common cover,<note place="margin">Funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> which alſo keeps each
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49419:106"/>
of them from touching other. It is called <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulum,</hi>
and <hi>Funiculus</hi> (by which it with its Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
is ſometimes underſtood.) It is membranous,
round and hollow, indifferent thick, conſiſting
of a double coat, (the inner from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi>
and the outer from the <hi>Panniculus carnoſus.)</hi>
Sometimes it ſelf only is wreath'd about like a
Rope, the Veſſels included in it running ſtreight
along its Cavity; and ſometimes they are wreath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together with it.</p>
                  <p>It has ſeveral knots upon it here and there,<note place="margin">Its knots.</note>
which Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> thinks to be <hi>Papillae</hi> or little
Glands through which the lacteal (or nutritious
juice) diſtils out of the capacity of the <hi>Funiculus</hi>
into the Cavity of the <hi>Amnios.</hi> I cannot tell
whether this be ſo or no, but that uſe that doting
Midwives make of them, to gueſs by their number
how many Children more the Mother ſhall have,
and by their colour, whether thoſe Children ſhall
be Male or Female, is moſt ridiculous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious.</p>
                  <p>When the Infant is born,<note place="margin">How to tie the navel-ſtring and cut it off.</note> this Navel-rope is
uſed to be tied, about one or two fingers breadth
from the Navel, with a ſtrong thread caſt about
it ſeveral times, and then about two or three
fingers breadth beyond the Ligature to be cut off.
What is not cut off, is ſuffered to remain till it
drop off of its own accord. Which the longer or
ſhorter while it is a doing, the longer or ſhorter-liv'd,
Women prophecy the Children to be.</p>
                  <p>There have been great diſputes among both
Philoſophers and Phyſicians,<note place="margin">Of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                     </note> with what and by
what way the <hi>Foetus</hi> is nouriſhed. Some affirm
by Bloud only, and that received by the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49419:106"/>
vein; others by Chyle only, received in by
the Mouth: each of which are in an extream.
The truth is, according to the different degrees
of perfection that an <hi>Ovum</hi> paſſes from a Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a <hi>Foetus</hi> ready for the birth, it is nouriſhed
diverſly.</p>
                  <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, by appoſition.</note> aſſoon as an <hi>Ovum</hi> impregnated is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into the Womb, it preſently imbibes
through its outer Membrane ſome of that albugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
liquor that at this time plentifully bedews
the internal ſuperficies of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus;</hi> ſo that
aſſoon as the firſt lineaments of an <hi>Embryo</hi> begin
to be drawn out of that humour contained in the
<hi>Amnios,</hi> they preſently receive increaſe by the
appoſition of the ſaid liquor filtrated out of the
<hi>Chorion</hi> through the <hi>Amnios</hi> into its Cavity. And
this ſame liquor that thus encreaſeth the firſt ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of the <hi>Embryo</hi> is called by Dr. <hi>Harvey
Colliquamentum</hi> (as was noted above.) That
this way of nutrition or augmentation of the
<hi>Embryo</hi> is poſſible, need not be doubted by him
that conſiders, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> of a Sow have no
other poſſible way of being nouriſhed till ſhe is
near gone half with Pig; <q>for even till then,
ſaith Dr. <hi>Needham,</hi> the <hi>Chorion</hi> cleaves not to
the Womb, but look as many <hi>Foetus</hi> as there are,
there are ſo many Eggs as it were without
Shells, neither ſticking to the Womb nor to
one another; but when one opens the Matrix,
they all tumble out of their own accord. There
are no Glandules, no <hi>Placenta.</hi> But the <hi>Chorion</hi>
which is ſoft and porous, does like a Spunge
imbibe or ſuck up the ſerous liquor that ſweats
out of the inmoſt Membrane of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> to
be afterwards ſwallowed by the Veins,</q> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49419:107"/>
he means the mouths of the Umbilical vein,
after the ſaid Vein is ſo perfectly formed as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it.) But of this more in the beginning of
the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p>But when the parts of the <hi>Embryo</hi> begin to be a
little more perfect,<note place="margin">2. By the umbilical vein.</note> and the <hi>Chorion</hi> becomes ſo
denſe that not any more of the ſaid liquor is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
by it, the Umbilical veſſels begin to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and to extend to the ſide of the <hi>Amnios,</hi>
which they penetrate, and both the Vein and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
paſs alſo through the <hi>Allantois</hi> and <hi>Chorion,</hi>
and are implanted into the <hi>Placenta,</hi> that at this
time, firſt gathering upon the <hi>Chorion,</hi> joins it to
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus.</hi> And now the Hypogaſtrick and
Spermatick arteries, that before ſpued out the
nutritious juice into the Cavity of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi>
open by their orifices into the <hi>Placenta,</hi> where
(whether by meer percolation through it, or by
ſome ſort of fermentation alſo, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
but) they depoſite the ſaid juice, which is
abſorbed by the Umbilical vein, and by it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
firſt to the Liver, then to the Heart of the
<hi>Foetus,</hi> where the thinner and more ſpirituous part
of it is turned into Bloud. But the more groſs
and terrene part of it deſcending by the <hi>Aorta</hi>
enters the Umbilical arteries, and by thoſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of them that run through the <hi>Amnios,</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
into its Cavity. They that will laugh
at this paſſage of the nutritious juice, becauſe it
is made by this doctrine to chooſe its way as if it
were ſome animal or even rational Creature, let
them avoid the like treatment if they can while
they deliver, that the Chyle paſſes immediately
either from the Meſentery, the <hi>Receptaculum</hi> or
<hi>Ductus communis</hi> to the <hi>Placenta,</hi> when a <hi>Foetus</hi> is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49419:107"/>
in the Womb. 'Pray how ſhould the Chyle
know, or the Lacteals by which it paſſes, that
there is any <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, that the one
ſhould offer to go that way, and the other
give it way to go thither at that time, whereas
the paſſage is ſhut at all other times? yet this
my Opponents maintain. As alſo how comes
the Chyle preſently to turn its courſe after the
<hi>Foetus</hi> is born, and inſtead of deſcending to the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> aſcend to the Breaſts? What mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cauſe can be aſſigned to theſe and many other
the like <hi>Phaenomena?</hi> We muſt therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to reſolve ſome things into the admirable
and unintelligible diſpoſal of our wiſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
                  <p>But there lies another objection againſt this
opinion, Becauſe it allows none of the Mothers
Bloud to be received by the <hi>Foetus</hi> through the
Umbilical vein, but only <hi>Succus nutritius;</hi> how
ſhould Bloud be firſt bred in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> ſeeing it
has Bloud, before the Liver or Heart, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part that conduce to ſanguification, are in
a capacity to perform their office?</p>
                  <p>I confeſs it is inexplicable by me how Bloud
ſhould be made ſo ſoon; but that it may be and
is made, out of the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi> or <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi>
without the mixture of any from the
Mother, is apparent from the moſt accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> concerning the order
of the generation of the parts in a Chicken,
(which from firſt to laſt receives nothing from
the Hen.) Says he,<note n="*" place="margin">De ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. 51.</note> 
                     <q>there appears at the
very firſt a red leaping <hi>Punctum</hi> or Speck, a
beating Bladder, and Fibres drawn from thence
containing Bloud in them. And as much as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49419:108"/>
one can diſcern by accurate inſpection; bloud is
made, before the leaping ſpeck is formed; and
the ſame is endowed with vital heat, before it is
ſtirred by the Pulſe: and as the pulſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
in the bloud and from it; ſo at length, at
the point of death it ends in it.—And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the beating Bladder and the ſanguineous
Fibres that are produced from it, appear firſt
of all; I ſhould think it conſentaneous to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that the bloud be before its receptacles;
namely the content before its container; and
that this is made for the ſake of the other.</q>
He confeſſes it to be a <hi>paradox,</hi> that bloud ſhould
be made and moved, and endued with vital ſpirit
before any ſanguifying or motive organs are in
being; and that the Body ſhould be nouriſhed and
increaſed, before the organs appointed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
(namely the Stomach and Bowels) are
formed: but neither of theſe are greater para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes
than that there ſhould be ſenſe and motion
in the <hi>Foetus</hi> before the Brain is compoſed; and
yet, ſays he,<note n="*" place="margin">Exercit. 57.</note> 
                     <q>The <hi>Foetus</hi> moves, contracts and
ſtretches out it ſelf, when there is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
for a Brain but clear water.</q> I ſay if
all theſe unlikely things do certainly come to paſs
in an Egg, that has nothing to ſet the vegetative,
or vital principle thereof on work, but the
warmth of the Hen that ſits upon it; why ſhould
we think it ſtrange that nutritious juice impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with the vital ſpirits of the Arterial bloud,
with which it circulated through the Mothers
Heart (it may be more than once) ſhould be
turned into bloud in an humane <hi>Foetus</hi> (foſtered
with ſuch kindly warmth in the Womb) though
it neither receive any humour under the form of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49419:108"/>
bloud from the Mother, nor have it ſelf as yet any
organs of ſanguification ſo perfect as to perform
their office? But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The groſſer nutritious juice being depoſited by
the Umbilical arteries in the <hi>Amnios,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. By the Mouth.</note> aſſoon as
the Mouth, Gullet and Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are formed
ſo perfectly that the <hi>Foetus</hi> can ſwallow, it ſucks
in ſome of the ſaid juice, which deſcending into
the Stomach and Inteſtins is received by the <hi>Venae
lacteae,</hi> as in adult perſons.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Foetus</hi> is nouriſhed this way, <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck</hi>
evinces by theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>1. Becauſe the Stomach of the <hi>Foetus</hi> is never
empty, but is found poſſeſt of a milky whitiſh
liquor; and ſuch like is contained even in its
Mouth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2. Becauſe there are <hi>Faeces</hi> contained in the
Inteſtins, (which Philoſophers call <hi>Meconium)</hi>
which the Infant aſſoon as 'tis born voids by
ſtool. Without doubt theſe are the excrements
of ſome aliment taken in by the Mouth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>3. Becauſe the Stomach could not preſently
after the birth perform the function of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
if it had not at all been accuſtomed to
it in the Womb.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His fourth reaſon, ſuppoſing the <hi>Foetus</hi> to be
nouriſhed in part by the Mothers bloud, I ſhall
not recite, becauſe I think that to be an erroneous
opinion, as I think to make appear by and by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>5. Becauſe the Infant aſſoon as it is born
knows how to ſuck the Breaſt, which it could
not be ſuppoſed to be ſo dextrous at, if while
it remained in the Womb it had taken nothing
by ſuction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>6. Becauſe many Infants aſſoon as they are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49419:109"/>
born, before they have ſucked any Breaſt, or
taken any thing by the Mouth, vomit up a
milky aliment: which therefore muſt needs be
received into their Stomach in the Womb.</q>
This he gives an inſtance of in one of his own
Children.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Arguments I think ſufficient to prove
what they are alledged for; but when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he
would afterwards prove that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is alſo
nouriſhed by the Mothers bloud conveyed by the
Umbilical vein, I think his reaſons are invalid.
For he ſays it muſt be ſo, <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe the ſaid
Vein is implanted into the <hi>Placenta;</hi> (but this is
but begging the queſtion, for 'tis neceſſary it
ſhould be implanted into it though it receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from it but nutritious juice.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the great quantity of bloud that will iſſue
out of the Umbilical vein, if one tie the Navel-rope
and then open the ſaid Vein betwixt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature
and <hi>Placenta:</hi> for he ſays there will flow
out four times as much bloud as could be ſuppoſed
to be contained in the ſmall Arteries on that ſide
the Ligature next the <hi>Placenta.</hi> I anſwer, that
firſt one would be well ſatisfied that the Ligature
was made ſo ſtrait, that there could no bloud paſs
through it from the <hi>Foetus</hi> to the <hi>Placenta.</hi> And
ſecondly it cannot exactly be gueſſed how much
bloud may be contained in the <hi>Foetus</hi>'s Arteries in
the <hi>Placenta,</hi> ſo as that one ſhould be certain that
there does four times more flow out by the Vein.
But laſtly, ſuppoſe there do four times as much
more bloud iſſue out of the Vein as is contained in
the <hi>Foetus</hi>'s Arteries that are on that ſide the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature
next the <hi>Placenta,</hi> and this bloud come
from the Dam's Hypogaſtrick and Spermatick
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49419:109"/>
arteries; I ſay there will not only four times,
but forty times as much iſſue therefrom, for all
the bloud of the Dam might then be drawn out
this way. Wherefore I think this experiment
makes much more againſt his opinion than for it.
His <hi>third</hi> reaſon is the neceſſity of it; becauſe as
the <hi>Foetus</hi> increaſes, it needs much aliment, and
its weak Bowels can concoct but little, it muſt
therefore have ſome purera liment, and which is
already concocted (he means bloud) to nouriſh
it, and by its commixture to help forward the
changing the aliment received by the Mouth into
bloud. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This reaſon himſelf invalidates
in the next Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">Anat. corp. hum. p. 367.</note> where he confeſſes that
the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb is nouriſhed in the ſame
manner as the Chicken in an Egg, which receives
increaſe firſt by the <hi>inner</hi> White (as he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes)
by way of appoſition; ſecondly it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
nouriſhment in by the Mouth from the
<hi>outer</hi> White, and at the ſame time its Umbilical
veſſels enter the Yelk (to draw nouriſhment from
thence) which, he ſays indeed, reſembles the
Mothers bloud, but ſeeing it has not the leaſt
form of bloud, why would it not be more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſaid that it is inſtead of the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi>
that the <hi>Foetus</hi> in viviparous Animals receives by
the Navel-vein? And ſeeing theſe ſeveral li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
are turned, part of them, into bloud in a
Chicken, without any of the Hens bloud to <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
them (as he ſpeaks;) why ſhould not the
ſame power be granted to the vegetative or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſoul of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, without any
aſſiſtance from the Mothers bloud? To which I
ſhall add another Argument (out of Dr. <hi>Harvey)</hi>
taken from Caeſarean births, when living Infants
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49419:110"/>
are cut out of the Mothers Womb, after ſhe is
dead. For if it had its life and heat from the
Mothers bloud; ſurely it ſhould die aſſoon as ſhe
at leaſt, if not ſooner: for when death approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the ſubordinate parts do languiſh and grow
cold before the principal; and therefore the
Heart fails laſt of all. Wherefore the bloud of
the <hi>Foetus</hi> would firſt loſe its heat, and become
unfit for its office if it were derived from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Womb; ſeeing her Womb is deſtitute of
all vital heat, before her Heart. But enough of
this.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may object, If the <hi>Foetus</hi> be nouriſhed
by none of the Mothers bloud, why ſhould her
<hi>Menſes</hi> be ſtopt all or moſt of the while ſhe is
with Child? To which I anſwer, that 'tis for
the ſame reaſon that Nurſes that give ſuck com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
want them alſo; for as in Nurſes the chyle
paſſes in a great proportion to the Breaſts,
whereby the bloud being defrauded of its due and
wonted ſhare does not encreaſe to that degree as
to need to be leſſened by the flowing of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
ſo in Women with Child, there is ſo great a
quantity of the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi> (which is only
chyle a little refined and impregnated with vital
ſpirit) that paſſes to the <hi>Placenta</hi> by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtrick
and Spermatick arteries for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> that unleſs the Mother be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſanguine, her <hi>Menſes</hi> intermit after the firſt or
ſecond month.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude therefore, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is
nouriſhed three ſeveral ways, but only by one
humour: firſt by appoſition of it whiles it is yet
an imperfect, <hi>Embryo</hi> and has not the Umbilical

from thoſe of an adult perſon.</head>
                  <p>HAving delivered the hiſtory of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> we
will only further ſhew in what parts a <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in the Womb differs from an adult perſon.
And this we cannot do more exactly than in the
manner that <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> has reckon'd them,
whom therefore we ſhall here tranſlate, with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
alteration.</p>
                  <p>This diverſity, he ſaith, conſiſts in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of magnitude, figure, ſituation, number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
uſe, colour, cavity, hardneſs, motion, excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and ſtrength of the parts.</p>
                  <p>Now this diverſity is conſpicuous either in the
whole Body, or in the ſeveral Ventricles, or in
the Limbs.</p>
                  <p>There is conſiderable in the whole Body,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:49419:111"/>
1. The littleneſs of all the parts.</p>
                  <p>2. The reddiſh colour of the whole.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſoftneſs of the Bones; whereof many
are as yet griſtly and flexible, and that by ſo much
the more, by how much the <hi>Foetus</hi> is further from
maturity.</p>
                  <p>In the Head there are ſeveral differences. As</p>
                  <p>1. The Head in reſpect to the proportion of
the reſt of the Body is bigger, and the ſhape of
the Face leſs neat.</p>
                  <p>2. The bones of the Skull are ſofter, and the
Crown is not covered with bone, but onely with
a Membrane.</p>
                  <p>3. The bone of the Forehead is divided, as
alſo of the under Jaw: and the <hi>Os cuneiforme</hi> is
divided into four.</p>
                  <p>4. The bone of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or hinder part of
the Head is diſtinguiſht into three, four or five
bones.</p>
                  <p>5. The Brain is ſofter and more fluid, and the
Nerves very ſoft.</p>
                  <p>6. The bones that ſerve the ſenſe of Hearing
are wonderfully hard and big.</p>
                  <p>7. The Teeth lie hid in the little holes of the
Jaw-bone.</p>
                  <p>There is no leſs diverſity in the <hi>Thorax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

new born whether Male or Female, a ſerous Milk
iſſues forth ſometimes of its own accord, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a light preſſure: yet there are no
Glandules very conſpicuous, but there is ſome
faſhion of a Nipple.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>brae</hi> of the Back want their ſpinous
proceſſes, and are each one made of three diſtinct
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49419:111"/>
Bones, whoſe mutual concourſe form that hole
whereby the ſpinal marrow deſcends.</p>
                  <p>3. The Heart is remarkably big, and its <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
large.</p>
                  <p>4. There are two unions of the greater Veſſels,
that are not conſpicuous in adult perſons: <hi>viz.</hi>
1. The <hi>Foramen ovale,</hi> by which there is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
open out of the <hi>Cava</hi> into the <hi>Vena pulmonaris</hi>
juſt as each of them are opening the firſt into the
right Ventricle, and the latter into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of the Heart. And this <hi>Foramen</hi> juſt as it
opens into the <hi>Vena pulmonaris</hi> has a Valve that
hinders any thing from returning out of the ſaid
Vein into the <hi>Foramen.</hi> 2. The <hi>Canalis arterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
which two fingers breadth from the <hi>baſis</hi> of the
Heart joins the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> to the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
It has a pretty large Cavity, and aſcends a little
obliquely from the ſaid Artery to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> into
which it conveys the bloud that was driven into
the pulmonary Artery out of the right Ventricle
of the Heart, ſo that it never comes in the left
Ventricle; even as that bloud that is ſent out of
the left Ventricle into the <hi>Aorta</hi> never came in
the right, (except a little that is returned from
the nutrition of the Lungs) but paſſed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
into it out of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> by the <hi>Foramen
ovale.</hi> So that the bloud paſſes not through both
the Ventricles as it does after the <hi>Foetus</hi> is born,
for then it muſt have had its courſe through the
Lungs, which it cannot have, becauſe they are
now very denſe and lie idle and unmoved. Yea
they are ſo denſe and heavy that if one throw
them into water they will ſink, whereas if the
<hi>Foetus</hi> be but born and take only half a dozen
breaths, they become ſo ſpongy and light that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49419:112"/>
they will ſwim. Which (by the way) may be
of good uſe to diſcover whether thoſe Infants
that are killed by Whores, and which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
affirm were ſtill-born, were really ſo or no.
For if they were ſtill-born the Lungs will ſink,
but if alive, (ſo as to breath never ſo little a
while) they will ſwim.</p>
                  <p>5. The Gland <hi>Thymus</hi> is notably large, and
conſiſts as it were of three Glands.</p>
                  <p>In the lower Belly there are theſe differences.</p>
                  <p>1. The Umbilical veſſels go out of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Stomach is narrower, yet not empty,
but pretty full of a whitiſh liquor.</p>
                  <p>3. The Caul is hardly diſcernible, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like a Spiders web.</p>
                  <p>4. The Guts are ſeven times longer (or more)
than the Body.</p>
                  <p>5. In the ſmall Guts the excrements are pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
and yellow, but in the thick ſomewhat
hard and blackiſh, ſometimes greeniſh: the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
is larger than uſual, and often filled with
<hi>Fae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>6. The Liver is very large, filling not only
the right Hypochondre, but extends it ſelf into
the left ſide, and covers all the upper part of the
Stomach. It has a paſſage now more than in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult
called <hi>Canalis venoſus,</hi> which ariſing out of the
<hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a</hi> carries the greateſt part of what
is brought by the Umbilical vein directly and in a
full ſtream into the <hi>Cava</hi> above the Liver; but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as the Infant is born, and nothing comes any
longer by the ſaid Vein, this <hi>Canalis</hi> preſently clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as the Vein it ſelf turns to a Ligament; as alſo
do the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> and the two Umbilical arteries.</p>

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:49419:112"/>
7. The Spleen is ſmall.</p>
                  <p>8. The Gall-bladder is full of yellow or green
choler.</p>
                  <p>9. The Sweet-bread is very large and white.</p>
                  <p>10. The Kidneys are bigger and unequal in
their ſuperficies, and look as if they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of a collection of very many Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>Renes ſuccenturiati</hi> are exceeding
large; they do not only border upon the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
as in the adult, but lie upon them, and
embrace their upper part with a large <hi>Sinus</hi> as it
were.</p>
                  <p>12. The Ureters are wide, and the Bladder
diſtended with Urine.</p>
                  <p>13. In Females the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> is depreſſed, the
<hi>Tubae</hi> long, and the <hi>Teſtes</hi> very large.</p>
                  <p>The difference in the Limbs conſiſts</p>
                  <p>1. In the tenderneſs and ſoftneſs of the
Bones.</p>
                  <p>2. The little bones of the Wriſt and Inſtep are
griſtly and not firmly joyned together.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Foetus</hi> ſwimming in the liquor of the

it muſt needs have ſcope enough to change its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and that is the reaſon that Anatomiſts
differ ſo much about it. But according to Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Harvey</hi> its uſual poſture is thus.</p>

                     <q>Its Knees are drawn up to the Belly,<note place="margin">The poſture of the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the Womb.</note> its Legs
bending backwards, its Feet acroſs, and its
hands lifted up to its Head, one of which it
holds to the Temple or Ear, the other to the
Cheek; where there are white ſpots on the
Skin as if it had been rubb'd upon. The Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
turns round, the Head hanging down
towards its Knees. Its Head is upwards and
its Face commonly towards the Mothers
Back.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But towards the birth (ſometimes a week or
two before) it alters its ſituation,<note place="margin">At its birth.</note> and tumbles
down with its Head to the neck of the Womb,
with its Feet upwards. Then the Womb alſo
ſettles downwards and its orifice relaxes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.
And the <hi>Foetus</hi> being now ill at eaſe ſprawls
and moves it ſelf this way and that way, whereby
it tears the Membranes wherein it is included, ſo
that the Waters (as they call them) flow into
the <hi>Vagina,</hi> which they make ſlippery for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
egreſs of the Infant: though ſometimes the
Membranes burſt not but come forth whole, (as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49419:113"/>
they do commonly in Brutes.) At the ſame time
the neighbouring parts are looſened and become
fit for diſtenſion: the joyntings of the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi>
and <hi>Pecten</hi> with the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Oſſa
pubis</hi> are ſo relaxed, that they yield very much to
the paſſage of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> And its motion gives
that diſturbance to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> that preſently the
animal ſpirits are ſent plentifully by the Nerves to
its conſtrictory Fibres, and the Muſcles of the
<hi>Abdomen,</hi> which all contracting together, very
ſtrongly expell the <hi>Foetus,</hi> which (in the moſt
natural birth) goes with the Head foremoſt:
and if the Feet or any other part (beſides the
Head) do offer it ſelf firſt, the travail is always
more painfull and dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral ſorts of Creatures have ſundry
terms of going with young:<note place="margin">The term of going with child.</note> The ſtated and moſt
uſual time of Women is nine months; though
ſome bring forth ſome weeks ſooner and others
later. But when it is given out that perfect and
ſprightly Infants are born at ſeven months end;
it is either to hide the faults of ſome new-married
Woman, or from the miſtake of the ignorant
Mother. As alſo when ſometimes the Mother
has affirmed her ſelf to go eleven months or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
it is either through miſtake, or to keep

dead without an Heir, for which the cunning

                  <p>Secondly, the Skin of the back-parts is of a
more exquiſite feeling: firſt, becauſe many twigs

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeveral branches of theſe <hi>Tubuli</hi> amongſt

therefore do believe that there are ſome <hi>Venae lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teae</hi>
that conduct the Chyle directly to the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</hi>
But from whence thoſe Lacteals have their

they ſhould not agree concerning their riſe,
ſeeing the opinion is grounded more upon ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conjecture, than ocular diſcovery. For as
was ſaid in the former Book (Chap. 32.) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing

the Chyle to the Breaſts, where it comes to
be called Milk. But with all due reſpect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Eſpouſers of this Hypotheſis (ſuch

                     </note>
Which how it is done, we ſhall ſhew in as few
words as may be.</p>
                  <p>It was an old opinion that Milk was made of
Bloud ſent from the Womb by the Epigaſtrick
veſſels aſcending, and as was thought inoſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with thoſe branches of the <hi>Mammariae</hi> that
deſcend towards the Navel. But as later Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
have found thoſe anaſtomoſes only imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(invented to ſerve an Hypotheſis;) ſo it is
generally denied that either Bloud ſent from the
Womb, or from whereſoever, is the true matter
out of which Milk is made. For not to mention
(which yet is very conſiderable) that it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
that the Mother could every day endure the
loſs of ſo much Bloud (ſuppoſe a pound and half)
as the Child ſucks daily Milk from the Breaſts; I
think the argument urged by Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
any Man. <hi>Viz.</hi> 
                     <q>Nature does nothing in
vain; ſhe goes not forward and backward by the
ſame path. But if ſhe make Bloud of Chyle
<hi>(which is certain)</hi> and then make Chyle of
Bloud again, ſhe goes ſo. For Chyle is a ſort
of Milk, as appears by the opening of the Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teal
veins. If therefore that Chyle be firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
into Bloud, and then return again to the
nature of Milk, Nature ſhould certainly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
her firſt work.]</q> We ſhall not therefore
ſpend further time to refute ſo improbable (and
now obſolete) an opinion; but ſhall avow, that
Chyle is the true matter out of which Milk is
made, which is done after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:49419:120"/>
The Chyle being received into the common
receptacle from the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> of the Meſentery,<note place="margin">How milk is made.</note>
aſcends up by the <hi>Ductus thoracicus,</hi> and by it is
conveyed into the ſubclavian Veins, where it is
mixed with the Bloud, and from whence it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
with it through the ventricles of the
Heart. And when it comes out of the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
by the <hi>Aorta,</hi> a good part of it (as yet not
aſſimilated to the Bloud) is ſent to the Breaſts
by the Mammary and Thoracick arteries, whoſe
Capillaries are inſerted into the Glands, through
which it is ſtrained or filtrated into the <hi>Tubuli
lactiferi,</hi> even as the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from <hi>it</hi> by the Glands of the Kidneys into
their <hi>Tubuli</hi> or Syphons. And as thoſe Syphons
of the Kidneys carry the <hi>Serum</hi> into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> ſo
do theſe of the <hi>Mammae,</hi> the Milk into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
duct of the Nipple. As for the Bloud that
came along with the Chyle to the Glands, that
returns back again into the Subclavian and Axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
veins, and ſo to the Heart.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this matter of the Milk <hi>(viz.</hi> Chyle)
Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> (ſuitable to his Hypotheſis of the
<hi>Succus nutritius</hi> of the Nerves) thinks that the
Nerves contribute their ſhare, which he calls
ſpermatick, for the nouriſhment and encreaſe of
the ſpermatick parts of the Child. But if it
ſhould be ſuppoſed that the Nerves have ſuch
<hi>Succus</hi> in them (which we do not believe) what
weakneſs muſt it needs induce upon the Mother to
have ſo much of it (with the animal ſpirits)
daily drain'd out of them? whereas we ſee that
many Women are more chearfull and healthfull
when they give ſuck, than at other times. We
cannot therefore conſent to that opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:49419:121"/>
And here a moſt difficult queſtion may ariſe,
why the Chyle (whether it be brought by ſome
<hi>Venae lacteae,</hi> or by the Arteries) flows only to the
Breaſts at ſome certain times, and not always,
ſeeing the Veſſels that carry it are not obliterated,
nor it ſelf exhauſted.</p>
                  <p>They that taught,<note place="margin">Why it flows to the breaſts at ſome times only.</note> that the Milk was made of
Bloud, and that that Bloud was ſent from the
Womb by the Hypogaſtrick veſſels inoſculating
with the Mammary; theſe I ſay deriving the
Milk from the Menſtrual bloud as its matter out
of which it is made, thought that the ſtopping of
the <hi>Menſes</hi> (as commonly happens to Nurſes,
unleſs very plethorick) occaſioned the regurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Bloud by the ſaid Veſſels up to the
Breaſts, where ſo free a vent was found for it,
after it was firſt changed into Milk by their Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.
They aſſigned the ſame bloud for the
nouriſhment of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, and that
after the birth it aſcended up to the Breaſts.
But having in the former Book (Chap. 33.)
ſhewn that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is not nouriſhed at all by
the Mothers bloud, as alſo in this Chapter that
Milk is not made of it; we need not (though it
were eaſie to) ſhew how ill this Hypotheſis would
ſatisfy the queſtion, if Bloud ſhould be ſuppoſed
the material cauſe of the Milk. And indeed it is
far eaſier to invalidate the reaſons that have been
urged for it, than to produce any new ones that
are more ſatisfactory. For as above (in Book I.)
diſcourſing of the manner and matter of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, we ſcrupled not
to expoſe our ſelves to the ſmiles of our ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagacious
<hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> in reſolving all into the wiſe
diſpoſal of the Creatour; ſo we ſhall not be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49419:121"/>
aſhamed to profeſs our (I think invincible) ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in this alſo, and acquieſce in the wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Nature. However we will not omit
to give <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi>'s opinion, which if it cannot
ſatisfy, may for its ingeniouſneſs delight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The cauſe of it (ſays he) is a <hi>ſtrong imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
or an intenſe and often thinking of
Milk, Breaſts and their Suction, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
wonderfull things in our Bodies: not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſimply of it ſelf, but by mediation of the
appetitive power, or of the paſſions of the
mind, which induce various motions on the
ſpirits and humours. So the imagination and
thinking of a great danger maketh a Man
tremble, fall, be cold, fall into a ſwoon, yea
hath ſometimes turn'd all the hairs grey in a
ſhort time: The imagination of a joyfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cauſeth heat and animoſity of the Body:
thinking on a ſhamefull thing, or a view of it,
cauſeth bluſhing; thinking on a terrible thing,
paleneſs; on a ſad thing, cold. Luſtfull
thoughts make the Body hot, relax the ſtrict
Genitals of Women, erect the <hi>Penis,</hi> and do ſo
open the ſeminary ways that are otherwiſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that Seed iſſueth out of its own accord
in involuntary or nocturnal pollution. The
ſame intenſe imagination <hi>(adds he)</hi> and
a deſirous cogitation of ſuckling the Infant, is
the Cauſe that the Chyliferous veſſels <hi>(by which
he means</hi> Venae lacteae <hi>properly ſo called)</hi> are
looſened and opened towards the Breaſts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if ſome outward cauſes tending that way
favour and further incite that ſtrong imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

ſtraitned, ſometimes relaxed, as every
one knows; and according to that different
conſtriction or relaxation the Bloud and other
impelled humours, flow ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leſs into the parts; and ſometimes beget
heat, ſoftneſs, redneſs; ſometimes conſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
cold and paleneſs. Amongſt theſe impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
humours is the Chyle,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—] To
confirm this opinion he gives ſeveral inſtances
wherein nothing but imagination could move the
Chyle to tend to the Breaſts. His firſt is that
known ſtory of <hi>Santorellus,</hi> 
                     <q>That a poor Man's
Wife dying, and not having Means enough to
hire a Nurſe for the Infant ſhe had left behind
her, he uſed, (to ſtill it a little) often to lay
it to his Paps (without doubt (ſays <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck)</hi>
with a great deſire to yield it ſome
Milk) and ſo at length by that intenſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
thought, and often repeated ſucking of
the <hi>Papillae,</hi> his Breaſts afforded Milk enough
for the ſuckling the Infant.</q> (Which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the
way, ſeems to make much againſt his opinion of
the Chyle's being conveyed to the <hi>Mammae</hi> by the
<hi>Venae lacteae;</hi> for ſeeing Men according to Nature
give no ſuck, to what purpoſe ſhould <hi>Venae lacteae</hi>
be diſtributed to their <hi>Mammillae?</hi> and yet here is
an inſtance of a Man giving ſuck, and therefore
the Chyle is more likely to be brought by the
Arteries, which Men have as well as Women:
unleſs we will grant that force to imagination,
to make <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> as well as to ſend the Chyle
by them, which would be an equal force of
imagination to imagine. But to proceed.) He
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49419:122"/>
tells another ſtory of an old Woman that came to
give ſuck, and he delivers it with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as may create a belief of the truth of it.
<q>At <hi>Vyanen</hi> a Town not far from us <hi>(viz.</hi> from
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> in which Province it is) about thirty
years agoe there was an Hoſteſs that kept the
Bores-head Inne without the Gate, who was
brought to bed a little after her Husbands
death, and died in Child-bed or very ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
leaving a healthfull Child behind her:
and having left very little Eſtate, her Mother
whoſe name was <hi>Joan Vuyltuyt,</hi> being alſo poor
and not able to put it out to Nurſe, yet had
ſuch pity on her Daughters Child, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to nouriſh it, and ſhe was now threeſcore
and ſix years old. Now having ſometimes uſed,
with the greateſt commiſeration, to hold it to
her Breaſts when it cried, and offered it the
Nipple to ſuck; by that ſtrong imagination,
and deſirous cogitation of nouriſhing the Infant,
her Breaſts began to give Milk, and that in a
few days ſo plentifully, as was abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to feed the Child, ſo that it had ſcarce any
need of other ſuſtenance: and ſo, to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all, the Infant was well nouriſhed
with the Milk of this old Woman, whoſe
Breaſts for many years had been wither'd and
flaggy, but now became plump and full like a
young Woman's. There are many ſtill alive in
that City that remember the thing very well.]</q>
I confeſs the ſtory is very odd, but whether to be
reſolved into the force of imagination I leave the
curious to meditate. However he very plauſibly
anſwers ſeveral objections that may be made
againſt it, which it will be worth the while for

                  <p>The Veins and Arteries according to <hi>Spigelius</hi>
run between the two Membranes of the <hi>Pleura,</hi>
and therefore he thinks that when an inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the matter is rather gathered betwixt its
Membranes than betwixt the Intercoſtal muſcles

                  <p>The ſecond proper internal containing part is
the <hi>Mediaſtinum:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaſtinum.</hi>
                     </note> ſo called becauſe it ſtandeth in

                  <p>It ſpringeth from the Membranes of the <hi>Pleura</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Its riſe.</note> (as was ſaid before) ſo
that at its riſe it conſiſts of four Membranes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Pleura,</hi> of the duplicature whereof it is

tends from the <hi>Sternum</hi> through the middle of the
<hi>Thorax</hi> towards the Back, its duplicated Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
are ſo ſevered, that the Heart with its
<hi>Pericardium</hi> are contained in its Cavity. Yet
when they arrive near the Back, they join again
as cloſe as they did at the Breaſt, though they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49419:124"/>
preſently part again, (ſaith <hi>Diemerbroeck)</hi> and
make another narrower Cavity, but as long, for
the Gullet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to deſcend by. Some have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
imagined a third Cavity at its origine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Sternum,</hi> wherein they thought there were
ſometimes collected corrupt humours, that were
the cauſe of many occult Diſtempers. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if the diſſection be begun at the <hi>Sternum,</hi>
when one has pull'd it off from the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi>
one would think at firſt ſight that there were as
great a diſtance betwixt the Membranes of the
<hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> as the <hi>Sternum</hi> is broad. But it is a
great errour, for if one begin the Section at the
Back and looſe the Ribs there, and ſo come to
the <hi>Sternum,</hi> he will ſee the <hi>Pleura</hi> doubled knit
cloſe to the <hi>Sternum</hi> without any Cavity.</p>

the task of reſpiration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it holdeth up the Heart incloſed in
the <hi>Pericardium</hi> ſo, that it may not reſt upon the
Back-bone, when we lie upon our Back; or fall
upon the Breaſt-bone, when we bend our ſelves
towards the ground; or touch the Ribs, when
we lie upon our Sides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it giveth a ſafe paſſage to the Veſſels

ſo that it is not pulled too much down by the

Liver and the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>To the upper part of the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> at the
Throat there groweth a Kernel called <hi>Thymus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thymus.</note>
ſeated between the diviſions of the Subclavian
veins and arteries. It is a whitiſh, ſoft, ſpongy,
glandulous body, (in ſhape reſembling a Tyme-leaf,
from which it has its name.) It is larger
in Children and Women than in Men. In Infants
it conſiſts of three Glands, and is in ſubſtance
ſomething like the Sweet-bread; but in adult
perſons it dries up and contracts into one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Jugular <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> paſs through it
as they go up to the Neck,<note place="margin">Its veſſels.</note> but if they ſend forth
any twigs into it, they are ſo ſmall as not to be
diſcovered in diſſecting it. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ſays it

has <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixth pair and from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian

in it, whoſe ſuperfluous or impurer parts are
ſeparated from it in this Gland and conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the Lympheducts, and the refined liquor
is reſumed by the Nerves diſperſed in it, for the
uſe of the nervous parts of the whole Body. And
becauſe he foreſaw how open this opinion (which
himſelf calls <hi>ſcrupoſa ſententia)</hi> lay to the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it is very improbable that the Nerves
ſhould bring the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi> to this part, and
after depuration ſhould reſorb it; he anſwers
that either the Nerves muſt do it, or it cannot be
done at all, ſeeing there are no other Veſſels fit
for the reſuming of it. But he had better have
ſuſpected his ſuppoſed office of the <hi>Thymus,</hi> when
he ſaw himſelf ſo hard ſet to maintain it. For it
is more probable that when there is found any
whitiſh liquor in it, (as there is in Infants, and
in Calves, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that liquor is Chyle which is
brought thither by Lacteals, and deſcends from
thence into the Subclavian veins; ſeeing if one

and be lighten'd by throwing off its burthen as
it were: wherefore that the Bloud may the

more rapid <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and often repeating its
jumps as it were, it bears up the Lungs, and
cauſes them the quicker and frequenter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

as the ſame Intercoſtal nerve, that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates

is alſo continued above with the Maxillar
nerves, when a cackling is begun in the Breaſt,

Body, which no perfect Animal does want, nor
can long ſurvive its wounds. Vital ſpirit and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
heat are communicated from it to all the
parts of the Body, though perhaps not ſo much
owing to its ſubſtance as to the fermentation of
the humours in it; as ſhall be diſcourſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>It is ſeated in the middle of the Breaſt,<note place="margin">Its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed

lower tip or <hi>Mucro</hi> bending a little to the left
ſide. Neither its <hi>Mucro</hi> nor ſides are knit to any
place, but it hangs looſe in its caſe, only ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Veſſels that go in and out of its upper
part or baſis. Its ſituation in Beaſts that feed
upon Graſs is near the middle of the whole Body,
reckoning from the Head to the Tail; but in Man
(and moſt carnivorous Animals) it is nearer the
Head; whereof the learned Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> gives an
ingenious reaſon. <q>Seeing, ſays he, the trajection
and diſtribution of the Bloud depends wholly
on the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Heart, and that its liquor
is not driven of its own nature ſo readily into
the upper parts as into veſſels even with it, or
downwards into thoſe under it: if the ſituation
of the Heart had been further from the Head, it
muſt needs either have been made ſtronger to
caſt out its liquor with greater force; or elſe
the Head would want its due proportion of
Bloud. But in Animals that have a longer
Neck, and which is extended towards their food
as it were, the Heart is ſeated as far from the
Head as from the other parts; and they find no
inconvenience from it, becauſe they feed with
their Head for the moſt part hanging down,
and ſo the Bloud, as it has farther to go to
their Head than in others, ſo it goes a plainer
and often a ſteep way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has a firm,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> thick, denſe ſubſtance, thinner
and ſofter in the right ſide, thicker and more
denſe in the left, but moſt compact and hard at
its tip; only on the left ſide of the tip it is thin, as
conſiſting moſtly of the concourſe of the inner and
outer Membrane. Its <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is for the
greateſt part made up of muſculary Fibres ſo
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49419:129"/>
that it ſelf may truly be reputed a Muſcle.</p>
                  <p>Its Fibres are a few of them ſtreight,<note place="margin">Fibres.</note> but far
more oblique. Both are inſerted into a Tendon
that is ſpread over its baſis under the Auricles.
Part of which Tendon at the egreſs of the <hi>Aorta</hi>
in ſome Creatures becomes bony, as in a Stag, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
On the outer ſuperficies of the right Ventricle
there run a few ſlender Fibres ſtreight upwards
and are terminated in its baſis. In which alſo
terminate the oblique ones next under theſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from the left ſide towards the right,
ſpiral-wiſe. The Fibres that lie under theſe, go
clean contrary. For they ariſe every where
from the right ſide of the Heart, whence being
carried obliquely towards the left, and having
embraced each Ventricle of the Heart, they riſe
to the baſis of the left ſide ſpiral-wiſe as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But they run not all of them the whole
length from the baſis to the cone; for then
would the Heart be as broad or thick at the lower
end as the upper: but ſome reach not above half
way, others a little further, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome to
the very <hi>Apex.</hi> The Fibres of the left Ventricle
differ not from thoſe of the right as to kind, only
they are conſiderably ſtronger. Which they are
for this reaſon, that whereas the right Ventricle
only promotes the circulation of the bloud
through the Lungs, the left muſt caſt it forth
with that force as that it may circulate through
the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>The curious Reader may find a moſt accurate
deſcription of theſe Fibres in Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s treatiſe
<hi>de Corde,</hi> whither I refer him; for, to inſiſt too
long on ſuch minute ſimilar parts, would not be
ſuitable to this Epitome of Anatomy. Though
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49419:130"/>
by a view of thoſe Figures that I have borrowed
of him, their ſtructure may be pretty plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
                  <p>Its ſhape is like a Boy's Top (ſave that it is
flattiſh behind) or a Pyramid turn'd topſy turvy;<note place="margin">Figure.</note>
whence it is divided into its baſis, which is its
broader part and upper; and into its cone or
<hi>apex,</hi> or narrower and lower part, which ends in
a tip or <hi>mucro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is bigger in Men than in other Creatures,<note place="margin">Bigneſs.</note>
conſidering the proportion of their Bodies. It
is leſſer but more denſe in hot and bold Men, than
in the cold and cowardly. In adult perſons it is
commonly ſix fingers breadth long, and four

                  <p>Outwardly it is cover'd with a proper Coat,<note place="margin">Coat.</note>
which is thin, but ſtrong and denſe, and very
hard to ſeparate from it; it is the ſame with the
outer Coat of the great Artery, as that which
cloaths the Ventricles on the inſide is continued
and common with that thin skin that covers the
inſide of the Arteries like a <hi>Cuticula:</hi> and hence
'tis likely (ſays <hi>Diemerbroeck)</hi> that the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
borrow theſe Coats of the Heart, as the
Nerves borrow their two Tunicles from the <hi>Pia</hi>
and <hi>Dura mater</hi> of the Brain. Upon this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
that inveſts the Heart, there grows
ſome hard fat about the baſis, which ſerves to
moiſten it.</p>
                  <p>It is not nouriſhed by the bloud or nutritious
juice received into its Ventricles,<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> but by Veſſels
running through its <hi>Parenchyma.</hi>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49419:130"/>
preſently ſink into the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Heart,
but fetching a circuit on its ſurface the better to
branch out themſelves towards its cone, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs
its baſis. And though at their riſe they
turn one on one ſide and t'other on the other
of the Heart, yet at their ends they meet again
and inoſculate one with the other: ſo that if one
inject any liquor into one, it will run into the
other.</p>
                  <p>It has alſo two <hi>Veins</hi> called <hi>Coronariae</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs
its baſis in like manner,<note place="margin">Veins.</note> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
one with the other. Theſe receive and carry
back the Arterial bloud that remains from the
nutrition of the Heart, and refund it into the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nerves</hi> it has from the ſixth pair (Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s
eighth) which paſſing between the <hi>Arteria pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Nerves.</note> and then are branched
out into the ſubſtance of the Heart. Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>
ſays they are manifeſtly apparent over all the
outer ſuperficies of the Heart of a Calf or other
Animal newly brought forth.</p>
                  <p>Great controverſie hath been and ſtill is about
the motion of the Heart,<note place="margin">The motion of the Heart.</note> whether it depend on
the influx of the animal ſpirits, or on the dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ebullition, or accenſion of the bloud in its
Ventricles, or partly on one, partly on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Plauſible Arguments are produced on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſide, but ſuch as rather tend to ſhew the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and inſufficiency of the contrary opinions to
ſolve this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> than pretend to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
any certain reaſon of it. That the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inſtruments of its motion are its Fibres,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49419:131"/>
none can doubt; but what ſets theſe Fibres on
work is all the queſtion. That it cannot be the
Animal ſpirits conveyed by the Nerves <hi>(only)</hi>
is apparent, <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe the Heart moves in
the <hi>Embryo</hi> before either Brain or Nerve are ſo
perfectly formed, that the Animal ſpirits can be
elaborated out of the Bloud by the former, or
tranſmitted to the Heart by the latter: yea ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are made of Arterial bloud, that muſt
be ſent to the Brain by the pulſation of the Heart
before they can be generated. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe muſcular motions that depend on the
influx of the Animal ſpirits, are voluntary, which
this of the Heart is not, for we can neither ſtop
it nor haſten it at our pleaſure. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> becauſe
the Heart of living <hi>Foetus</hi>'s (as of young Puppies)
and of Eels, being cut out of the Body and from
all the Nerves by which any Animal ſpirits ſhould
flow into it, will continue beating as long as 'tis
warm: yea when it has ceas'd beating, if one
throw warm bloud or but warm water upon it,
it will recover ſome kind of pulſation again.
Which may ſerve alſo to convict the ſecond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of errour; for if its motion depended only
on the dilatation of the bloud, it would ceaſe
aſſoon as the bloud flows no longer into its Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles.</p>
                  <p>And as to ebullition or accenſion, Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s
experiment, or his obſervation, are a ſufficient
confutation of their being the reaſon of this pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
His <hi>experiment</hi> is this: <q>He drew out of
the <hi>Jugular</hi> vein of a Dog about half of his bloud
away, injecting by turns into the <hi>Crural</hi> vein a
like quantity of Beer mixt with a little Wine;
and this he repeated alternatively ſo often, till
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49419:131"/>
inſtead of bloud there flow'd out of the Vein
only a paler tincture like water wherein Fleſh
had been waſh'd, or Claret diluted with very
much Water; and yet the Heart in the mean
time remitted but a little of its former pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.....</q>
His <hi>obſervation,</hi> which he had from
a Phyſician worthy of credit, is this: <q>A Youth
about ſixteen years old, continuing bleeding for
two days together, his friends and thoſe that
waited on him gave him good ſtore of Broth to
keep up and recruit his Spirits; which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
down greedily, his bleeding was now
and then encreas'd thereby, ſo that at length
having poured forth almoſt the whole maſs of
his bloud, that which now run out was dilute
and pale, neither of the nature nor colour of
bloud, but liker the Broth he had drunk ſo
much of: And this kind of flux continued a day
or two, (the Heart the mean while retaining
its pulſation) till at length being ſtopt, the
Youth was reſtored by degrees to entire
health,</q> and grew to a robuſt and luſty Fellow.]
This experiment and obſervation I ſay do make it
apparent, the motion of the Heart depends not
on the ebullition or accenſion of the bloud, for
then when in the firſt the Beer and Wine, in
the ſecond the Broth flow'd into its Ventricles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Bloud, its motion muſt either have been
more notably alter'd, or rather have quite ceas'd,
theſe liquors being ſo far diſtant from the nature
of bloud, eſpecially the Broth.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, that this motion is not cauſed
partly by the influx of the animal ſpirits, and
partly by the ebullition or accenſion of the
bloud, may be evinced by the Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49419:132"/>
againſt each opinion apart: and yet if
a reaſon could be given, this ſeems the moſt
probable. Namely, that the bloud deſtilling
into the Ventricles of the Heart, is in them
accended and rarefied, and wanting more room
expands or bears againſt their Sides: and then
the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Heart being moleſted
by that expanſion, calls in the Animal ſpirits
for help, which coming in in convenient plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
contract the muſcular Fibres that make up
the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Heart, and ſo by ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
its Ventricles drive forth the bloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them into the Arteries. But we had
rather ingenuouſly confeſs our ignorance of the
reaſon of ſo admirable an action, and profeſs
with Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> that it is too hard for Man to
conceive of, and that it is the prerogative of
God only, who ſearcheth the ſecrets of the
Heart, to know the reaſon of its motion

                  <p>Now ſeeing by this continual reciprocation of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49419:133"/>
the Pulſe there is a conſtant expulſion of Bloud
<hi>from</hi> the Heart; there muſt needs be a continual
influx of Bloud into the Heart out of the <hi>Cava.</hi>
And ſeeing the <hi>Cava</hi> from whence the ſupply is,
is never drawn dry, and on the other hand ſeeing
the Arteries that receive the Bloud continually
from the Heart, are not unduly ſwell'd with it,
it neceſſarily follows that this motion proceeds
<hi>circularly, viz.</hi> that the Bloud is continually dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of the Heart into the Arteries, out of
theſe into the Veins and parts to be nouriſhed,
then from the leſſer Veins returns to the <hi>Cava,</hi>
and ſo at length to the Heart again. The inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which circulation is owing to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman
Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> and may be prov'd invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1. The great quantity of Bloud that is driven
out of the Heart into the Arteries at every Pulſe.
For though the Ancients who knew not this circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
imagin'd that only a drop or two were
expelled by every <hi>Syſtole,</hi> which they were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
to ſuppoſe, to avoid the great diſtenſion
that the Arteries muſt be liable to, if any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quantity iſſued into them; yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and demonſtrable that there muſt needs an
ounce or more be driven into them each time.
For (taking it for granted that there is no other
way for any liquor to paſs from the Stomach to
the Kidneys but through the Heart, along with
the Bloud) ſeeing if ſome Men at ſome times
drink three pints of Drink, they ſhall piſs it out
again in half an hour, yea more of <hi>Tunbridge</hi>
Waters in that ſpace; and ſeeing ſecondly, that
there is commonly as much Bloud as <hi>Serum</hi> that
flows to the Kidneys (the Bloud returning back
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49419:133"/>
by the Emulgent veins) it is clear that by the
two Emulgents (which are none of the largeſt
Arteries) there muſt paſs in half an hours
time ſix pounds of liquor, all which muſt come
from the Heart; and how much more then may
we conceive to be driven through all the other
Arteries that run through the whole Body? This
is more accurately evinced by Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is this: <q>I cut aſunder (ſays he)
both <hi>Cervical</hi> arteries in a large Dog, and at
the ſame time through an hole made in the left
ſide of his Breaſt over againſt the Heart, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
the trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> below the Heart
with my finger, to hinder any Bloud from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
by it; and laſtly I took care alſo to
ſtraiten the <hi>Brachial</hi> arteries under the <hi>Axillae,</hi>
by which means almoſt all the Bloud was driven
out of the Heart through the <hi>Cervicals</hi> (beſides
that which was ſent into the <hi>Vertebrals)</hi> and
which is wonderfull to be related, within the
twentieth part of an hour the whole maſs iſſued
out; ſo that it is not to be denied but that it
all paſt through the Heart in that ſpace.]</q> And
though it may be granted that amidſt ſuch wounds
and tortures the Heart does beat ſomewhat quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in ſuch a caſe than at other times; yet the
ſame thing is partly evident from wounds in the
Limbs when ſome notable Artery is cut aſunder,
for 'tis ſtrange in how ſmall a time a Man will
bleed to death even at that one Artery. Yea we
may give a great gueſs how much Bloud is ſent
out at every Pulſe, even from the ordinary open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one <hi>Vein</hi> in the Arm, from whence a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
quantity of Bloud will iſſue in a ſhort time;
how much then may we ſuppoſe would flow out of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49419:134"/>
all the Veins, if they were opened at one time?
Seeing then 'tis evident that ſo great a quantity
of Bloud is expelled out of the Heart at every <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole,</hi>
and that for all that the Arteries are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
diſtended nor any part ſwell'd by it, neither
yet the <hi>Cava</hi> and other Veins emptied, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the Bloud that is driven into the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
flows back to the Heart by the Veins, in a
conſtant circulation.</p>
                  <p>2. A ſecond Argument to prove it, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Valves in the Veins, which are ſo
framed that Bloud may freely flow through them
out of the leſſer Veins into the greater, (and ſo
into the <hi>Cava)</hi> but not on the contrary out of
the greater into the leſs. Yea if one blow into
the <hi>Cava</hi> through a Pipe, there will no wind
paſs into the ſmaller Veins; but on the contrary,
if you blow up the leſſer Veins, the wind will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
paſs to the larger and ſo to the <hi>Cava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And laſtly, The ſame thing is moſt clear by
the Ligature in bloud-letting. For whether you
let bloud in the Arm or Foot, you always tie the
Fillet above where you intend to make the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and then the Vein below the Ligature will
preſently fill and grow tumid, but above it will
fall and almoſt diſappear. Which muſt needs be
from hence, for that the Bloud being driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Arteries towards the extreme parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
by the Veins and aſcends upwards, which
coming to the Ligature and being ſtopt there,
ſwells the Vein below the Ligature, and ſpurts
out aſſoon as the Orifice is made: but when the
Fillet is looſed again, the Bloud flows no longer
out thereat, but holds on its wonted channel, the
Vein, and the Orifice cloſes up again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49419:134"/>
Having ſufficiently demonſtrated the circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bloud we will ſhew two things further,
firſt, how the Bloud paſſes out of the Arteries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Veins, and ſecondly in how long a time the
whole maſs of Bloud may be ſuppoſed to paſs
through the Heart in its ordinary circulation.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> it was the opinion of <hi>Riolanus</hi>
that the Bloud circulated only through the larger
Veſſels, by anaſtomoſes or inoſculation of the
Veins with the Arteries, and that that which run
into the ſmaller, was all ſpent on the nutrition
of the parts. But it is clear that there muſt be
a circulation even in the ſmalleſt, from the great
quantity of Bloud that will flow out of the leaſt
Artery in the Hand or Foot, when it is cut;
which it were very abſurd to imagine to be all
ſpent on the nouriſhment of the reſpective part.
Now there are but two ways whereby the Bloud
can be ſuppoſed to paſs out of the Arteries into the
Veins, <hi>viz.</hi> either by the former opening into the
latter by inoſculation, or elſe by the Capillary
arteries letting out their Bloud into the pores of
the ſubſtance of the parts, on whoſe nutrition
part is ſpent, and the remainder imbibed by the
gaping mouths of the Capillary veins. And it
ſeems neceſſary to admit both theſe ways; this
<hi>latter,</hi> becauſe if part of the Arterial bloud did
not iſſue into the ſubſtance of the parts, they
could not be nouriſhed by it, for while it is in the
veſſels it may add warmth indeed to the parts
through which it flows, but cannot nouriſh them,
ſeeing even the veſſels themſelves are not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by that ſtream of Bloud that glides along
their Cavity, but by Capillaries running through
their Coats; and if the Bloud be driven into the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49419:135"/>
ſubſtance of the parts, and that in a greater
quantity than ſuffices for their nouriſhment (as
was juſt now ſhewn) what is ſuperfluous muſt
needs enter the mouths of the Capillary veins,
from which it goes forward to the larger and ſo
to the Heart: But ſeeing this way of transfuſing
the Blood through the ſubſtance of the parts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
not to that haſty circulation of the Bloud
we above demonſtrated; it is neceſſary alſo to
admit of the <hi>former</hi> way, namely anaſtomoſes, in
which the Veins are continued to the Arteries,
and that not only in their larger branches (as
that notable one of the Splenick artery with the
Splenick vein) but alſo in their ſmaller twigs in
the extreme parts.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſecondly</hi> as to the ſpace of time in which
the whole maſs of Bloud may ordinarily circulate
through the Heart, it is probably much ſhorter
than many have imagined. For ſuppoſing that
the Heart makes two thouſand pulſes an hour
(which is the leaſt number any ſpeak of, and
ſome have told twice as many) and that at every
pulſe there is expelled an ounce of Bloud (which
we may well ſuppoſe, ſeeing the Ventricles are
wide enough to contain two ounces, and that it is
probable both that they are filled near full in the
<hi>Diaſtole,</hi> and that they are near if not quite empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſtrong conſtriction of the Heart in the
<hi>Syſtole)</hi> ſeeing the whole maſs uſually exceeds
not four and twenty pound, it will be circulated
ſix or ſeven times over through the Heart in the
ſpace of an hour. And by ſo much the oftener,
by how much the Bloud comes ſhort of the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
quantity, or the pulſe either naturally, or by
a Fever or violent motion is rendred more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49419:135"/>
By which quick motion the Bloud it ſelf
is kept from coagulation and putrefaction, and
the parts are cheriſhed with vital heat, which
heat of the parts is much according to the ſlowneſs
or rapidneſs of the circulation; ſo when we ſit
ſtill and the pulſe is ſlow or rare, we grow cold,
but when upon running or any violent exerciſe
the pulſe becomes more frequent and quick, we
become hot.</p>

and whether the Body be nouriſhed by it.</head>
                  <p>ACcording to Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s obſervations there
appears in an <hi>Embryo</hi> a <hi>punctum ſaliens,</hi> or
red beating ſpeck, which is Bloud, before any
the leaſt lineament of the Heart. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
inſtrument of ſanguification the Heart may
appear to be afterwards, it contributes nothing
to the elaborating of the firſt Bloud; but it ſeems
rather to be made for the Bloud's ſake to tranſmit
it to all the parts of the <hi>Embryo</hi> or <hi>Foetus,</hi> than the
Bloud to be made by it. But it muſt be confeſt that
things proceed in the grown <hi>Foetus</hi> far otherwiſe
than they do in the firſt formation. For the parts
of an <hi>Embryo</hi> are nouriſhed and encreaſed before it
have a ſtomach to concoct any thing, and yet in
a perfect <hi>Foetus</hi> none can deny that the Stomach
does concoct and prepare nouriſhment for it: ſo
it moves before the Brain is formed ſo perfectly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49419:136"/>
as to be able to elaborate Animal ſpirits; and
yet after it is perfected, every one knows that the
Brain does elaborate ſuch ſpirits, as being ſent
into all the parts of the Body by the Nerves ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them to move. In like manner though there
be Bloud in the <hi>Embryo</hi> before the Heart be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
yet after it is perfected, nothing will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
but it may at leaſt contribute ſomething to
ſanguification.</p>
                  <p>We will ſuppoſe then, that as all the other
parts are formed by the <hi>Vis plaſtica</hi> or generative
faculty of the (firſt) vegetative and (then)
animal Soul, ſeated in the <hi>Ovum,</hi> but aſſoon as they
are perfected and the <hi>Foetus</hi> excluded, are nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Bloud; ſo the Bloud it ſelf being at
firſt made in like manner, aſſoon as the Veins,
Heart and Arteries are compleated ſo as it can
circulate by them, may, not improperly, be ſaid
to be nouriſhed by the Chyle, the Heart aſſiſting
the aſſimilation of the one into the other. And
this is done in this manner.<note place="margin">How chyle is turned into bloud.</note> The Chyle aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the <hi>Ductus thoracicus</hi> (as was deſcribed
Book 1. Chap. 10.) and flowing into the Subcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
vein, together with the returning venal
Bloud is poured into the right ventricle of the
Heart in its <hi>Diaſtole</hi> or Relaxation, then by its
<hi>Syſtole</hi> or Contraction it is driven out from thence
into the Lungs, from whence it aſcends again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the left ventricle of the Heart, out of which it
is expelled through the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and paſſing along
with the Bloud through the Arteries of the whole
Body, returns again with it by the Veins to the
Heart. For it undergoes many circulations before
it can be aſſimilated to the Bloud. Which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
both becauſe it is the Chyle (but little
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49419:136"/>
alter'd) that is ſeparated in the <hi>Placenta uteri</hi>
for the nouriſhment of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and in the
Breaſts for the Infant to ſuck, in the form of
Milk; and alſo from hence, that if one be let
bloud four or five hours (or later) after a full
meal, there will a great quantity of the milky
Chyle it ſelf ſwim a top the coagulated Bloud.
But every time the new infuſed Chyle paſſes
through the Heart with the Bloud, the particles
of the one are more intimately mixed with thoſe
of the other in its Ventricles, and the vital ſpirit
and other active principles of the bloud work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Chyle; which being full of ſalt, ſulphur
and ſpirit, aſſoon as its <hi>Compages</hi> is looſened by
its fermentation with the Bloud in the ventricles
of the Heart (eſpecially, but alſo in the Arteries)
theſe principles having obtained the liberty of
motion do readily aſſociate themſelves, and are
aſſimilated with ſuch parts of the Bloud as are
of a like and ſuitable nature. Now whether this
alteration that happens to the Chyle, eſpecially
in the Heart, ſhould be ſaid to be by fermentation,
or accenſion, or by what other action, is a thing
not yet (nor likely to be) agreed upon, it is ſo
full of difficulty. But it ſeems to be by fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
from the conſiderable heat obſervable in
the Arterial bloud; and if there be any thing of
accenſion, that ſeems to proceed, not from any
part inherent either in the Bloud or Chyle, nor
to be effected ſo much in the Heart and Arteries,
as in the Lungs, whiles the Bloud paſſes through
their <hi>Parenchyma</hi> out of the <hi>Vena arterioſa</hi> into the
<hi>Arteria venoſa,</hi> and is inſpirited or impregnated
with nitrous air drawn into them by inſpiration.
Which will be more evident by what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:49419:137"/>
Why the Bloud ſhould be of a red colour rather
than any other,<note place="margin">The colour of the bloud.</note> no reaſon can be given but the
will of the Creatour, though ſome attribute it to
the Heart, others to the mixture of ſalt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid
juices with ſulphureous; even as the Oyl of
Vitriol being poured upon Conſerve of Roſes, or
other thing that is of a <hi>paliſh</hi> red (if it contain
any thing of ſulphur) makes it of a moſt <hi>deep</hi>
red. We will not ſpend time to ſhew in how
many reſpects this ſimilitude falls ſhort of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reaſon of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> but ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our ſelves with inquiring from whence the
difference of colour ariſes between the Venal and
Arterial bloud. Every one knows that Bloud let
out of a Vein into a Porringer, is indeed of a
florid ſcarlet colour in its ſurface, but all that
coagulates is of a dark red colour from the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
to the bottom, and of ſuch a colour it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
as it ſtreams out of the Orifice of the
Vein. But if an Artery be cut, the ſtream then
looks of a far brighter colour, like the ſuperficies
of the Venal bloud when it is congealed in a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringer.
Now the Arterial bloud receives not
this florid colour in the Heart but in the Lungs.
For if it receiv'd it in the Heart, then might the
right Ventricle be ſuppoſed to give it as well as
the left: but that it does not do ſo, is clear by
this experiment of Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s. If you open the
<hi>Vena arterioſa</hi> which receives the Bloud out of the
right Ventricle, the Bloud differs nothing in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
from the Venal, but its curdled part looks
every whit as black. But if one open the <hi>Arteria
venoſa</hi> as it is entring into the left Ventricle, it has
the perfect colour of Arterial bloud; which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49419:137"/>
ſhews, that as it ows not that colour to the left
Ventricle any more than to the right, (being
not yet arriv'd at it) ſo it muſt receive that alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of colour in the Lungs, in which the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
air being diffuſed through all the particles
of the Bloud is intimately mixed with it, and (if
you will) accends it. For if there be any ſuch
thing as a <hi>Flamma vitalis</hi> (properly ſo called) in
Animals, though the Bloud be to it inſtead of the
Oyl or other matter whereon it feeds, yet it
oweth the continuance of its burning to the Air,
without the continued inſpiration of which the
Animal cannot live, but inſtantly dies, even as a
Candle is preſently extinguiſhed if you put it in a
cloſe place where the air cannot come to it, or
by ſome Engine be ſuckt from it. But this by
the bye. For I muſt confeſs that (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the plauſibleneſs of the opinion) this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the colour of the Bloud by the Air in the
Lungs, is no ſufficient argument to prove any
ſuch vital flame, ſeeing the Arterial bloud being
extravaſated, retains its florid colour, when no
doubt if there ever was any accenſion, the flame
is extinguiſhed. But this ſcarlet colour is meerly
from the mixture of the particles of the Air with
the Bloud, from which it tranſpires, in a great
meaſure, through the pores of the Skin, while
the Bloud circulates in the habit of the Body out
of the Arteries into the Veins, whence the Venous
bloud becomes ſo much darker in colour than the
Arterial. And yet the Venous bloud it ſelf
when extravaſated appears of a ſcarlet dye in
its ſurface, which is meerly from its being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Air; for if one turn the congealed Bloud
in a Porringer upſide down, the bottom which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49419:138"/>
at the turning is blackiſh, will in a little while
turn red.</p>
                  <p>Though we have confeſſed that the Chyle does
circulate through the Body ſeveral times before it
be perfectly aſſimilated to the Bloud;<note place="margin">Whether the body be nouriſh'd by bloud.</note> yet we do
not think that it paſſes into the nouriſhment of
the parts in the form of Chyle. And therefore
when ſpeaking of the nutrition of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the
Womb (Book 1. Chap. 33.) we often mentioned
a nutritious juice (which was Chyle a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd)
we did not call it ſo with reſpect to the
ſolid parts of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> but to the Bloud it ſelf
whoſe <hi>Pabulum</hi> or nouriſhment it is, aſſoon as the
Umbilical vein is formed, as the Bloud is of the
Body. For as to the increaſe of the firſt delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
parts of an imperfect <hi>Embryo,</hi> that is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from ordinary nutrition.</p>
                  <p>The Bloud then conſiſting of particles of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature, each particle paſſes into the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of that part which is of the ſame nature.
So the ſalt and ſulphureous particles being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mixt, are agglutinated and aſſimilated to the
fleſhy or muſculous parts; the oily and ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Fat; the ſalt and tartareous to the
Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is not done by any electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or attraction of the parts, as if they pick'd
and choos'd (with a kind of diſcretion) ſuch
particles of the Bloud as are ſuitable to their own
nature: For the maſs of Bloud is equally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
carried to all the parts: But there is
that diverſity of figure both in the ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Bloud and in the pores of each part,
that in the circulation through the habit of the
Body ſome ſtick in theſe, and others in thoſe,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49419:138"/>
where they are faſten'd aud united to the ſubſtance
of the reſpective parts; and thoſe which through
their peculiar figure are unapt to adhere to one or
other, return again to the Veins and ſo to the
Heart, where they receive ſome new alteration.
So that as <hi>the Life of the Fleſh is in the Bloud</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

carried into oppoſite Tendons, whereof that at
the baſis of the Heart is common to it and theſe
<hi>Auriculae,</hi> and the other runs along their upper
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49419:139"/>
part. The right is larger and ſofter, the left is
leſs, but more firm. Their ſuperficies is ſmooth
when they are filled; but when empty, it is
wrinkled, and the left more than the right.
When they are cut open, there appear in their
Cavity many fleſhy columns running from the
upper to the lower Tendon, and betwixt them
there are pretty deep Ditches or long Cavities,
but fewer in the right than the left.</p>
                  <p>They are dilated and contracted in like manner
as the Heart,<note place="margin">Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but at different times: for the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole</hi>
of the Ventricles is at the ſame time with
the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>Auriculae;</hi> and on the contrary,
the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>Auriculae</hi> with the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the
Ventricles. So that the <hi>Auriculae</hi> are a receiving
their Bloud from the Veins, while the Ventricles
are expelling theirs into the Arteries; and when
the Ventricles are relaxed and empty in their
<hi>Diaſtole,</hi> the Auricles force their Bloud into
them by their <hi>Syſtole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſerve to receive the Venal bloud imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
out of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and <hi>Pulmonalis,</hi> and
to meaſure it as it were into the Ventricles.
Whither that they may expell it with the greater
force, the internal Fibres or Columns of their
cavity ariſing from their root where they are
joined to the baſis of the Heart, reach directly
outwards towards the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and <hi>Pulmonaris,</hi>
and in the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>Auriculae</hi> graſp the Bloud
contained in their cavity like ſo many fingers, and
ſqueez it into the Ventricles whilſt they are relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their <hi>Diaſtole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Heart hath two Cavities,<note place="margin">The ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles.</note> called <hi>Ventricles,</hi>
whereinto it receives the Bloud from its two
Auricles, and out of which it expels it into the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49419:139"/>
                     <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> and <hi>Aorta.</hi> The right is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and not exactly round but almoſt ſemicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
nor reacheth down to the <hi>Mucro</hi> or tip of
the Heart; the left is narrower but rounder and
longer, reaching down to the very tip. Now
though the outſide of the Heart be ſmooth, yet
theſe Ventricles are very unequal, having their
ſides hollowed into divers interſtices or furrows,
and interwoven with carnous Fibres reaching this
way and that way. They are more numerous in
Men's Hearts, than in thoſe of any other Animal;
though ſuch as are big, as Horſes and the like,
have them larger. Theſe Fibres or fleſhy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
ſerve to ſtraiten or conſtringe the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and the clefts or furrows betwixt them help
their ſides to cloſe more exactly in their <hi>Syſtole</hi>
than they could have done, had they been ſmooth.
The Fibres are more and ſtronger and the furrows
deeper in the left Ventricle than in the right, yea
they are alſo in that ſide of the <hi>Septum</hi> that makes
part of the left, though that ſide that looks to the
right be well nigh ſmooth. For there was need
of greater and ſtronger conſtriction in the left
than in the right; ſeeing the right expels the
Bloud to no greater circuit than through the
Lungs, but the left to the extreameſt parts of the
Body.</p>
                  <p>They are divided from one another by the
<hi>Septum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Septum.</note> or a partition that ſtands like a Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. It is hollow towards the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
and (as was juſt now ſaid) has ſuch like
Fibres and Clefts as the reſt of the Cavity; but
towards the right it is convex or bunching out,
and has but very little inequality. Many have
been of opinion that it has ſome wider pores
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49419:140"/>
through which part of the Bloud does paſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
out of the right into the left Ventricle;
but he that ſearches for them diligently will find
none, unleſs he firſt make them with his Probe.
And indeed if there were any in grown perſons,
we may much more ſuppoſe them to be in <hi>Foetus</hi>'s
in the Womb, in whom are ſeveral paſſages that
after the birth are obliterated. But if theſe were
in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> then ſhould Nature have made thoſe
two other paſſages in vain, namely the <hi>Foramen
ovale,</hi> whereby the Bloud paſſes out of the <hi>Cava</hi>
into the <hi>Vena pulmonaris</hi> as it is entring the left
Ventricle; and the <hi>Canalis arterioſus,</hi> which carries
the Bloud out of the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> into the
<hi>Aorta.</hi> I ſay if the Bloud could have paſſed out
of one Ventricle into the other (without going
through the Lungs) by any pores that perforate
the <hi>Septum,</hi> theſe other paſſages had been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.
And therefore we may ſuppoſe, that as
in grown perſons they cannot be found by any
Probe or Briſtle, ſo they were not there even
while the <hi>Foetus</hi> was in the Womb, ſeeing there
was no occaſion for them.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>uſe</hi> of the Ventricles, it may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
partly by what has been diſcourſed in the

proſecution of it till this place that we come

                  </p>
                  <p>As it aſcends through the Midriff it ſends forth
a ſmall ſprig on each ſide,<note place="margin">Venae phrenicae.</note> called <hi>Venae phrenicae;</hi>
theſe run through the Midriff, the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi>
and <hi>Pericardium.</hi> If at any time matter gathered
in the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> be afterwards diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by Urine, (which many Phyſicians have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed)
it is probable that it is abſorbed by the
mouths of theſe Veins gaping in the upper ſide of
the Diaphragm, (upon which ſuch matter muſt
be ſuppoſed to fluctuate) whereby it is brought
into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and ſo in the circulation is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Kidneys out of the Emulgent arteries,
and deſcends by the Ureters to the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>From the Diaphragm it paſſes undivided to the
right ventricle of the Heart,<note place="margin">Venae co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronariae.</note> but before it enter
it, having pierced the <hi>Pericardium</hi> it ſends forth
ſometimes one, ſometimes two twigs called <hi>Venae
coronariae,</hi> which compaſſing the baſis of the
Heart bring back into the <hi>Cava</hi> the Bloud that is
ſuperfluous from its nutrition. As theſe open
into the <hi>Cava</hi> there is a Valve placed, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Bloud to return by them into the <hi>Cava,</hi>
but hinders any to paſs out of the <hi>Cava</hi> into
<hi>them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this trunk of <hi>Vena cava</hi> open into the
Ventricle it is joined to that other trunk that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
from the <hi>Claviculae,</hi> (though for method's
ſake we muſt conſider <hi>that</hi> as a continuation of
<hi>this,</hi> by and by) and both of them diſcharge the
Bloud contained in them by one mouth into the
ſaid Ventricle. As they are going to join, there
comes a Tubercle or Protuberance betwixt them,
that hinders the one from opening into the other
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49419:141"/>
in a direct line, but makes them both go obliquely
towards the left hand as they enter the <hi>Auricula;</hi>
without which proviſion, that Bloud that is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
from the <hi>Claviculae</hi> would have faln ſo
full on that which is aſcending by this trunk of
the <hi>Cava,</hi> we have been a deſcribing, as muſt have
made it either to ſtagnate (if not regurgitate)
or however would have retarded its motion.</p>
                  <p>Now immediately below this protuberance,
out of the united trunk there goeth a paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the baſis of the Heart to the <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi>
in <hi>Foetus</hi>'s in the Womb, which aſſoon as they are
born cloſes up and becomes obliterate. The
reaſon of this paſſage of the Bloud in them is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Lungs having either none or but a
very obſcure and imperfect motion, the Bloud
does but little of it paſs through them, but a
good part of it through this <hi>Foramen</hi> out of the
<hi>Cava</hi> into the <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> juſt as it is entring
into the left Ventricle, into which this Bloud is
diſcharged together with that little that is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by the ſaid <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> from the nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lungs. For though there be expelled
out of the right Ventricle a pretty quantity of
Bloud at every pulſe into the <hi>Arteria pulmonalis,</hi>
yet there is but a little of it that goes to the
Lungs (though all do in adult perſons, that it
may be there impregnated with Air) but the
greateſt part by a Pipe called <hi>Canalis arterioſus</hi>
runs into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> which Pipe does degenerate
into a Ligament after the <hi>Foetus</hi> is born. So that
the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb liveth after the manner of
Fiſh or other Creatures that have no Lungs and
but one ventricle of the Heart; for there is but
very little of its Bloud that paſſeth any more than
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49419:142"/>
one of its Ventricles in one circulation, that
which circulateth through one miſſing the other.
But to return:</p>
                  <p>The united trunk of the <hi>Cava</hi> opens by one
large Orifice into the right ventricle of the Heart,
into which is poured all the Bloud that returns
from all the parts of the Body (except the
Lungs) in its circulation. And leſt in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole</hi>
or conſtriction of the Heart, the Bloud
ſhould be expelled the ſame way that it comes in
by; at the Orifice of the <hi>Cava</hi> there grows a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
circle, which is cleft into three membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Valves, looking inwards, called <hi>Tricuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
(or three-pointed) which permit the Bloud
to come in, but not to go out. And this office
theſe Valves perform in this manner, (as is moſt
ingeniouſly deſcribed by Dr. <hi>Lower.)</hi> Out of the
ſides of the right Ventricle there grow certain
<hi>Papillae</hi> or round and long Caruncles (called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fleſhy Columns) from whoſe top there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
certain tendinous Fibres that are knit to theſe
membranous Valves. Now theſe Membranes
encompaſs the orifice of the <hi>Cava</hi> round about, ſo
that whereas the <hi>Mucro</hi> or tip of the Heart is in
every <hi>Syſtole</hi> drawn up towards the baſis, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillae</hi>
being alſo moved upwards do ſlacken their
Fibres (like Bridle-reins) whereby it comes to
paſs that the Membranes (or Valves) alſo, to
which they are tied, hanging looſe are driven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(like ſails filled with wind) by the Bloud
that is ſqueezed in every <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Heart, and
thereby they ſhut this inlet into the Heart ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that not a drop of liquor can flow back again
into the <hi>Auricula</hi> or <hi>Cava,</hi> but is expelled all into
the <hi>Arteria pulmonalis</hi> that is now open: But, as in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49419:142"/>
every <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Heart (its tip being brought
nearer its baſis) the <hi>Papillae</hi> do much relax their
Fibres; ſo in the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> the tip receding from the
baſis again does alſo draw down the <hi>Papillae</hi> and
their Fibres with it: whence it comes to paſs that
the Membranes or Valves being alſo drawn down
do preſently unſhut this Orifice, and open the
door as it were for more Bloud to come in, what
came in before being expelled in the laſt <hi>Syſtole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The united trunks of the <hi>Cava</hi> diſcharging
themſelves thus into the right Ventricle, that
which aſcends towards the <hi>Claviculae</hi> (for ſo we
muſt conſider it for orders ſake, though in truth
it deſcends from thence) aſſoon as it is gone out
of the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> ſendeth forth a notable branch
called <hi>Vena ſine pari,</hi> (or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) becauſe it is
but one, having no fellow.</p>
                  <p>It ariſeth out of the hinder part of the <hi>Cava,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vena ſine pari.</note>
but more towards the right hand, and deſcends
through the right ſide of the cavity of the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
After its beginning, which is betwixt the fourth
and fifth <hi>vertebra</hi> of the Breaſt, it bends a little
forward toward the right hand, till it be deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as far as the eighth or ninth <hi>vertebra,</hi> where
it begins juſt to keep the middle. It ſends forth
on each ſide Intercoſtal branches to the Interſtices
of the eight loweſt Ribs; and at the eighth Rib
it is divided into two branches: One whereof,
being the larger, deſcends toward the <hi>left hand</hi>
betwixt the proceſſes of the Diaphragm, and is
inſerted ſometimes into the <hi>Cava</hi> above or below
the Emulgent, but oftner into the Emulgent it
ſelf: The other being the <hi>right</hi> is joined alſo to
the <hi>Cava,</hi> commonly a little above the Emulgent,
but ſeldom into the Emulgent it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:49419:143"/>
It was formerly held, before the circulation of
the Bloud was found out, that in an <hi>Empyema</hi> of
the <hi>Thorax,</hi> the matter was abſorbed by the
mouths of this Vein, and carried directly to the
Emulgent veins, where it was ſeparated with the
<hi>Serum</hi> by the Kidneys. But ſeeing the Bloud does
indeed aſcend from the Emulgents by this Vein,
and that at its inſertion into them there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a Valve that hinders any thing from iſſuing
out of the <hi>Vena ſine pari</hi> into the Emulgent, but
permits the contrary; it is certain that if this
Vein be at any time an inſtrument to evacuate
ſuch <hi>Pus,</hi> it muſt firſt aſcend to the <hi>Cava</hi> and paſs
through the Heart, and ſo be carried to the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
by the <hi>Aorta</hi> and the Emulgent arteries ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
out of it. But though it is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how the mouths of this Vein ſhould open ſo
wide into the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as to imbibe
ſlimy roapy <hi>Pus,</hi> and yet not let forth the Bloud
that is more fluid; ſo that one would hardly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
this office to it: yet when the <hi>Pus</hi> is collected
betwixt the <hi>Pleura</hi> and Intercoſtal muſcles and
the Tumour does not burſt, I ſee not why it may
not be ſuppoſed that the Intercoſtal branches of
the <hi>Vena ſine pari</hi> do imbibe the matter out of the
Tumour, and carry it that way which was juſt
now ſpoken of. And if ever <hi>Pus</hi> be imbibed out
of the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> becauſe it floats upon
the Diaphragm, the <hi>Venae phrenicae</hi> are liker to do
it than this, as was noted before in this Chapter
when we deſcribed thoſe Veins. Of this <hi>Vena ſine
pari</hi> we ſhall ſay no more, but that at its riſe out
of the <hi>Cava</hi> it has a Valve that opens towards the
<hi>Cava,</hi> which having ſent forth this Vein, aſcends
on towards the <hi>Claviculae</hi> ſtrengthned and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49419:143"/>
by the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> and <hi>Thymus,</hi> and before it
is divided into the two <hi>Rami ſubclavii</hi> (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
after) ſends out yet two other ſmall Veins
called</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſuperiour Intercoſtals,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtales ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periores.</note> on each ſide one,
each of which has a Valve where it joins to the
<hi>Cava,</hi> permitting the influx of the Bloud into it,
but hindring its relapſe. Theſe run along the
Interſtices or intervals of the three or four up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
Ribs. Yet ſometimes the <hi>Vena ſine pari</hi>
ſends twigs to theſe four Interſtices of the Ribs as
well as to the eight lower, and then theſe ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Intercoſtals are wanting.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the trunk of the <hi>Cava</hi> is divided
into two large Veins,<note place="margin">Venae ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claviae.</note> one of which goes to the
right hand, the other to the left. Theſe while
they are within the Breaſt are called <hi>Venae ſubcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viae,</hi>
running along the Channel-bones; but aſſoon
as they are gone out of it, <hi>Axillares.</hi> They ſend
forth ſeveral branches both <hi>upwards</hi> and <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
Sometimes the ſuperiour Intercoſtals juſt
now mentioned (though ſeldom) ariſe out of
them. Next, the</p>

                  <p>THE ſecond veſſel in the Breaſt is called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
pulmonaris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vena ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioſa.</note> otherwiſe <hi>Vena arterioſa.</hi>
It is an Artery from its office: for it carrieth
Bloud out of the right Ventricle of the Heart to
the Lungs. Its Coat is double alſo like that of
other Arteries.</p>
                  <p>As it riſeth out of the right ventricle of the
Heart,<note place="margin">Its valves.</note> there ſtand at its orifice three Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Valves looking outwards, called <hi>Semiluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
becauſe they make as it were a half circle; as
alſo <hi>Sigmoides</hi> or <hi>Sigmoideae,</hi> from the ſhape of the
Greek letter <hi>Sigma,</hi> which of old was of the ſame
figure with an Engliſh capital C. In the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of
the Heart they open, and permit the Bloud to iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
out of the Ventricle into this Artery; but in
the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> they ſhut, ſo that none can return
back again.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as it is paſt out of the <hi>Pericardium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Branchings in the Lungs.</note> it
bends towards the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> or Wind-pipe,
and is divided into the right and left branch,
which applying themſelves to the like branches of
the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> do every where accompany
them on the under ſide, and as they run along
ſend out very many twigs on every ſide, which
preſently aſſociate with thoſe of the Wind-pipe,
and of the <hi>Vena pulmonaris.</hi> And where the ſmall
Pipes of the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> end into the little
round Cells (which we ſhall deſcribe in the
Chapter of the Lungs) the twigs of this Artery
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49419:145"/>
being complicated with thoſe of the Vein do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
them like a Net. Whence one may gueſs
that the reaſon why the ſanguiferous veſſels do ſo
exactly accompany all the branches of the Wind-pipe
and its annexed little Bladders, is, that the
whole maſs of Bloud paſſing this way may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
or impregnated with the particles of the
nitrous Air. For there is but a very little ſpent
on the nutrition of the Lungs, but the greateſt
part of it is driven into the ſmall twigs of the
<hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> which inoſculate with thoſe of
the Artery in all its ramifications.</p>
                  <p>The third veſſel is called <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> or
<hi>Arteria venoſa;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arteria venoſa.</note> this has but a ſingle Coat as the
other Veins have. After it has accompanied the
Wind-pipe and <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> in all their
branchings in the Lungs, and by its ſmall twigs
has received the Bloud by <hi>anaſtomoſes</hi> out of the
Artery, it unites firſt into two trunks <hi>(viz.</hi> the
right and left) afterwards into one, and opens
into the left ventricle of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>At its orifice there are placed two membranous
Valves called <hi>Mitrales,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its valve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> becauſe when they are
joined together they do in ſome manner reſemble
a Biſhop's Mitre. They are of a ſtronger contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than thoſe called <hi>Tricuſpides</hi> at the orifice of
the <hi>Cava</hi> in the right Ventricle; and ſo are the
Fibres that aſcend to them from the <hi>Papillae</hi> or
fleſhy columns, ſtronger. For ſeeing the Bloud is
expelled more impetuouſly out of the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
than out of the right, (for the Bloud ſent
out of the one is to circulate only through the
Lungs, but that out of the other, through the
whole Body) it was convenient that the Valves
and Fibres ſhould be ſtronger, to ſuſtain the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49419:146"/>
motion of the Bloud, and hindring it from
returning into this Vein again, to direct its courſe
into the <hi>Aorta</hi> whoſe orifice opens in the <hi>Syſtole</hi>
of the Ventricle.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as this <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> is entring into the
left Ventricle, there is, in a <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb,
a Pipe called <hi>Foramen ovale</hi> that opens into it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the <hi>Cava,</hi> as was noted above. To
which we ſhall here add, that at its orifice into
this Vein there is a Valve placed, that hinders
any Bloud from returning into the <hi>Foramen</hi> out
of the Vein.</p>
                  <p>And here there is one thing worth noting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the pulmonary Artery and Vein, That
whereas in all the other Arteries and Veins
through the whole Body beſides, the Bloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Arteries is of a bright ſcarlet colour,
and that in the Veins of a black purple; on the
contrary, the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> containeth black
purple Bloud, and the Vein ſcarlet-coloured.
The reaſon whereof was ſhewn before, Chap. 7.
<hi>viz.</hi> That the ſcarlet colour of the Bloud is wholly
owing to the mixture of Air with it in the Lungs.
And therefore that Bloud which the pulmonary
Artery brings into the Lungs out of the right
ventricle of the Heart, being the Venal bloud
that was brought thither from the circulation by
the <hi>Cava,</hi> changes not its colour till it paſſes out
of the ſmall twigs of the ſaid Artery into thoſe
of the pulmonary Vein, where the airy particles
inſinuate themſelves into it, and ſo alter its
colour.</p>
                  <p>The pulmonary Vein hath no Valve in it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that at its opening into the left Ventricle.
Of which Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> giveth this reaſon, That the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49419:146"/>
Bloud within the <hi>Praecordia</hi> may always, becauſe
of the <hi>Impetus</hi> of the paſſions, freely fluctuate and
regurgitate both ways, backwards and forwards.
And leſt the left ventricle of the Heart ſhould at
any time be ſuffocated by the Bloud ruſhing too
impetuouſly into it, the fleſhy Fibres in the root
of the Vein (for both this and the <hi>Cava</hi> have
ſuch there) by the inſtinct of Nature contracting
themſelves invert its courſe, and make it flow
backward towards the Lungs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of the great Artery, or Aorta.</head>
                  <p>THE fourth veſſel is the great Artery called
<hi>Aorta (arcula,</hi> a little Cheſt) and by way
of eminency <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> becauſe it is the
greateſt Artery of the whole Body, from which
all the others (except the pulmonary) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
                  <p>It ſpringeth out of the left ventricle of the
Heart,<note place="margin">Its valves.</note> and at its riſe hath three Valves looking
outwards, called <hi>Semilunares,</hi> being altogether
like thoſe at the orifice of the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi>
in the right Ventricle. Theſe hinder the Bloud
from returning out of the great Artery into the
Heart again. The orifice of the <hi>Aorta</hi> (or elſe
the Tendon of the Heart that adheres to it) in
ſome Creatures (eſpecially in Harts) does often
grow bony; and ſometimes in Men, according to
the obſervations of <hi>Bartholin</hi> and <hi>Riolanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:49419:147"/>
Aſſoon as the <hi>Aorta</hi> is gone out of the Heart, it
aſcends not in a direct courſe towards the Head;
for if it had, ſeeing it openeth ſtreight upward
out of the Ventricle, it would have poured the
Bloud in too rapid a ſtream into the Brain, and
the lower parts of the Body would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
of their due ſhare: but it firſt bends arch-wiſe,
ſo that its bowed corner ſuſtains the firſt
<hi>Impetus</hi> of the expelled Bloud, and directs the
greateſt torrent towards its deſcending trunk,
and a leſſer quantity paſſes up by the aſcending,
being to convey the Arterial bloud to fewer and
ſmaller parts.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb there comes a Pipe out
of the <hi>Arteria pulmonalis</hi> into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> called
<hi>Canalis arterioſus,</hi> which brings out of it the
greateſt part of the Bloud that was expelled out
of the right Ventricle; little more paſſing into
the Lungs than may ſerve for their nouriſhment:
of which we gave the reaſon before, Chap. 9.
After the <hi>Foetus</hi> is born, this <hi>Canalis</hi> degenerates
into an impervious Ligament.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Aorta</hi> come out of the <hi>Pericardium,</hi>
it ſendeth forth ſometimes one, but oftener two
ſmall twigs, from each ſide one, which compaſs
the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Heart like a Garland, and ſend
down according to the length of the Heart other
twigs: Theſe are called <hi>Coronariae.</hi> When theſe
two twigs have encompaſſed the <hi>baſis</hi> and meet,
they inoſculate with one another, but not with
the Veins. At their riſe out of the <hi>Aorta</hi> there is
a Valve placed, that permits the Bloud to flow
out of the great Artery into them, but hinders
its reflux.</p>

                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:49419:147"/>

into two Trunks, whereof the one is called <hi>Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus

<hi>deſcendens,</hi> the deſcending.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe two, the <hi>deſcending</hi> is largeſt, becauſe
it miniſtreth to more parts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>aſcending</hi> Trunk running up under the

ſometimes ariſes from the right Subclavian.)
Theſe at their riſe are ſuſtained by the <hi>Thymus,</hi>

Lips; and in general, through all the outer
parts of the Head and Face.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>internal,</hi> which is larger, ſends firſt ſome
more twigs to the <hi>Larynx,</hi> Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo
to the Glands behind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ears, and the ſpongy
parts of the Palate and Noſe. Then it entreth
the upper Jaw, and beſtows a ſmall ſlip on the

                  <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of the aſpera Arteria and Lungs.</head>
                  <p>AS in the firſt Book, being to treat of the
Stomach, we firſt deſcribed the Gullet,
which ſerves as a Tunnel to it; ſo the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
induces to begin with the Windpipe, called
<hi>Trachea</hi> or <hi>aſpera Arteria,</hi> thereby to uſher in the
deſcription of the Lungs, to which it performs
the ſame office as the Gullet to the Stomach, this
receiving in Air, as that does Meat and Drink.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> then is a long Pipe,<note place="margin">The wind-pipe.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of Cartilages and Membranes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the Throat or lower part of the Jaws
and lying upon the Gullet deſcends into the
Lungs, through which it ſpreads in many branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>It is commonly divided into two parts,<note place="margin">Its parts.</note> the
upper which is called <hi>Larynx,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Larynx.</note> and the lower,
that is named <hi>Bronchus.</hi> Of the former we ſhall
ſpeak in Chap. 14. where we ſhall treat of the
parts contained in the Neck; of the other here.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Bronchus</hi> we mean all the <hi>Trachea</hi> beſides
the <hi>Larynx,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note> as well before as after it arrive at
the Lungs. It is joined immediately to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx,</hi>
to whoſe loweſt Cartilage all thoſe of the
<hi>Bronchus</hi> are aſſimilated. Theſe Cartilages are
like ſo many Ribs, Hopes or Rings, ſeated one
below another at equal diſtances, and kept in
their places by the <hi>inner</hi> membrane of the <hi>Trachea,</hi>
which fills up their interſtices and ties them one
to another like a Ligament. Yet theſe Rings
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49419:155"/>
have not their circle intire, but on the back-ſide
of the <hi>Bronchus</hi> next the Gullet, that they might
give way to the Meat in ſwallowing, they paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Membrane, which is the ſame with the inner
Membrane that ties them together. So that they
are in figure like the letter C.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the inner there is alſo an <hi>outer</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
that helps to connect theſe Cartilages the
more firmly one to another, and the whole <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea</hi>
to the neighbouring parts, that it may more
ſafely and firmly deſcend into the <hi>Thorax.</hi> This
is much thinner than the other: for the inner
(according to Dr. <hi>Willis)</hi> has two rows of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Fibres, the outer ſtreight, the inner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;
the firſt by their contraction ſhorten the
<hi>Trachea,</hi> the latter ſtraiten it: ſo that he thinks
they aſſiſt expiration, eſpecially when it is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
as in coughing, hawking or the like. It is
alſo of moſt exquiſite ſenſe, as every one knows,
being the leaſt thing offends it and cauſes a
Cough, which is a ſort of Convulſive motion.
And this it ows to the recurring Nerves of the
ſixth pair (Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s eighth) creeping along
<hi>it</hi> more than the outer. It is uſually beſmear'd
with a fattiſh and mucous humour, to hinder its
drying, and to make the voice ſmoother: for
when this humour is fretted off in Catarrhs, or
it becomes unequal from any cauſe, the voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
hoarſe; and when it is dryed by too much
heat, as in Fevers, it becomes ſqueaking.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>aſpera Arteria</hi> has <hi>Veins</hi> from the external
Jugulars.<note place="margin">Its veſſels.</note> 
                     <hi>Arteries</hi> from the <hi>Carotides,</hi> and from
the <hi>Arteria bronchialis,</hi> (firſt found out by <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Ruyſch)</hi> which ſprings from the backſide of
the deſcending trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> a little above
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49419:156"/>
the lower Intercoſtals. <hi>Nerves</hi> it receives from
the recurring branches of the <hi>par vagum,</hi> as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p>When it is deſcended as low as the fourth <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra</hi>
of the <hi>Thorax,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> it is divided into two Trunks,
whereof one goes into the right lobe of the Lungs,
the other into the left, and each is preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
divided into two, and thoſe into others, till
at laſt they end in very ſmall branches, which
are diſperſed among the roots of the pulmonary
Artery and Vein, and end into and are continued
with the little Bladders that make up the greateſt
part of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Lungs. For</p>
                  <p>Though the Lungs (called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">The Lungs.</note>
                     <hi>à</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to breath) have been held to be of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> not much unlike the Liver or
Spleen; yet <hi>Malpighius</hi> hath diſcover'd them to
have a far other <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> namely ſoft, ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
and rare, made up of moſt thin and fine Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
continued with the inner coat of the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi>
which Membranes compoſe an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of little round and hollow Bladders, ſo placed
that there is an open paſſage from the <hi>Trachea</hi> out
of one into another, and all are terminated at
the outer Membrane that incloſeth the whole
Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Bladders though they are continued to
the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> yet they have no Cartilages as thoſe
have; but though they are very fine, yet they
have muſcular Fibres, whereby they contract
themſelves in expiration, but not ſo cloſe as to
expell all the Air included in them; for if the
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Lungs had fallen flat and cloſe
in expiration, it would have given ſome ſtop to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49419:156"/>
the circulation of the Bloud through them out of
the pulmonary Artery into the Vein; whereas
now that there remains ſtill ſo much Air in theſe
<hi>Veſiculae</hi> as to keep the Lungs a little pufft up and
rare, the Bloud can paſs the more eaſily and
ſwiftly through them.</p>
                  <p>That there are ſuch Bladders annexed to the
<hi>Bronchia, Diemerbroeck</hi> ſhews by two notable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
The one of a Stone-cutter's Man that died
of an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> in whom he found theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> ſo
ſtufft with the duſt of the hewn Stone, that when
he cut his Lungs open, his Knife ſeem'd as if it
went through an heap of Sand: The other of one
that being employed to pick and cleanſe Feathers,
died of a long continued <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and had theſe
Bladders quite fill'd with the fine Duſt or Down
of the Feathers. From whence he concludes,
That whereas in a natural ſtate the Air in inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is received as well into theſe Bladders as the
<hi>Bronchia,</hi> ſeeing they could not now admit any
Air, being ſtufft with the aforeſaid matters, the
Patients were neceſſarily Aſthmatical, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo.</p>
                  <p>We ſaid before that all theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with a common Membrane in the <hi>ſuperficies</hi>
of the Lungs;<note place="margin">Inveſting membrane.</note> and this Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> will have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The <hi>outer</hi> tunicle is thin and ſmooth, which
ſeems to be a fine texture of nervous filaments;
the <hi>inner</hi> rough and thicke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, conſiſting almoſt
wholly of the extremities of the Veſſels and <hi>Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae;</hi>
and through the little pits that are all over
made in it by them, its inner <hi>ſuperficies</hi> looks like
an Honey-comb. This inveſting Membrane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
thus of two Tunicles has many large pores,
but ſuch as admit not any thing to paſs from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49419:157"/>
within outwards; for if one fill the Lungs newly
taken out of a Sheep or the like (before they are
cold) with a pair of Bellows never ſo full of
wind, there will none paſs out of the Membrane,
not ſo much as to make the flame of a Candle to
wave: but on the other ſide they do admit even
liquors to paſs from without inwards; ſo when
the Breaſt has been opened to let out matter in an
<hi>Empyema,</hi> (which was too thick to be abſorbed
by the too narrow pores) and bitter cleanſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
have been ſquirted into the cavity of the
<hi>Thorax,</hi> to clear it from the purulent matter
ſtagnating in it, it has been obſerved that a good
part of ſuch injections have been hawkt and
cough'd up. And though ſome think that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>Pus</hi> is cough'd up, it is certainly bred in
the Lungs themſelves; yet I am of opinion that
in an <hi>Empyema</hi> when it is thin, theſe pores may
be ſo large as to imbibe it even out of the cavity
of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> otherwiſe I ſee not how any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
of an <hi>Empyema</hi> ſhould ever be cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tapping: for of the two I think this a far
more probable way to diſcharge the matter by,
than that it ſhould be imbib'd by the mouths of
the Veins gaping (as is ſuppos'd) either in the
ſuperficies of the <hi>Pleura</hi> or Diaphragm. But to
proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs are divided into the right and left
part,<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> being parted by the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> and each
part is otherwiſe called a <hi>Lobe.</hi> And becauſe
they are two, that have no communication one
with the other (ſave in one <hi>Trachea,</hi> by which
the Air comes into and goes out of them) hence
in common ſpeech we ſay <hi>Lungs</hi> in the plural.
Each of theſe parts or Lobes is ſubdivided into
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49419:157"/>
two, ſometimes three others, and thoſe into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
leſſer Lobules, as may be ſeen in the following
Figure taken from Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lungs hang by the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> that runs
through the middle of their ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> and ſo by
its means adhere to the Neck. Preternaturally
(though pretty often) they cleave by their outer
ſuperficies to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and ſometimes with
their lower end to the Diaphragm.</p>
                  <p>They have all ſorts of Veſſels,<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them with other parts;<note place="margin">1. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea.</note> but peculiar to
themſelves they have <hi>Bronchia</hi> or the branches of
the Wind-pipe, for bringing in and carrying
forth of Air.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins</hi> are the <hi>Arteria</hi> and
<hi>Vena pulmonaris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Arteries and Veins.</note> that accompany all the diviſions
of the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> within their ſeveral Lobes.
Theſe open one into the other by many anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſes,
and are interwoven one with another all
through the coats of the <hi>Veſiculae.</hi> But of theſe
we diſcourſed ſo largely before, Chap. 10. that
we ſhall ſay no more of them here. Beſides
theſe, that were all the ſanguiferous veſſels Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts
had obſerved to reach to the Lungs, there
has of late been found out an Artery by <hi>Frederick
Ruyſch</hi> (which he calls <hi>Arteria bronchialis)</hi> that
ſeems to convey Bloud for the nouriſhment of the
Lungs and <hi>Bronchia.</hi> But of this likewiſe before
(in this Chapter.)</p>
                  <p>They have abundance of <hi>Lympheducts</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the Veins and Arteries.<note place="margin">3. Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts.</note> Their ſmall
twigs running upon the outer <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the
Lungs, towards their root unite into ſeveral
greater trunks; which being inſerted into the
common thoracick duct, diſcharge thereinto the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49419:158"/>
                     <hi>Lympha</hi> imbibed by them in the Lungs. They
may be made to appear very plain in the outward
ſurface, if in diſſecting a Live-dog, one preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the top of the thoracick duct, ſo as nothing be
poured from thence into the Subclavian vein:
for then the Lympheducts of the Lungs, ſeeing
they cannot unload themſelves into the common
duct that is now ſtopt and full, will ſwell very
much and be very conſpicuous. If theſe Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts
at any time be obſtructed or broken,
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> thinks there often proceeds from
thence a Dropſie of the Breaſt or Lungs, yea
Coughs and Phthiſical diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſort of Veſſels diſperſed in the Lungs
are the Nerves.<note place="margin">4. Nerves.</note> And theſe proceed from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
Nerves of the <hi>Par vagum,</hi> uſually called
the ſixth pair, but Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s eighth, who ſays
they are diſtributed all over the Lungs along with
the ſanguiferous Veſſels and ducts of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi>
to ſupply animal ſpirits to the muſcular Fibres of
their Coats.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Action</hi> is reſpiration, of which in the

                  <head type="sub">Of Reſpiration.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Action</hi> for which the Lungs are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Nature is <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> which is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative
<hi>Diaſtole</hi> and <hi>Syſtole,</hi> or dilatation and
contraction of the Breaſt, whereby the Air is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in, and driven forth of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lungs do not dilate themſelves by
any proper power or faculty of their own,<note place="margin">How reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is performed.</note> being
deſtitute of inſtruments to perform ſuch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor do they attract the Air by any magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
property, in inſpiration: But the Muſcles of
the <hi>Thorax</hi> being ſo framed, that though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
be the only and proper action of a Muſcle,
yet the <hi>Thorax</hi> is dilated by certain of them, as it
is contracted by others; whilſt it is dilated, there
is greater ſpace given for expanding the Lungs,
and then the Air by its proper elaſtick virtue
does of its own accord iſſue in at the <hi>Trachea,</hi>
and inſinuates it ſelf into all its <hi>Bronchia</hi> and into
the <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> and puffs them all up; namely to
the end that its nitrous particles may every where
meet with the Bloud as it glides through all the
parts of the Lungs: And when the Breaſt rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from that dilatation is contracted, the
Lungs, being partly compreſſed thereby, and
partly by the muſcular Fibres of the <hi>Veſiculae</hi> and
of the inner coat of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and <hi>Bronchia,</hi>
expell the Air out again.</p>
                  <p>The Muſcles that aſſiſt the dilatation of the
Breaſt,<note place="margin">Muſcles miniſtring to reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> are thoſe that lift up the Ribs and draw
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49419:161"/>
them backwards; which ſhall be deſcribed
Book 4. Chap. 15. And beſides theſe there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
internal Muſcle, namely the Midriff, that
contributes towards it, as was ſhewed Chap. 3. of
this Book, where we treated of it. And as for
the ſtraitning or concidence of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> that
it is not only a motion of reſtitution, or a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the foreſaid Muſcles from their action, as
evident, ſeeing ſometimes expiration is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more laboriouſly and violently than inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in coughing, hollooing, or the like.
And therefore Nature has provided peculiar and
proper Muſcles for that purpoſe, deſcribed in
the ſame Chapter of the fourth Book; and theſe
are aſſiſted partly by ſome Muſcles of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and partly by the muſcular Fibres of the
<hi>Veſiculae, Trachea</hi> and <hi>Bronchia,</hi> as aboveſaid.</p>
                  <p>There hath been great controverſie among
Philoſophers whether reſpiration be an Animal
or Natural motion.<note place="margin">What kind of motion reſpiration is.</note> That it is <hi>natural,</hi> is thought
to be proved, both in that it is performed as well
when we are aſleep, as awake; and alſo that
though it be continued through a Man's whole
life, yet we are never wearied with it as we are
with animal and voluntary motions. On the
other ſide ſome prove it to be <hi>animal,</hi> firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is performed by ſuch Inſtruments as ſerve
for animal motion, namely Muſcles; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe at our pleaſure we can make it quicker
or ſlower, ſtronger or weaker, or alter it how
we pleaſe. Others thinking the arguments on
either ſide convincing, take both in, and ſuppoſe
it a kind of mixt action, partly natural, and
partly ſpontaneous. But I think there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
from the arguments alledged to grant this
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49419:161"/>
motion to be natural, or any more than animal or
ſpontaneous. For as to the <hi>firſt</hi> argument, that
the motion is as well performed when we ſleep as
when we are awake, and therefore it cannot be
voluntary; if this were allowed to be of force,
we muſt alſo grant walking and talking to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motions, becauſe many perform them both,
when they are aſleep. And as to the <hi>ſecond,</hi>
from our not being wearied by it, in anſwer to it
we may diſtinguiſh of animal actions, into ſuch
as are done by inſtinct and are free, and into
ſuch as ſerve the affections of the mind: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
proceed always and without impediment,
even when we think not thereon, but may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
be directed and moderated when we
do think of them, and ſuch is reſpiration; the
latter is not performed continually, as to run,
leap, write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the former there is a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and continual influx of animal ſpirits into
the Muſcles, of cuſtom or courſe; whence there
follows no wearineſs, though they be continual:
In the latter, ſeeing by the determination that is
made in the Brain the ſpirits now flow in and
anon ceaſe, ſometimes in greater plenty and
ſometimes in leſs, from this mutation and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomedneſs
does the wearineſs proceed.</p>
                  <p>Reſpiration is ſo neceſſary to the continuance
of life,<note place="margin">The uſe of it.</note> that after once the <hi>Foetus</hi> comes into the
open Air and begins to breath, it can hardly live
two minutes without it. But upon what account
it becomes ſo neceſſary is not agreed among lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, each party exhibiting ſuch reaſons of
it, as may beſt ſuit with their hypotheſes. Hence
<hi>ſome</hi> (and thoſe the moſt) think that reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſerves for the cooling and ventilating of the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49419:162"/>
Bloud that acquires a great heat in the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of the Heart, and alſo for the carrying out
fuliginous ſtreams therefrom. <hi>Others,</hi> that it
ſerves for the better mixture of the particles of
the Bloud as it paſſes through the Lungs, as alſo
to further its circulation. <hi>Others,</hi> that the Air
is inſpired for the greater ſubtilization of the
Bloud, and inkindling of the vital ſpirits, or
(to continue the metaphor) vital flame. More
opinions there are, but this laſt is (if not the
trueſt) the moſt ingenious, and is very learnedly
maintained by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> &amp;c.
whom the Reader may be pleas'd to conſult for
further ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>A ſecondary uſe is to form the voice; for ſuch
Creatures as breath not (as Fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> are
mute.</p>

                  <p>THE Hairs of the Head are called in Latine
<hi>Capilli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its name.</note> quaſi <hi>Capitis pili,</hi> and differ not from

                  <p>Now an Hair may be defined to be a body cold
and dry,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> ſmall, thread-like, hard and flexible,
budding from the Skin.</p>
                  <p>The Hairs are ſeldom round,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> but generally
four ſquare, as the ſtalks of ſome Plants; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
triangular, but always porous, the pores
running lengthways. All theſe things may be
obſerved in a good Microſcope. They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
curled, and ſometimes hang lank.</p>
                  <p>Hairs are commonly divided into <hi>Congeniti,</hi>
ſuch as we bring into the World with us, as thoſe
of the Head, Eyelids, and Eyebrows; and <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniti,</hi>
ſuch as begin to grow at certain ſeaſons in
our life-time, as the Beard, the Hairs growing
about the <hi>Pudenda,</hi> on the Breaſt, in the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
and the like.</p>
                  <p>They are no parts of the Body,<note place="margin">Life.</note> and therefore
have no Animal life; yet they have a Vegetative
life, and that peculiar to themſelves, and not
owing to the life of the Body, ſeeing they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49419:166"/>
to grow after a Man is dead, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in embalmed Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The matter out of which they are bred and
nouriſhed is commonly reputed to be a moiſt,<note place="margin">Matter.</note> fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous,
craſs, earthy and ſomewhat viſcid excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the third concoction. <hi>Spigelius</hi> thinks
they are nouriſhed by Bloud: which opinion he
grounds on an analogy he ſuppoſes there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Hair, and the Feathers of Fowl; and theſe
latter he ſays are apparently nouriſhed by Bloud,
for if one pull one from off a young Fowl, its end
is bloudy. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> diſſents not much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
but thinks the Bloud to be prepared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
in a ſpecifical manner into a craſs, earthy
and viſcid juice. Whatever the matter be, it is
attracted by the white roots of the Hairs, and is
carried even to their very ends by the pores; juſt
as Plants receive nouriſhment out of the Earth by
their Roots, and communicate it to their outmoſt
parts.</p>
                  <p>The colour of them is anſwerable to the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,<note place="margin">Colour.</note>
or to the natural conſtitution of the party,
or to the diverſity of thoſe humours that are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the juice whereby they are nouriſhed. In
thoſe of cold flegmatick conſtitutions they uſe to
be of a light colour, in cholerick, reddiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
They are moſt commonly ſtreight in thoſe which
are born in cold Countries, but curled in thoſe
who inhabit hot Climates.</p>
                  <p>And as the reaſon of the difference of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Hair in ſeveral perſons is from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
temperaments,<note place="margin">Why hair turns white.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo the reaſon why Men
in old age grow grey, whenas their Hair before
was of another colour, ſeemeth to be the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance
of flegm in that juice that nouriſheth
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49419:166"/>
them: whence alſo the Hairs of the Head and
Face ſooneſt turn white, becauſe the Brain does
more abound with pituitous humours than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the Body. But it is not ſo eaſy to
give a reaſon of ſome Men's turning grey in one
nights time, when they have been under great
fears; of which there are many inſtances credibly
reported.</p>
                  <p>The Hairs have three <hi>uſes:</hi>

and white, of exquiſite ſenſe, immediately ſeated
under the <hi>Membrana carnoſa.</hi> It covereth the

lie upon the <hi>Cranium,</hi> for it is ſtretched over them,
and ſeeing it is very ſenſible and tender, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
horrible pain and inflammation, when the
temporal Muſcle is wounded.</p>
                  <p>It is tied to the <hi>Dura mater</hi> by ſome nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,<note place="margin">Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</note>
which paſs within the Skull by its Sutures,
to ſtay firmly the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> and alſo the Brain
which it inveſts, from inordinate moving. And
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49419:167"/>
although in Infants new born theſe be ſtrongly

by ſome fibrous ties, by which, inflammations may
be communicated from the <hi>Pericranium</hi> to the

                  <p>Next under the <hi>Pericranium</hi> is ſpread the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſteum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perioſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note>
which immediately cleaveth to the
Skull and gives it that ſenſe which it hath. It
ſelf is a very thin and nervous Membrane, and of
very acute ſenſe. All the Bones of the whole Body

above the temporal Muſcles, whereas the <hi>Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteum</hi>
always cleaveth cloſe and immediately to
the Bone, as here it doth to the Skull under the

                  <p>Theſe two Membranes outwardly inveſting the
<hi>Cranium</hi> have Arteries from a branch of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

ſaving in its <hi>baſis,</hi> to which it is ſo firmly knit,
that it can hardly be pulled from it; or where it
is ſuſpended by Veſſels entring into it from the

the outer of which is more rough, towards the
<hi>Cranium;</hi> and the inner is more ſmooth and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and as it were bedewed with water. It is
knit to the <hi>Pia mater</hi> by many veſſels that paſs

the Brain into the right and left ſide. This
duplicature, becauſe it is broader backwards, and
grows narrower forwards, and ſo reſembles in
ſome manner a Reaper's Sickle, is called <hi>Falx.</hi>
Now this <hi>Falx</hi> reaches as far forwards as to the
top of the Noſe, where it grows to the Partition-bone
that diſtinguiſhes the <hi>Proceſſus mammillares,</hi>
and is called <hi>Galli criſta</hi> or Cock's comb. But its

                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſaid duplicature are formed four <hi>Sinus</hi> or
Cavities,<note place="margin">Sinus.</note> three pretty large, and one little one.
The firſt which is the higheſt and longeſt, runs
along the upper part of the <hi>Falx,</hi> from the top of
the Noſe lengthways of the Head towards the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciput,</hi>
where it is divided into two lateral <hi>Sinus</hi>

both of Arteries and Veins are ſaid to open; by

them, and abſorbed again out of them by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Whence if one open the Skull of a live-Creature,
one may obſerve a beating in the long

the Veins alſo convey ſome Bloud into them,
which being ſuperfluous to the nouriſhment of the
Brain and <hi>Meninges</hi> is poured in hither by the
Veins from the reſpective parts, and is imbibed
again by other Veins opening into them, namely
the inner branches of the Jugulars, to be returned
to the Heart. The place where all theſe <hi>Sinus</hi>
meet together at the <hi>Occiput,</hi> is called <hi>torcular
Herophili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond (and inner) Membrane inveſting the
Brain is called <hi>Tenuis meninx</hi> or <hi>Pia mater.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pia mater.</note> This
is of moſt exquiſite ſenſe, and endowed with very
many Arteries and Veins. It immediately cloaths
the Brain and hinders it from running about, and
alſo involves all its windings and circuits, and

may eaſily be ſeparated and laid open.
From this ſame <hi>Meninx</hi> proceeds alſo a moſt thin

(called the <hi>Corpus calloſum)</hi> is evidently divided
into flattiſhly round little Fibres, which in the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49419:169"/>
Brains of Fiſh are ſo apparent, that if you hold
them betwixt you and the light, they repreſent
the ſmall teeth of an Ivory comb. Theſe Fibres
he ſaith are inſerted by their ends into the <hi>Cortex</hi>
or the aſh-coloured outer part of the Brain,
through which abundance of ſanguiferous veſſels
are diſperſed, and out of which therefore the
aforeſaid Fibres ſeem to draw their nouriſhment.
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> calls theſe Fibres <hi>Canales</hi> or <hi>Striae,</hi>
whence the <hi>Corpus calloſum</hi> might as well be called
<hi>Striatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For nutrition and confection of Animal ſpirits
it receives Bloud by Arteries derived from the
<hi>Carotides</hi> and Cervical,<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> whoſe Capillaries are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
through its ſubſtance: and what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
to the ſaid uſes is partly imbibed by the
Veins of the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and partly depoſited in
the <hi>Sinus</hi>'s by the Arteries themſelves, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the internal branches of the Jugulars, and
thereby to the Heart. The Arteries inoſculate
one with another <hi>(i. e.</hi> the right <hi>Carotides</hi> with the
left) as well as with the Veins. And it is from
the Pulſe of the Arteries altogether, that the
beating (or <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> as it were) of the
Brain proceedeth.</p>

                  <p>THE Brain taken in a large ſignification hath
three parts, <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> that which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

which is within the Skull.</p>
                  <p>Now there are ſeveral methods of diſſecting
the Brain, ſome beginning behind, as Dr. <hi>Willis;</hi>
ſome on the right ſide, as <hi>Sylvius;</hi> and ſome at
the Crown, which is the old way, and this we
ſhall follow, beginning with the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo called, which lieth uppermoſt.</p>
                  <p>The Brain differeth from the <hi>Cerebellum;</hi>

                  <p>The upper part of the Brain is divided into

ſays, it is wholly medullar: whence ſome divide

                  </p>
                  <p>The inferiour part of the <hi>Corpus calloſum</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a partition,<note place="margin">Septum lucidum.</note> which is called <hi>Septum lucidum.</hi>
It is looſe and wrinkled; but if it be ſpread
out, and held to the light, it appeareth clear. It
cleaveth above to the <hi>Corpus calloſum,</hi> but below
to the <hi>Fornix.</hi> Some will have it to be a redupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>Pia mater;</hi> others a portion of the
Brain.</p>
                  <p>Under the <hi>Corpus calloſum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fornix.</note> the <hi>Fornix</hi> or Vault
is ſeated, of the like ſubſtance. In the upper
part it is arched; but in the lower part convex:
in figure it is triangular. It holdeth up the weight
of this upper part of the Brain from bearing
down on the ſubjacent parts.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavities in the Brain,<note place="margin">Sinus.</note>
that are continued indeed to one another, yet
becauſe at the firſt view they ſeem ſeparate, are
conſidered by Anatomiſts as diſtinct, and they
commonly reckon four of them: three of which
are ſeated in the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> of which in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and the fourth is common to the <hi>Cerebellum</hi>
and <hi>Medulla oblongata,</hi> of which in the next.</p>
                  <p>The Brain being taken away as far as the <hi>Corpus
calloſum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The two anteriour.</note> there appear two of the ſaid <hi>Sinus,</hi>
which are called the ſuperiour, lateral, or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and which are divided into the right and
left by the <hi>Septum lucidum</hi> juſt now deſcribed.
They are ſomething of the ſhape of Half-moons,
or Horſe-ſhoes, and being inveſted with a very
thin Membrane, they deſcend <hi>forwards</hi> by a pretty
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49419:171"/>
large duct to the <hi>Proceſſus mammillares.</hi> And
<hi>backwards</hi> they deſcend to the baſis of the Brain,
in which place branches of the <hi>Carotides</hi> enter
their Membrane,<note place="margin">Plexus choroides.</note> and make in it the <hi>Plexus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides,</hi>
together with ſome twigs of Veins inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with them. The Membrane wherein this
<hi>Plexus</hi> is formed, has very many ſmall Glandules,
which ſeparate a pituitous matter or flegm from
the Veſſels into the <hi>Sinus.</hi> Along which it has
been ſuppoſed to flow to the <hi>Proceſſus mammilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
and from them to deſtill through the <hi>Os cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briforme</hi>
into the Noſe. But Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> denies
any ſuch office of the <hi>Os cribriforme,</hi> affirming
that the holes in it are only for the tranſit of the
Nerves and Membranes going forth from the
<hi>Proceſſus,</hi> and that theſe fill them ſo cloſe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can flow through them. And ſays, that
flux of Rheum through the Noſe, upon the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi>
and into the Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Catarrhs, falls not
from the Head, but is ſeparated from the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in the Glands of the reſpective parts, as into
the Noſe through the Glands of its inveſting
Membrane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to the ſerous matter that
is infuſed into theſe <hi>Sinus</hi> in the Brain, he ſays it
is all abſorbed again by the Veſſels opening into
them, and returns by the Jugular veins to the
Heart.</p>
                  <p>The third Ventricle is nothing elſe,<note place="margin">The one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior.</note> but the
meeting of the former two, towards the hinder
part. In it there are two paſſages: the firſt in
the fore-part, which marcheth ſtreight-ways
down to the <hi>Infundibulum.</hi> The ſecond paſſeth
under the <hi>Teſtes</hi> and <hi>Nates</hi> to the fourth Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and is called <hi>Foramen ani</hi> or <hi>Vulva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infundibulum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Infundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum.</note> or Funnel, is a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49419:171"/>
under this third Ventricle, paſſing down
from about the middle of it, ſay ſome, but Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Wharton</hi> ſays out of the fourth. It is framed of
the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> which being wide at its beginning,
and becoming narrower towards its end, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
a Funnel.<note place="margin">Glandula pituitaria.</note> It endeth in the <hi>Glandula pituita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
which is placed in the cavity of the <hi>Sella equina,</hi>
and upon the wedge-like Bone, through which it
has been thought to deſtil upon the Palate, the
flegm poured upon it by the <hi>Infundibulum.</hi> But
Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> denies this, appealing to the ſtructure
of the parts, and his often experiments upon
Calves heads: <q>In which, he ſays, the wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Bone lying under the <hi>Glandula pituitaria</hi>
is ſometimes perforated in divers places, at
leaſt by one large duct, which being divided
into two does on each ſide open into the Jugular
veins: ſo that if Milk or Ink be injected through
thoſe ducts by a Syringe, it preſently paſſeth
through on each ſide into the ſaid Veins; and
nothing of tincture will appear about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
Noſtrils, Mouth, <hi>Fauces</hi> or <hi>Larynx.</hi> So
that in a Calf the humour that proceeds from
the Brain, returns all again into the Veins.
And the ſame thing he ſays he has lately tried
in a Man's Skull, wherein though the wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Bone be never perforated, yet Nature has
framed other ducts whereby all the <hi>Serum</hi> may
be again derived out of the Ventricles of the
Brain into the Bloud: for there are two Veſſels
ſeated on each ſide the <hi>Sella Turcica</hi> (to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
Book 6. Chap. 6.) which with gaping
Mouths as it were receive all the water deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of the <hi>Glandula pituitaria,</hi> and depoſite
it on each ſide into the Jugular veins without
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49419:172"/>
the Skull; whoſe ducts will eaſily appear if
water or milk be ſquirted forcibly out of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
into either Jugular vein near the Skull,
for the liquor will by and by break out near the
<hi>Glandula pituitaria,</hi> which makes it evident,
that whatever <hi>Serum</hi> is ſeparated into the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
of the Brain, and iſſues out of them
through the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> deſtils not upon the
Palate, but is poured again into the Bloud and
mixed with it.]</q> So that according to this
opinion, the Rheum that iſſues ſo plentifully
ſometimes into the Mouth and <hi>Fauces, &amp;c.</hi> falls not
from the Brain, but, as was noted above, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Arteries immediately by the
Glands of the reſpective parts.</p>
                  <p>About this Glandule, all over the ſides of the
aforeſaid Cavity, there is a membranous <hi>Plexus</hi>
framed of innumerable twigs of Arteries; which
ſpring from the largeſt branch of the <hi>Carotides,</hi>
that paſſeth by a proper hole in the bones of the
Temples, into the capacity of the <hi>Cranium:</hi> it
is called <hi>Rete intrabile,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rete mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile.</note> repreſenting a Net ſpread
abroad.</p>
                  <p>About the hindermoſt paſſage of the third Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
which leadeth to the fourth Ventricle, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
round bodies appear, being ſmall protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
or portions of the <hi>Medulla oblongata.</hi> As
firſt, and uppermoſt, there are the two ends of
the roots of the ſaid <hi>Medulla,</hi> which are called
<hi>Corpora ſtriata,</hi> being of ſuch a like ſubſtance as
the <hi>Corpus calloſum</hi> before deſcribed. The reſt
lying under theſe have their denomination from
thoſe things which they reſemble. The firſt is
<hi>Glandula pinealis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Penis.</note> or <hi>Penis;</hi> becauſe it repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Pine-nut, or a Man's Yard. It is ſeated
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49419:172"/>
in the beginning of that Pipe, by which the third
and fourth Ventricles are united. Its <hi>baſis</hi> is
downwards, and its <hi>apex</hi> or end looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
It is of a ſubſtance harder than the Brain,
of a pale colour, and covered with a thin Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.
This Gland <hi>des Cartes</hi> thinks to be the
primary ſeat of the Soul, and that all animal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
draw their origine from it. But <hi>Bartholin</hi>
has ſufficiently confuted that opinion; for it
ſeems to be but of the ſame uſe as other Glands,
and particularly the <hi>Glandula pituitaria</hi> placed
near it, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeparate the <hi>Lympha</hi> from the
Arterial bloud; which <hi>Lympha</hi> is reſorbed by the
Veins (or it may be by <hi>Vaſa lymphatica)</hi> as was
ſhewn above from Dr. <hi>Lower.</hi> Near to this on
both the ſides of this third Ventricle four round
bodies appear. The two upper are leſſer, and
are called <hi>Teſtes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Teſtes.</note> the two greater are lower, and
are called <hi>Nates.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nates.</note> The Chink betwixt the <hi>Nates</hi>
is called <hi>Anus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anus.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of theſe Ventricles is firſt for the more
eaſie paſſage of the Bloud;<note place="margin">The uſe of the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> for it were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

now it has no ſuch lett, ſeeing the Veſſels are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
in the Membranes that inveſt theſe
<hi>Sinus,</hi> and make the <hi>Plexus choroides</hi> and <hi>Rete mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile</hi>
abovementioned. Another uſe is for the
reception of the ſerous excrement of the Bloud
ſeparated from it by the glandulous Membrane of
the <hi>Plexus choroides,</hi> and <hi>Glandula pituitaria;</hi>
which according to the old doctrine was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out of them by the ſieve-like Bone at the top
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49419:173"/>
of the Noſtrils, and through the wedge-like Bone
upon the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula, Fauces, &amp;c.</hi> but according to

many Fibres and Filaments, and paſſing through

the Membrane that inveſts them. Yet beſides
this uſe of ſmelling, he thinks they may deſtil
ſome of their moiſture into the Noſtrils through
the holes of the <hi>Os cribriforme</hi> by the duct of the
Fibres and Filaments. <hi>Diemerbro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or <hi>Lympha</hi> deſtils from them as well upon the <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and their Glands, as into the Noſtrils.
Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> grants only the former uſe; and ſays,
<q>that It is incredible that the humour that is
contained in the cavity of theſe proceſſes ſhould
iſſue out by the Nerves into the Noſtrils, for if
it did, the ſenſe of Smelling muſt needs be much
prejudic'd thereby. And beſides, if this water
could deſtil by and out of the Nerves, much
more might the ſpirits, that are thinner and
more ſubtil, fly away. And as to the humour
contained in the cavity of the proceſſes, he
ſuppoſes it to be of very great uſe: namely,
that when <hi>Effluvia</hi> or moſt ſubtil particles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling
from an external object are delivered to
the <hi>olfactory Nerves,</hi> that their ſpecies may
reach the Brain the better, it was neceſſary
that thoſe Nerves or <hi>Proceſſes</hi> ſhould be made
hollow from their very riſe, and be filled with a
limpid humour: Not that I believe, ſays he,
that the ſpecies themſelves are conveyed
through their cavities into the ventricles of the
Brain, or that the Animal ſpirits are lodged in
thoſe Ventricles, as the Ancients thought;
but that they are therefore hollow and moiſten'd
within with water, that their marrowy bodies
may ſerve the better both for retaining and
conveying ſmells into the Brain: For as things
ſmelled are better perceived from moiſt bodies

                  <head type="sub">Of the Action of the Brain, and the ſuppoſed
Succus nutritius of the Nerves.</head>
                  <p>IT is generally agreed that the proper Action
of the Brain (in a large ſenſe) is the elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
of Animal ſpirits; and that they are ſent
from it by the Nerves into the ſeveral parts of the
Body, for performing both natural and animal
actions. But what theſe Animal ſpirits are, and
in what particular part of the Brain they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
is not agreed upon by learned Men.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion that the Animal ſpirits
differ in no other regard from the Vital,<note place="margin">The animal ſpirits what, and of what made.</note> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they are conveyed by proper Veſſels, and
miniſter to other purpoſes, and are of a cooler
temperament; but that there is no ſpecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt them. Others on the other ſide
think they differ <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and agree in nothing,
but only that the Vital ſpirits and Bloud are the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49419:176"/>
matter from whence the Animal ſpirits are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
A third ſort deny the Arterial bloud to be
the matter of theſe Spirits, and affirm that the
Nerves abſorb a part of the Chyle, of which they
are made, and beſides, a Nutritious juice, (of
which by and by.) And ſome there are that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Air alſo to be an Ingredient, which aſcends
into the Brain through the <hi>Os cribriforme.</hi> We
cannot ſtand upon the examination and refutation
of ſeveral of theſe opinions here; but upon a due
conſideration of the Arguments urged for each,
we think that the Animal ſpirits are ſpecifically
diſtinct from the Vital, but that the Vital, with
the Arterial bloud, their Vehicle, are the true
and only matter, out of which they are elaborated.</p>
                  <p>And there is no leſs difference in what part of
the Brain the Animal ſpirits are made.<note place="margin">Where ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated.</note> Some
thinking in the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Falx.</hi> others the four
ventricles of the Brain, eſpecially the fourth, a
third ſort the <hi>Plexus choroides</hi> and <hi>Rete mirabile;
des Cartes,</hi> that they are ſeparated out of the
Arteries of <hi>Plexus choroides</hi> in the <hi>Glandula pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealis</hi>
into the Ventricles; and others laſtly aſſign
the whole ſubſtance of the Brain for the place of
their confection. As to the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Falx,</hi> the
uſe of that was ſhewn above Chap. 3. And as to
the Ventricles, ſeeing they are often almoſt <hi>quite
full</hi> of wateriſh humour, but always have <hi>ſome,</hi>
they ſeem very unfit for the making or receiving
ſuch ſubtil and volatile Spirits as the Animal are.
As for the <hi>Plexus choroides</hi> and <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> there
is no Veſſel in either that contains any thing, but
under the form of Bloud; ſo that ſeeing there are
no <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> (or call them what you will)
to convey the Spirits to the origine of the Nerves,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49419:177"/>
theſe alſo ſeem improper for ſuch an action. We
muſt therefore ſubſcribe to the laſt opinion that
aſcribes this work to the very ſubſtance of the
Brain, and is performed in this manner. The
Heart is like the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of the Body, to
which the motion of all the humours, that have
once paſt it, is owing. This by its <hi>Syſtole</hi> impells
the Bloud, as into all other parts, ſo into the
Brain by the ſeveral branches of the <hi>Carotides,</hi>
whoſe innumerable twigs run partly through the
outer <hi>Cortex</hi> or greyiſh part of the Brain, and
partly into the inner medullar or white ſubſtance.
Theſe twigs of Arteries ſpring partly from the
<hi>Plexus choroides</hi> and <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> and partly
from the <hi>Carotides</hi> themſelves immediately. The
ſuperfluous <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud is ſeparated by the
Glands above deſcribed; and that which is not
elaborated into Animal ſpirit, is returned again
to the Heart, by the Veins. But thoſe particles
that are fit and proper to be converted into them,
are extravaſated into the very <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the
Brain, or at leaſt are diſtributed through it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Capillaries, in which being perfected into
Spirits, theſe by help of the Fibres or Filaments
which the inner ſubſtance of the Brain chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of, are conveyed to the <hi>Corpora ſtriata</hi> (or
other proceſſes of the <hi>Medulla oblongata</hi> that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the Brain) which conſiſt of the like Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and by them to the Nerves, whoſe inner
ſubſtance is fibrous like the <hi>Medulla</hi> from whence
they ſpring. And the reaſon of this ſucceſſive
motion from one to another, is the Pulſe of the
Heart, whereby that which comes behind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
drives forward what is before. Whence
the true cauſe of an Apoplexy (wherein motion
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49419:177"/>
and ſenſe are almoſt quite aboliſht) is from the
obſtruction or compreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Arteries
in the Brain; whereby both little Bloud and
Vital ſpirit can be conveyed thither to make Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſpirit of, and alſo when it is made, it is not
impelled out of the Brain along the Fibres into
the Nerves, to enable them to perform their
functions.</p>
                  <p>There is no leſs controverſie about the Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
juice of the Nerves:<note place="margin">The <hi>ſuccus nutritius</hi> of the Nerves.</note> ſome contending for it
to that height, as to affirm that all the parts of
the Body are only nouriſh'd by it, and not at all
by the Bloud, which by its rapid motion they ſay
is liker to wear and carry away ſomething from
the parts through which it paſſes, than to adhere
to them for their reſtauration. Others are more
moderate, and ſuppoſe that nouriſhment is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
only to the ſpermatick parts by the
Nerves, which the Nerves receive not from the
Bloud, but imbibing the moſt thin part of the
Chyle out of the Stomach and Guts do carry it up
to the Brain, from whence it is conveyed again
by the ſame Nerves to the parts to be nouriſh'd
by it. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> is of opinion, that the juice
of the Nerves (which is as a Vehicle to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits)
being ſomewhat acid, does contribute or
yield aſſiſtance to the nouriſhment of the ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
parts, not as it is the matter of, but as it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
from the Bloud ſuch particles as are fit
for, their nouriſhment. Whence it is, he ſays,
that ſuch parts of the Body as are moſt exerciſed,
and by conſequent into which moſt Animal ſpirits
flow, grow the ſtrongeſt, having more of ſuch
particles of the Bloud as are fit for their inſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſeparated in them. So they that are uſed
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49419:178"/>
to walk, will endure it better, than others that
are not ſo uſed, though otherwiſe much ſtronger.
And hence the right Arm is uſually ſtronger than
the left, in thoſe that are right-handed (as we
ſay.) But he thinks that the Nerves have no
juice in them which they did not firſt receive from
the Bloud. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> is much of his opinion,
ſaving as to this laſt particular; for he ſays, it is
without doubt that the nervous Fibres and Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which cloath the ſenſory of the taſte, and
the Bowels that ſerve concoction, do immediately
take ſome taſte of the Aliments for the ſupply of
the Brain, eſpecially at ſuch times as the Spirits
are much waſted in too long faſting or over much
exerciſe. But then that juice that may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be made thereof in the Brain, and to be
diſpenſed by the Nerves into all the parts of the
Body, he believes not to be the matter of the
nouriſhment of any part whether ſpermatick or
ſanguineous: but that it is as the <hi>form</hi> only, and
the Bloud the <hi>matter,</hi> whoſe ſeveral particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
analyſed or ſevered by the ſaid juice, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and adapted by its <hi>directive faculty</hi> or <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
power</hi> as it were, to ſuch parts reſpectively
as they are ſuitable for. And from hence he draws
a reaſon why paralytick parts do waſte ſo much,
though the Bloud flow plentifully enough into
them, becauſe the Nerves being obſtructed and
no Animal ſpirits (with their Vehicle) paſſing
by them, the particles of the Bloud are not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
for the ſupply of ſuch parts.] As for the
nervous juice, it muſt needs be very little in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
ſeeing if one make a Ligature upon the
Nerve, it will not ſwell betwixt the Head and
Ligature, nor if one cut the Nerve in ſunder will
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49419:178"/>
any thing deſtil out of it. So that 'tis very abſurd
to think that it ſhould be ſufficient for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of all the parts of the Body, according
to the firſt opinion. Nor does it ſeem reaſonable
to imagine that the Chyle ſhould aſcend from the
Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Brain by the Nerves, whiles
this nervous juice that is contended for, with the
Animal ſpirits, is deſcending by the ſame; for
one cannot conceive how ſuch contrary motions
of liquors in the ſame Veſſel can be at the ſame
time. Though from the ſudden refection that
perſons ready to faint receive from ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it be probable that certain <hi>Effluvia</hi>
or ſubtil and ſpirituous vapours do enter the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſilaments of the Mouth and Stomach, and
recruit the Animal ſpirits immediately, without
fetching that compaſs that I believe all the Chyle
does. And as the Nerves imbibe no Chyle from
the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo receive they no more from
the Arteries, than ſome of its moſt ſpirituous and
volatile particles elaborated in the Brain into
Animal ſpirits, which have indeed ſome little
moiſture accompanying them as a Vehicle, but
which is neither of a ſuitable nature nor of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
quantity for the nouriſhment even of
the ſpermatick parts only. For ſeeing the Nerves
have no conſpicuous Cavity, but only impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Pores, by which any liquor can drill along
them; ſuch liquor muſt needs be moſt thin and
watery, and therefore unfit to be aſſimilated to
any part. And laſtly, as to the opinion that it
ſeparates the particles of the Bloud, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes
thoſe that are reſpectively proper for,
unto, each part, as the ſulphureous to the
fat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or is to the Bloud as the form is to the

                     <note place="margin">Its riſe.</note> but I
think it is more probably affirmed by others, that
this pair ariſes alſo from the <hi>Medulla oblongata</hi> a
little below the former Nerves. Its trunk is very
large, conſiſting of very many Fibres, ſome ſoft
and ſome hard: ſo that it ſeems to be not one
ſingle Nerve, but a collection or bundle of many
ſmall ones, ſome of which are deſigned for one
part, ſome for another; ſome ſerving for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and others for ſenſe. And the reaſon why
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49419:181"/>
they are all united together in their riſe, Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
thinks to be, that there may be a ſympathy and
conſent of actions in the ſeveral parts to which
they are diſtributed. Hence it is that ſeeing or
ſmelling what is pleaſing to the appetite makes
ones Mouth water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its Trunk is divided into <hi>two</hi> notable branches,<note place="margin">Diviſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</note>
ſometimes before but oftner after it has penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof tending
ſtreight downwards, and paſſing out of the Skull
by its proper hole, in its deſcent towards the
lower Jaw (for whoſe parts 'tis chiefly deſign'd)
is divided into many leſſer branches, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the temporal Muſcle, as alſo for the
Muſcles of the Face and Cheeks. From theſe alſo
there go twigs to the Lips, Gums, roots of the
Teeth, <hi>Fauces,</hi> Tonſils, Palate and Tongue.
The <hi>ſecond</hi> branch of this fifth pair, being the
larger, goes a little ſtreight forward by the ſides
of the <hi>ſella Turcica,</hi> and over againſt the <hi>Glandula
pituitaria</hi> ſends little twigs to the trunk of the
<hi>Carotides;</hi> then inoſculates with the Nerve of
the ſixth pair, and afterward ſends back a ſlip or
two, which being united with another ſlip retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the Nerve of the ſixth pair conſtitute
the trunk of the <hi>Intercoſtal pair,</hi> which we ſhall
reckon for the ninth, and ſpeak of it by and by.
After this it is divided into <hi>two</hi> notable branches;
The <hi>leſs and upper</hi> whereof tends towards the
globe of the Eye, and being again divided ſends
forth two other, the firſt of which is parted into
two more, that go one to the Noſe and the other
to the Eye-lids; and the ſecond into four or five
ſlips, that are moſtly ſpent on the Eye-lids, but
partly on the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea tunica</hi> and the Glands of the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49419:181"/>
Eye. The <hi>greater branch</hi> (of its ſecond diviſion)
being carried towards the orbit of the Eye is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into two new branches. The <hi>lower</hi> whereof
bending downwards is beſtowed on the Palate and
upper region of the <hi>Fauces;</hi> and the <hi>upper</hi> being
carried beyond the orbit of the Eye paſſes through
an hole of the upper Jaw with the Vein and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which it twiſts about, and ſends many ſlips to
the Muſcles of the Cheeks, Lips, Noſe, and roots
of the upper Teeth. From its twiſting about the
ſanguiferous veſſels deſigned for the Cheeks and
other parts of the Face, may a reaſon be drawn
why one bluſhes when he's aſhamed: for the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſpirits being diſturbed by the imagination of
ſome uncomely thing, as if they took care to hide
the Face, enter this Nerve diſorderly; ſo that
its twigs embracing theſe ſanguiferous veſſels, by
compreſſing and pulling of them, cauſe the Bloud
to flow too impetuouſly into the Cheeks and Face
by the Arteries, and detain it there ſome time by
conſtringing the Veins.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſixth</hi> pair riſes juſt by the fifth,<note place="margin">The ſixth pair.</note> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſinking under the <hi>Dura mater</hi> goes out of
the Skull by the ſame hole with the Nerves of the
third and fourth pair,<note place="margin">Its riſe and inſertion.</note> and is carried by a ſingle
trunk towards the orbit of the Eye; but ſo, as by
the ſide of the <hi>ſella Turcica</hi> it inoſculates with the
ſecond or greater branch of the fifth pair, (as
was noted in the former paragraph:) whence
ſending back ſometimes one, ſometimes two
twigs, theſe being united with the recurring
twigs of the fifth pair (above-mentioned) make
the beginning of the <hi>Intercoſtal nerve.</hi> Afterwards
going forwards, near the orbit of the Eye it is
divided into two branches; of which <hi>one</hi> is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49419:182"/>
into the abducent Muſcle of the Eye placed in
its outer corner; and the <hi>other</hi> being cleft into
many Fibres is beſtowed on the ſeventh Muſcle
proper to Brutes, whereby they defend the Eye
from external injuries without cloſing the Eye-lids,
when they are ſaid <hi>nictitare,</hi> which I think
we have no word to expreſs in Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſeventh</hi> pair,<note place="margin">The ſeventh pair.</note> by the Ancients commonly
reckon'd for the fifth,<note place="margin">Its riſe and inſertion.</note> miniſters to the ſenſe of
Hearing. It has two Proceſſes, one ſoft, and
the other harder, which might ſeem to be two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
pairs, but are uſually accounted one. They
have been held to ſpring from the ſides of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla
oblongata,</hi> but Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays (I cannot tell
how truly) from the annular protuberance of
the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> that lies by the ſides of the ſaid
<hi>Medulla.</hi> The <hi>ſoft</hi> part or proceſs that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the auditory Nerve, is carryed through an
hole of <hi>Os petroſum</hi> into the caverns of the Ear,
which it cloaths with a moſt thin Membrane. By
this are ſounds conveyed to the common ſenſory.
The <hi>harder</hi> proceſs ſerves rather for motion than
ſenſe; which paſſing out alſo through its proper
hole, preſently admits a twig from the <hi>par vagum</hi>
or eighth pair, after which it is immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into <hi>two</hi> branches; <hi>one</hi> whereof tending
downwards, is beſtowed on the Muſcles of the
Tongue and <hi>Os hyoides;</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> winding
about the auditory paſſage, and bending upwards,
is divided into three twigs; of which the <hi>firſt</hi>
correſponding to the Nerve of the firſt diviſion
beſtows certain ſlips on the Muſcles of the Lips,
Mouth, Face and Noſe, and ſo actuates ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
organs of the Voice, as the former ſome of
the inner; the <hi>ſecond</hi> is diſtributed to the Muſcles
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49419:182"/>
of the Eye-lids and Forehead, and the third on

or wandring pair, from its being diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>It ſprings below the auditory Nerves,<note place="margin">The eighth pair.</note> out of
the ſides of the <hi>Medulla oblongata,</hi> its root con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of twelve Fibres at leaſt (in Man) to
which a notable Fibre,<note place="margin">Its riſe.</note> or rather <hi>Nerve</hi> (much
greater than any of theſe twelve) coming from
the ſpinal marrow about the ſixth or ſeventh <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra</hi>
of the Neck, is joined, and inveſted with
the ſame Coat from the <hi>Dura mater</hi> as if they
grew into one Nerve; but if their common Coat
be removed, this acceſſory Nerve, and many of
the other Fibres remain ſtill diſtinct, and after
they are gone out of the Skull together, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
to ſeveral parts; the acceſſory Nerve to
the Muſcles of the Neck and Shoulder; and one
notable Fibre of the eighth pair to the harder
proceſs of the Auditory or ſeventh pair, as alſo
two others to the Muſcles of the Gullet and Neck.
But the other Fibres of this <hi>par vagum</hi> continue
united, and inſtead of thoſe companions they
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49419:183"/>
have parted with, they entertain a new one,
namely a branch from the Intercoſtal or ninth pair,
whereby is made a notable <hi>Plexus</hi> (which in a
Nerve is like the jointing of a Cane, or the knot
upon the trunk of the Tree where a Bough goes
out) and out of the ſame <hi>Plexus</hi> there ſprings a
conſiderable branch, which being carried toward
the <hi>Larynx</hi> is divided into three twigs, of which
one goes to the ſphincter of the Gullet, a ſecond
to the upper Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and the third
going under the <hi>Cartilago ſcutiformis,</hi> meets the
top of the recurring Nerve and is united to it.
Below the aforeſaid <hi>Plexus</hi> of this <hi>par vagum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Progreſs.</note> its
trunk goes ſtreight down by the ſide of the aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Carotides,</hi> on which it beſtows ſome ſlips.
And at the bottom of the Neck it receives a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
branch from the Intercoſtal, <hi>(viz.</hi> from its
firſt <hi>Plexus)</hi> and near thereto ſends out another
twig into the recurrent Nerve, but only on the
left ſide. From hence the trunk of this eighth
pair deſcends without any notable ramification,
till it be come over againſt the firſt or ſecond
Rib; where out of a ſecond <hi>Plexus</hi> (or knot)
many twigs and Fibres go towards the Heart and
its appendage, but not altogether in the ſame
manner on both ſides. There is one notable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
(which we cannot but note) of the two
<hi>recurring Nerves</hi> that ſpring out of the trunk of
this eighth pair, <hi>viz.</hi> that that on the right ſide
ariſes out of it higher and windes about the axillar
Artery; whereas that on the left ſprings much
lower therefrom, and twiſting about the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> returns back from thence.
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays that the <hi>recurring Nerve</hi> is really a
diſtinct Nerve from the <hi>par vagum</hi> from the very
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49419:183"/>
original, and was only included in the ſame caſe
or cover for the more convenient and ſafe paſſage.
The branches of the <hi>par vagum</hi> do frequently
unite with others of the Intercoſtal pair about the
<hi>Praecordia.</hi> And many twigs go out of the eighth
pair into the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence each of its
trunks deſcending by the ſides of the Gullet are
divided into two branches, <hi>outer</hi> and <hi>inner:</hi> The
outer unite with the outer, and the inner with
the inner, and both deſcend to the Stomach, in
which they terminate. As for their more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
diſtribution, we have ſpoke thereof while
we treated of the parts themſelves on which they
are beſtowed.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the <hi>ninth</hi> or laſt pair
(commonly not diſtinguiſhed from that going
before) which is called the <hi>Intercoſtal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ninth pair.</note> becauſe as
it marches down by the roots of the Ribs, betwixt
every Rib it receives a branch from the ſpinal
marrow.<note place="margin">Its riſe.</note> It has no proper root of its own, but
its trunk is compounded of two or three recurring
branches of the fifth and ſixth pair, (near their
origine) as was noted when we treated of thoſe
pairs. Being thus formed it paſſes out of the
Skull by its proper hole, and preſently has a
<hi>Plexus</hi> near that of the <hi>par vagum,</hi> into which
two nervous proceſſes out of the firſt vertebral
pair are inſerted, and out of which there goes a
twig into the ſphincter of the Gullet, and into
the <hi>Plexus</hi> (aforeſaid) of the <hi>par vagum.</hi> Whence
deſcending by the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, by that
time it arrives at its middle, it has another
greater <hi>Plexus, into which</hi> a large Nerve from a
neighbouring vertebral pair is inſerted; and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49419:184"/>
                     <hi>from which</hi> proceed many twigs that uniting with
others of the <hi>par vagum</hi> are diſtributed all about
the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> as alſo one ſingle one a little lower.
This <hi>Plexus cervicalis</hi> out of which ſo many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſpring is proper to Man, being not found in
Brutes. From the Neck it deſcends by the <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> where having arrived at the
ſecond Rib it receives three or four branches from
the vertebral Nerves next above, whereby is made
another notable <hi>Plexus</hi> (commonly called the
<hi>Intercoſtal.)</hi> From whence as its trunk paſſes
down by the roots of the Ribs, in every one of
their Interſtices and even as low as <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi>
from every jointing of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> it receives a
vertebral pair. Aſſoon as it is deſcended out of
the cavity of the Breaſt, and is come over againſt
the Stomach, it ſends forth on each ſide a notable
branch, which tending towards the Meſentery,
make its chief <hi>Plexus,</hi> which are in number <hi>ſeven,
five large</hi> ones which are <hi>upper,</hi> and <hi>two leſs</hi> that
are <hi>lower.</hi> For each branch is preſently divided
into two other, and every one forms one <hi>Plexus,</hi>
which make four; and the fifth is in the middle
of theſe, being the largeſt, and like the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Planets (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> compares it.)
And theſe are the <hi>five upper.</hi> The <hi>two lower</hi> are
framed of branches that ſpring from the trunk
deſcended as far as the lower part of the Loins,
and are diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>Plexus Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and <hi>Minimus.</hi> As to the parts that all the
twigs which ſpring from theſe ſeven <hi>Plexus</hi> are
diſtributed to, it may be learned from the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>WE obſerved above, <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla
oblongata</hi> ſeemed not to be any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
part, but only a production from the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum</hi>
and <hi>Cerebellum:</hi> and that when it is deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the Skull into the Spine, it loſes its
name of <hi>oblongata,</hi> and acquires that of <hi>Spinalis,</hi>
which name it borrows from the Spine through
which it paſſes, but is of the ſame fibrous or fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
ſubſtance as it was within the Brain.
And now we come to deſcribe the Nerves that
ſpring out of it, which aſſiſt the motion of all
thoſe parts, which thoſe nine pair already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
that ariſe within the Skull, reach not to.</p>
                  <p>In its whole progreſs from the Skull to the
<hi>Coccyx,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nerves ſpringing from the <hi>Spinalis medulla.</hi>
                     </note> there ſpring out of it thirty pair of
Nerves: ſeven of which are of the Neck, twelve
of the Breaſt, five of the Loins, and ſix from the
holes of <hi>Os ſacrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt and ſecond pair of the Neck come not
out of the ſides of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> as all the reſt do;
but becauſe of their peculiar articulation ſpring
out before and behind.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fore</hi> Nerve of the firſt pair cometh out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the bone of the <hi>Occiput</hi> and the firſt <hi>vertebra</hi>
of the Neck,<note place="margin">Seven of the Neck.</note> and is beſtowed upon the Muſcles
which bend the Neck,<note place="margin">The firſt pair.</note> and lie under the <hi>Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi>
The <hi>hinder</hi> Nerve cometh out of the hole
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49419:189"/>
which is common to the <hi>Os occipitis</hi> and the firſt
<hi>vertebra</hi> of the Neck. This hath two twigs: The
ſmaller is beſtowed upon thoſe Muſcles which
ſtretch out the Neck; The bigger is inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the beginning of the Muſcle which lifteth up
the Shoulder-blade.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fore</hi> Nerve of the ſecond pair (which is
ſmaller) cometh out between the firſt and ſecond
<hi>Vertebrae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> and is beſtowed upon the Skin of the
Face. The <hi>hinder</hi> cometh out at the ſides of the
hinder proceſs of the ſecond <hi>Vertebra,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
is parted into two twigs. The thicker of
which is beſtowed upon the whole Skin of the
Head even to the Crown; The ſmaller upon
the greater ſtreight, and the lower oblique Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which ſtretch out the Head. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays,
that the firſt and greateſt root of the <hi>Nerve of the
Diaphragm</hi> ariſeth from this ſecond pair of the
Neck: of which Nerve we ſhall ſpeak more by
and by.</p>
                  <p>The third pair cometh out of the <hi>lateral</hi> holes,<note place="margin">The third.</note>
which are between the ſecond and third <hi>Vertebrae,</hi>
and each is immediately divided into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
the <hi>formore</hi> whereof hath four twigs: The
firſt cometh to the long Muſcle or the firſt of the
benders of the Neck; The ſecond deſcending is
beſtowed upon the Muſcles which lie under the
<hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> being firſt united to a twig of the
fourth pair; The third aſcending goeth to the
Skin of the back-part of the Head, having firſt
joined with the thicker twig of the hinder Nerve
of the ſecond pair; The fourth is beſtowed upon
the tranſverſe Muſcles of the Neck, and the Muſcle
which lifteth up the Shoulder-blade. The <hi>hinder</hi>
branch is beſtowed upon the ſecond pair of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49419:189"/>
Muſcles which heaveth up or wideneth the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The fourth pair cometh out of the holes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the third and fourth <hi>Vertebrae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The fourth.</note> and each
hath two branches, like the third pair. The
<hi>formore</hi> hath three twigs: The firſt of which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with a twig of the third pair is beſtowed on
the firſt of thoſe Muſcles which bend the Neck,
called <hi>Longus;</hi> The ſecond upon the tranſverſe
Muſcle of the Neck, and the <hi>Cucullaris</hi> of the
Shoulder-blade: The third being ſlenderer than
the other two, is joined with a twig of the fifth
pair, and both with one of the ſixth, and laſtly all
three (according to Dr. <hi>Willis)</hi> with that of
the ſecond pair above-mentioned: and the Trunk
made up of all theſe deſcendeth by the ſides of the
Gullet down the Neck and <hi>Thorax</hi> without any
branchings till it come to the Diaphragm, where
it is divided again into three or four twigs, on
each ſide, and is inſerted into its fleſhy or muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
part, being known by the name of <hi>Nervus
diaphragmatis,</hi> or <hi>Phrenicus.</hi> The <hi>hinder</hi> branch
goeth back to the Spine under the Muſcles of that
part, upon which it beſtoweth twigs, and going
down between the Muſcles of each ſide of the
Neck it is carried to the <hi>Muſculus quadratus</hi> that
draweth the Cheek down.</p>
                  <p>The fifth pair marcheth out between the fourth
and fifth <hi>Vertebrae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The fifth.</note> and hath likewiſe two branches
on each ſide. The <hi>formore</hi> of which hath four
twigs: The firſt goeth to thoſe Muſcles that bend
the Neck: The ſecond is that which joineth with
the twigs of the ſecond, fourth and ſixth pairs,
and makes up the <hi>Nervus phrenicus:</hi> The third
goeth to the <hi>Deltoides:</hi> The fourth goeth to the
ſame <hi>Deltoides,</hi> and to the <hi>Coracohyoideus,</hi> or the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49419:190"/>
third pair of the Muſcles of <hi>Os hyoides.</hi> The <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
branch bendeth back to the Spine, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon the Muſcles there, as the like branch
of the fourth pair was.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth pair cometh out under the fifth <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſixth.</note>
and hath, as the reſt, two branches. The
<hi>formore</hi> ſendeth firſt one twig to make the trunk
of the <hi>Nervus phrenicus;</hi> then proceeding further
it is united with the three following, namely the
laſt of the Neck and two firſt of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one <hi>Plexus</hi> with them, out of which thoſe
Nerves proceed that are carried to the Arm.
The <hi>hinder</hi> branch goeth to the Muſcles behind,
which ſtretch out the Neck and Head.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh pair cometh out of the hole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the ſixth and ſeventh <hi>Vertebrae.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</note> The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
and larger branch is joined with the ſixth of
the Neck and two firſt of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as aforeſaid,
and is carried to the Arm. The <hi>hinder</hi> and ſmaller
is beſtowed upon the Muſcles of the Neck, and
quadrat Muſcle which pulleth down the Cheek.</p>
                  <p>About where this ſixth or ſeventh pair of
Nerves riſe,<note place="margin">Nervus ad par vagum acceſſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> there ſpringeth another, deſcribed
by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> and by him called <hi>Nervus ſpinalis
ad par vagum acceſſorius.</hi> It riſes ſmall out of the
ſide of the ſpinal marrow, and aſcends up by the
ſide of it, growing thicker as it goes, (but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being inſerted any where into the marrow)
till having enter'd the Skull it is joined to the
Fibres of the <hi>par vagum</hi> or eighth pair. Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
from thence we obſerved in Chap. 13. when
we deſcribed the eighth pair.</p>

                  <p>THE Eyes (in Latin <hi>Oculi,</hi> from <hi>occludo</hi> to
ſhut, or <hi>occulto</hi> to hide, becauſe they lie
hid under the Eyelids) are the organs of ſight,
conſiſting of many ſimilar parts; and are as the
two Luminaries of the Microcoſm, to afford us
light; or like two Watchmen placed in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Body as in a Watch-tower, to give
notice of any approaching danger. To loſe
them is the greateſt miſery can befall a Man: for
'tis the ſame as to be thrown into a Dungeon,
when theſe windows of the Body are ſhut up.</p>
                  <p>They are in number two,<note place="margin">Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> partly to make the
ſight ſtronger, and partly that one being hurt,
the other might perform the office in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
though more imperfectly.</p>
                  <p>The Eye alone,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> deveſted of its Muſcles, is of a
round or ſphaerical ſhape, both that it might
move the better, and alſo that it might more
conveniently receive the viſible rays.</p>
                  <p>The colour of the Eyes in <hi>Men</hi> is ſometimes
grey,<note place="margin">Colour.</note> ſometimes browniſh, ſometimes black:
which variety is moſt conſpicuous about the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla</hi>
in the <hi>Iris,</hi> and proceeds from the colour of
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea. Brutes</hi> of the ſame ſpecies have not
that diverſity of colours.</p>
                  <p>Some have much larger Eyes than others;<note place="margin">Bigneſs.</note> but
thoſe which are largeſt and ſtand much out,
have not ſo acute and piercing a ſight as thoſe that
are leſs and ſtand further in.</p>

                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:49419:194"/>
They are each placed in a large Cavity,<note place="margin">Situation.</note> called
<hi>Orbita</hi> (or the Socket) on each ſide the Noſe,
which is hollowed out of the bones of the Skull.
And theſe orbits are inveſted on their inſide with
the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> to which the fat and origins
of the Muſcles cleave firmly. Theſe may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
the firſt <hi>containing</hi> parts of the Eye; as

ſmokes and vapours, too much light and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries

membrane of the Eye called <hi>Cornea</hi> is moiſten'd,

very thin Skin which has no fat under it; inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are lined with the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> that is
here moſt thin and ſmooth. Betwixt theſe parts
comes the <hi>Membrana carnoſa,</hi> which is alſo very
thin. Each Eye has two. In Man the lower is
leſs, and is but very obſcurely moved in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with the upper: but in Birds the lower is the
larger, and in moſt ſeems only to be moved, the
upper remaining unmoveable. As for their
Muſcles to which they owe their motion, thoſe
may be ſeen in the fifth Book. At their edges
they have little ſoft Cartilages, (called <hi>Cilia</hi> in
Latin) to ſtrengthen them, and that they may
meet the more exactly. Upon theſe Cartilages
there grow Hairs, which having grown to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
length, will naturally grow no longer, ſo
that they never need to be cut. Thoſe on the
upper Eyelid turn ſomething upwards, and thoſe
on the lower downwards. Above the upper Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
grow alſo a ſet of Hairs, betwixt it and the
Forehead, out of the <hi>Supercilia</hi> or Eyebrows;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49419:195"/>
theſe lie pretty flat bending from within out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and hinder ſweat, duſt or other things
from falling into the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Eyelids have two corners called <hi>Canthi.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Canthi.</note>
The <hi>outer</hi> of theſe is leſs, and in its upper part it

of the Eyes, that they may move more
glibly. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> having reckoned eight
opinions concerning the cauſe, origine and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

mention'd with the reſt: and thinks that their
matter is the more ſerous and thin particles of
the pituitous humour gathered in the Brain, and
flowing to the Eyes, upon its contraction, through
the <hi>Foramen lachrymale.</hi> Which the learned
Reader may ſee defended in his <hi>Anat. lib. 3. cap. 15.</hi>
There is another Gland in the inner <hi>canthus</hi> or
corner, which helps the former in its office.
Dr. <hi>Briggs</hi> ſays, there are two or three lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
veſſels, that receive <hi>Lympha</hi> from it, and
end in the inner part of the Eyelid; and that
eight ariſe out of the former Gland and end in
the <hi>Tunica adnata,</hi> where they continually depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
ſomething of <hi>Lympha,</hi> to keep the Eye moiſt.
Nerves come to them from the fifth pair, which
communicating with the Intercoſtal, are much

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> becauſe it is ſomewhat
of the colour of a Grape. This ſprings from the
<hi>Pia mater,</hi> and is ſpread from the bottom or
centre of the Eye, behind all over the Eye to the
<hi>Pupilla;</hi> to whoſe circumference when it is come,
it becomes double, making with one part the <hi>Iris,</hi>
with the other the <hi>Ligamentum ciliare.</hi> On the
inſide it is of a duskiſh colour, (in Man) but
blacker on the outſide. But where it makes the
<hi>Iris,</hi> it is of divers colours reſembling the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
from whence it borrows its name: yet in
ſome it is more blue, in others black, in others
grey. This Tunicle is perforated before as wide
as the <hi>Pupilla</hi> (or ſight of the Eye) to permit
the rayes of viſible ſpecies to paſs in to the cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

<hi>Retiformis</hi> (Net-like:) This ſeemeth to be the
principal organ of ſight. For as Dr. <hi>Briggs</hi> well
argues, neither the cryſtalline humour, through
which the rayes paſs much refracted; nor the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
<hi>Choroides,</hi> are at all fit for this uſe. For
this latter part (as riſing from the <hi>Pia mater)</hi>
cannot communicate the impreſſions of the rayes
to the medullar part of the Brain, which it does
not at all touch. Whereas the medullary Fibres
of the <hi>Retina</hi> have communication therewith, and
therefore can well perform that office. The
Fibres of this Tunicle are extended from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
or inner centre of the Eye, where the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Nerve enters it, as far as the <hi>Ligamentum
ciliare,</hi> (to which it affords Animal ſpirits for the
continuance of its motion.) If one take this
<hi>Tunica Retina</hi> and put it into warm water, ſhaking
it a little, to waſh off the mucous ſubſtance that
cleaves to it, and then hold it up to the light,
theſe Filaments will appear very numerous like
the threads of the fineſt Lawn.</p>

betwixt the aqueous and the vitreous,<note place="margin">2. Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus.</note> but not
exactly in the middle or centre of the Eye, but
rather towards its fore-part. It is incloſed in
the boſom as it were of the vitreous humour, and
is flattiſh on the foreſide, but rounder behind. It
is more bright and ſolid than either of the other
two. It has been the common opinion that it is
incloſed in its proper Membrane, which is called
either <hi>Cryſtallina</hi> from its tranſparency, or <hi>Aranea</hi>
from its moſt fine contexture. But Dr. <hi>Briggs,</hi>
a very accurate Anatomizer of the Eye, denies
any ſuch Tunicle, affirming that it is meerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious
when the humour is expoſed for ſome
while to the Air, or is gently boiled. As to the
collection or reception of the rayes of things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
this humour is the primary inſtrument of
ſight: though as was ſaid before, the <hi>Tunica retina</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:49419:197"/>
is the principal as to perception, becauſe through

                  <p>The third and laſt humour of the Eye is the

                     <note place="margin">3. Vitreus.</note> ſo called becauſe it is like to molten

a Vault, formed in the <hi>Os ſphenoides,</hi> and ſerves
partly for perfecting of the voice by repercuſſing
the air, and partly aſſiſts the ſenſe of Taſting.
It conſiſts of Bones (of which, Book 6. Chap. 6.)
of a peculiar glandulous Fleſh and a thick Tunicle,
with little holes for the <hi>Saliva</hi> that is ſeparated in
the Glands to deſtil through into the Mouth.

broad at its baſis hangs down from the middle of
the Palate (where the Noſtrils open into the
Mouth) with a ſmall but bluntiſh end. It is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a very lax and ſoft Skin, and is often
ſwelled with defluxions of Rheum, hanging down
flaggy, which is called the falling of the <hi>

and Speech. It is long and broad, thicker at the
root than towards the tip. It is cloathed with
two <hi>Membranes;</hi> The <hi>outer</hi> covers only the upper
part of the Tongue, and is very porous, being
pretty ſmooth in Men, but in Brutes it is rough
with abundance of copped bodies ariſing out of it,
(and bonding towards its root) like the Teeth
of Wool-cards, of ſomething a cartilaginous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
This Membrane has a line that runs
lengthways of it in its middle, dividing the
Tongue into two parts. The <hi>inner</hi> covers the
whole Tongue, the lower ſide as well as the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
This is thin and ſoft, and has many <hi>Papillae</hi>
protuberating out of it, which are inſerted into
the pores of the outer. As to the ſubſtance of
the Tongue there is great diverſity of opinions.
Some think it to be a Gland; others, that it has
a peculiar ſubſtance; <hi>Spigelius,</hi> that it is truly a
Muſcle; and ſo does Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> call it <hi>verus
Muſculus,</hi> though towards its root (he ſaith) it
hath ſomething of a glandulous ſubſtance. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pighius
(exercit. Epiſtol. de lingua, p. 9.)</hi> ſays it
is rather muſculous than glandulous; and deſcribes
its ſubſtance thus. <q>Immediately under the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Membranes there lie ſtreight fleſhy Fibres,
whereby the Tongue is drawn inwards and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But the centre of the Tongue conſiſts of
a manifold kind of Fibres, long, tranſverſe and
oblique, which riding one upon another are
interwoven like a Mat.]</q> But though this be
its ſubſtance, yet it cannot properly be called a
Muſcle, both becauſe no Muſcle ſerves to move it
ſelf, but ſome other part; and alſo becauſe one
Muſcle is not moved by another, as the Tongue
is by ſeveral pair, deſcribed Book 5. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected

to the <hi>Os hyoides, Larynx,</hi> and <hi>Fauces,</hi>
and by a membranous Ligament to the parts under

<hi>Fraenum,</hi> which being too ſhort, or extended to
the top of the Tongue, hindreth ſucking in
Children, when they are ſaid to be Tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed.</p>

the Glands, and is not a meer excrement, but
ſerves for the furthering of the fermentation of
Meats in the Stomach, if it be not the main fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

after it is deſcended out of the skull into the

of the Muſcle. As ſoon as it hath entred
into the ſubſtance of the Muſcle, it is diſperſed
into a number of twigs, which end in it, and
are continued or elonged into Fibres.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>fibre</hi> is thus defined by Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> in cap. 4.
de Ventric.<note place="margin">Fibrous fleſh.</note> 
                     <hi>A body in figure like a thread, ſlender,
tenacious, tenſile, and irritable, made of ſpermatical
matter, for the ſake of ſome motion and ſtrength.</hi>
Which he thus explains: <q>
                        <hi>In figure like a thread]
i. e.</hi> oblong and round; <hi>ſlender]</hi> like a ſpiders
web; <hi>tenacious]</hi> whoſe parts firmly cohere and
are not eaſily broken; <hi>tenſile]</hi> viz. that may be
extended as to longitude, its latitude being
leſſen'd, and in like manner that may be thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
as to latitude, its longitude being ſhortn'd;
<hi>irritable]</hi> i. e. which by irritation may be excited
to contract it ſelf, and the irritation ceaſing,
to be remitted of its own accord; <hi>made of ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
matter]</hi> namely if it be a bare Fibre;
but if it be ſtuft with a <hi>parenchyma,</hi> perhaps it
is not always made of only ſpermatick matter;
(for the ſtuft Fibres may be divided into ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:49419:209"/>
and ſpermatick; of the former kind are
thoſe of the Muſcles; of the latter, thoſe of the
ſtomach and guts:) <hi>for the ſake of motion and
ſtrength]</hi> for in that it is tenacious it adds ſtrength
to the part, and that which is apt to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and contracted is deſtin'd for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.]</q>
Theſe Fibres being ſtuft in their interſtices
with a ſanguineous <hi>parenchyma,</hi> are that which
we properly call <hi>fleſh</hi> (without fat.) For (ſaith
Dr. <hi>Croone)</hi> all the fleſh of a Muſcle (which makes
the greateſt part of it, and of which the bulk of
the whole body chiefly conſiſts) ſeems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but that portion of the bloud that flows
through the intervals of the Fibres, which thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by their coldneſs is ſtaid amongſt them, and
makes the muſculous fleſh. The Fibres are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſtreight; wherefore the Muſcles of the belly
(called oblique and tranſverſe) have not their
denomination from their Fibres, for they are all
ſtreight; but from their own poſition and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
ſo the Muſcle called <hi>Maſſeter,</hi> is accounted
double, becauſe it hath two ſorts or ranks of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
one lying upon another.</p>
                  <p>Every Muſcle hath a proper <hi>membrane</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts
it,<note place="margin">Membrane.</note> and diſtinguiſhes it from others. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
unto the Tendon in ſuch Muſcles as have
one.</p>
                  <p>The laſt <hi>proper</hi> part of the Muſcle is the <hi>Tendon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tendon.</note>
It is a ſimilar body, of a <hi>ſinewy-like</hi> ſubſtance, (yet

Secondly, becauſe the Nerve is not carried in
the form of a Nerve to the Tendon, but is either
continued to or makes the Fibres of the Muſcle.
Thirdly, Ligaments are inſenſible, but Tendons
are of exquiſite ſenſe; as appeareth by the great

where it is nervous and broad; and afterward
becoming fleſhy, ſmall, and round, it paſſeth
downward, and in its middle, where it comes to the
flexure of the lower jaw-bone, it loſeth its fleſhy
ſubſtance, and degenerates into a nervous and
round Tendon; but by and by it becomes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

one is nervous, ſpringing from the ſuture where
the firſt bone of the Jaw is joyned to the fourth.
This beginning is large and ſtrong. The other
beginning is fleſhy, proceeding from the <hi>os jugale,</hi>
and ſo marcheth towards the Chin, and is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the whole breadth of the lower Jaw
ſtrongly. The Fibres of this Muſcle, by reaſon

theſe Muſcles do not only move the Jaw laterally,<note place="margin">4. Aliforme exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, <hi>or</hi> maxillam abducens.</note>

                  <p>The fourth pair is called <hi>pterygoideum externum,

bone. Whence marching down by ſtreight Fibres,
it becometh greater and thicker. And at length
is inſerted by a ſtrong Tendon into the internal
lateral part of the lower Jaw, which is under the
Tendon of the temporal Muſcle. This moveth
the Jaw forward, which appeareth when the
lower Teeth are ſtretched further out than the
upper.</p>
                  <p>The fifth pair is termed <hi>maxillam adducens,</hi> or

then becoming fleſhy, large and thick, and
marching down by a ſtreight paſſage, it is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

of the Neck; from whence aſcending and
becoming thick and carnous, it is implanted into

Muſcles of this pair act together, they draw the
Head directly backward; if one ſingly, then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

And by ſuppoſing them thus diſtinct, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Water. Sometimes one, and ſometimes
both of theſe are wanting, and then the ending of

pair is the <hi>tranſverſe,</hi> which is firmly knit to the

as far as to the middle of this Shoulder-Bone,
where it is inſerted. This beſides its raiſing up the

ſecond is <hi>ſupraſpinatus,</hi> or <hi>ſuperſcapularis ſuperior.</hi>
This ariſes from the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and fills

by the inſide of the Thigh obliquely, it endeth in
the inſide of the Leg a little below the Knee. It

according to the motion of the

To perform this motion it hath two

from the upper appendices of the <hi>tibia</hi> and <hi>fibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and cleaving unto the whole <hi>os tibiae,</hi> about

turneth by degrees into a Tendon, which paſſing
under the annular ligament of the Inſtep, that
ſprings from the lower appendices of the <hi>tibia</hi>

whereof the one is inſerted into the firſt of
thoſe bones which are called <hi>innominata,</hi> and the

before the great Toe. If the Tendon continue
one, then it is implanted into the inner ſide of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this laſt Bone. The ſecond is <hi>peronaeus anticus:</hi> this
ariſeth from the outer and upper part of the
<hi>fibula,</hi> and being carried through the chink of
the outer ankle, it is inſerted into that bone
of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> which ſuſtaineth the little Toe.
It deſcends all along by the outſide of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:49419:238"/>
The foot is extended when it is drawn
backwards.<note place="margin">Extenders.</note> To perform this motion it hath
three Muſcles. The firſt is <hi>gemellus externus,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or <hi>gaſtrocnemius externus:</hi> this Muſcle hath two
heads, the firſt of which ariſes under the ham,
from the inner part of the end of the thigh-bone,
fleſhy and broad. It marcheth down by the
back and inner part of the <hi>tibia,</hi> and when it
is come to the middle of it, it becometh ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous.
The other head likewiſe ariſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ham, but from the outer part of the
end of the Thigh-bone, and paſſing down by
the outward and back part of the Leg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
tendinous a little above the former,
and joyning with it they both grow into one
ſtrong, broad, and ſinewy Tendon, which is
inſerted into the Heel. This is the Muſcle
that maketh up the greateſt part of the Calf
of the Leg. The ſecond is <hi>gemellus internus,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
or <hi>gaſtrocnemius internus,</hi> or <hi>ſoleus.</hi> This lyeth
under the former, and is of a livid colour. It
ſpringeth from the hinder <hi>appendix</hi> of the <hi>fibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
by a ſtrong nervous beginning, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pretty bulky it continueth ſo till it hath

the Heel it is ſo united to the Tendon of
the former <hi>gemellus,</hi> that both ſeem to be but
one, and is inſerted with it into the Heel. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
third is <hi>plantaris.</hi> This ſpringeth from the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the end of the Thigh-bone in
the ham, being very ſmall but carnous. It
deſcends but a little way before it ends in a
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:49419:239"/>
very long and ſlender Tendon, which joyning
very cloſely with thoſe of the two former is

middle of the ſoal of the Foot; <hi>Spigelius</hi> ſays, as

of that Bone of the <hi>tarſus</hi> which is next to the
<hi>cubiforme.</hi> This moveth the Foot inwards. The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecond is <hi>peronaeus</hi> or <hi>fibulaeus poſticus:</hi> this ariſeth
from the upper and hinder part of the <hi>fibula</hi> or

cleaving to the outſide of the <hi>fibula,</hi> it paſſeth
down round and fleſhy: the outer part is of a

with it, for it goes under the ſoal of the
Foot, and is inſerted into the root of the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:49419:239"/>
greater <hi>os cuneiforme</hi> that is ſeated before the

the great Toe from the reſt, to the inner part of

                  <p>The fourth is <hi>Adducens pollicem major.</hi> This

                  <p>The fifth and laſt is <hi>Adducens pollicem minor</hi>
(otherwiſe called <hi>Tranſver ſalis.)</hi> This ariſeth
from the Ligament of the little Toe that tieth its
firſt joint, and paſſing croſs the firſt bones of the
Toes it ends in the inſide of the firſt bone of the
great Toe. Some think this ſerves only to tie
together the firſt bones of the Toes (like a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:)
But <hi>Caſſerius</hi> (who firſt found it out)
ſays it draws the great Toe to the little one, and

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:49419:242"/>

bedewed with a fat and unctuous moiſture, which
the more it abounds, the Bones are the tougher

they are the apter to grow together again with a
<hi>Callus,</hi> which ſuch viſcous juice contributes very
much to. And it is only by a <hi>Callus</hi> that any Bone

                  <p>The <hi>common</hi> are ſeven.<note place="margin">Common affections.</note> For firſt, a Bone muſt
be hard, the more firmly to ſuſtain the Body.
Secondly, of a whitiſh colour, becauſe it is a
ſpermatick part. Thirdly, deſtitute of feeling,
for avoiding of pain in motion. Fourthly, it muſt
be either hollow to contain Marrow in its Cavity
for moiſtening of it; or ſpongious and porous,
that ſome nutritive particles of the Bloud may
paſs through its very ſubſtance. Fifthly, its ends
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:49419:243"/>
muſt be covered with a Cartilage, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
with an unctuous humour, to procure an
eaſie motion. Sixthly, it muſt be covered with
a Membrane, to preſerve it from carioſity; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the four Bones of the Ear, and the parts of
the Teeth above the Gums. Seventhly, it muſt
be equal. Wherefore the <hi>Callus</hi> wherewith a
broken Bone is united, and nodes in the Pox, are
not natural affections.</p>
                  <p>Theſe tokens that follow, ſhew a Bone to be
preternaturally affected: Firſt, if it be ſoft; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that muſt cauſe the Member to be too flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Secondly, if it be too dry; for then it is
diſtempered. Thirdly, if it be black; for then
it is carious. Fourthly, if its figure be altered;
for then it muſt hinder the action of the part.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proper</hi> affections are four:<note place="margin">Proper.</note> The firſt is a
<hi>Cavity;</hi> and it is twofold: for it is either deep,
as in the Hip-bone, and is called <hi>Cotyle;</hi> or ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
as in the Knee, and is called <hi>Glene.</hi> The
ſecond is a <hi>Protuberance,</hi> of which there be two
kinds: for it is either a continued part of the
Bone jetting manifeſtly above its plain ſuperficies,
for the more commodious inſertion of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is called <hi>Apophyſis,</hi> a Proceſs; or
elſe it is like an additional Bone growing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſimple and immediate contiguity, (and
generally ſofter and more porous than it) and is
called <hi>Epiphyſis,</hi> an Appendage. If the Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Bone be round, it is called its <hi>Caput;</hi>
under which is the <hi>Cervix,</hi> as in the upper end of
the Thigh-bone: If it be flat, it is called <hi>Condy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi>
If pointed, <hi>Corone.</hi> Other Protuberances
are named from the ſimilitude they have to other
things; as <hi>Styloides, Coracoides, &amp;c.</hi> The third
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:49419:243"/>
is <hi>Inequality:</hi> this is ſeen in the outſide of the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciput</hi>
for the inſertion of the Muſcles. The fourth
is <hi>Smoothneſs,</hi> as in the outſide of the reſt of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Articulation</hi> is either for <hi>manifeſt,</hi>

when a large head of a Bone is received into a
deep Cavity, as the Thigh-bone into the Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.
Secondly, <hi>Arthrodia,</hi> which is when the
Cavity which receiveth is ſhallow, and the head
of the Bone which is received, flattiſh: ſuch is the
articulation of the lower Jaw with the Temple-bone.
The third is <hi>Ginglymos;</hi> when the ſame
Bone receiveth, and is received. This falleth
out three manner of ways. Firſt, when the Bone
is received by another, and receiveth the ſame;
this is ſeen in the articulation of the Shoulder-bone
with the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna.</hi> Secondly, when a Bone
receiveth one Bone, and is received by another:
this may be ſeen in the Spondyls or <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of
the Back, where the middle Bone receiveth the
upper, and is received by the lower. The third
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49419:244"/>
is, when the proceſs of the Bone being long and
round, is inſerted into another upper Bone, and
ſo is turned in the Cavity like an Axle-tree in a

                  <p>THE Bones of the whole Body belong to
theſe four parts of it; the Head (and
Neck) the Breaſt, the lower Belly, and the
Limbs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Head</hi> is that part which is above the <hi>verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi>
of the Neck: of it there are two parts, the
Skull and the Face. The <hi>Skull</hi> is that bony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which containeth the Brain, and is decked
with hair.</p>
                  <p>In the deſcription of the Bones of the Head
theſe two things are to be noted; the <hi>Sutures,</hi>
and the <hi>number</hi> of the Bones.<note place="margin">Sutures proper or common.</note> The <hi>Sutures</hi> are
either <hi>proper,</hi> or <hi>common.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>proper</hi> are thoſe which join the Bones of
the Skull one with another;<note place="margin">Proper ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures true or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</note> and they are either
<hi>true</hi> Sutures, or <hi>(mendoſae) counterfeit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>true</hi> are thoſe which repreſent two Saws
joined together by their Teeth;<note place="margin">Three true.</note> and theſe are
three in number: the firſt is <hi>Coronalis,</hi> which is
ſeated in the fore part, and paſſeth from one
Temple to the other tranſverſly, joining the <hi>Os
frontis</hi> to the <hi>Synciput.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>Lambdoides,</hi>
oppoſite to this, reſembling the Greek letter Λ.
This beginning at the baſis of the <hi>Occiput</hi> aſcends
obliquely to either Ear, and joins the Bone of
the <hi>Occiput</hi> to the Bones of the <hi>Synciput</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
The third is <hi>Sagittalis,</hi> which beginning
at the top of the <hi>Lambdoides</hi> comes ſtreight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the Crown to the middle of the <hi>Coronalis,</hi>
                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:49419:245"/>
and in Children for ſome years (ſometimes in
the adult) it runs to the top of the Noſe, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the bone of the Forehead into two.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>counterfeit</hi> or <hi>mendoſae</hi> reſemble a line only,<note place="margin">Two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</note>
and might more properly be called <hi>Harmoniae</hi>
than Sutures. They are two in number. The
<hi>firſt</hi> paſſing from the root of the <hi>Proceſſus mammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>
upwards with a circular duct, circumſcribes
the Temple-bone on each ſide of the Head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
down again to the baſis of the Ear: this
joins the Bones of the <hi>Synciput, Occiput</hi> and <hi>Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides</hi>
with the Temple-bones, theſe lying upon
thoſe like the Skales upon Fiſh, whence theſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are called <hi>Squamoſae.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> runs from
the top of this ſquamous conjunction obliquely
downwards towards the orbit of the Eye, to the
beginning of the firſt common Suture, and joins
this Bone above with the Bones of the <hi>Synciput,</hi>
below with the Bone of the Forehead.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>common</hi> Sutures are thoſe which belong to
the Skull,<note place="margin">Common ſutures.</note> the wedge-like Bone, and the upper
Jaw. The moſt remarkable are theſe: firſt,
<hi>Frontalis,</hi> by which the outer proceſs of the <hi>Os
frontis</hi> is joined with the firſt Bone of the upper
Jaw. The ſecond is <hi>Cuneiformis,</hi> by which the
wedge-like Bone is joined with the firſt Bone of
the upper Jaw. The third is <hi>Cribroſa:</hi> this is
common to the wedge-like Bone, and the <hi>Septum</hi>
or partition of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sutures</hi> have three uſes.<note place="margin">The uſes of the ſutures.</note> The firſt is to
help to ſtay the Brain from tottering, and its parts
from being miſplaced in violent motions, by
permitting ſome Fibres to paſs through from the
<hi>Dura mater</hi> to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> by which the ſaid
<hi>Mater</hi> and the Brain inveſted in it are ſuſpended
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:49419:245"/>
as it were. The ſecond is to permit the ſteams
and fumes in the Brain to evaporate. And the
third, to hinder the fiſſures that happen in the
Skull from knocks or falls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from extending
any farther than through one Bone, for they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſtop at the next Suture.</p>

part of the Eye-brows at the top of the Noſe,<note place="margin">Its cavity.</note>
there is a large Cavity, (often two) from
whence two holes paſs to the Noſtrils. The outer
<hi>Lamina</hi> that conſtitutes this Cavity, makes the
upper plane part of the orbit of the Eye; but the
inner, on each ſide above the Eyes forms a bunchy
protuberance uneven with many jettings out like
little Hills. The Cavity is inveſted with a very
thin greeniſh Membrane, and contains a clammy
humour. What its uſe may be is hard to ſay;
ſome think it gives an Echo to the Voice, making
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:49419:246"/>
it more ſonorous; others that it receiveth the
odoriferous air drawn in by the Noſe, to ſtay it
awhile before it be ſent to the Brain. It hath
two holes in the middle part of the Eye-brow,
which go to the orbit of the Eye, by which the
firſt branch of the Nerve of the fifth conjugation
of the Brain goes to the Muſcle of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It hath alſo four proceſſes; the greater
two are ſeated at the greater corner of the Eye,

                     <hi>Sphenoides</hi> or <hi>Cuneiforme;</hi> ſo called, not
that it is like a Wedge, but that it is ſeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Bones of the Skull and the upper Jaw.
Before, it is joined with the Forehead-bone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
to the <hi>Os occipitis.</hi> At the ſides it doth
accompany a good way the <hi>Os petroſum.</hi> Above,
it doth touch the firſt, fourth, and ſixth Bone of
the upper Jaw; and below, the Bones of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of the Mouth by the wing-like Proceſſes. It
is thick in the middle, but thinner at the edges,
and in the adult it conſiſts of two <hi>Laminae</hi> and a
<hi>Diploe,</hi> like the other Bones proper to the Skull.
In Infants it conſiſts of three or four. It has four
<hi>external Proceſſes,</hi> of which two, that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
to the upper Jaw, are called <hi>Aliformes</hi>
Wing-like; and four <hi>internal</hi> alſo, that compoſe
the <hi>ſella Turcica,</hi> upon which the <hi>Glandula pituitaria</hi>
lieth, that receiveth the pituitous excrements
falling from the Brain by the <hi>Infundibulum.</hi> But
this <hi>ſella Turcica</hi> is not perforated, as we intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> in Book 3. Chap. 5. though
that has been generally taught, ſuppoſing that
the pituitous matter did deſtil through its holes
upon the Palate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas it is reſorbed by
the Veins, as that learned Doctor affirms. It
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49419:248"/>
hath ſundry perforations, by which the motory
and optick Nerves of the Eye, and other Nerves
for the motion of other parts, as alſo Veins and
Arteries do paſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond common Bone is <hi>Os cribriforme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Os cribri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</note>
becauſe, like a Sieve, it hath many holes, by
which ſmells paſs to the <hi>Proceſſus mammillares</hi> or
olfactory Nerves. It is covered with the <hi>Dura
mater,</hi> and ſeated in the middle baſis of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
at the top of the Noſtrils, and is joined by
the Sutures called <hi>Harmoniae</hi> to the <hi>Os frontis,</hi> the
ſecond Bone of the upper Jaw and to the <hi>Cunei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</hi>
On its upper ſide in the middle it has
growing upon it a kind of triangular proceſs,
like to the Comb of a Cock, which is therefore
called <hi>Criſta galli.</hi> And oppoſite to this in its
lower ſide it has another that is thin and hard, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Noſe into two parts or Noſtrils, the
right and the left, and is called <hi>Septum naſi.</hi> To
this <hi>Os cribriforme,</hi> in the cavity of the Noſtrils,
there adhere two other Bones called <hi>Spongioſa,</hi>
becauſe they are full of holes like a Pumice-ſtone.
But moſt Anatomiſts conſider them as parts of the
<hi>Os cribriforme,</hi> confounding their names one with
the other, calling this, <hi>Os ſpongioſum</hi> or <hi>cribri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi>
indifferently.</p>
                  <p>The third common Bone is <hi>Os jugale,</hi> or the
Yoke-bone. It is placed on each ſide of the Face
between the <hi>Meatus</hi> of the Ear and the firſt Bone
of the upper Jaw, being framed of two Bones, of
which the hinder is a proceſs of the Temple-bone
that is carried from the <hi>Meatus auditorius;</hi> and
the fore-bone is a proceſs of the firſt bone of the
upper Jaw, which maketh the lower ſide of the
leſſer corner of the Eye. Theſe two Proceſſes are
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49419:248"/>
joined by an oblique Suture, and make the <hi>Os ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi>
It ſuſtaineth the Tendon of the temporal

is not ſolid but ſpongious; and unequal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is framed of ſundry Bones. They are ſix
pair, ſix in each ſide. The <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>Zygomaticum:</hi>
this maketh up the beſt part of the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> and
the outer corner of the Eye. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is <hi>Os la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymale.</hi>
It is a round, little and thin Bone in
the inner corner of the Eye, whereon the <hi>Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
lachrymalis</hi> reſteth. In the lower part of it
there is a hole which paſſeth to the cavity of the
Noſe: by this a branch of the fifth pair of Nerves
paſſeth to the inner Membrane of the Noſe. The
<hi>third</hi> is thin as the former, but quadrangular. It
is placed between the two former in the inner
ſide of the orbit of the Eye, and is continuous to
the <hi>Os ſpongioſum</hi> of the Noſtrils. The <hi>fourth</hi> is
<hi>Os malae,</hi> the Cheek-bone, the greateſt and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.
This maketh up the greateſt part of the
Cheek and Palate, and containeth all the upper
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:49419:249"/>
Teeth in its caverns. It is joined above, on that
ſide next the Noſe, to the Bone of the Forehead,
but below with the wedge-like Bone; before with
the <hi>Os lachrymale,</hi> behind with the third, and laſt
of all with its fellow. Under the Eye it has a hole
for the paſſage of a branch of the fifth pair of
Nerves that is beſtowed on the Face; and another
near the bottom of the Noſe, by which an Artery
and a Vein paſs from the Palate to the Noſtrils.
The <hi>fifth</hi> is long, hard, and reaſonable thick; it
with its fellow maketh up the bony part of the
Noſe. It is joined with the Cartilages of the
Noſe below, (to which purpoſe it is very rough
and unequal on that ſide) but to the internal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the <hi>Os frontis</hi> above. The ſixth doth make
up the Roof of the Mouth, (with its fellow.)</p>
                  <p>Six Bones then make up the orbit of the Eye.
The firſt is <hi>Frontale,</hi> which maketh the upper
vaulted part. The ſecond is placed in the outſide,
where the leſſer corner is, and is a portion of the
wedge-like Bone. The third is the firſt Bone of
the upper Jaw, and maketh up the outſide, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with the former portion of the wedge-like
Bone. The fourth and fifth are the ſecond
and third of the ſaid Jaw, and make up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.
The ſixth maketh up the lower part. Theſe
are joined one to another partly by common, and
partly by proper Sutures.</p>
                  <p>The lower Jaw in thoſe of ripe age is but one
Bone,<note place="margin">The lower Jaw.</note> but in Children, till they are a year or
two old, it conſiſts of two, which are joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at the Chin by <hi>Synchondroſis,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
grow into one. This is moveable, but the
upper immoveable. It reſembleth in ſhape the
Greek letter <hi>v.</hi> At both the ends of it there are
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:49419:249"/>
two proceſſes, whereof the one from a broad ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
grows ſharp, and is called <hi>Corona:</hi> this recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Tendon of the temporal Muſcle, which
is alſo the firſt of the lower Jaw. The other may
be called <hi>Articularis,</hi> becauſe it ſerveth for Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.
This has a Neck and a longiſh Head
(called <hi>Condylus)</hi> that is covered with a Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
for its eaſier motion. By this Head it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulated
into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of <hi>Os petroſum</hi> that is
alſo lined with a Cartilage, and is knit ſtrongly
thereto by a membranous Ligament. This Bone
has a cavity within, eſpecially in the fore part
toward the Chin, which contains a marrowy
juice for its nouriſhment. It has four <hi>Foramina;</hi>
of which two are at the roots of the Proceſſes,
by which a branch of the fifth pair of Nerves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a Vein and Artery paſs to the Teeth;
and two other in its fore-part by the ſides of the
Chin, by which two twigs of the ſaid fifth branch
paſs out again to the lower Lip and its Muſcles
and Skin.</p>
                  <p>Both the Jaws have <hi>Alveoli</hi> or Sockets for the
Teeth, in number equal with the number of the
Teeth. But when in old age the Teeth fall out,
the Sockets cloſe together, ſo that in time there
remains no print of them, but the Bone becomes
ſharp.</p>

                  <p>THE Teeth are called in Latin <hi>Dentes,</hi> quaſi
<hi>Edentes,</hi> from their office; and are fixed in
the Jaw-bones as a Nail into a Poſt, by <hi>Gomphoſis.</hi>
Their root is tied to the Mandible by a Nerve, by
<hi>Syneuroſis;</hi> and the upper part as far as 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed

<hi>Syſſarcoſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their ſubſtance is the hardeſt of all other Bones.<note place="margin">Their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note>
That part of them that ſtands out naked above
the Gums is ſmooth and covered with no <hi>Perioſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
but that part within the Sockets of the
Jaws is rough and inveſted with a thin Membrane
or <hi>Perioſteum</hi> that is of exquiſite ſenſe. The
Grinders have a manifeſt cavity within, (but the
<hi>Inciſores</hi> and Dog-teeth but an obſcure one)
whereinto by the very ſmall holes of their roots
they each receive a Capillary artery from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides,</hi>
a Vein from the Jugulars, and a twig of
a Nerve from the fifth pair (as aboveſaid) which
laſt being expanded through the thin Membrane
that inveſts the ſaid cavity gives it a moſt acute
ſenſe; but the bony ſubſtance of it ſelf is wholly
inſenſible. The Vein, Artery and Nerve are
united together and clad with a common Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
when they enter the Jaw, within which
they have a proper channel to run along in under
the roots of the Teeth, ſending twigs to each as
they paſs under them.<note place="margin">Origine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rudiments or principles of the Teeth are
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49419:250"/>
bred with the other parts in the Womb, but lie
hid for ſome months within the Jaws and Gums,
in which they encreaſe and are perfected by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
ſome breaking through the Gums ſooner,
others later, as every one may obſerve in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But though after ſuch a term of man's
life, no new Teeth ſpring; yet they grow conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
as long as a Man lives, elſe would they be
ſoon worn to the ſtumps by their daily uſe; and
we ſee that when a Tooth is loſt out of either Jaw,
that which is oppoſite to it in the other Jaw,
will grow longer than the reſt, having none to
grind againſt.</p>
                  <p>When Children come to be ſeven or eight
years old,<note place="margin">Change.</note> they change ſeveral of their Teeth;
but very rarely, if ever, all. The <hi>Inciſores</hi> or
Fore-teeth, the <hi>Canini,</hi> or Eye-teeth, and the
foremoſt Double-teeth moſt change; but the reſt
of the Double-teeth very few. Now concerning
this changing of the Teeth we muſt note, that the
old ones do not come out by the roots, but their
upper part only drops off, their root remaining
ſtill in the Socket of the Jaw, which (being
like ſeed for the new ones) by degrees grows up
above the Gums to ſupply the place of that which
was faln off. Commonly about the twentieth
year (or upwards) there ſpring out two Double-teeth
behind the reſt, which till then had lain
hid in their Sockets. Theſe are called Genuine
teeth, or <hi>Dentes ſapientiae,</hi> becauſe Men are then
come to years of diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>number</hi> of them,<note place="margin">Number.</note> commonly there are
found ſixteen in each Jaw; if there fall out any
difference in number as to individual perſons, it

way out of the Gums in Children, becauſe the
tops of them are ſharpeſt. Thoſe of the ſecond
rank are called <hi>Canini,</hi> or Dog-teeth, from their
length, hardneſs and ſharpneſs above the reſt.
In each Jaw there are two, at each ſide of the
Cutters one. They are commonly called <hi>Eye-teeth,</hi>
either from an opinion that their roots
<hi>(viz.</hi> of the upper) reach as far as the Eyes, or
that the ſame Nerve that moves the Eye ſends a
twig to theſe Teeth; neither of which conceits
are true. The roots of theſe are ſingle as thoſe
of the <hi>Inciſores,</hi> but they are both ſometimes
crooked; and if ſuch people in whom they are
ſo, chance to have one of them drawn, they can
hardly be pulled out without breaking off a piece

Head an <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> or Appendix to the Neck.
This Head is received by the large Cavity or <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabulum</hi>

                  <p>Note, that as it is either harder or ſofter than
is ſuitable to its proper nature, it acquires the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets
of <hi>cartilaginous</hi> or <hi>membranous</hi> reſpectively:
ſo, that which proceeds out of the top of the
Thigh-bone and is inſerted into the cavity of the
<hi>Coxendix</hi> is called a cartilaginous Ligament, for
its hardneſs; and that which environeth the joint
of the Shoulder, is called membranous, from its
ſoftneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which tye Bones together are without
ſenſe, (for otherwiſe upon every motion we
ſhould have been in pain:) but thoſe that knit
other parts together, (as thoſe that tye the Liver,

                  <p>Ligaments are found in ſeveral parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
As firſt, the Head being moved upon the
firſt and ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, there are
four Ligaments to ſtrengthen the articulation.
Secondly, a common membranous Ligament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girts
the whole articulation of the lower Jaw
with the Temple-bone. Thirdly, the Bone at
the root of the Tongue has four, by which it is
tyed to the neighbouring parts; and the Tongue
it ſelf has one ſtrong one on its under-ſide, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:49419:267"/>
called its <hi>Fraenum)</hi> which being two ſhort or
running too near its tip, hindreth its motion.
Children being ſo troubled, are ſaid to be Tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed,
and muſt have it cut. Fourthly, both the
Bodies and Proceſſes of all the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the
Back are knit together by Ligaments, as alſo are
the Ribs with the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> behind, and with the
Breaſt-bone before. Fifthly, ſundry are to be

were diſcourſed of when we deſcribed thoſe parts
in Book 1. Sixthly, in the Arm theſe appear.
1. Five tie the <hi>Os humeri</hi> to the Shoulder-blade.
2. The Bones of the Cubit, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> and <hi>Radius,</hi>
are tied firſt one to another; ſecondly, to the
Shoulder-bone; and thirdly, to the Wriſt by
(moſtly) membranous Ligaments. 3. There are
annular Ligaments at the Wriſts, which being
tranſverſe, confirm and make ſteady the Tendons
which paſs to the Fingers. They are two; one
in the outſide, for the Tendons of the extending
Muſcles; the other in the inner ſide, for the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of the contracting Muſcles. 4. The Bones
of the Wriſt, back of the Hand and Fingers, have
membranous Ligaments. Seventhly, In the Leg
are theſe. 1. The Thigh-bone is tied to the
<hi>Coxendix</hi> by two Ligaments. 2. The lower end
of it is tied to <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> by ſix Ligaments.
3. The <hi>Tibia</hi> is joined to the <hi>Fibula</hi> by three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Ligaments, <hi>viz.</hi> two common and one
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:49419:268"/>
proper. 4. <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> are joined to the
<hi>Talus</hi> by three Ligaments, and there are three
other for the ſtrengthening of the Tendons.
5. The <hi>Talus</hi> is tied with the other Bones of the
Foot by five Ligaments. 6. The Bones of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep
and Toes are tied with ſuch Ligaments as
thoſe of the Hand are.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Nails.</head>
                  <p>IN the laſt place we will ſay ſomething of the
Nails, which though they are not <hi>truly</hi> parts
of the Body, yet for their uſefulneſs ought not to
be omitted.</p>
                  <p>They are of an horny tranſparent ſubſtance,
coming neareſt to that of Bones, faſten'd upon
the ends of the Fingers and Toes for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
They are endued with no ſenſe, nor is
that colour which they appear to be of upon the
Fingers, owing to their proper ſubſtance, but to
the colour of the parts that lie under them;
whence they ſometimes look ruddy, ſometimes
pale, blue or yellow, and thereby give ſome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the ſtate of the Body. They grow
very firmly to the Fleſh that lies under them; and
to faſten them the better, they are tied about
their root with a Ligament, and on their ſides
the Skin cloſes them in. The parts that lie under
them are very ſenſible, for there are ſeveral twigs
of Nerves and tendons of Muſcles that run to the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:49419:268"/>
very Fingers ends; ſo that upon handling any
hard or rugged thing we ſhould have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in pain, if theſe ſo ſenſible parts had not
been thus defended by the Nails.</p>
                  <p>They may in ſome ſenſe be reputed parts of the
Body, ſo as that it would not be perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
without them: but that is but an improper
notion of a part. For if they were properly parts,
they ſhould live by the common life of the Body;
but that they do not, ſeeing <hi>they</hi> as well as the
<hi>hair</hi> continue to grow after a Man is dead: and
their growth ſeems meerly to be by appoſition of
new particles to their roots, which drive on ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
thoſe before them; as we may ſee when
there is a black or white ſpeck on any of them,
for it ſtill goes forward together with the Nail,
till it arrive at the Fingers end beyond the Fleſh.</p>
