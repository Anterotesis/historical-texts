            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ine Honourable Lord; having Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
some five or six years agoe, the
Historie of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> out of the
Spanish tongue into the English, in the
space of fourty dayes; being thereunto more then
half enforced, through the importunity of a very
deer friend, that was desirous to understand the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
After I had given once a view thereof, I cast it
aside, where it lay long time neglected in a corner,
and so little regarded by me, as I never once set
hand to review or correct the same. Since when,
at the entreatie of others my friends, I was content
to let it come to light conditionally, that some one
or other would peruse and and amend the errours
escaped; my many affairs hindring me from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
that labour. Now I understand by the
Printer, that the Copie was presented to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
which did at the first somewhat disgust me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as it must pass, I fear much, it wil prove far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:3"/>
either of your Noble view or protection.
Yet since it is mine, though abortive, I doe humbly
intreat, that your Honour will lend it a favourable
countenance, thereby to animate the Parent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to produce in time some worthier subject, in
your Honourable name, whose many rare Virtues
have already rendred me so highly devoted to
your service, as I will some day give very evident
tokens of the same; and till then I rest,</p>
                  <closer>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou maist beleeve me (gentle Reader) without swearing, that
I could willingly desire this book (as a childe of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
to be the most beautifull, gallant and discreet that might
possibly bee imagined. But I could not transgresse the order of
Nature, wherein every thing begets his like: which being
so what could my sterile and ill-tild wit engender, but the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of a dry, toasted, and humorous sonne, full of various
thoughts and conceits, never before imagined of any other; much like one who was
ingendred within some noysome prison, where all discommodities have taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and all dolefull noyses made their habitation? seeing that rest, pleasant
places, amenity of the fields, the cheerfulnesse of cleer skie, the murmuring noyse of
the cristal fountains, &amp; quiet repose of the spirit, are great helps for the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Muses to shew themselves fruitful, &amp; to bring forth into the world such births
as may enrich it with admiration &amp; delight. It oft times befals, that a father hath
a child both by by birth evil favoured and quite devoid of all perfection, and yet
the love that hee bears him is such, as it casts a mask over his eyes, which hinders
his descerning of the faults and simplicities thereof, and makes him rather to deem
them discretions &amp; beauty, and so tels them to his friends for witty jests &amp; conceits.
But I (though in shew a father, yet in truth but a step-father to <hi>Don Quixote</hi>)
will not bee born away by the violent current of the modern custome now a daies;
and therefore intreat thee with the tears almost in mine eyes, as many others are
wont to doe, (most dear Reader) to pardon and dissemble the faults which thou shalt
discern in this my soone; for thou art neither his kinsman nor friend, and thou
hast thy soul in thy body, and thy free will therein as absolute as the best, and thou
art in thine own house, wherein thou art as absolute a Lord, as the King is of his
subsidies, and thou knowest well the common Proverb, that <hi>Under my cloak a fig
for the King,</hi> all which doth exempt thee, and makes thee free from all respect and
obligation; and so thou maiest holdly say of this History whatsoever thou shalt
think good, without fear either to bee controled for the evill, or rewarded for the
good thou shalt speak thereof.</p>
                  <p>I would very fain have presented it unto thee pure and Naked, without the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of a Preface, or the rabblement &amp; Catalogue of the wonted Sonnets, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams,
Poems, Elegies, &amp;c. which are wont to bee put at the beginning of Books.
For I dare say unto thee, that (although it cost me some pains to compose it) yet in
no respect did it equalize that which I took to make this preface which thou doest
now read. I took oftentimes my pen in my hand to write it, and as often set it
down again, as not knowing what I should write, and being once in amuse with
my Paper before me, my Pen in mine eare, mine elbow on the table, and my hand
on my cheek, imagining what I might write; there entred a friend of mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly,
who was a very discreet and pleasantly witted man; who seeing me so
pensative, demanded of me the reason of my musing: And not concealing it from
him, said, That I bethought my self on my preface I was to make to <hi>Don Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xotes</hi>
History, which did so much trouble me, as I neither mean to make any at all,
nor publish the History of the Acts of so noble a Knight: For how can I choose quoth
I) but be much confounded at that which the old legislator (the Vulgar) will say
when it sees that after the end of so many years (as are spent since I first step in the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:4"/>
bosome of oblivion) I come out loaden with my gray haires, and bring with me a
Book as dry as a Kex, void of invention, barren of good phrase, poor of conceits,
and altogether emptie both of learning and eloquence; without quotations on the
margents, or annotations in the end of the Book, wherewith I see other Books are
still adorned, bee they never so idle, fabulous and prophane: so full of sentences of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> and the other crue of the Philosophers, as admires the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and makes them beleeve that these Authours were very learned and eloquent.
And after, when they cite <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> what can they say, but that they
are the sayings of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> or other Doctors of the Church? observing herein
so ingenious a method, as in one line they will paint you an enamoured gull, and in
the other will lay you down a little seeming devout sermon, so that it is a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight to read or heare it; all which things must be wanting in my Book,
for neither have I any thing to cite on the margent or note in the end, &amp; much lesse
doe I know what Authors I follow, to put them at the beginning as the custome is, by
the letter of the <hi>A.B.C.</hi> beginning with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and ending in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or
in <hi>Zoylus,</hi> or <hi>Zeuxis.</hi> Although the one was a Railer, and the other a Painter. So
likewise shall my Book want Sonnets at the beginning, at least such Sonnets whose
Authours bee Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Bishops, Ladies or famous Poets. Although
if I would demand them of two or three Ahtificers of mine acquaintance, I know
they would make me some such, as those of the most renowed in <hi>Spain</hi> would in no
wise be able to equall or compare with them.</p>
                  <p>Finally good Sir, and my very deer friend (quoth I) I doe resolve that <hi>Sir Don
Quixote</hi> remain intombed among the old Records of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> untill heaven
ordain some to adorn him with the many graces that are yet wanting: for I find my
self wholly unable to remedy them, through mine insufficiency and little learning;
and also because I am naturally lazie and unwilling to goe searching for Authors to
say that which I can say well enough without them. And hence proceeded the perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity,
&amp; extasie wherein you found me plunged. My friend hearing that, &amp; striking
himself on the fore head, after a long and lowd laughter said: In good faith friend,
I have now at last delivered my self of a long and intricate error wherewith I was
possessed all the time of our acquaintance; for hitherto I accounted thee ever to bee
discreet and prudent in all thy Actions, but now I see plainly that thou art as far
from that I took thee to bee, as Heaven is from the Earth.</p>
                  <p>How is it possible, that things of so small moment and so easie to be redressed, can
have force to suspend and swallow up so ripe a wit as yours hath seemed to bee, and
so fitted to break up and trample over the greatest difficulties that can be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
This proceeds not in good sooth from defect of will, but from superfluity of
sloath, and penury of discourse: wilt thou see whether that I say be true or no?
Listen then attentively a while, and thou shalt perceive how in the twinkling of an
eye, I will confound all these difficulties, and supply all the wants which doe sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
&amp; affright thee from publishing to the world <hi>The History of the famous
DON-QUIXOTE, the light and mirrour of all Knighthood Errant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Say I pray thee, quoth I (hearing what hee had said) after what manner doest
thou think to replenish the vacuity of my fear, and reduce the <hi>Chaos</hi> of my confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to any cleernesse and light? And hee replyed: The first thing whereat thou
stopest, of Sonnets, Epigrams, Eglogues, &amp;c. (which are wanting for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and ought to be written by grave and noble persons) may be remedied, if thou
thy self wilt but take a little pain to compasse them, and thou mayest after name
them as thou pleasest, and father them on <hi>Prester John</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or the
Emperour of <hi>Trapisonde,</hi> whom I know were held to be famous Poets; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:54746:4"/>
they were not, but that some pedantes and presumptuous, fellowes, would back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
thee and murmur against this truth, thou needest not waigh them two straws;
for although they could prove it to bee an untruth, yet cannot they cut off thy hand
for it.</p>
                  <p>As touching citations in the margent, and Authours out of whom thou mayest
collect sentences and sayings, to insert in thy History, there is nothing else to bee
done, but to bob into it some latine sentences that thou knowest already by rote, or
mayest get easily with a little labour: as for example, When thou treatest of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and thraldome, thou mayest cite that <hi>non bene pro toto libertas venditur
auro:</hi> and presently quote <hi>Horace,</hi> or hee whosoever else that said it, on the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
If thou shouldest speak of the power of death, have presently recourse to that,
of <hi>Pallida mors equo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque turres.</hi>
If of the instability of friends, thou hast at hand <hi>Cato</hi> freely offering his disti<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hon.
<hi>Donec eris foelix multos numerabis amicos. Tempora si iuerint nubila,
solus eris.</hi> If of riches, <hi>quantum quisque sua nummorum servat in arca
tantum habet &amp; fidei.</hi> If of love, <hi>hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
herbis.</hi> And so with these latine Authorities, and other such like, they will at
least account thee a good Grammarian, and the being of such a one, is of no little
honour and profit in this our age. As touching the addition of annotations in the
end of thy Book, thou mayest boldly observe this course. If thou namest any Gyant
in thy Book, procure that it bee the Gyant <hi>Goliah;</hi> and with this alone (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
will cost thee nothing) thou hast gotten a fair annotation; for thou mayest
say, The Gyant <hi>Golias</hi> or <hi>Goliat</hi> was a <hi>Philistine,</hi> whom the Sheepheard <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
slew with the blow of a stone in the vale of <hi>Terebintho,</hi> as is recounted in the
Book of Kings, in the chapter wherein thou shalt finde it written.</p>
                  <p>After all this, to shew that thou art learned in humane letters, and a Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
take some occasion to make mention of the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> and thou shalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
finde thy self stored with another notable notation, saying the River <hi>Tagus</hi>
was so called of a King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it takes it beginning from such a place, and dies
in the <hi>Ocean</hi> Seas, kissing first the walls of the famous Citie of <hi>Lisborne:</hi> And
some are of opinion, that the sands thereof are of Gold, &amp;c. If thou wilt treat of
Theeves, I will recite the History of <hi>Cacus</hi> to thee, for I know it by memory. If of
Whores or Curtezans, there thou hast the Bishop of <hi>Mondonnedo,</hi> who will
lend thee <hi>Lamia, Layda,</hi> and <hi>Flora,</hi> whose annotation will gain thee no small cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
If of cruell persons, <hi>Ovid</hi> will tender <hi>Medea.</hi> If of Enchanters and Witches,
<hi>Homer</hi> hath <hi>Calipso</hi> and <hi>Virgill Circe.</hi> If of valorous Captains, <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
shall lend himself in his commentaries to thee; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> shall give thee a
thousand <hi>Alexanders.</hi> If thou doest treat of Love, and hast but two ounces of the
<hi>Thuscane</hi> language, thou shalt encounter with <hi>Lion</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
thy vessells with store in that kinde; but if thou wilt not travel for it into
strange Countries, thou hast here at home in thy house <hi>Fonseca</hi> of the love of God,
wherein is deciphered all that either thou, or the most ingenious capacitie can desire
to learn of that subject. In conclusion, there is nothing else to bee done, but that
thou only indeavour to name those names, or to touch those Histories in thine own
which I have here related, and leave the adding of Annotations and citations unto
me, for I doe promise thee that I will both fill up the margent, and also spend four or
five sheets of advantage at the end of the Book.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the citation of Authours, which other Books have, and thine
wanteth, the remedie hereof is very easie; for thou needest doe naught else but
seek out a Book that doth quote them all from the Letter A untill Z, as thou saidst
<pb facs="tcp:54746:5"/>
thy self but even now, and thou shalt set that very same Alphabet to thine own
Book, for although the little necessity that thou hadst to use their assistance in thy
work, will presently convict thee of falshood, it makes no matter, and perhaps
there may not a few bee found so simple as to beleeve that thou hast holp thy self in,
the Narration of thy most simple &amp; sincere History, with all their authorities. And
though that large Catalogue of Authors doe serve to none other purpose; yet will
it at least give some authority to the Book at the first blush: and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none will bee so mad as to stand to examine whether thou doest follow them or
no, seeing they can gain nothing by the matter. Yet if I doe not erre in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of so weighty an affaire, this Book of thine needs none of all these things,
for as much as it is only an invective against Books of Knighthood, a subject
whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> never dreamed, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> said nothing, <hi>Cicero</hi> never heard
any word. Nor doe the punctualities of truth, nor observations of Astrologie fall
within the Sphear of such fabulous jestings. Nor doe Geometricall dimentions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
it anything; nor the confutation of arguments usurped by Rhetorick; nor ought
it to preach unto any the mixture of holy matters with prophane (a motly where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
no Christian well should bee attyred) only it hath need to help it
self with imitation; for, by how much the more it shall excell therein, by so much
the more will the work be esteemed. And since that thy labour doth aime at no more
then to diminish the authoritie and acceptance that Books of Chivalrie have in the
world, and among the vulgar, there is no occasion why thou shouldest goe begging
of sentences from Philosophers, fables from Poets, Orations from Rhetoritians, or
miracles from the Saints, but onely endeavour to deliver with significant, plain,
honest, and well-ordered words thy joviall and cheerfull discourse, expressing as
neer as thou mayest possibly thy intention, making thy conceits cleer, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
or dark; and labour also, that the melancholy Mare by the reading thereof,
may bee urged to laughter, the pleasant disposition increased, the simple not cloyed;
and that the judicious may admire thy invention, the grave not despise it, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
applaude it. In conclusion, let thy project bee to overthrow the ill-compiled
<hi>Machina,</hi> and bulk of those knightly Books, abhorred by many, but applauded by
more. For if thou bring this to passe, thou hast not atchieved a small matter.</p>
                  <p>I listned with very great attention to my friends Speech; and his reasons are
so firmly imprinted in my minde, as without making any reply unto them, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
them all for good, and framed my preface of them: Wherein (sweet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
thou mayest perceive my friends discretion, my happinesse to meet with so good
a councellour at such a pinch, and thine own ease in finding so plainly and sincerely
related, <hi>The History of the famous DON-QUIXOTE of the Mancha,</hi>
of whom it is the common opinion of all the inhabitants bordering on the Fields
of <hi>Montiel,</hi> that hee was the most chaste, enamoured and valiant Knight that
hath been seen, read, or heard of these many ages. I will not indeer the benefit
and service I have done thee, by making thee acquainted with so Noble and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a Knight, but only doe desire that thou gratifie me for the notice of the
famous <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his Squire; in whom, in mine opinion, are deciphered all
the Squire-like graces dispersed throughout the vain rout of Knightly Books:
And herewithall I bid thee farewell, and doe not forget me.</p>

His pot consisted daily of somewhat more Beef then
Mutton, a Galli mawfry each night, Collops and Eggs on
Saturdayes, Lentils on Fridayes, and now and then a lean Pigeon
on Sundayes, did consume three parts of his Rents; the rest and remnant thereof was
spent on a Jerkin of fine Puke, a pair of Velvet hose, with Pantofles of the same for
the Holy-dayes, and one Sute of the finest Vesture; for therewithall he honoured and
see out his person on the work dayes. He had in his house a woman servant of about
fourty yeers old, and a Neece not yet twenty, and a man that served him both in field
and at home and could saddle his Horse, and likewise manage a pruning hook. The
Master himself was about fifty yeers old, of a strong complexion, dry flesh, and a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
face: He was an early riser, and a great friend of hunting. Some affirm that
his surname was <hi>Qixada</hi> or <hi>Quesada</hi> (for in this there is some varience among the
Authors that write his life) although it may be gathered by very probable conjectures,

Let it then suffice, that in the Narration thereof we will not vary a jot from the
truth.</p>
                     <p>You shall therefore wit, that this Gentleman above named, the spirts that he was
idle (which was the longer part of the year) did apply himself wholly to the reading of
<pb facs="tcp:54746:10"/>
Books of Knight-hood, and that with such gusts and delights, as he almost wholly
neglected the exercise of hunting; yea, and the very administration of his houshould
affairs: and his curiosity and folly came to that passe, that he made away many Acres
of arable Land to buy him books of that kinde, and therefore he brought to his house
as many as ever he could get of that Subject: And among them all, none pleased him
better then those which famous <hi>Felician</hi> of <hi>Silva</hi> composed. For the smoothness of his
Prose, with now and then some intricate sentence meddled, seemed to him peerlesse;
and principally when he did read the courtings, or Letters of challenge that Knights
sent to Ladies, or one to another; where, in many places he found written, The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the unreasonablenesse, which against my reason is wrought, doth so weaken
my reason, as withall reason I doe justly complain on your Beauty. And also when he
read the high Heavens, which with your Divinity doe fortifie you divinely with the
Starrs, and make you deserveresse of the Deserts which your Greatnesse deserves, &amp;c.
With these and other such passages, the poor Gentleman grew distracted, and was
breaking his brains day and night, to understand and unbowell their sense. An endlesse
labour; foreven <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself would not understand them, though he were again
resuscitated only for that purpose. He did not like so much the unproportionate
blows that <hi>Don Belianie</hi> gave and took in fight; for, as he imagined, were the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
never so cunning that cured them, yet was it impossible but that the Patient his
Face and all his Body must remain full of scars and tokens: yet did he praise notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the Author of that History, the conclusion of his book, with the promise of
the endlesse adventure; and many times he himself had a desire to take pen and finish it
exactly, as it is there promised; and would doubtlesly have performed it, and that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with happy successe, if other more urgent and continuall thoughts had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
him.</p>
                     <p>Many times did he fall at varience with the Curate of his Village (who was a learned
man, graduated in <hi>Ciguenca)</hi> touching who was the better Knight, <hi>Palmerin</hi> of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
or <hi>Amadis de Gaule:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber of the same Town would
affirm, that none of both arrived in worth to the Knight of the Sun; and if any one
Knight might paragon with him, it was infallibly <hi>Don Galaor, Amadis de Gaule's</hi>
brother, whose nature might fitly be accommodated to any thing; For he was not so
coy and whyning a Knight as his brother, and that in matters of Valour, he did not
bate him an Ace.</p>
                     <p>In resolution, he plunged himself so deeply in his reading of these books, as he spent
many times in the Lecture of them whole dayes and nights; and in the end, through his
little sleep and much reading, he dryed up his brains in such sort, as he lost wholy his
Judgement. His fantasie was filled with those things that he read, of Enchantments,
Quairels, Battels, Challenges, Wounds, Wooings, Loves, Tempests, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
follies. And these toyes did so firmly possesse his imagination with an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
opinion, that all that Machina of dreamed inventions which he read, was true, as
he accounted no History in the World to be so certain and sincere as they were. He
was wont to say, that the <hi>Gid Ruydiaz (A famous Captain of the Spanish Nation.)</hi> was
a very good Knight, but not to be compared to the Knight of the burning Sword, which
with one thwart blow cut asunder two fierce and mighty Gyants. He agreed better
with <hi>Bernarde del Carpio,</hi> because he flew the enchanted <hi>Rowland</hi> in <hi>Roncesuales.</hi> He
likewise liked of the shift <hi>Hercules</hi> used when he smothered <hi>Antean,</hi> the son of the
earth, between his arms. He praised the Gyant <hi>Margant</hi> marvelously, because, though
he was of that Monstrom Progenie, who are commonly all of them proud and rude, yet
he only was affable and courteous. But he agreed best of all with <hi>Reinauld</hi> of <hi>Mount
Alban;</hi> and most of all then, when he saw him fallie out of his Castle to Rob as
many as ever he could meet: And when moreover he Rob'd the Idoll of <hi>Mahome's</hi>
made of God, as his History recounts, and would be content to give his old woman;
yea, and his Neece also, for a good oportunity on the Traytor <hi>Galalon,</hi> that he might
Lamb-skin and trample him into Powder.</p>
                     <p>Finally, his wit being wholy extinguished; he fell into one of the strangest conceits
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54746:10"/>
that ever mad-man stumbled on in this World, to wit, It seemed unto him very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
and behoovefull, as well for the augmentation of his Honour, as also for the
benefit of the Common-wealth, that he himself should becom a Knight Errant, and goe
throughout the World, with his Horse and Armor to seek Adventures, and practise
in person all that he had read was used by Knights of yoare; revenging all kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>juries,
and offering him-self to occasions and dangers: which being once happily
atchieved, might gain him eternall renown. The poor soul did already figure himself
crowned, through the valour of his Arm, at least Emperor of <hi>Trapesonda;</hi> and led thus
by these soothing thoughts, and borne away with the exceeding delight he found in
them, he hastened all that he might, to effect his urging desires.</p>
                     <p>And first of all he caused certain old rusty Arms to bee scowred, that belonged to his
great Grand-father, and lay many ages neglected and forgotten, in a by-corner of his
house; he trim'd them and dressed them the best he mought, and then perceived a great
defect they had; for they wanted an helmet, and had only a plain morrion; but he
by his industry supplied that want, and framed with certain Papers pasted together, a
Beaver for his Morrion. True it is, that to make tryall whether his pasted Beaver was
strong enough, and might abide the adventure of a blow; he out with his sword and
gave it a blow or two, and with the very first did quite undoe his whole weeks labour:
the facility wherewithall it was dissolved liked him nothing; wherefore to assure him
self better the next time from the like danger, he made it anew, placing certain Iron
bars within it, in so artificiall manner, as he rested at once satisfied, both with his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and also the solidity of the work; and without making a second tryall, he deputed
and held it in estimation of a most excellent Beaver. Then did he presently visit his
Horse, who (though he had more quarters then pence in a sixpence, through leannesse,
and more faults then <hi>Gonellas)</hi> having nothing on him but skin and bone; yet he
thought that neither <hi>Alexanders Bucephalus,</hi> nor the <hi>Cid</hi> his horse <hi>Balie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>a,</hi> were in
any respect equall to him. He spent four dayes devising him a name: for (as he reasoned
to himself) it was not fit that so famous a Knights horse, and chiefly being so good a
beast, should want a known name; and therefore he endeavoured to give him such a
one, as should both declare what sometime he had been, before he pertained to a Knight
Errant, and also what at present he was: for it stood greatly with reason, seeing his
Lord and Master changed his estate and vocation, that he should alter likewise his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
and get a new one, that were famous and altisonant, as becomed the new
order and exercise which he now professed: and therefore after many other names
which he framed, blotted out, rejected, added, undid, and turned again to frame in his
memory and imagination, he finally concluded to name him <hi>Rozinante, (A horse of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
or carriage, in Spanish, is called</hi> Rozin, <hi>and the word</hi> Ante <hi>signifies</hi> Before; <hi>so that</hi>
Rozinante <hi>is a horse that sometime was of carriage.)</hi> A name in his opinion lofty, full,
and significant, of what he had been when he was a plain Jade, before he was exalted
to his new dignitie; being, as he thought, the best carriage Beast of the World. The
name being thus given to his Horse, and so to his minde, he resolved to give himself a
name also; and in that thought he laboured other eight dayes; and in conclusion, called
himself <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> whence (as is said) the Authors of this most true History de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
that he was undoubtedly named <hi>Quixada,</hi> and not <hi>Quesada,</hi> as others would
have it. And remembring that the valorous <hi>Amadis</hi> was not satisfied only with the
dry name of <hi>Amadis,</hi> but added thereunto the name of his Kingdome and Countrey,
to render his own more redoubted, terming himself <hi>Amadis de Gaula;</hi> so he, like a
good Knight, would add to his own, that also of his Province, and call himself <hi>Don
Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> wherewith it appeared, that he very lively declared his Linage
and Countrey, which he did honour, by taking it for his surname.</p>
                     <p>His Armour being scowred, his Morrion transformed into an Helmet, his Horse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and himself confirmed with a new name also; he forthwith bethought himself,
that now he wanted nothing but a Lady, on whom he might bestow his service and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for the Knight Errant that is lovelesse, resembles a Tree that wants leaves and
fruit, or a body without a soul: and therefore he was wont to say, If I should for
<pb facs="tcp:54746:11"/>
my sinns, or by good hap, encounter there abroad with some Gyant (as Knights Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
doe ordinarily) and that I should overthrow him with one blow to the ground,
or cut him with a stroak in two halves, or finally overcome, or make him yield to me,
would it not be very expedient to have some Lady, to whom I might present him?
And that he entring in her presence, doe kneel before my sweet Lady, and say unto
her with an humble and submissive voice; Madam, I am the Gyant <hi>Caraculiambro,</hi>

                        </gap> how glad was our Knight when he had made this
discourse to himself, but chiefly when he had found out one whom he might call his
Lady? For as it is imagined, there dwelled in the next Village unto his Mannor, a
young handsome wench, with whom he was sometime in Love, although, as is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
she never knew or took notice thereof. She was called <hi>Aldonsa Lorenso,</hi> and
her he thought fittest to intitle with the name of Lady of his thoughts, and searching
a name for her that should not vary much from her own, and yet should draw and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre
somewhat to that of a Princesse or great Lady, he called her <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>lcinea del Toboso</hi>
(for there she was borne) a name in his conceit harmonious, strange, and significant,
like to all the others that he had given to his things.</p>

no longer, being spur'd on the more vehemently, by the want
which he esteemed his delayes wrought in the World, according to
the wrongs that he resolved to right, the harmes he meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse,
the excesses he would amend, the abuses that he would better,
and the debts he would satisfie. And therefore without acquainting
any living creature with his intentions he, unseen of any, upon a certain Morning,
somewhat before the day (being one of the warmest of <hi>Iuly</hi>) Armed himself <hi>Cap a pie,</hi>
mounted on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> laced on his ill-contrived Helmet, imbraced his Target, took his
Launce, and by a Postern door of his base-Court issued out to the Field, marveilous
jocund and content to see with what facility he had commenced his good desires.
But scarce had he sallied to the Fields, when he was suddainly assaulted by a terrible
thought, and such a one as did well nigh overthrow his former good purposes; which
was, he remembred he was not yet dub'd Knight; and therefore by the Laws of
Knighthood, neither could nor ought to Combat with any Knight. And though he were
one, yet ought he to weare white Armour like a new Knight, without any device in his
shield untill he did win it by force of Arms.</p>
                     <p>These thoughts did make him stagger in his purposes; but his follies prevailing
more then any other reason, he purposed to cause himself to be Knighted by the first
he met, to the imitation of many others that did the same, as he had read in the books
which distracted him. As touching white Armour, he resolved with the first oportunity,
to scower his own so well, that they should rest whiter then Ermines: And thus he
pacified his minde and prosecuted his Journey, without chusing any other way then that
which his horse pleased, believing that therein consisted the vigor of Knightly adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Our burnish'd Adventurer travelling thus onward, did parle with himself in this
manner: <q>Who doubts in the ensuing Ages, when the true History of my famous

abandoning the slothfull plumes, did mount upon his renowned Horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi>
and began to travell through the ancient and known Fields of <hi>Moh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                              </gap>l,</hi> (as indeed
he did) and following still on with his discourse, he said: O! happy the age, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
the time, wherein my famous feats shall be revealed, feats worthy to be
graven in Brasse, carved in Marble, and delivered with most curious Art in Tables, for
a future instruction and memory. And, thou wise Enchanter, whosoever thou beest,
whom it shall concern to be the Chronicler of this strange History, I desire thee not
to forget my good horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> mine eternall and inseparable Companion in all
my Journies and Courses. And then, as if he were verily enamoured, he said, O Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<hi>Dulcinea,</hi> Lady of this captive heart, much wrong hast thou done me by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing
me, and reproaching me with the rigorous Decree and Commandement, Not
to appear before thy beauty: I pray thee, sweet Lady, deign to remember thee of this
poor subjected heart, that for thy Love suffers so many tortures.</q> And with these
words he inserted a thousand other ravings, all after the very same manner that his
books taught him, imitating as neer as he could, their very phrase and language, and
did ride there withall so slow a pace, and the Sun did mount so swiftly, and with so
great heat, as it was sufficient to melt his brains if he had had any left.</p>
                     <p>He travelled almost all that day without encountring any thing worthy the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
which made him to fret for anger: for he desired to encounter presently some
one, upon whom he might make tryall of his invincible strength. Some Authors
write, that his first adventure was that of the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>picean</hi> straits; others, that of the
Winde-mills: But what I could only finde out in this affair, and which I have found
written in the Annals of the <hi>Mancha</hi> is, that he travelled all that day long, and at night
both he and his Horse were tyred, and marvellously prest by hunger, and looking about
him on every side, to see whether he could discover any Castle or Sheep-fold, wherein
he might retire himself for that night, and remedy his wants; he perceived an Inn neer
unto the high-way, wherein he travelled, which was as welcome a sight to him as if he had
seen a Star that did addresse him to the Porch, if not to the Palace of his redemption.
Then spurring his horse, he hyed all he might towards it, and arrived much about night
fall. There stood by chance at the Inn door, two young women Adventurers likewise,
which travelled toward <hi>Sivill</hi> with certain Carriers, and did by chance take up their
lodging in that Inn the same evening; and for as much as our Knight Errant esteemed
all which hee thought, saw, or imagined, was done or did really passe in the very same
form, as he had read the like in his books; forthwith as soon as he espied the Vent, he
feigned to himself that it was a Castle with four Turrets, whereof the Pinacles were of
glistring silver, without omitting the draw-Bridge, deep Fosse, and other adherents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the like places: And approaching by little and little to the Vent, when he
drew neer to it, checking <hi>Rozin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nte</hi> with the bridle, he rested a while to see whether any
Dwarf would mount on the battlements to give warning with the sound of a Trumpet,
how some Knight did approach the Castle: but seeing they staid so long, and also that
<hi>Rozinante</hi> kept a colle to goe to his Stable, he went to the Inn door, and there beheld
the two loose Baggages that stood at it, whom he presently supposed to be two beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

                        </gap>s or lovely Ladies, that did solace themselves before the Castle gates. And
in this space it befell by chance, that a certain Swine heard as he gathered together his
Hogs, blew the horne, whereat they are wont to come together; and instantly <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
imagined, it was what he desired, to wit, some Dwarf who gave notice of his
arrivall; and therefore with marveilous satisfaction of minde he approached to the
Inn and Ladies; who beholding one Armed in that manner to draw so neer, with his
<pb facs="tcp:54746:12"/>
Launce and Target, they made much haste, being greatly affrighted, to get to their
lodging. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiving their fear by their flight, lifting up his pasted
Beaver, and discovering his withered and dusty countenance, did accost them with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
demeanor and grave words in this manner: <q>Let not your Ladyships flie, nor
fear any outrage; for to the order of Knighthood which I doe professe, it toucheth
nor appertaineth not to wrong any body, and least of all such worthy Damzels as
your presences denote you to be.</q> The wenches looked on him very earnestly, and did
search with their eyes for the visage, which his ill-fashioned Beaver did conceal: but
when they heard themselves termed damzels, a thing so far from their profession, they
could not contain ther laughter, which was so loud, as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> waxed ashamed
thereat; and therefore said to them; <q>Modesty is a comely ornament of the beautifull,
and the excessive laughter that springs from a light occasion must be reputed great
folly: But I doe not object this unto you to make you the more ashamed, or that
you should take it in ill part; for my desire is none other then to doe you all the
honour and service I may.</q> This he spake unto them in such uncouth words, as they
could not understand him, which was an occasion, joyned with his own uncomelinesse,
to increase their laughter and his wrath, which would have passed the bounds of reason,
if the Inn-Keeper had not come out at the instant; being a man who by reason of his
exceeding fatnesse must needs have been of a very peaceable condition, who beholding
that counterfeit figure, all Armed in so unsutable Armour as were his Bridle, Launce,
Target, and Corslet, was very neer to have kept the Damzels company in the pleasant
shewes of this merriment: but fearing in effect the <hi>Machina</hi> and bulk contrived of so
various furnitures, he determined to speak him fairly; and therefore began to him in this
manner: If your Worship (Sir Knight) doe seek for Lodging, you may chalk your self
a Bed (for there is none in this Inn) wherein you shall finde all other things in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> noting the lowlinesse of the Constable of that Fortresse (for such
the Inn and Inn-keeper seemed unto him) answered, Any thing, Sir Constable, may
serve me; for mine Arms are mine ornaments, and Battels mine ease, &amp;c. The Host
thought he had called him a <hi>Castellano</hi> or Constable, <hi>[Here the Spanish is</hi> Castellano;
<hi>that is in the Spanish tongue, either a Constable of a Castle or one born in Castile.]</hi> because
he esteemed him to be one of the sincere and honest men of Castile, whereas he was indeed
an <hi>Andaluzian,</hi> and of the Commark of S. <hi>Lucars,</hi> no lesse thievish then <hi>Cacus,</hi> nor less
malicious and crafty then a Student or Page: and therefore he answered him thus: If that
be so, your Bed must be hard Rocks, &amp; your sleep a perpetuall Watching; and being such,
you may boldly alight, and shall finde certainly here occasion &amp; oportunity to hold you
waking this twelvemonth more, for one night: and saying so, laid hold on <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi>
stirrop, who did forthwith alight, though it was with great difficulty &amp; pain (as one that
had not eaten all the day one crum) and then he requested his Host to have speciall care
of his horse, saying, He was one of the best pieces that ever eate bread. The Inn-keeper
viewed and reviewed him, to whom he did not seem half so good as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
valued him; and setting him up in the Stable, he turned to see what his Ghuest would
command, who was a disarming by both the Damzels (which were by this time recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to him) who, though they had taken off his breast-plate and back parts; yet knew
they not how, nor could any wise undoe his Gorget, nor take off his conterfeit Beaver,
which hee had fastened on with green Ribbands; and by reason the knots were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
it was requisite they should be cut, whereunto he would not in any wise agree;
and therefore remained all the night with his Helmet on, and was the strangest and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest
figure thereby that one might behold. And as he was a disarming (imagining
those light wenches that holp him, to be certain principall Ladies and Dames of that
Castle) he said unto them with a very good grace, Never was any Knight so well atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on, and served by Ladies as was <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> when he departed from his Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
Damzels attended on him, and Princesses on his Horse. O <hi>Rozinante!</hi> for (La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
that is the name of my Horse, and <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi> is mine own. For
although I meant at the first not to have discovered my self, untill the Acts done in your
service and benefit should manifest me; yet the necessity of accommodating to our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54746:12"/>
present purpose, the old Romance of Sir <hi>Launcelot,</hi> hath been an occasion that you
should know my name before the right season: But the time will come wherein your
Ladyships may command me, and I obey, and then the valour of mine arme shall
discover the desire I have to doe you service.</p>
                     <p>The wenches being unaccustomed to hear so Rhetoricall terms, answered never a
word to him, but only demanded, whether he would eat any thing? That I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for as much as I think the taking of a little meat would be very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoovefull
for me. It chanced by hap to be on Friday, and therefore there was no other
meat in the Inn, then a few pieces of a Fish called in Castile <hi>Abadexo,</hi> in Andaluzia,

                     <p>They demanded of him therefore, whether he would eat thereof? giving it the
name, used in that place, of <hi>Truchuela,</hi> or little Trout; for there was no other Fish
in all the Inn to present unto him but such. Why then (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> bring it
in; for if there be many little Trouts, they may serve me instead of a great one; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being all one to me, to be paid my money (if I were to receive any) in eight single
Realls, or to be paid the same in one Reall of eight. And moreover those little Trouts
are perhaps like unto Veal, which is much more delicate flesh then Beef; or the Kid
which is better then the Goat; but be it what it list, let it be brought in presently; for
the labour and weight of arms cannot be well borne without the well supplying of the
Guts. Then was there straight laid a Table at the Inn door, that he might take the air;
and the Host brought him a portion of evill-watered, and worse boyled poor-John,
and a loaf as black and hoary as his Harnesse: But the onely sport was to behold him
eat: for by reason his Helmet was on, and his Beaver lifted, he could put nothing into
his mouth himself, if others did not help him to finde the way; and therefore one of
those Ladies served his turn in that: but it was altogether impossible to give him drink
after that manner, and would have remained so for ever, if the Inn-keeper had not
boared a Cane, and setting the one end in his mouth, powred down the wine at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
all which he suffered most patiently, because he would not break the Ribbands
of his Helmet. And as he sate at Supper, there arrived by chance a Sow-gelder, who as
soon as he came to the Inn, did sound four or five times a whistle of Canes, the which
did confirm <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that he was in some famous Castle, where he was served
with Musick, and that the poor-John was Trouts; the Bread of the finest Flower;
the Whores, Ladies; and the Inn-keeper, Constable of the Castle; Wherefore he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
his resolution and departure from his own house very well imployed. But
that which did most afflict him, was, that he was not yet dubbed Knight, for as much
as he was fully perswaded, that he could not lawfully enterprize, or follow any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
untill he received the order of Knight-hoood.</p>

which being finished, he called for his Horse, and shutting the Stable
door very fast, he laid himself down upon his knees in it before him,
saying, I will never rise from the place where I am valourous
Knight, untill your courtesie shall grant unto me a Boone that I mean
to demand of you, the which will redound unto your renown, and
also to the profit of all humane kinde. The Inn-keeper seeing his ghest at his feet, and
hearing him speak those words, remained confounded beholding him, not knowing
<pb facs="tcp:54746:13"/>
what he might doe or say, and did studie and labour to make him arise: But all was in
vain, untill he must have promised unto him, that he would grant him any gift that
he sought at his hands. I did never expect lesse (replied <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> from your

of you, and that hath been granted unto me by your liberality, is, that to morrow in the

Chappell of your Castle, and in the morning, as I have said, the rest of my desires
shall be accomplished, that I may goe in due manner throughout the four parts of
the World, to seek Adventures, to the benefit of the needy, as is the duty of Knight-hood,
and of Knights Errant, as I am; whose desires are wholy inclined and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to such achievements. The Host, who, as we noted before, was a great giber,
and had before gathered some arguments of the defect of wit in his ghest, did wholy
now perswade himself that his suspicions were true, when he heard him speak in that
manner: and that he might have an occasion of laughter, he resolved to feed his
humor that night, and therefore answered him, that he had very great reason in that

many widowes, undoing certain maydens, and deceiving many Pupils, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
making himself known and famous in all the Tribunals and Courts almost of all
<hi>Spain,</hi> and that at last hee had retired himselfe to that his Castle, where hee was sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with his own and other mens goods, entertaining in it all Knights Errant, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
quality and condition they were; only for the great affection hee bore towards
them, and to the end they might divide with him part of their winnings in recompence
of his good-will; hee added besides, that there was no Chappell in his Castle, wherein
hee might watch his Armes, for hee had broken it down to build it up a new: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
hee knew very well, that in a case of necessitie they might lawfully bee
watched in any other place, and therefore hee might watch them that night in the base
Court of the Castle; for in the morning, an't pleased God, the Ceremonies requisite
should bee done in such sort as hee should remaine a dubbed Knight, in so good fashion
as in all the World hee could not bee bettered. Hee demanded of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee had any money? who answered that hee had not a blanck, for hee had never
read in any History of Knights Errant, that any one of them ever carried any money.
To this his Host replyed, that hee was deceived; for admit that Histories made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, because the Authors of them deemed it not necessary to expresse a thing so
manifest and needfull to bee carried as was money and clean shyrts, it was not therfore
to bee credited that they had none; and therefore hee should hold for most certain and
manifest, That all the Knights Errant, with the story of whose Acts so many Bookes
are replenished and heaped, had their purses well lined for that which might befall, and
did moreover cary with them a little Casket of oyntments and salves, to cure the
wounds which they received, for they had not the commodity of a Surgeon to cure
them, every time that they fought abroad in the fields and desarts, if they had not by
chance some wise Enchanter to their friend, who would presently succour them, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them, in some Cloud, through the Ayre, some Damzell or Dwarfe, with a
Viol of water of so great virtue, as tasting one drop thereof, they remained as whole
of their sores and wounds, as if they had never received any: But when they had not
that benefit, the Knights of times past held it for a very commendable and secure course
that their Squires should bee provided of money and other necessary things, as Lynt and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54746:13"/>
Oyntments for to cure themselves; and when it befell that the like Knights had no
Squires to attend upon them (which hapned but very seldom) then would they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cary all this provision behind them on their Horses, in some sleight and subtle
Wallets, which could scarce be perceived, as a thing of very great consequence. For, if
it were not upon such an occasion, the cariage of Wallets was not very tollerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Knights Errant. And in this respect hee did advise him, seeing hee might yet
command him, as one that by receiving the Order of Knighthood at his hands, should
very shortly become his God-childe, that hee should not travell from thence forward
without money and other the preventions he had then given unto him; and hee should
perceive himselfe how behoovefull they would prove unto him, when hee least expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Quixote</hi> promised to accomplish all that hee had counselled him to doe, with all
punctualitie; and so Order was forthwith given how hee should watch his Armes in a
great yard that lay neere unto one side of the Inne: Wherefore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all his Armes together, laid them on a Cistern that stood neer unto a Well: And
buckling on his Target hee laid hold on his Launce, and walked up and down before
the Cisterne very demurely, and when hee began to walke, the night likewise began to
lock up the splendor of the day. The In-keeper, in the mean season, recounted to all
the rest that lodged in the Inne, the folly of his Guest, the watching of his Armes, and
the Knighthood which hee expected to receive. They all admired very much at so
strange a kinde of folly, and went out to behold him from a far off, and saw that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he pranced too and fro with a quiet gesture, other times, leaning upon his Launce,
he looked upon his Armor, without beholding any other thing save his Armes for a
good space.</p>
                     <p>The night being shut up at last wholly, but with such cleerenesse of the Moone, as it
might well compare with his brightnesse that lent her her splendor; every thing which
our new Knight did, was easily perceived by all the beholders. In this season one of
the Carriers that lodged in the Inne resolved to water his Mules, and for that purpose
it was necessarie to remove <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Armour that lay on the Cistern; who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him approach, said unto him with a loud voice: O thou! whosoever thou beest,
bold Knight, that commest to touch the Armour of the most valorous Adventurer that
ever gyrded sword, looke well what thou dost, and touch them not, if thou meanest
not to leave thy life in payment of thy presumption. The Carrier made no account of
those words (but it were better hee had, for it would have redounded to his benefit)
but rather laying hold on the leatherings, threw the Armour a pretty way off from him
which being perceived by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hee lifted up his eyes towards heaven, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
his thoughts (as it seemed) to his <q>Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> hee said; Assist mee
deere Lady in this first dangerous affront and adventure offered to this breast, that is
enthralled to thee, and let not thy favor and protection faile mee in this my first
Traunce.</q> And uttering these and other such words, hee let slip his Target, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Launce with both hands, hee paid the Carrier so round a knock therewithall
on the Pate, as hee overthrew him to the ground in so evill taki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g, as if hee had secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it with another, hee should not have needed any Surgeon to cure him. This done
hee gathered up his Armour again, and laying them where they had-beene before,
hee walked after up and downe by them, with as much quietnesse as hee did at the
first.</p>
                     <p>But very soone after, another Carrier without knowing what had hapned (for his
companion lay yet in a Trance on the ground) came also to give his Mules water, and
coming to take away the Armes, that hee might free the Cistern of incumbrances, and
take water the easier: <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saying nothing, nor imploring favor of his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris
or any other, let slip again his Target, and lifting his Launce, without breaking of
it in peeces, made more then three of the second Carriers noddle; for hee broke it in
foure places. All the People of the Inne, and amongst them the Host likewise repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at this time to the noyse: which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiving, imbracing his Targe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
and laying hand on his sword, hee said: <q>O Lady of all Beauty, Courage and Vigour
<pb facs="tcp:54746:14"/>
of my weakened heart, it is now high time that thou doe convert the eyes of thy
greatnesse to this thy captive Knight, who doth expect so marveilous great an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
Saying thus, hee recovered as hee thought so great courage, that if all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
of the world had assayled him, hee would not goe one step backward. The woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
mens fellowes, seeing them so evill dight, from a far off began to raine stones on
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who did defend himself the best hee might with his Target, and durst
not depart from the Cistern, lest hee should seeme to abandon his Armes. The Inkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cryed to them to let him alone; for hee had already informed them that hee was
mad, and for such a one would scape scot free although hee had slain them all. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
likewise cryed out louder, terming them all disloyall men and traytors, and
that the Lord of the Castle was a treacherous and bad Knight, seeing that hee consented
that Knights Errant should be so basely used; and that if hee had not yet received the
<q>Order of Knighthood, hee would make him understand his treason, but of you base
and rascally Kenell (quoth he) I make no reckoning at all: throw at mee, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
draw neere, and doe mee all the hurt you may, for you shall ere long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the reward you shall carie for this your madnesse and outrage:</q> Which words
hee spoke with such great spirit and boldnesse, as hee stroke a terrible feare into all
those that assaulted him: and therefore moved both by it, and the Inkeepers perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they left oft throwing stones at him, and hee permitted them to carry away the
wounded men, and returned to the guard of his Armes, with as great quietnes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
as he did at the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The Inkeeper did not like very much these tricks of his Guest, and therefore hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to abbreviate, and give him the unfortunate Order of Knighthood forthwith,
before some other disaster befell: and with this resolution coming unto him, hee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself of the insolencies those base fellowes had used to him, without his privity or
consent, but their rashnesse, as hee said, remained well chastized: Hee added how he
had already told unto him, that there was no Chappel in his Castle, and that for what
yet rested unperfected of their intention, it was not necessarie, because the chiefe point
of remayning Knighted consisted chiefly in blowes of the neck and shoulders, as hee
had read in the ceremoniall Booke of the Order, and that, that might bee given in the
very midst of the fields; and that hee had already accomplished the obligation of
watching his Armes, which with only two houres watch might bee fullfilled; how
much more after having watched foure, as hee had done. All this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and therefore answered, That hee was most ready to obey him, and requested
him to conclude with all the brevity possible: for if hee saw himselfe Knighted, and
were once again assaulted, hee meant not to leave one person alive in all the Castle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those which the Constable should command, whom he would spare for his sake.</p>
                     <p>The Constable being thus advertised, and fearfull that hee would put this his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in execution, brought out a Booke presently, wherein hee was wont to write
downe the accounts of the straw and Barly which hee delivered from time to time, to
such Carriers as lodged in his Inne, for their Beasts: and with a But of a candle which
a boy held lighted in his hand before him, accompanied by the two Damzels above
mentioned, hee came to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whom hee commanded to kneele upon his
knees and reading in his <hi>Manual</hi> (as it seemed some devout Orison) hee held up his
hand in the midst of the Lecture, and gave him a good blow on the neck, and after
that gave him another trim thwack over the shoulders with his own sword (alwaies
murmuring somthing between the teeth, as if hee prayed) this being done, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
one of the Ladies to gyrd on his sword, which shee did with a singular good
grace and dexteritie, which was much, the matter being of it self so ridiculous, as it
wanted but little to make a man burst with laughter at every passage of the Ceremonies:
but the prowesse which they had already beheld in the new Knight, did lymit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their delight: At the gyrding on of his sword, the good Lady said, God make you a
fortunate Knight, and give you good successe in all your debates. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
then how shee was called, that hee might thence forward know to whom hee was
so much obleged for the favor received? and shee answered with great buxomnesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54746:14"/>
that shee was named <hi>Tolosa,</hi> and was a Butchers daughter of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that dwelt in
<hi>Sancho Benegas</hi> street, and that shee would ever honour him as her Lord, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
replied, requesting her, for his sake, to call her selfe from thence forth the Lady <hi>Tolosa</hi>
which shee promised to perform. The other Lady buckled on his Spur, with whom he
had the very like conference, and asking her name, shee told him shee was called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linera,</hi>
and was daughter to an honest Miller of <hi>Antequera:</hi> her likewise our Knight
intreated to call her selfe the Lady <hi>Molinera,</hi> proferring her new services and favours.
The new and never seen before Ceremonies being thus speedily finished, as it seemed
with a gallop, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could not rest untill hee was mounted on horseback, that
hee might goe to seeke Adventures; wherefore causing <hi>Rozinante</hi> to bee instantly sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
hee leaped on him, and imbracing his Hoste, hee said unto him such strange things,
gratifying the favor hee had done him in dubbing him Knight, as it is impossible to hit
upon the manner of recounting them right. The Inkeeper that hee might bee quickly
rid of him, did answere his words with others no lesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

issued out of the Inne, so content, lively and jocund to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
himself Knighted, as his very horse gyrts were ready to burst for
joy: but calling to memory the Counsels that his Hoste had given
him, touching the most needfull implements that hee was ever to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
about him, of money and clean shirts, hee determined to returne
to his House, and to provide himself of them, and also of a Squire: making account
to entertain a certain labourer, his neighbour, who was poore and had children, but
yet one very fit for this purpose and Squirely function, belonging to Knighthood. With
this determination hee turned <hi>Rozinante</hi> towards the way of his owne Village, who
knowing, in a manner, his will, began to trot on with so good a pace, as hee seemed
not to touch the ground. Hee had not travelled far, when he thought that hee heard
certain weake and delicate cries, like to those of one that complained, to issue out from
the thickest of a Wood that stood on the right hand. And scarce had hee heard them
when hee said: <q>I render infinite thanks to heaven for the favour it doth mee, by
proferring mee so soone occasion wherein I may accomplish the duty of my professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and gather the fruits of my good desires: these Plaints doubtlesly bee of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
man or woman, who needeth my favour and ayd.</q> Then turning the reynes,
hee guided <hi>Rozinante</hi> towards the place from whence hee thought the complaints sally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and within a few paces after he had entred into the thicket, hee saw a Mare tyed
unto an <hi>Holme Oake,</hi> and to another was tyed a young youth all naked from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
upward, of about the age of fifteen yeeres, and was hee that cried so pittifully: and
not without cause, for a certain Countryman of comly personage did whip him with a
gyrdle, and accompanied every blow with a reprehension and counsell, for hee said;
The tongue must peace, and the Eyes bee warie: and the boy answered I will never do
it again, good Master; for the passion of God, I will never doe it again. And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to have more care of your things from henceforth.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> viewing all that passed, said with an angry voice: <q>Discourteous
<pb facs="tcp:54746:15"/>
Knight, it is very uncomly to see thee deale thus with one that cannot defend himself,
mount therfore on horseback and take thy Launce (for the Farmer had also a Launce
leaning to the very same tree whereunto his Mare was tyed) for I will make thee
know that it is the use of Cowards to doe that which thou doest.</q> The other behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such an Antick to hover over him, all laden with Armes, and brandishing of his
Launce towards his face, made full account that hee should bee slaine, and therefore
hee answered with very milde and submissive words saying, Sir Knight, the boy which I
chastise is mine own servant, and keepeth for mee a slock of sheep in this Commarke;
who is grown so neglignet, as hee loseth one of them every other day, and because I
correct him for his carelessenesse and knavery, hee sayes I doe it through covetousnesse
and pinching, as meaning to defraud him of his wages; but before God, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
hee belies me. <q>What? the Lie in my presence rascally Clown? quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
by the Sun that shines on us, I am about to run thee through and through
with my Launce base Carle; pay him instantly without more replying, or else by that
God which doth mannage our sublunar affairs, I will conclude thee, and annihilate
thee in moment; loose him forthwith.</q> The Countreyman hanging downe of his
head, made no reply, but loosed his servant; of whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanded how
much did his Master owe unto him? hee said nine Moneths hire, at seven Reals a
Moneth. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made then the account, and found that all amounted to sixty
one Reals, and therefore commanded the Farmer to pay the money presently, if hee
meaned not to die for it. The fearfull Countryman answered, That by the Trance
wherein hee was then, and by the Oath hee had made (which was none at all, for hee
swoar not) that hee ought not so much; for there should bee deducted out of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
three paire of shoes hee had given unto him, and a Reall for twice letting him
blood, being sick. All is well, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but let the price of the shoes and

is no Knight, nor did ever receive any Order of Knighthood, for hee is <hi>Iohn Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dudo</hi>

for there may bee Knights of the <hi>Haldudos:</hi> and what is more, every one is son
of his workes. That's true, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> but of what workes can this my Master be
sonne? seeing hee denies mee my wages, and my sweat and labour? I doe not deny
thy wages, friend <hi>Andrew,</hi> quoth his Master; doe mee but the pleasure to come with
mee, and I sweare by all the Orders of Knighthood that are in the World, to pay thee
as I have said, one Reall upon another, yea and those also perfumed. <q>For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming
I thanke thee, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> give it him in Reals, and with that I will
rest satisfied; and see that thou fullfillest it as thou hast sworn: if not, I sweare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to thee by the same Oath to return and search thee, and chastise thee, and I will
finde thee out, though thou shouldst hide thy self better then a <hi>Lizard;</hi> and if thou
desirest to note who commands thee this, that thou maist remaine more firmly oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to accomplish it, know that I am the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi>
the righter of wrongs and undoer of injuries, and so farewell: and doe not forget
what thou hast promised and sworn, on paine of the paines already pronounced.</q> And
saying these words, hee spurred <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and in short space was got far off from them.
The Countryman pursued him with his eye, and perceiving that hee was past the wood,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54746:15"/>
and quite out of sight, hee returned to his man <hi>Andrew,</hi> and said to him, come to me
childe, for I will pay thee what I owe thee; as that righter of wrongs hath left mee
commanded. That I sweare, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> and you shall deale discreetly in fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that good Knights commandement, who I pray God may live a thousand yeeres;
for seeing hee is so valorous and so just a judge, I sweare by <hi>Rocque,</hi> that if you pay mee
not, hee shall return and execute what hee promised. I also doe sweare the same,
quoth the Farmer, but in respect of the great affection I beare unto thee, I will aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the debt, to increase the payment; and catching the youth by the arme, hee tyed
him again to the Oake, where hee gave him so many blowes as hee left him for dead;
call now master <hi>Andrew</hi> (quoth hee) for the righter of wrongs, and thou shalt see
that hee cannot undoe this, although I beleeve it is not yet ended to bee done; for I
have yet a desire to flea thee alive, as thou didst thy selfe feare: Notwithstanding all
these threats, hee untied him at last, and gave him leave to goe seeke out his Judge, to
the end hee might execute the Sentence pronounced. <hi>Andrew</hi> departed somewhat
discontent, swearing to search for the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
unto him, word for word, all that had past, and that hee should pay the abuse
with usury: but for all his threats hee departed weeping, and his Master remayned
behinde laughing; and in this manner the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> redressed that
wrong.</p>
                     <p>Who glad above measure for his successe, accounting himself to have given a most
noble beginning to his feats of Armes, did travell towards his Village, with very great
satisfaction of himself, and said in a low tune these words following: <q>Well maist
thou call thy self happy above all other women of the earth, O! above all Beauties
beautifull <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> since thy good fortune was such, to hold subject and

Order of Knighthood but yesterday, and hath destroyed to day the greatest outrage
and wrong that want of reason could forme, or cruelty commit. To day did he take

the reines to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> subjecting his will to that of his horse, who presently pursued

and was withall very discreet, said unto him, Sir Knight, wee doe not know
that good Lady of whom you speake: shew her therefore to us, and if shee bee so
beautifull as you affirm, wee will willingly and without any compulsion confesse the
truth which you now demand of us. If I did shew her to you, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
what masterie were it then for you to acknowledge a truth so notorious? The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of mine affaires consists in this, that without beholding her, you doe beleeve,
confesse, affirm, sweare and defend it; which if you refuse to perform, I challenge
you all to Battell, proud and unreasonable folke, and whether you come one by one
(as the order of Knighthood requires) or all at once, as is the custome and dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
practise of men of your broode, here will I expect and await you all, trusting in
the reason which I have on my side, Sir Knight, replied the Merchant, I request you
in all these Princes names, as many as wee bee here, that to the end wee may not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our Consciences, confessing a thing which wee never beheld nor heard, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being so prejudiciall to the Empresses and Queenes of the Kingdomes of <hi>Alcarria</hi>
and <hi>Estremadura,</hi> you will please to shew us some portraiture of that Lady, although
it be no biger then a grain of Wheat: for by one threed we may judge of the whole
olew, and we will with this favor rest secure and satisfied, and you likewise remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and appaid. And I doe believe moreover, that we are already so inclined to your
side, that although her picture shewed her to bee blinde of the one eye, and at the other
that she ran fire and brimstone; yet would we notwithstanding, to please you, say in
her favour all that you listed. There drops not base Scoundrels, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
all inflamed with choller; there drops not, I say, from her that which thou say'st, but
Amber and Civet among bombase: and she is not blinde of an eye, or crook-back'd;
but is straighter then a spindle of <hi>Guadarama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And saying so, he abased his La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

anger, as if good fortune had not so ordained it, that <hi>Rozinante</hi> should stumble, and
fall in the mid'st of the Carriere, it had gone very ill with the bold Merchant. <hi>Rozinante</hi>
fell in fine, and his Master reeled over a good peece of the field; and though hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to rise, yet was he never able, he was so encombred by his Launce, Target,
Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to arise, and could not, he cried, Flie not cowardly Folk, abide base people, abide; for
I lye not here through mine own fault, but through the defect of my horse.</p>
                     <p>One of the Lacquies that came in the company, and seemed to be a man of none of
the best intentions, hearing the poor overthrown Knight speak such insolent words,
could not forbear them without returning him an answer on his ribbs; and with that
intention approaching to him, he took his Launce, and after he had broken it in peeces,
he gave <hi>Don Quixote</hi> so many blows with one of them, that in despite of his Armor
he threshed him sike a shea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to beat him so much, but that he should leave him: But all would not serve, for the
youth was angry, and would not leave off the play, until he had avoyded the rest of his

them all on the miserable fallen Knight; who, for all the tempest of blows that rained
on him, did never shut his mouth, but threatned heaven and earth, and those <hi>[Malan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and the Merchants followed on their way, carrying with them occasion enough of talk
of the poor belaboured Knight; who, when he saw himself alone, turned again to make
tryall whether he might arise: but if he could not doe it when he was whole and
sound, how was it possible he being so bruised and almost destroyed? And yet he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
himself very happie, preswading himself that his disgrace was proper and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to Knights Errant, and did attribute all to the fault of his horse, and could in no

recourse to his ordinary remedy, which was to think on some passage
of his Histories; and in the instant his folly presented to his memory
that of <hi>Valdovinos,</hi> and the Marquesse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> then when <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loto</hi>
had left him wounded in the Mountain. A History known by
children, not hidden to youg men, much celebrated, yea, and believed
by many old men; and is yet for all that no more authenticall then
are <hi>Mahomets</hi> Miracles. This History, as it seemed to him, was most fit for the trance
wherein he was; and therefore he began, with signes of great pain, to tumble up and
down, and pronounce with a languishing breath the same that they feign the wounded
Knight to have said in the wood:
<q>
                           <l>Where art thou Lady deer! that griev'st not at my smart?</l>
                           <l>Or thou do'st it not know; or thou disloyall art.</l>
                        </q>
And after this manner he did prosecute the old song, untill these verses that say: <hi>O noble
Marquesse of</hi> Mantua, <hi>my carnall Lord and Vncle.</hi> And it befell by chance, that at the
very same time there past by the place where he lay a man of his own Village, who was
his neighbour, and returned after having carried a loaf of wheat to the Mill; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
a man stretched on the ground, he came over to him, and demanded what hee
was, and what was it that caused him to complain so dolefully? <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did
verily belive that it was his Uncle, the Marquesse of <hi>Mantua;</hi> and so gave him no
other answer, but only followed on in the repetition of his old Romance, wherein he
gave him account of his misfortune, and of the love the Emperours son bore to his
Spouse, all in the very same manner that the Ballad recounts it. The laborer remained
much astonished, hearing those follies. And taking off his Vizard, which with the
Lacquies blows was broken all to peeces, he wiped his face that was full of dust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and
scarce had he done it when he knew him, to whom he said; Master <hi>Quixada</hi> (for so
he was probably called when he had his wits, before he left the state of a staid Yeoman,
to become a wandring Knight) who hath used you after this mannner? But he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Romance, answering out of it, to every question that was put to him. Which the
good man perceiving, disarmed him the best he could, to see whether he had any wound,
but he could see no blood, or any token on him of hurt. Afterward he endeavoured
to raise him from the ground, which he did at the last with much adoe; and mounted
him on his Asse, as a Beast of easiest carriage. He gathered then together all his Arms,
and left not behinde so much as the splinters of the Launce, and tied them altogether
upon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> whom he took by the bridle, and the Asse by his halter, and led them
both in that equipage fair and easily towards his Village, being very pensative to hear
the follies that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> spoak. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was no lesse melancholy, who
was so beaten and bruised, as he could hardly hold himself upon the Asse; and ever and
anon he breathed forth such grievons sighs, as he seemed to fix them in Heaven; which
moved his neighbour to intreat him again to declare unto him the cause of his grief.
And it seems none other, but that the very Devill himself did call to his memorie, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
accommodated to his successes. For in that instant, wholy forgeting <hi>Valdovinos</hi>
he remembred the Moor <hi>Abindaraez</hi> then, when the Constable of <hi>Antequera Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Narvaez</hi> had taken him, and carried him prisoner to his Castle. So that when his
<pb facs="tcp:54746:17"/>
neighbour turned again to aske of him how hee did, and what ailed him; he answered
the very same words and speech that Captive <hi>Abencerrase</hi> said to <hi>Narvaez,</hi> just as hee
had read them in <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemayor,</hi> where the History is written; applying it so
properly to his purpose, that the labourer grew almost mad for anger to heare that
Machina of follies; by which hee collected that his neighbour was distracted, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee hied as fast as possible hee could to the Village, that so hee might free himself
from the vexation that <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> idle and prolixe discourse gave unto him. At
the end whereof the Knight said, <hi>Don Rodericke</hi> of <hi>Narvaez:</hi> You shall understand
that this beautifull <hi>Xarifa,</hi> of whom I spoak, is now the faire <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso;</hi> for
whom I have done, I doe, and will doe such famous acts of Knighthood as ever have
beene, are, and shall be seen in all the World. To this his neighbour answered, doe
not you perceive Sir, sinner that I am, how I am neyther <hi>Don Roderick de Narvaez,</hi>
nor the Marquesse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but <hi>Peter Alonso</hi> your neighbour; nor are you
<hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovinos,</hi>
nor <hi>Abindaraez,</hi> but the honourable yeoman Master <hi>Quixada.</hi> I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

whom I have named, but also all the twelve Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> yea and the nine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies;
since mine Acts shall surpasse all those that ever they did together, or every one
of them apart.</p>
                     <p>With these and such other discourses they arived at last at their Village about Sun-set,
but the labourer awayted untill it waxed somwhat darke, because folke should not view
the Knight so simply mounted. And when hee saw his time he entred into the Towne,
and went to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> house, which hee found full of confusion. There was the
Curate &amp; the Barbar of the Village, both of them <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> great friends: to whom
the old woman of the house said in a lamentable manner; What doe you think Master
Licentiate <hi>Pere Perez</hi> (for so the Curate was called) of my Masters misfortune?
These six dayes neyther hee nor his horse have appeared, nor the Target, Launce or
Armour, unfortunate woman that I am, I doe suspect, and I am as sure it is true as
that I shall die; how those accursed Books of Knighthood which hee hath, and is wont
to reade ordinarily, have turned his judgement; for now I remember that I have heard
him say often times, speaking to himself, that hee would become a Knight Errant, and
goe seeke Adventures throughout the World. Let such Books bee recommended to
<hi>Sathan</hi> and <hi>Barrabas,</hi> which have destroyed in this sort the most delicate understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all the <hi>Mancha.</hi> His Niese affirmed the same, and did add, moreover you shall
understand good Master <hi>Nicholus</hi> (for so hight the Barbar) that it many times befell
my Uncle to continue the Lecture of those unhappy Books of disventures two dayes
and two nights together. At the end of which, throwing the book away from him, he
would lay hand on his Sword, and would fall a slashing of the walls, and when hee
were wearied, hee would say that hee had slain foure Giants as great as foure Towres,
and the sweat that dropped down, through the labour hee tooke, hee would say was
blood that gushed out of those wounds which hee had received in the conflict, and then
would hee quaffe off a great pot full of cold water, and straight hee did become whole
and quiet; saying, that water was a most precious drinke, which the wise man <hi>Esquife,</hi>
a great Enchanter or Sorcerer, and his friend, had brought unto him. But I am in the
fault of all this, who never advertis'd you both of mine Uncles raving, to the end you
might have redrest it ere it came to these termes, and burnt all those Excommunicate
Books; for hee had many that deserved the Fire as much as if they were Hereticall.
That doe I likewise affirme, quoth Master Curate, and in soothe to morrow shall not
passe over us, without making a publique Processe against them, and condemn them to
bee burned in the Fire, that they may not minister occasion again to such as may read
them, to doe that which I feare my good friend hath done.</p>
                     <p>The Labourer and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood hearing all that which was said, and then hee
perfectly found the disease of his neighbour, and therefore he began to crie aloud; Open
the doores to Lord <hi>Valdovinos,</hi> and to the Lord Marquesse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who comes very
sore wounded and hurt, and to the Lord Moore <hi>Abindaraez,</hi> whom the valorous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke
of Narvaez</hi> Constable of <hi>Antequera</hi> brings as his Prisoner. All the houshould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54746:17"/>
ran out, hearing these cries, and some knowing their friend, the others their Master
and Uncle, who had not yet alighted from the Asse, because he was not able, they ran
to embrace him, but he forbad them, saying stand still and touch me not, for I returne
very sore wounded and hurt, through default of my horse, carie me to my bed, and if
it be possible send for the wise <hi>Viganda,</hi> that she may cure and looke to my hurt. See
in an ill houre (quoth the old woman straight way) if my heart did not very well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
me on which foote my Master halted; come up in good time, for we shall know
how to cure you well enough without sending for that <hi>Viganda</hi> you have mentioned;
Accursed say I, once again, and a hundred times accursed may those bookes of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
be, which have brought you to such a state: With that they bore him up to his
bed, and searching for his wounds could not finde any, and then hee said all was but
bruising, by reason of a great fall hee had with his horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> as hee fought with
ten Giants, the most unmeasurable and boldest that might bee found in a great part of
the Earth. Hearken quoth the Curate, wee have also Giants in the dance: by mine
honesty I will burne them all before to morrow at night. Then did they aske a thousand
questions of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but hee would answere to none of them, and only reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
them to give him some meate and suffer him to sleep, seeing rest was most behoove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for him. All which was done, and the Curate informed himself at large of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
man, in what sort hee had found <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> which hee recounted to him,
and also the follies hee said, both at his finding and bringing to Towne; which did kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
more earnestly the Licentiates desire to doe what hee had resolved the next day;
which was to call his friend the Barber M. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> with whom hee came to <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xotes</hi> House.</p>

the only authors of his harme; which the Gentlemans Niese
gave unto him very willingly: All of them entred into it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest the old woman, wherein they found more then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
great Volumes, and those very well bound, beside the small
ones. And as soone as the old woman had seene them, shee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very hastily out of the chamber, and eftsoones returned with as
great speed, with a holy-water pot and a sprinkler in her hand, and said; Hold Master
Licentiate and sprinkle this chamber all about, lest there should lurke in it some one

penalties wee meane to inflict on these Bookes, by banishing them out of this world.
The simplicitie of the good old woman caused the Licentiat to laugh: who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Barber to fetch him down the Books from their shelves, one by one, that hee
might peruse their Arguments; for it might happen some to bee found, which in no
fort deserved to bee chastised with Fire. No, replyed the Niese, no; you ought not
to pardon any of them, seeing they have all beene offenders; it is better you throw
them all into the base Court, and there make a pile of them, and then set them a Fire;
if not, they may bee carried into the yard, and there make a bon-fire of them, and the
smoak will offend no body; the old woman said as much, both of them thirsted so
much for the death of these Innocents, but the Curate would not condiscend thereto,
untill he had first read the Titles, at the lest, of every booke.</p>
                     <p>The first that Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> put into his hands, was that of <hi>Amadis of Gaule;</hi>
which the Curate perusing a while, this comes not to mee first of all others without

some mystery: for as I have heard told, this is the first Book of Knighthood that ever was
printed in <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the others have had their beginning and originall from this;
and therefore methinks that we must condemn him to the fire, without all remission,
as the <hi>Dogmatizer</hi> and head of so bad a Sect. Not so, fie quoth the Barber, for I have
heard that it is the very best contrived book of all those of that kinde; and therefore
he is to be pardoned, as the only compleat one of his profession. That is true replied
the Curate, and for that reason we doe give him his life for this time. Let us see that
other which lyes next unto him. It is, quoth the Barber, <hi>The [Las S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Adventure of Splandian Amadis of Gaules</hi> lawfully begotten son: Yet on mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
replyed the Curate, his fathers goodnesse shall nothing avail him, take this book
old Masters and open the window, throw it down into the yard, and let it lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our heap for the fire we mean to make. She did what was commanded with
great alacrity, and so the good <hi>Splandian</hi> fled into the yard, to expect with all patience
the fire, which he was threatned to abide. Forward quoth the Curate. This that comes
now, said the Barber, is <hi>Amadis of Greece;</hi> and as I conjecture, all those that lye on
this side are of the same linage of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Then let them goe all to the yard, quoth
the Curate, in exchange of burning Queen <hi>Pintiquinestra,</hi> and the Sheepheard <hi>Darinel,</hi>
with his Eglogues, and the subtle and intricate Discourses of the Author, which are
able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o intangle the father that ingendred me, if he went in form of a Knight Errant.
I am of the same opinion, quoth the Barber: And I also, said the Niese. Then since it is
so, quoth the old wife, let them come, and to the yard with them all. They were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
all up unto her, which were many in number: wherefore, to save a labour of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down the stairs, she threw them out at the window.</p>
                     <p>What bundle is that, quoth the Curate? This is, answered Master <hi>Nicholas, Don
Olivante of Laura.</hi> The authour of that booke, quoth the Curate composed likewise
<hi>The Garden of flowers,</hi> and in good sooth I can scarce resolve which of the two works is
truest, or to speake better, is lesse lying: onely this much I can determine; that this
must goe to the yard, being a booke foolish and arrogant. This that followes is <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismarte</hi>
of <hi>Hircania,</hi> quoth the Barber. Is Lord <hi>Florismarte</hi> there? then replyed the
Curate; then by mine honesty he shall briefly make his arrest in the yard, in despight of
his wonderfull birth and famous Adventures; for the drouth and harshnesse of his stile
deserves no greater favour. To the yard with him, and this other (good Masters.)
with a very good will, quoth old <hi>Mumpsimus;</hi> and streight way did execute his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
with no small gladnesse. This is <hi>Platyr</hi> (quoth the Barber.) It is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
book replyed the Curate, wherin I finde nothing meriting pardon; let him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reply, keep company with the rest. Forthwith it was done. Then was another
book opened, and they saw the title thereof to be <hi>The Knight of the Crosse.</hi> For the
holy title which this book beareth, quoth the Curate, his ignorance might be pardoned:
but it is a common saying, <hi>The Devill lurks behinde the Crosse:</hi> wherefore let it goe to
the fire. The Barber taking another book, said; This is <hi>The Mirror of Knighthood.</hi>
I know his worship well, quoth the Curate. There goes among those books, I see, the
<hi>Lord Raynold of Montalban</hi> with his friends and companions, all of them greater
Theeves then <hi>Cacus, [A Theefe that used to steal Cattell, and pull them backward, by the
tayles, that none might trace them]</hi> and the twelve Peers of France, with the Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Turpin.</hi> I am in truth about to condemn them only to exile, for as much as they
contain some part of the famous Poet <hi>Matthew Boyardo</hi> his invention. Out of which
the Christian Poet <hi>Lodovick Ariosto</hi> did likewise weave his work, which if I can finde
among these, and that he speaks not his own native tongue, I'le use him with no respect;
but if he talk in his own language, I will put him, for honours sake, on my head. If that
be so, quoth the Barber, I have him at home in the Italian, but cannot understand him.
Neither were it good you should understand him, replyed the Curate; and here we
would willingly have excused the good Captain that translated it into Spanish, from
that labour, or bringing it into <hi>Spain,</hi> if it had pleased himself. For he hath deprived it
of much naturall worth in the translation; a fault incident to all those that presume
to translate Verses out of one language into another: for, though they imploy all their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54746:18"/>
industry and wit therein, they can never arive to the height of that Primitive conceit,
which they bring with them in their first byrth. I say therefore that this booke, and all
the others that may bee found in this Library, to treate of French affaires, bee cast and
deposited in some drie Vault, untill wee may determine with more deliberation, what
wee should doe with them: alwaies excepting <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> which must bee
there amongst the rest, and another called <hi>Roncesualles;</hi> for these two coming to my
hands, shall bee rendred up to those of the old guardian, and from hers into the fires,
without any remission. All which was confirmed by the Barbar, who did ratifie his
Sentence, holding it for good and discreete, because hee knew the Curate to bee so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
a man, and so great a friend of the truth, as he would say nothing contrary to it
for all the goods of the world.</p>
                     <p>And then opening another booke, he saw it was <hi>Palmerin de Oliva,</hi> neere unto which
stood another, intituled <hi>Palmerin of England:</hi> which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>icenciat perceiving, said let
<hi>Oliva</hi> be presently rent in pieces, and burned in such sort, that even the very ashes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may not be found: and let <hi>Palmerin of England</hi> be preserved, as a thing rarely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable,
and let such another box as that which <hi>Alexander</hi> found among <hi>Darius</hi> spoyls,
and depured to keep <hi>Homers</hi> works, be made for it: for gossip this booke hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
authority for two reasons; the first, because of it self it is very good and excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrived; the other, for as much as the report runnes, that a certain discreet King
of <hi>Portugal</hi> was the author thereof. All the Adventures of the Castle of <hi>Miraguarda,</hi>
are excellent and artificiall. The discourses very cleere and courtly, observing ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
a <hi>decorum</hi> in him that speaks, with great propriety and conceit, therefore I say
Master <hi>Nicholas,</hi> if you think good, this and <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> may bee preserved from
the fire; and let all the rest without farther search or regard perish. In the devills
name doe not so, gentle gossip (replyed the Barbar) for this which I hold now in my
hand is the famous <hi>Don Belianis:</hi> What hee? quoth the Curate, the second, third and
fourth part thereof have great neede of some <hi>Ruybarbe</hi> to purge his excessive choller,
and wee must moreover take out of him all that of the <hi>Castell of Fame,</hi> and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
of more consequence. Therefore wee give them a <hi>terminus Vltramarinus,</hi>
and as they shall bee corrected, so will wee use Mercy or justice towards them; and in
the meane space Gossip, you may keepe them at your house, but permit no man to
read them. I am pleased, quoth the Barbar, and being unwilling to tyre himself any
more by reading of Titles, hee bad the old woman to take all the great volumes, and
throw them into the yard; the words were not spoken to a Mome or deaf person, but
to one that had more desire to burn them then to weave a peace of Linnen, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great and fine; and therefore taking eight of them together, shee threw them all
out of the window, and returning the second time, thinking to carry away a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at once, one of them fell at the Barbers feet, who desirous to know the Title, saw
that it was the Historie of the famous Knight <hi>Tirante the white.</hi> Good God, quoth
the Curate with a loud voice, is <hi>Tirante the white</hi> here? Give mee it Gossip, for I
make account to find in it a Treasure of delight. and a copious Mine of pastime. Here is
<hi>Don Quireleison of Montalban,</hi> a valiant Knight, and his brother <hi>Thomas of Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
and the Knight <hi>Fonseca,</hi> and the combat which the valiant <hi>Detriante</hi> fought with
<hi>Alano,</hi> and the witty conceits of the damzell <hi>Plazerdeminida,</hi> with the love and
guiles of the widow <hi>Reposada,</hi> and of the Empresse enamoured on her Squire <hi>Ipolite.</hi> I
say unto you gossip, that this booke is for the stile, one of the best of the world; in it
Knights doe eate and drinke and sleepe, and die in their beds naturally, and make their
testaments before their death; with many other things, which all other bookes of this
subject doe want, yet notwithstanding, if I might bee Judge, the Author thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
because hee purposely penned and writ so many follies, to bee sent to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
for all the dayes of his life. Carie it home and read it, and you shall see all
that I have said thereof to bee true. I beleeve it very well, quoth the Barber. But what
shall wee doe with these little bookes that remaine? These as I take, said the Curate
are not bookes of Knighthood, but of Poetry; and opening one, hee perceived it was
<hi>The Diana of Montemayor,</hi> and beleeving that all the rest were of that stampe, hee said,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:19"/>
these deserve not to bee burned with the rest, for they have not, nor can doe so much
hurt as bookes of Knighthood, being all of them works full of understanding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and doe not prejudice any other. O good Sir, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his Niese,
your reverence shall likewise doe well to have them also burned, lest that mine Uncle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

becomming a Sheepheard, and so wander through the woods and fields, singing of
Rounde layes; and playing on a Crowd; and what is more dangerous then to become a
Poet? which is as some say, an incurable and infectious disease. This maiden saies true,
quoth the Curate, and it will not bee amisse to remove this stumbling block and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of our friends way; and since wee begin with the <hi>Diana of Montemayor,</hi> I am
of opinion that it bee not burned, but only that all that which treates of the wise <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
and of the inchanted water bee taken away, and also all the longer verses, and let
him remaine with his Proses, and the honour of being the best of that kinde. This that
followes, quoth the Barber, is the <hi>Diana</hi> called the second, written by him of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi>
and this other is of the same name, whose Author is <hi>Gil Polo.</hi> Let that of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca</hi>

the Curate, they would have beene more esteemed. It is necessary that this book
bee carded and purged of certain base things, that lurke among his high conceits. Let
Him bee kept, both because the Author is my very great friend, and in regard of other
more Heroicall and lost in works hee hath written. This is, said the Barber, <hi>The ditty
booke of Lopez Maldonad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> The Author of that worke is likewise my great friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Parson, and his lines pronounced by himselfe doe ravish the hearers, and such
is the sweetnesse of his voice when hee sings them, as it doth enchant the eare. Hee is
somwhat prolix in his <hi>Eglogues,</hi> but that which is good, is never superfluous; let him
bee kept among the choysest. But what booke is that which lies next unto him? <hi>The
Galatea of Michael Cervantes</hi> quoth the Barber. That <hi>Cervantes,</hi> said the Curate, is
my old acquaintance this many a yeere, and I know hee is more practised in misfortunes
then in verses: His booke hath some good invention in it, hee intends and propounds
somwhat, but concludes nothing; therefore wee must expect the second Part, which
hee hath promised, perhaps his amendment may obtaine him a generall remission, which
until now is denied him; and whilest we expect the sight of his second work, keep this
part closely imprisoned in your lodging. I am very well content to do so, good Gossip,
said the Barber; and here there come three together, <hi>The Auracana of Don Alonso
de Ercilla, The Austriada of Iohn Ruffo,</hi> one of the Magistrates of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and <hi>The
Monserrato of Christopher de Virnes,</hi> a <hi>Valentian</hi> Poet. All these three books, quoth the
Curate, are the best that are written in heroicall verse in the <hi>Castilian</hi> tongue, and may
compare with the most famous of <hi>Italy:</hi> reserve them as the richest pawns that <hi>Spain</hi>
enjoyeth of Poetry. The Curate with this grew weary to see so many books, and so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54746:19"/>
he would have all the rest burned at all adventures. But the Barber ere the Sentence
was given had opened by chance one entituled <hi>The Tears of Angelica.</hi> I would have
shed those tears my self, said the Curate, if I had wittingly caused such a book to bee
burned; for the Author thereof, was one of the most famous Poets of the World, not

Here, here valourous Knights, here it is needfull that you
shew the force of your valiant armes; for the Courtiers begin to
bear away the best of the Tourney. The folk repairing to this
rumour and noyse, was an occasion, that any farther speech and
visitation of the books was omitted; and therefore it is to be
suspected, that <hi>The Ca<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

Emperor <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> written by <hi>Don Luis de Avila,</hi> were
burned, without being ever seen or heard; and perhaps if the Curate had seen them,
they should not have pas'd under so rigorous a sentence. When they all arrived to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
his Chamber he was risen already, out of his Bed, and continued still his out-cries,
cutting and flashing on every side, being as b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>dly awake, as if he never had
slept. Wherefore, taking him in their arms, they returned him by main force into his
Bed, and after he was somewhat quiet and setled, he said turning himself to the Curate,
In good sooth Lord Archbishop <hi>Turpin,</hi> it is a great dishonor to us that are called the
twelve Peers, to permit the Knights of the Court to bear thus away the glory of the
Tournay without more adoe; seeing that we the Adventures have gained the prize
thereof the three formost dayes. Hold your peace good Gossip, quoth the Curate, for
fortune may be pleased to change the successe; &amp; what is lost to day, may be wonn again
to morrow: Look you to your health for the present; for you seem at least to be
very much tyred, if besides, you be not sore wounded. Wounded, no, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote!</hi>
but doubtless I am somewhat bruised: for that Bastard <hi>Don Rowland</hi> hath
beaten me to powder with the stock of an Oake-tree; and all for envy, because he sees
that I only dare oppose my self to his valour: But let me be never again called <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold
of Montealban,</hi> if he pay not deerly for it, as soon as I rise from this Bed, in despite
of all his inchantment. But I pray you call for my breakfast, for I know it will doe me
much good, and have the revenge of this wrong to my charge. Presently meat was
brought; and after he had eaten he fell a sleep, and they remained astonished at his
wonderfull madnesse. That night the old woman burned all the books that she found
in the house and yard; and some there were burned, that deserved, for their worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to be kept up in everlasting Treasuries, if their fortunes and the lazinesse of the
Searchers had permitted it. And so the proverb was verrified in them, That the Just
payes sometimes for the Sinners. One of the remedies which the Curate and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
prescribed for that present, to help their friends Disease, was, that they should
change his Chamber, and dam up his Study, to the end, that when he arose, he might
not finde them: for perhaps by removing the cause, they might also take away the
effects: And moreover, they bad them to say, that a certain Inchanter had carried them
away, studie and all; which device was presently put in practise. And within two dayes
after, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> got up, and the first thing he did, was to goe and visit his books;
and seeing he could not finde the Chamber in the same place where he had left it, hee
<pb facs="tcp:54746:20"/>
went up and down to finde it. Sometimes he came to the place where the door stood,
and felt it with his hands, and then would turn his eyes up and down here and there to
seek it, without speaking a word. But at last after deliberation, he asked of the old
woman, the way to his books? She as one well-schooled before what she should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
said, What Study? or what nothing is this you look for? There is now no more
Study nor books in this house; for the very Divell himself carried all away with him.
It was not the Divell, said his Niese, but an Inchanter that came here one night upon a
cloud, the day after you departed from hence; and alighting down from a Serpent,
upon which he rode, he entred into the study, and what he did therein I know not; and
within a while after he fled out at the roof of the house, and left all the house full of
smoak: And when we accorded to see what he had done, we could neither see Book or
Studie: only this much the old woman. And I doe remember very well, that the
naughty old man at his departure said, with a loud voyce, that he for hidden enmity
that he bore to the Lord of those books had done all the harme to the house that they
might perceive when he were departed, and added that he was named the wise <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aton
Frestron,</hi> you would have said, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I know not, quoth the old
woman, whether he height <hi>Frestron</hi> or <hi>Friton,</hi> but well I wot, that his name ended with
<hi>Ton.</hi> That is true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and he is a very wise Inchanter, and my great
adversary, and looks on me with a sinister eye; for he knows by his Art and Science,
that I shall in time fight a single combat with a Knight, his very great friend, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him in battell, without being able to be by him assisted, and therefore he labours
to doe me all the hurt he may: and I have sent him word, that he strives in vain to
divert or shun that, which is by heaven already decreed. Who doubts of that, quoth
his Niese? But I pray you good Unkle say; what need have you to thrust your self
into these difficulties and brabbles? were it not better to rest you quietly in your own
house, then to wander through the world, searching bread of <hi>[Buscardo pan de Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strigo
p. 47.)</hi> blasted corn? without once considering, how many there goe to seek for
wooll, that return again shorn themselves. O Niese! quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how ill
doest thou understand the matter? before I permit my self to be shorn, I will pill and
pluck away the beards of as many as shall dare or imagine to touch but a hair only of
me. To these words the woman would make no reply, because they saw his choler
increase.</p>
                     <p>Fifteene dayes he remained quietly at home, without giving any argument of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding
his former vanities: in which time past many pleasant encounters betweene
him and his two gossips, the Curate and Barber, upon that point which he defended,
to wit, that the world needed nothing so much as Knights errant, and that the errati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Knighthood ought to be again renewed therein. Master Parson would contradict
him sometimes, and other times yeeld unto that he urged; for had they not observed
that manner of proceeding, it were impossible to bring him to any conformity. In this
space <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> dealt with a certain labourer his neighbour, an honest man (if the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of honesty may be given to the poore) but one of a very shallow wit; in resolution
he said so much to him, and perswaded him so earnesty, and made him so large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as the poore fellow determined to goe away with him, and serve him as his Squire.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> among many other things bad him to dispose himself willingly to depart
with him; for now and then such an adventure might present it self, that in as short
space as one would take up a couple of straws, an Island might be won, and he be left as
Governor thereof. With these and such like promises <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> for so he was
called, left his wife and children, and agreed to be his Squire. Afterward <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
began to cast plots how to come by some money; which he atchieved by selling one
thing, pawning another, and turning all up-side down. At last he got a pretty sum,
and accommodating himself with a buckler which he had borrowed of a friend, and
patching up his broken Beaver again as well he could: he advertised his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi>
of the day and hour wherein he meant to depart, that he might likewise furnish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with that which he thought needfull; but above all things he charged him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himself of a Wallet; which he promised to perform, and said that he meant also
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54746:20"/>
to carry a very good Asse, which he had of his own, because he was not wont to travell
much a foot. In that of the Asse <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood a while pensive, calling to minde
whether ever he had read, that any Knight Errant carried his Squire Assishly mounted;
but he could not remember any authority for it: yet notwithstanding he resolved that
he might bring his beast, with intention to accomodate him more honourably, when
occasion were offered, by dismounting the first-discourteous Knight they met, from his
horse, and giving it to his Squire; he also furnished himself with Shirts, and as many
other things as he might, according unto the Inn-keepers advise. All which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<hi>Sancho Panca</hi> without bidding his wife and children farewell, or <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
his Niese and old servant, they both departed one night out of the Village unknown
to any person living; and they travelled so farr that night, as they were sure in the
morning not to be found, although they were pursued. <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> rode on his
beast like a <hi>Patriark</hi> with his Wallet and Bottle, and a marvellous longing to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Governour of the Island which his master had promised unto him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took by chance the same very course and way that he had done in his
first voyage through the field of <hi>Montiel,</hi> wherein he travelled then with lesse vexation
then the first; for by reason it was early, and the Sun beams stroke not directly down,
but athwart; the heat did not trouble them much. And <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> seeing the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
good, said to his Master, I pray you have care good Sir Knight, that you forget
not that Government of the Island which you have promised me, for I shall be able to
Govern it, were it never so great. To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replyed; <q>You must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
friend <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi> that it was a custome very much used by ancient
Knights Errant, to make their Squires Governours of the Islands and Kingdoms that
they conquered; and I am resolved that so good a custome shall never be abolished
by me; but rather I will passe and exceed them therein: for they sometimes, and as I
take it, did for the greater part expect untill their Squires waxed aged, and after they
were cloyed with service, and had suffered many bad dayes and worse nights; then
did they bestow upon them some title of an Earl, or at least of a Marquesse of some
Valley or Province, of more or lesse account. But if thou livest, and I withall; it may
happen, that I may conquer such a Kingdome within six dayes, that hath other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
adherent to it, which would fall out as just as it were cast in a mould for thy
purpose, whom I would crown presently King of one of them. And doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this to be any great matter, for things and chances do happen to such Knights
Adventurers as I am, by so unexpected and wonderfull wayes and means, as I might
give thee very easily, a great deal more then I have promised.</q> After that manner,
said <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi> if I were a King through some miracle of those which you say, then
should <hi>Iean Gutierez</hi> my wife become a Queen, and my children Princes. Who doubts
of that, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> That doe I, replyed <hi>Sancha Panca;</hi> for I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that although God would rain Kingdomes down upon the earth, none of them
would sit well on <hi>Mary Gutierez</hi> her head. For Sir, you must understand that shee's
not worth a Dodkin for a Queen. To be a Countesse would agree with her better;
and yet I pray God that she be able to discharge that calling. Commend thou the
matter to God, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that he may give her that which is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for her. But doe not thou abase thy minde so much, as to content thy self with
lesse then at the least to be a Vice-Roy. I will not, good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> especially
seeing I have so worthy a Lord and Master as your self, who knows how to give me all
that may turn to my benefit, and that I shall be able to discharge in good sort.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S thus they discoursed, they discovered some thirty or forty Wind-mils,
that are in that field; and as soone as <hi>Don- Quixote</hi> espied them, hee
said to his Squire, Fortuue doth addresse our affaires better then wee
our selves could desire; for behold there, friend <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> how
there appeares thirty or forty monstrous Giants, with whom I mean
to fight, and deprive them all of their lives, with whose spoyles wee
will begin to bee rich, for this is a good Warre, and a great service
unto God, to take away so bad a seede from the face of the Earth. What Giants?
quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> Those that thou seest there, quoth his Lord, with the long armes,
and some there are of that race, whose armes are almost two leagues long, I pray you
understand, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that those which appeare there, are no Giants but
Windmills; and that which seemes in them to bee armes, are their Sayles, that are
swinged about by the Winde, doe also make the Mill goe. It seemes well, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
that thou art not yet acquainted with matter of Adventures: they are Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
and if thou beest afraid, goe aside and pray whilst I enter into cruell and unequall
battell with them: And saying so, hee spur'd his horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> without taking heed
to his Squire <hi>Sanchoes</hi> cryes, advertising him how they were doubtlesse Windmills that
hee did assault, and no Giants; but hee went so fully perswaded that they were Giants
as hee neither heard his Squires out-cries, nor did discern what they were, although hee
drew very neere to them, but rather said as loud as hee could: Flie not ye Cowards
and vile creatures, for it is only one Knight that assaults you. With this the winde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and the Mill Sailes began to turne about, which <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> espying, said,
although thou movedst more armes then the Giant <hi>Briares,</hi> thou shalt stoope to mee,
and after saying this, and commending himself most devoutly to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
her to succour him in that trance, covering himself well with his Buckler, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Launce on his rest, hee spurred on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and encountred with the first
Mill that was before him, and striking his Launce into the Sayle, the wind swinged it
about with such furie, that it broke his Launce into shivers, carrying him and his Horse
after it, and finally tumbled him a good way off from it on the field in very evill plight.
<hi>Sancho Panca</hi> repayred presently to succour him as fast as his Asse could drive; and
when hee arived. hee found him not able to stir, hee had gotten such a crush with <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante.</hi>
Good God, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> did I not foretell unto you that you should looke
well what you did, for they were none other then Windmills, nor could any thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
unlesse hee had also Windmills in his braines. Peace <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
(for matters of Warre are more subject then any other thing to continuall
change; how much more seeing I doe verily perswade my self, that the wise <hi>Freston</hi>
who robbed my Studie and Bookes, hath transformed these Giants into Mills, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
mee of the glory of the Victory; such is the enmitie hee beares towards mee. But
yet in fine, all his bad arts shall but little prevaile against the goodnesse of my Sword.
God grant it, as hee may, said <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and then helpt him to arise, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hee mounted on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who was half shoulder-pitcht <hi>[Medio spaldado]</hi> by
rough encounter; and discoursing upon that Adventure, they followed on the way
which guided towards the passage or gate of <hi>Lapice (A passage through the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains)</hi>
for there as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> avouched, it was not possible but to finde many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
because it was a through-fare much frequented, and yet hee affirmed that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54746:21"/>
went very much grieved because hee wanted a Launce, and telling it to his Squire hee
said, I remember how I have read that a certain Spanish Knight, called <hi>Diego Peres</hi> of
<hi>Vargas,</hi> having broken his Sword in a Battell, tore off a great branch or stock from an
Oake tree, and did such marvailes with it that day, and battered so many Moors, as
he remained with the surname of <hi>Machuca,</hi> which signifies a stumpe, and as well hee
as all his Progenie were ever after that day called <hi>Vargas</hi> and <hi>Machuca,</hi> I tell thee this,
because I mean to tear another branch, such, or as good as that at least, from the first
Oake, we shall encounter, and I mean to atchieve such Adventures therewithall, as thou
wilt account thy self fortunate, for having merited to behold them, and be a witnesse
of things almost incredible. In Gods name quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I doe believe every word
you said: But I pray you sit right in your saddle; for you ride sideling, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
as I suppose, of the bruising you got by your fall. Thou sayest true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
And if I doe not complain of the grief, the reason is; because Knights Errant
use not to complain of any wound, although their guts did issue out thereof. If it be so
(quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> I know not what to say; but God knows that I would be glad to
hear you to complain when any thing grieves you. Of my self I dare affirm, that I
must complain of the least grief that I have, if it be not likewise meant that the Squires
of Knights Errants must not complain of any harm. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could not refrain
laughter, hearing the simplicity of his Squire; and after shewed unto him, that hee
might lawfully complain, both when he pleased, and as much as he listed, with desire,
or without it; for he had never yet read any thing to the contrary, in the order of
Knighthood. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> said unto him, that it was dinner time: To whom he answered,
that he needed no repast; but if he had will to eat, he might begin when hee pleased.
<hi>Sancho</hi> having obteined his licence, did accommodate himself on his Asse back, the best
he might, taking out of his Wallet some Belly-munition; he rode after his Master tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
and eating at once, and that with great leisure; and ever and anon he lifted up his
bottle with such pleasure as the best fed Victualer of <hi>Malaga</hi> might envie his state; and
whilest he rode multiplying of quaffs in that manner, he never remembred any of the
promises his Master had made him; nor did he hold the fetch of Adventures to be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but rather a great recreation and ease, were they never so dangerous. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
they past over that night under certain Trees, from one of which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oar a withered branch, which might serve him in some sort for a Launce; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he set thereon the iron of his own, which he had reserved when it was broken. All
that night <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> slept not one wink, but thought upon his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> that
he might conform himself to what he had read in his books of Adventures, when
Knights passed over many nights without sleep in forrests and fields only entertained by
memory of their Mistrisses. But <hi>Sancho</hi> spent not his time so vainly; for having his
stomack well stuffed, and that not with <hi>Succory</hi> water, he carried smoothly away the
whole night in one sleep: and if his Master had not called him up, neither the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
which struck on his visage, nor the melody of the Birds, which were many, and
did cheerfully welcome the approach of the new day, could have been able to awake
him: At his arriving he gave one assay to the bottle, which he found to be somewhat
more weak then it was the night before, whereat his heart was somewhat grieved; for
he mistrusted that they took not a course to remedy that defect so soon as he wished:
Nor could <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Quixote</hi> break his fast, who, as we have said, meant only to sustein himself
with pleasant remembrances. Then did they return to their commenced way towards
the Port of <hi>Lapice,</hi> which they discovered about three of the clock in the afternoon.
Here (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> as soon as he kend it, may we (friend <hi>Sancho)</hi> thrust our
hands up to the very elbows in that which is called Adventures. But observe well this
Caveat which I shall give thee, that although thou seest me in the greatest dangers of
the World, thou must not set hand to thy sword in my defence, if thou doest not see
that those which assault me be base and vile vulgar people; for in such a case thou mayst
assist me. Marry if they be Knights thou may'st not doe so in any wise, nor is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the laws of arms, that thou may'st help me, untill thou beest likewise dub'd
knight thy self. I doe assure you Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that herein you shall be most pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb facs="tcp:54746:22"/>
obeyed: And therefore chiefly, in respect that I am of mine own nature a quiet
and peaceable man, and a mortall enemy of thrusting my self into stirrs or quarrells:
Yet it is true that touching the defence of mine own person, I will not be altogether
so observant of those Laws, seeing that both divine and humane allow every man to
defend himself from any one that would wrong him. I say no lesse, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
but in this of ayding me against any Knight, thou must set bounds to thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
impulses. I say I will doe so, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and I will observe this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as punctually, as that of keeping holy the Saboth day.</p>
                     <p>Whil'st thus they reasoned, there appeared in the way two Monks of S. <hi>Benets</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
mounted on two <hi>Dromedaries;</hi> for the <hi>Mules</hi> whereon they rode were but little
lesse. They wore masks with spectacles in them, to keep away the dust from their faces;
and each of them besides boar their Umbrills; after them came a Coach, and four or
five a horse-back accompanying it, and two Lacquies that ran hard by it. There came
therein, as it was after known, a certain <hi>Biscaine</hi> Lady, which travelled towards <hi>Sivil,</hi>
where her husband so journed at the present, and was going to the <hi>Indies,</hi> with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
charge: The Monks rode not with her although they travelled the same
way. Scarce had <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceived them, when he said to his Squire; Either
I am deceived, or else this will prove the most famous Adventure that ever hath been
seen. For these two great black bulk, which appear there, are questionlesse Inchanters
that steal, or carry away perforce, some Princesse in that Coach; and therefore I must
with all my power undo that wrong. This wil be worse then the adventure of the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills,
quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Doe not you see Sir, that those are Fryers of S. <hi>Benets</hi> Order? &amp; the
Coach can be none other then of some travellers. Therefore listen to mine advice, and see
well what you doe, lest the Devill deceive you. I have said already to thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> that
thou art very ignorant in matter of Adventures. What I say is true, as now thou shalt see.
And saying so, he spur'd on his horse, and placed himself just in the mid'st of the way,
by which the Fryers came; and when they approached so neer, as he supposed they
might hear him, he said with a loud voyce: <q>Divilish and wicked people, leave present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those high Princesses which you violantly carry away with you in that Coach; or if
you will not, prepare your selves to recive suddain death, as a just punishment of your
bad works.</q> The Fryers held their horses, and were amazed both at the shape and
words of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> To whom they answered, Sir Knight, we are neither divillish
nor wicked, but religious men of S. <hi>Benets</hi> Order, that travell about our affairs; and
wee know not whether or no there comes any Princesses forced in this Coach. With
me fair words take no effect, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> For I know you very well treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
knaves; and then, without expecting their reply, he set spurs to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and
laying his Launce on the thigh, charged the first Fryer with such fury and rage, that if
he had not suffered himself willingly to fall off his Mule, he would not only have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
him against his will; but likewise have slain, or at least wounded him very ill
with the blow. The second religious man seeing how ill his companion was used made
no words; but seting spurs to that Castell his Mule, did fly away through the field,
as swift as the winde it self. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> seeing the Monk overthrown, dismounted
very speedily off his Asse, and ran over to him, and would have ransackt his habits. In
this arrived the Monks two Lacquies, and demanded of him why he thus dispoyled the
Fryer? <hi>Sancho</hi> reply'd, that it was his due by the Law of arms, as lawfull spoyles gained
in battell by his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> The Lacquies which understood not the jest, nor
knew not what words of battell or spoyles meant, seeing that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was now
out of the way speaking with those that came in the Coach, set both at once upon
<hi>Sancho,</hi> and left him not a hair in his beard; but they pluck't, and did so trample him
under their feet, as they left him stretched on the ground without either breath or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Monk cutting off all delayes, mounted again on horse back, all affrighted,
having scarce any drop of blood left in his face through fear. And being once up, he
spur'd after his fellow, who expected him a good way off, staying to see the successe of
that assault; and being unwilling to attend the end of that strange Adventure, they did
prosecute their journey, blessing &amp; crossing themselves as if the Divell did pursue them.</p>

                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as is rehearsed, was in this season speaking to the Lady of the Coach,
to whom he said, <q>Your beauty deer Lady, may dispose from henceforth of your person,
as best yee liketh; for the pride of your Robbers lyes now prostrated on the ground,
by this my invincible arme. And because you may not be troubled to know your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer
his name, know that I am called <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> a Knight Errant
and Adventurer, and Captive to the Peerlesse and Bautifull Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boso:</hi>
and in reward of the benefit which you have received at my hands, I demand
nothing else but that you return to <hi>Toboso;</hi> and there present your selves in my name
before my Lady, and recount unto her, what I have done to obtain your Liberty.</q> To
all these words which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, a certain <hi>Biscaine</hi> Squire that accompanied
the Coach, gave ear; who seeing that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> suffered not the Coach to passe
onward, but said that it must presently return back to <hi>Toboso,</hi> he drew neer to him, and
laying hold on his Launce, he said in his bad Spanish and worse Basquish; Get thee
away Knight in an ill hour; by the God that created me, if thou leave not the Coach,
I will kill thee, as sure as I am a <hi>Biscaine. Don-Quixote</hi> understanding him, did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with great staidnesse; If thou wer'st a Knight [Cavallero <hi>in Spanish is taken as
well for a Gentleman as for a Knight]</hi> as thou art not, I would by this have punished thy
folly and presumption, crafty creature. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> replyed with great furie; Not I
a Gentleman? I swear God thou lyest, as well as I am a Christian: If thou cast away
thy Launce, and draw thy sword, <hi>[pag. 58.]</hi> thou shalt see the water as soon as thou
shalt carrie away the Cat: A <hi>Biscaine</hi> by Land, and a Gentleman by Sea, a Gentleman
in despight of the Devill; and thou lyest if other things thou sayest. Straight thou
shalt see that, said <hi>Agrages,</hi> replyed <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and throwing his Lannce to the
ground, he out with his Sword, and took his Buckler, and set on the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to kill him. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> seeing him approach in that manner, although he
desired to alight off his Mule, which was not to be trusted, being one of those naughty
ones which are wont to be hired, yet had he no leisure to doe any other thing then
to draw out his Sword: but it befell him happily to bee neer to the Coach, out of
which he snatched a Cushion that served him for a Shield, and presently the one made
upon the other like mortall enemies. Those that were present laboured all that they
might, but in vain, to compound the matter between them; for the <hi>Biscaine</hi> swore in
his bad Language, that if they hindred him from ending the Battell, he would put his
Lady, and all the rest that dared to disturb him to the Sword.</p>
                     <p>The Lady astonished and fearfull of that which shee beheld, commanded the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to goe a little out of the way, and face aloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, beholding the rigorous conflict. In
the progresse whereof the <hi>Biscaine</hi> gave <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> over the Target a mighty blow
on one of the shoulders, where if it had not found resistance in his armour, it would
doubtlesly have cleft him down to the girdle. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> feelling the waight of that
unmeasurable blow, cried with a loude voice, saying, <q>O <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> Lady of my soule,
the flower of all beauty, succour this thy Knight, who to set forth thy worth, findes
himself in this dangerous trance.</q> The saying of these words, the griping fast of his
Sword, the covering of himself wel with his Buckler, &amp; the assayling of the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> was
done all in one instant, resolving to venter all the successe of the battell on that one only
blow. The <hi>Bicaine,</hi> who perceived him come in that manner, perceived by his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
his intention, and resolved to doe the like, and therefore expected him very well
covered with his Cushion, not being able to manage his <hi>Mule</hi> as hee wished from one
part to another, who was not able to goe a step, it was so wearied, as a beast never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
used to the like toyes. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as wee have said, came against the weary <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caine,</hi>
with his Sword lifted a loft, with a full resolution to part him in two, and all the
beholders stood with great feare suspended to see the successe of those monstrous blows
wherewithall they threatned one another. And the Lady of the Coach with her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
made a thousand Vowes and Offerings to all the devoute places of <hi>Spain,</hi> to
the end that God might deliver the Squire and themselves out of that great danger
wherein they were.</p>

leaves this Battell depending, excusing himselfe that hee could find no more written
of the Acts of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> then those which hee hath already recounted. True it is
that the second writer of this worke would not beleeve that so curious a History was
drowned in the jawes of Oblivion, or that the wits of the <hi>Mancha</hi> were so little curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as not to reserve among their Treasuries or Records, some papers treating of this
famous Knight; and therefore encouraged by this presumption, hee did not despaire
to finde the end of this pleasant History; which Heaven being propicious to him, hee
got at last, after the manner that shall bee recounted in the second Part.</p>

the first Part, with their Swords lifted up and naked, in termes
to discharge one upon another two furious Cleevers, and such,
as if they had lighted rightly, would cut and divide them both
from the top to the toe, and open them like a <hi>Pomgranat.</hi> And
that in so doubtfull a taking the delightfull Historie stopped and
remained dismembred, the Author thereof leaving us no notice
where wee might find the rest of the narration. This grieved
mee not a little, but wholly turned the pleasure I tooke in reading the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
into disgust, thinking how small commodity was offered, to finde out so much as in
my opinion wanted of this so delectable a tale. It seemed unto mee almost impossible,
and contrary to all good order, that so good a Knight should want some wise man that
would undertake his wonderfull prowesses and feats of Chivalry. A thing that none
of those Knights Errant ever wanted, of whom People speake, for each of them had
one or two wise men of purpose, that did not only write their Acts, but also depain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their very least thoughts and toyes, were they never so hidden. And surely so good
a Knight could not bee so unfortunate as to want that wherewith <hi>Platyr</hi> and others his
like abounded: and therefore could not induce my self to beleeve, that so gallant a
Historie might remaine maimed and lame, and did rather cast the fault upon the malice
of the time, who is a consumer and devourer of all things, which had eyther hidden or
consumed it. Me thought on the other side, seeing that among his bookes were found
some modern workes, such as the <hi>Vndeceiving of Iealousie,</hi> and the <hi>Nymphs and Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
of Henares.</hi> That also his owne Historie must have been new; and if that it
were not written, yet was the memory of him fresh among the dwellers of his owne
Village, and the other Villages adjoyning. This imagination held mee suspended and
desirous to learn really and truly all the life and miracles of our famous Spanyard, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the light and mirror of all <hi>Manchicall</hi> Chivalrie; being the
first who in this our age and time, so full of calamities, did undergoe the travells and
exercise of armes Errant; and undid wrongs, succour'd widdowes, protected Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels
that rode up and down with their whips and Palfreys, and with all their virginity
<pb facs="tcp:54746:24"/>
on their backs from hill to hill, and dale to dale; for if it hapned not that some lewd
miscreant, or some Clowne with a hatchet and long haire, or some monstrous Giant
did force them, Damzels there were in times past that at the end of fourescore yeeres,
all which time they never slept one day under a roofe, went as entyre and pure may
dens to their Graves, as the very mother that bore them. Therefore I say, that as well
for this as for many other good respects, our gallant <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is worthy of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and memorable praises; nor can the like bee justly denied to my self, for the labour
and diligence which I used to finde out the end of this gratefull History, although I
know very well that if Heaven, Chance, and Fortune had not assisted mee, the world
had beene deprived of the delight and pastime that men may take for almost two
houres together, who shall with diligent attention read it. The manner therefore of
finding it was this.</p>
                     <p>Being one day walking in the Exchange of <hi>Toledo,</hi> a certain Boy by chance would
have sold divers old quires &amp; scroules of bookes to a Squire that walked up and down in
that place, and I being addicted to read such scroules, though I found them torn in the
streets, borne away by this my naturall inclination, tooke one of the quires in my hand,
and perceived it to bee written in Arabicall Characters, and seeing that although I
knew the Letters, yet could I not read the substance, I looked about to view
whether I could perceive any Moor turned Spanyard thereabouts, that could reade
them; nor was it very difficult to finde there such an Interpreter, for if I had searched
one of another better and more ancient language <hi>[to Wit a Iew]</hi> that place would
easily afford him. In fine, my good fortune presented one to mee, to whom telling my
desire, and giving him the booke in his hand, hee opened it, and having read a little
therein, began to laugh, I demanded of him why hee laughed? and hee answered, at
that marginall note which the booke had. I bad him to expound it to mee, and with
that tooke him a little aside, and hee continuing still his laughter said, there is written
here on this margin these words. <hi>This Dulcinea of Toboso so many times spoaken of in this
Historie, had the best hand for powdring of Porkes, of any woman in all the Mancha.</hi>
When I heard it make mention of <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> I rested amazed and suspended,
and imagined forthwith that those quires contained the <hi>Historie of Don-Quixote,</hi> with
this conceit I hastned him to read the ibegnning, which hee did, and translating the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabicall</hi>
into <hi>Spanish</hi> in a trice, hee said that it began thus. <hi>The Historie of Don-Quixote
of the Mancha, written by Cyde Hamete Benegeli,</hi> an <hi>Arabicall Historiographer.</hi>
Much discretion was requisite to dissemble the content of mind I conceived when I
heard the Title of the book, and preventing the Squire, I bought all the boyes scroles and
papers for a Riall, and were he of discretion, or knew my desire, he might have promised
himself easily, and also have borne away with him more then six Reals for his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.
I departed after with the Moor to the Cloyster of the great Church, &amp; I requested
him to turn me all the <hi>Arabicall</hi> sheets that treated of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> into Spanish, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adding or taking away any thing from them; and I would pay him what hee listed
for his paines: hee demanded fifty pounds of Raisons, and three Bushells of Wheat,
and promised to translate them speedily, well, and faithfully. But I, to hasten the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more, least I should lose such an unexpected and welcome treasure, brought him to
my house, where he translated all the work in lesse then a moneth and a half, even in the
manner that it is here recounted.</p>
                     <p>There was painted in the first Quier very naturally the battell betwixt <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and the <hi>Biscaine;</hi> even in the same manner that the History relateth it, with their Swords
lifted aloft, the one covered with his Buckler, the other with the Cushion: and the
<hi>Biscaines</hi> Mule was delivered so naturally as a man might perceive it was hired; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he stood farther oft then the shot of a Cross-bow. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> had a title
written under his feet, that said, <hi>Don Sancho de Azpetia,</hi> for so belike he was called:
and at <hi>Rozinante</hi> his feet, there was another that said <hi>Don-Quixote. Rozinante</hi> was
marvellous well pourtraited, so long and lank, so thin and lean, so like one labouring
with an incurable consumption, as he did shew very cleerly with what consideration
and propriety he had given unto him the name <hi>Rozinante.</hi> By him stood <hi>Sancho Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54746:24"/>
holding his Asse by the halter; at whose feet was another scroule, saying, <hi>Sancho
Cancas:</hi> And I think the reason thereof was, that as his picture shewed, he had a
great belly, a short stature, and thick leggs. And therefore I judge he was called <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
or <hi>Canca,</hi> for both these names were written of him indifferently in the History.
There were other little things in it worthy nothing; but all of them are of no great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
nor any thing necessary for the true relation of the History, for none is ill if
it be true. And if any objection be made against the truth of this; it can be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then that the Authour was a Moor; and it is a known propriety of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be lying: Yet in respect that they hate us so mortally, it is to be conjectured
that in this History there is rather want and concealement of our Knights worthy acts,
then any superfluity; which I imagine the rather, because I finde in the progresse thereof
many times, that when he might; and ought to have advanced his penn in our Knights
prayses, he doth as it were of purpose passe them over in silence. Which was very ill
done, seeing that Historiographers ought and should be very precise, true, and unpassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate;
and that neither profit, or fear, rancor or affection should make them to tread
awry from the truth, whose mother is History; the Emulatresse of time; the depository
of actions; the witnesse of things past; and advertiser of things to come. In this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
I know a man may finde all that he can desire in the most pleasing manner; and
if they want any thing to be desired, I am of opinion that it is through the fault of that
ungracious knave that translated it, rather then through any defect in the subject.
Finally, the second part thereof (according to the translation) began in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>The trenchant Swords of the two valorous and inraged combatants being listed a
loft, it seemed that they threatned Heaven, the Earth, and the Depths. Such was their
hardnesse and courage: And the first that discharged his blow was the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> which
fell with such force and fury, as if the Sword had not turned a little in the way, that
only blow had been sufficient to set an end to the rigorous Contention, and all other
the Adventures of our Knight. But his good fortune which resolved him for greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Affairs, did wrest his adversaries Sword away in such sort, as though he stroke him on the

                        </gap> then disarm all that side carying away with it
a great part of his Beaver, with the half of his eare; all which fell to the ground with
a dreadfull ruine, leaving him in very ill case for a good time. Good God! who is
he that can well describe at this present, the fury that entred in the heart of our <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chegan,</hi>
seeing himself used in that manner? Let us say no more, but that it was such,
that stretching himself again in the stirrops, and griping his Sword fast in both his hands,
he discharged such a terrible blow on the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> hitting him right upon the Cushion
and by it on the head, that the strength and thicknesse thereof so little availed him, that
as if a whole Mountain had faln upon him, the blood gushed out of his mouth, nose,
and ears, all at once, and he to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>teredi so on his Mule, that every step he took, he was
ready to fall off, as he would indeed if he had not taken him by the neck: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
he lost the stirrops, and loosing his gripe of the Mule, it being likewise frighted
by that terrible blow, ran away as fast as it could, about the Fields, and within two or
three winches overthrew him to the ground. All which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood beholding
with great quietnesse; and as soon as he saw him fall, he leapt off his Horse, and ran
over to him very speedily; and setting the poynt of his Sword on his eyes, he bad him
yeeld himself, or else he would cut off his head. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> was so amazed as he could
not speak a word; and it had succeeded very ill with him, considering <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
fury, if the Ladies of the Coach, which untill then had beheld the Conflict with great
anguish, had not come where he was, and earnestly be sought him to doe them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pardon their Squiers life. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered with a great loftinesse and
gravity. <q>Truly fair Ladyes I am well appaid to grant you your request, but it must
be with this agreement and condition, that this Knight shall promise me to goe to
<hi>Toboso,</hi> and present himself in my name to the Peerlesse Ladie <hi>Daloinea,</hi> to the end
she may dispose of him as shee pleaseth.</q> The timerous and comfortlesse Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Lackeyes, and stood attentively beholding his Lords combate,
and prayed to God with all his heart, that it would please him to
give him the victory; and that he might therein winn some Island,
whereof he might make him governour, as he had promised. And
seeing the controversie ended at last, and that his Lord remounted
upon <hi>Rozinante;</hi> he came to holde him the stirrop, and cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on his knees before him ere hee got up, and taking him by the hand, hee kist it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I desire that it will please you good my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to bestow upon mee
the government of that Island which in this terrible Battell you have wonne; for
though it were never so great, yet doe I finde my selfe able enough to govern it, as wel
as any other whatsoever that ever governed Island in this world. To this demand <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
answered, thou must note friend <hi>Sancha,</hi> that this Adventure, and others of
this kinde are not adventures of Islands, but of thwartings and high wayes, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else is gained but a broaken pate, or the losse of an ear. Have patience a
while, for Adventures will be offered, whereby thou shalt not only be made a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
but also a greater man. <hi>Sancho</hi> rendred him many thanks, and kissing his hand again,
and the skirt of his Habergeon; he did help him to get up on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and he leapt
on his Asse, and followed his Lord: who with a swift pace, without taking leave or
speaking to those of the Coach, he entred into a wood that was hard at hand. <hi>Sancho</hi>
followed him as fast as his beast could trot; but <hi>Rozinante</hi> went off so swiftly, as he
perceiving he was like to be left behinde, was forced to call aloud to his Master that he
would stay for him; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did by checking <hi>Rozinante</hi> with the bridle,
untill his wearied Squire did arrive: who, as soon as he came, said unto him; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
(Sir) that it will not be amisse to retire our selves to some Church; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as that man is ill dight with whom you fought. I certainly perswade my self that
they will give notice of the fact to the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> and they will seek to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
us; which if they doe, in good faith before we can get out of their claws, I fear
me we shall sweat for it. Peace, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> where hast thou ever read or
seen that Knight Errant, that hath been brought before the Judge, though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
never so many homicides and slaughters? I know nothing of Omicills, quoth

Then be not afraid friend, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I will deliver thee out of the
hands of the <hi>Caldeans;</hi> how much more out of those of the <hi>Brotherhood?</hi> But tell me in
very good earnest, whether thou did'st ever see a more valarous Knight then I am,
on the face of the earth? did'st thou ever read in Histories of any other that hath or ever
had more courage in assayling; more breath in persevering; more dexterity in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or more art in overthrowing, then I? The truth is, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I have never
read any History; for I can neither read nor write: But that which I dare wager is,
that I never in any life served a bolder Master then you are; and I pray God that we

pay not for this boldnesse, there where I have said, That which I request you is, that
you will cure your selfe, for you lose much blood by that eare, and here I have lint and

needs not fear death, nor ought he to think that he may be killed by any wound: and
therefore after I have made it, and given it unto thee, thou hast nothing else to doe.
but when thou shalt see that in any Bateel I bee cloven in twaine (as many times it
happens) thou shalt take faire and softly that part of my Body that is faln to the
ground, and put it up again with great subtlety, on the part that rests in the Saddle,
before the blood congeale, having evermore great care that thou place it just and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then presently after thou shalt give mee two draughts of that <hi>Balsamum</hi> of which I
have spoken, and thou shalt see me streight become founder then an Apple. If that bee
true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I doe presently here renounce the government of the Island you
promised, and will demand nothing else in recompence of my services of you, but only
the receit of this precious liquor; for I am certain that an ounce thereof will be worth
two Rials in any place, and when I have it I should neede nothing else to gain my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
easily and honestly. But let mee know, is it costly in making? With lesse then
three Reals, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> a man may make three gallons of it, But I meane
to reach thee greater secrets then this, and doe thee greater favours also. And now let
me cure my self, for mine eare grieves me more then I would wish. <hi>Sancho</hi> then tooke
out of his Wallet his lynt and oyntment to cure his Master. But when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
saw that the vizar of his Helmet was broken, he was ready to run mad; and setting his
hand to his Sword, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, I vow to the creator of
all things, and to the foure Gospels where they are largest written, to leade such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life as the great <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> did, when he swore to revenge the death of
his Nephew <hi>Valdovinos,</hi> which was; not to eate on Table cloath, nor sport with his
Wife, and other things, which although I doe not now remember, I give them here
for expressed, untill I take compleate revenge on him that hath done me this
outrage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing this said, you must note, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that if the Knight hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
that which you ordained, to goe and present himselfe before my Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea
of Toboso,</hi> then hath hee fully satisfied his debt, and deserves no new punishment,
except hee commit a new fault. Thou hast spoken well and hit the marke right, said
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore I disanull the Oath, in that of taking any new revenge on
him; but I make it, and confirm it again, that I will leade the life I have said until I
take another Helmet like, or as good as this, perforce from some Knight. And doe
not think <hi>Sancho</hi> that I make this resolution lightly, or as they say, with the smoak of
strawes, for I have an Author whom I may very well imitate herein, for the very like in
every respect past about <hi>Mambrinoes</hi> Helmet, which cost <hi>Sacriphante</hi> so deerely. I
would have you resigne those kind of Oathes to the Devill, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for they will
hurt your health, and prejudice your Conscience. If not, tell mee now, I beseech you
if wee shall not these many dayes encounter with any that weares a Helmet, what shall
wee doe? Will you accomplish the Oath in despight of all the inconveniences and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
that ensue thereof? to wit, to sleepe in your clothes, nor to sleepe in any
dwelling, and a thousand other penitencies, which the Oath of the mad old man, the
Marquesse of <hi>Mantua</hi> contained, which you meane to ratifie now? Doe not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that armed men travell not in any of these wayes, but Carriers, and Waggoners,
who not only carie no Helmets, but also for the most part never heard speake of them
in their lives? Thou dost deceive thy self saying so, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for wee shall
not haunt these wayes two houres, before wee shall see more armed Knights then were
at the siege of <hi>Albraca,</hi> to conquer <hi>Angelica the faire.</hi> Well then, let it bee so,
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I pray God it befall us well, whom I devoutly beseech that the time
<pb facs="tcp:54746:26"/>
may come of gayning that Island which costs mee so deere, and after let me die present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and I care not. I have already said to thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth his Lord, that thou shouldst
not trouble thy self in any wise about this Affair; for if an Island were wanting, we
have then the Kingdome of <hi>Denmark</hi> or that of <hi>Sobradisa,</hi> which will come as fit for
thy purpose as a Ring to thy finger, and principally thou art to rejoyce, because they
are on the continent. But omitting this till his own time; see whether thou hast any
thing in they Wallet, and let us eat it, that afterward wee may goe search out some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
wherein we may lodg this night, and make the <hi>Balsamum</hi> which I have told thee.
For I vow to God that this ear grieves me marvellously. I have here an Onion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Squire, a peece of Cheese and a few crusts of bread, but such grosse meats are
not befitting so noble a Knight as you are. How ill doest thou understand it? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I let thee to understand <hi>Sancho,</hi> that it is an honour for Knights
Errant, not to eat once in a moneths space; and if by chance they should eat, to eat
only of that which is next at hand. And this thou mightest certainly conceive, hadst
thou read so many books as I have done. For though I past over many, yet did I never
finde recorded in any, that Knights Errant did ever eat, but by meer chance and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or in some costly Banquests that were made for them, and all the other dayes they
past over with hearbs and roots: and though it is to be understood that they could not
live without meat, and supplying the other needs of nature, because they were in effect
men as wee are: It is likewise to be understood, that spending the greater part of their
lives in Forrests and Deserts, and that too without a Cook, that their most ordinary
meats were but course and rusticall, such as thou doest now offer unto me. So that
friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> let not that trouble thee which is my pleasure, nor goe not thou about
to make a new world, or to hoist Knight Errantry off of her hinges. Pardon me
good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for by reason I can neither read nor write, as I have said
once before I have not fallne rightly in the Rules and Laws of Knighthood; and from
hence forth my Wallet shall be well furnished with all Kindes of dry fruits for you,
because you are a Knight: and for my self, seeing I am none, I will provide Fowls and
other things, that are of more substance. I say not <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that it
is a forcible Law to Knights Errant, not to eat any other things then such fruits; but
that their most ordinary sustenance could be none other then those, and some herbs
they found up and down the Fields, which they knew very well, and so doe I also. It
is a virtue, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to know those Hearbs; for as I imagine that knowledge will
some day stand us in stead: And saying so, he took out the provision he had, which
they both eat together with good conformity. But being desirous to search out a place
where they might lodg that night, they did much shorten their poor dinner, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
anon a horse-back, they made as much haste as they could, to finde out some dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
before the night did fall; but the Sun and their hopes did fail them at once, they
being neer the Cabins of certain Goat-heards; and therefore they concluded to take up
their lodging there for that night: For, though <hi>Sancho</hi>'s grief was great, to lie out of a
Village yet <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>'s joy exceeded it farr, considering he must sleep under open
Heaven, because he made account as oft as this befell him, that he did a worthy act,
which did facilitate and ratifie the practise of his Chivalry.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E was entertained very cheerfully by the Goat-heards, and <hi>Sancho</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
set up <hi>Rozinante</hi> and his Asse, as well as he could, he presently
repaired to the smell of certain peeces of Goat-flesh, that stood boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in a Kettle over the Fire; and although he thought in that very
moment to try whether they were in season to be translated out of
the Kettle into the Stomack, he did omit it, because he saw the Heards
take them off the Fire, and spreading certain Sheep-skins, which they
had for that purpose on the ground, lay in a trice their rusticall table, and invited the
Master and man with very cheerfull minde, to come and take part of that which they
had. There sate down round about the skinns six of them, which were all that dwelled in
that Fold; having first (using some course complements) placed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> upon a
Trough, turning the bottome up. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sate down and <hi>Sancho</hi> stood, to serve
the Cup, which was made of horn. His Master seeing him a foot, said, <hi>Sancho,</hi> to the
end thou mayest perceive the good included in wandring Knighthood, and also in
what possibility they are, which exercise themselves in any ministery thereof, to arrive
briefly to honour and reputation in the World. My will is that thou doest sit here by
my side and in company with this good people, and that thou beest one and the very self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
thing with me, who am thy Master and naturall Lord, that thou eat in my dish,
and drink in the same cup wherein I drink: for the same may be said of Chivalrie that
is of Love, to wit, that it makes all things equall. I yeeld you great thanks, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
yet dare I avouch unto you, that so I had therewithall to eat well, I could eat it as well
or better standing and alone, then if I sate by an Emperour. And besides, if I must say
the truth, me thinks that which I eat in a corner without ceremonies, curiosity, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any, though it were but bread and an Onion, smacks a great deal better then
Turkey-Cocks at other Tables, where I must chew my meat leisurely, drink but little,
wipe my hands often, must not neese nor cough though I have a desire, or be like to
choake, nor doe other things that solitude and liberty bring with them. So that (good
Sir) I would have you convert these honours that you would bestow upon me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that I am an adherent to Chivalry, as I am being your Squire, into things more
essentiall &amp; profitable for me then these; &amp; though I remain as thankfull for them, as if
they were received, yet doe I here renounce from this time untill the worlds end. For all
that thou shalt sit, for the humble shall be exalted; and so taking him by the arm hee
forced him to sit down neer himself.</p>
                     <p>The Goat-heards did not understand that Gibbrish of <hi>Squires</hi> and <hi>Knights Errant,</hi>
and therefore did nothing else but eat and hold their peace, and look on their guests,
that tossed in with their fists whole slices, with good grace and stomacks. The course of
flesh being ended, they served in on the rugges a great quantity of sheld Akorns, and
half a Cheese harder then if it were made of rough-casting, the horne stood not the while
idle; for it went round about so often, now full, now empty, much like a Conduit of
Noria, <hi>[Arcaduzed Noria. p. 76.)</hi> And in a trice it emptied one of the two wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bags
that ley there in the publique view. After that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had satisfied his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
well, he took up a handfull of Akorns. and beholding them earnestly, he began
to discourse in this manner. <q>Happy time, and fortunate ages were those, whereon
our Ancestors bestowed the title of Golden, not because Gould (so much prized in this
our iron age) was gotten in that happy time without any labours, but because those
which lived in that time, knew not these two words <hi>Thine</hi> and <hi>Mine:</hi> in that holy
Age all things were in common. No man needed for his ordinary sustenance to doe
<pb facs="tcp:54746:27"/>
ought else then lift up his hand, and take it from the strong Oake, which did liberally
invite them to gather his sweet and savory fruit. The cleer Fountains and running
Rivers did offer them these savorie and transparent waters in magnificent abundance.
In the clifts of Rocks and hollow Trees did the carefull and discreet Bees erect
their Commonwealth, offering to every hand without interest, the fertile cropp of
their sweetest travails. The loftie Cork-Trees did dismisse of themselves, without any
art then that of their native liberality, their broad and light rindes. Wherewithall
Horses were at first covered, being susteined by rusticall stakes, to none other end,
but for to keep back the inclemencies of the Ayre. All then was peace, all Amitie,
and all Concord: as yet the ploughshare presumed not with rude encounter to
open and search the compassionate bowels of our first mother; for shee without
compulsion offered up, through all the parts of her fertil and spacious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
all that which might satisfie, sustein, and delight those children which it then
had: Yea it was then that the simple and beautifull young Sheepheardesse went from
Valley to Valley, and Hill to Hill, with their haires sometimes plaited, sometime di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shevel'd,
without other apparell then that which was requisite to cover comelily that
which modesty wills, and ever would have concealed. Then were of no request the
Attires and Ornaments which are now used by those that esteem the purple of Tyre
and the so-many-waies-marterized-Silk so much: but only certain green leaves of
<hi>Burdocks</hi> and <hi>Ivie</hi> intertexed and woven together; wherewithall perhaps they went
as gorgeously and comly deck'd, as now our Court-dames with all their rare and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish
inventions that idlenesse and curiosity hath found out. Then were the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
conceits of the minde, simply and sincerely delivered, and imbellished in the very
form and manner that she had conceived them, without any artificiall contexture of
words to indeer them: Fraud, Deceipt, or Mallice had not then medled themselves
with Plainnesse and Truth: Justice was then in her proper terms, Favour daring not
to trouble or confound her, or the respect of profit, which doe now Prosecute, Blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
and disturb her so much. The Law of Corruption, or taking Bribes had not yet
possest the understanding of the Judge; for then was neither Judge, nor person to be
judged. Maidens and Honesty wandred then, I say, where they listed, alone signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
secure, that no Stranger, Liberty, or Lascivious intent could prejudice it, or their
own native desire or will any way indamage it. But now in these our detestable
times no damzel is safe, although she be hid and shut up in another new Labyrinth,
like that of <hi>Creet;</hi> for even there it self the amorous Plague would enter, either by
some cranie, or by the aire, or by the continuall urgings of cursed Care, to infect her.
For whose protection and security was last instituted, by successe of times, the order
of Knigh-hood, to defend Damzels, protect Widows, and assist Orphans and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Wights. Of this Order am I, friends, Goatheards, whom I doe heartily
thank for the good entertainment which you doe give unto me and my Squire: for
although that every one living is oblieged by the Law of Nature, to favour Knights
Errant; yet notwithstanding, knowing that you knew not this Obligation, and yet
did receive and make much of me, it stands with all reason that I doe render you
thanks with all my heart!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Knight made this long Oration (which might have been well excused) because
the Achorns that were given unto him, called to his minde the golden World: and
therefore the humour took him to make the Goat-heards that unprofitable discourse,
who heard him all amazed and suspended with very great attention all the while. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
likewise held his peace, eating Acorns, and in the mean while visited very often the
second wine-bagg, which, because it might be fresh, was hanged upon a Cork-Tree.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had spent more time in his Speech then in his Supper; at the end whereof
one of the Goat-heards said, To the end that you may more assuredly know, Sir Knight
Errant, that we doe entertain you with prompt and ready will, wee will likewise make
you some pastime, by hearing one of our companions sing, who is a Heard of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and very amorous withall, and can besides read and write, and playes so
well on a Rebeck, that there is nothing to be desired. Scarce had the Goat-Heard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54746:27"/>
ended his Speech, when the sound of the Rebeck touched his ear, and within a while
after he arrived that played on it, being a youth of some twenty years old, and one of a
very good grace and countenance. His fellows demanded if he had supped, and answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had; he which did offer the courtesie, said, then <hi>Anthony</hi> thou mayest doe
us a pleasure by singing a little, that this Gentleman our Guest may see, that we enjoy
amid'st these Groves and Woods, those that know what Musick is: we have told him
already thy good qualities, and therefore we desire that thou shew them, to verifie our
words. And therefore I desire thee by thy life, that thou wilt sit and sing the Ditty
which thy Unkle the Prebendary made of thy Love, and was so well liked off in our
Village. I am content, quoth the youth, and without further intreaty, sitting down
on the trunk of a lopped Oak, he turned his Rebeck, and after a while began with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
good grace to sing in this manner.

                     <p>Here the Goat-heard ended his Ditty, and although <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> intreated him to
sing somwhat else. yet would not <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> consent to it; who was at that time
better disposed to sleep then to heare Musick: and therefore said to his Master, you
had better provide your self of a place wherein to sleep this night then to heare Music,
for the labour that these good men indure all the day long, doth not permit that they
likewise spend the night in singing. I understand thee well enough <hi>Sancho,</hi> answered
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> nor did I thinke lesse, but that thy manifold visitations of the wine-bottle,
would rather desire to bee recompenced with sleepe then with Music. The
Wine liked us all well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I doe not denie it, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but
goe thou and lay thee downe where thou pleasest, for it becomes much more men of
my profession to watch then to sleepe. Yet notwithstanding it will not bee amisse to
lay somwhat againe to mine eare, for it grieves mee very much. One of the Goat-heards
beholding the hurt, bad him bee of good cheere, for hee would apply a remedy
that should cure it easily. And taking some Rosemary leaves of many that grew
thereabouts, hee hewed them, and after mixed a little salt among them, and applyed
this Medecine to the eare, hee bound it up well with a cloth, assuring him that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to use no other Medecine, as it proved after in effect.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>BOUT this time arived another youth, one of those that brought
them provision from the Village, who said, Companions doe not
you know what passeth in the Village? How can wee know it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absent? saies another of them. Then wit, quoth the youth, that
the famous Sheepheard, and Student <hi>Chrisostome</hi> died this morning,
and they murmur that hee died for love of that divellish lasse <hi>Maree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,
William</hi> the rich his daughter, shee that goes up and down these
Plaines and Hills among us in the habit of a Sheepheardesse; Dost thou mean <hi>Marcela,</hi>
quoth one of them? Even her, I say, answered the other; and the jest is, that hee
hath commanded in his Testament, that hee bee buried in the fields, as if he were a
Moor; and that it be at the foot of the Rock, where the Fountain stands of the Cork-Tree.
For that according to same, and as they say, he himself affirmed, was the place
wherein he viewed her first. And he hath likewise commanded such other things to be
done, as the ancienter sort of the Village doe not allow, nor think fit to be performed;
for they seem to be ceremonies of the Gentils. To all which objections his great friend
<hi>Ambrosio</hi> the Student, who likewise apparelled himself like a Sheepheard, at once with
him answers, that all shall be accomplished, without omission of any thing, as
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath ordeyned, and all the Village is in an uproar about this affair, and
yet it is said that what <hi>Ambrosio</hi> and all the other Sheepheards his friends doe pretend
shall in fine be done: and to morrow morning they will come to the place I have
named to burie him with great pomp: and as I suppose it will be a thing worthy the
seeing: at leastwise I will not omit to goe and behold it, although I were sure that I
could not return the same day to the Village. We will all doe the same, quoth the
Goat-heards, and will draw Lots who shall tarry here to keep all our Heards. Thou
saist well <hi>Peter,</hi> quoth one of them, although that labour may be excused, for I mean
to stay behinde for you all, which you must not attribute to any virtue, or little curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in me; but rather to the fork that prickt my foot the other day, and makes me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to travell from hence. We doe thank thee notwithstanding, quoth <hi>Peter,</hi> for thy
good will. And <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who heard all their discourse, intreated <hi>Peter</hi> to tell
him who that dead man was, and what the Sheepheardesse of whom they spoak.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> made answer, that what he knew of the affair was, that the dead person was a
rich Gentleman of a certain Village, seated among those mountains, who had studied
many yeers in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and after returned home to his house, with the opinion to be
a very wise and learned man: But principally it was reported of him, that he was skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in Astronomie, and all that which passed above in heaven, in the Sunne and the
Moon; for he would tell us most punctually the clips of the Sunne and the Moon.
Friend, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the darkning of these two greater <hi>Luminaries</hi> is called an
<hi>Eclipse,</hi> and not a <hi>Clipse.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> stopping not at those trifles, did prosecute his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
saying; he did also Prognosticate, when the yeer would be abundant or Estill.
Thou wouldest say <hi>Sterril,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote. Sterril</hi> or <hi>Estil,</hi> said <hi>Peter,</hi> all is one
for my purpose: And I say, that by his words, his father and his other friends, that
gave credit to him, became very rich: For they did all that he counselled them, who
would say unto them; sow Barley this yeer and no Wheat. In this you may sow Pease
and no Barley. The next yeer will be good for Oyle. The three ensuing you shall not
gather a drop. That Science is called <hi>Astrologie,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I know not
how it is called, replied <hi>Peter,</hi> but I know well he knew all this and much more. Finally,
a few moneths after he came from <hi>Salamanca,</hi> he appeared one day apparalled like a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:29"/>
Sheepheard with his Flock, and leather Coat; having laid aside the long habits that he
wore, being a Scholler, and joyntly with him came also a great friend of his, and fellow
Student called <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> apparraled like a Sheepheard. I did almost forget to tell
how <hi>Crisostome</hi> the dead man was a great maker of Verses; insomuch that he made
the Carols of Christmas day at night, and the playes for <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day, which the
youths of our Village did represent, and all them affirmed, that they were most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
When those of the Village saw the two Schollers so suddainly clad like Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
they were amazed, and could not guesse the cause that moved them to make so
wonderfull a change. And about this time <hi>Chrisostome</hi>'s father died, and he remained
possessed of a great deal of goods, as well moveable as immoveable; and no little quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Cattell great and small, and also a great sum of money; of all which the young
man remained a dissolute Lord. And truly he deserved it all; for he was a good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
charitable, and a friend of good folk; and he had a face like a blessing. It
came at last to be understood, that the cause of changing his habit was none other, then
for to goe up and down through these Desarts after the Sheepherdesse <hi>Marcela,</hi> whom
our Heard named before; of whom the poor dead <hi>Crisostome</hi> was become enamoured.
And I will tell you now, because it is fit you should know it, what this wanton Lasse is,
perhaps, and I think without perhaps, you have not heard the like thing in all the dayes
of your life, although you had lived more yeers then <hi>Sarna.</hi> Say <hi>Sarra,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
being not able any longer to hear him to change one word for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The <hi>Sarna</hi> or Scabb, quoth <hi>Peter,</hi> lives long enough too. And if you goe thus
Sir, interrupting my tale at every pace, we shall not be able to end it in a yeer. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me friend, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for I speak to thee by reason there was such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Sarna</hi> and <hi>Sarra.</hi> But thou doest answer well; for the
<hi>Sarna</hi> or Scab
lives longer then <hi>Sarra:</hi> and therefore prosecute thy History; for I will not interrupt
thee any more. I say then deer Sir of my Soul, quoth the Goat-heard, that there was
in our Village a Farmer that was yet richer then <hi>Crisostomes</hi> father, who was called
<hi>William,</hi> to whom fortune gave in the end of his great riches a daughter called <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cela,</hi>
of whose birth her mother died, who was the best woman that dwelled in all this
circuit. Me thinks I doe now see her quick before me, with that face which had on the
one side the Sun, &amp; on the other side the Moon; &amp; above all, shee was a thriftie huswife,
and a great friend to the poor: For which I believe that her soul is this very hour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of the Gods in the other World. For grief of the losse of so good a wife, her
husband <hi>William</hi> likewise dyed, leaving his daughter <hi>Marcela</hi> young and rich in the
custody of his Uncle, who was a Priest, and Curate of our Village. The child grew
with such beauty as it made us remember that of her mother, which was very great.
And yet notwithstanding they judged that the daughters would surpasse hers, as indeed
it did: for when she arrived to the age of fourteen or fifteen yeers old, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
her, that did not blesse God for making her so fair: and most men remained ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
and cast away for her love. Her Unkle kept her with very great care and
closenesse: And yet neverthelesse the fame of her great beauty did spread it self in such
sort, that as well for it as for her great Riches, her Unkle was not only requested by
those of our Village, but also was prayed, solicited, and importuned by all those
that dwelled many leagues about, and that by the very best of them, to give her to
them in marriage. But he (who is a good Christian every inch of him) although he
desired to marry her presently as soon as she was of age, yet would he not doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her good will, without ever respecting the gain and profit he might make by the
possession of her goods, whilest he desired her marriage. And in good sooth this was
spoaken of, to the good Priest his commendation, in more then one meeting of the
people of our Village. For I would have you to wit, Sir Errant, that in these little
Villages they talk of all things, and make account, as I doe, that the Priest must have
been too good who could obliege his Parishiones to speak so well of him, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Villages. Thou hast reason, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and therefore follow on,
for the History is very pleasant, and thou good <hi>Peter</hi> doest recount it with a very good
grace. I pray God, said <hi>Peter,</hi> that I never want our Heards; for it is that which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54746:29"/>
makes to the purpose. And in the rest you shall understand, that although her Unkle
propounded and told to his Niese the quality of every woer of the many that desired
her for wife, and intreated her to marry and chuse at her pleasure; yet would she never
answer other, but that she would not marry as then, and that in respect of her over
green years, she did not finde her self able enough yet to bear the burden of marriage.
With these just excuses which shee seemed to give, her Unkle lest off importuning of
her, and did expect untill she were farther entred into yeers; and that she might know
how to choose one that might like her. For hee was wont to say, and that very well, <hi>That
Parents were not to place or bestow their Children, where they bore no liking.</hi> But see here
when we least imagined it, the coy <hi>Marcela</hi> appeared one morning to become a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesse;
and neither her Uncle, nor all those of the Village which disswaded her from
it, could work any effect, but she would needs goe to the Fields, and keep her own
Sheep with the other young Lasses of the Town. And shee coming thus in publique,
when her beauty was seen without hindrance, I cannot possibly tell unto you, how
many rich youths, as well Gentlemen as Farmers, have taken on them the habit of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
and follow woing of her up and down those Fields. One of which, as is said
already, was our dead man, of whom it is said, that leaving to love her, he had at last
made her his Idol. Nor is it to be thought that because <hi>Marcela</hi> set her self in that
liberty, and so loose a life, and of so little or no keeping, that therefore she hath given
the least token or shadow of dishonesty or negligence: nay rather such is the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse
wherewithall shee looks to her honour, that among so many as serve and
sollicite her, not one hath praised or can justly vaunt himself to have received at her
hands, the least hope that may be to obtain his desires. For although she did not flie
or shun the company and conversation of Sheepheards, and doth use them courteously
and friendly, whensoever any one of them begin to discover their intention, be it ever
so just and holy, as that of Matrimony, shee casts them away from her, as with a
sling.</p>
                     <p>And with this manner of proceeding shee does more harme in this Countrey, then
if the Plague had entred into it by her meanes, for her affability and beauty doth draw
to it the hearts of those which doe serve and love her: But her disdaine and resolution
doe conduct them to termes of desparation: and so they know not what to say unto
her, but to call her with a loud voyce cruell and ungratefull, with other titles like unto
this, which doe cleerely manifest the nature of her condition; and Sir, if you staid here
but a few daies, you should heare these Mountaines resound with the lamentations of
those wretches that follow her. There is a certain place not far off, wherein are about
two dozen of Beech-trees, and there is not any one of them in whose rinde is not ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Marcelas</hi> name, and over some names graven also a crowne in the same tree, as if
her lover would plainly denote that <hi>Marcela</hi> beares it away, and deserves the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of all humane beauty. Here sighs one Sheepheard, there another complaines, in
another place are heard amorous ditties, here in another dolefull and despayring la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Some one there is that passeth over all the whol houres of the night at the foot
of an Oake or Rock, and there without folding once his weeping eyes, swallowed and
transported by his thoughts, the Sunne findes him there in the morning: and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there is, who without giving wade or truce to his sighes, doth amidst the fervor of
the most fastidious heate of the Summer, stretcht upon the burning sand, breathe his
pittifull complaints to Heaven: and of this, and of him, and of those, and these, the
beautifull <hi>Marcela</hi> doth indifferently and quietly triumph: all we that know her,
doe await to see wherein this her loftinesse will finish, or who shall be so happy as to
gain dominion over so terrible a condition, and enjoy so peerlesse a beauty. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all that I have recounted is so notorious a truth, it make me more easily believe
that our companion hath told, that is said of the occasion of <hi>Chrisostome</hi>'s death: and
therefore I doe counsell you Sir, that you doe not omit to be present to morrow at his
buriall, which will be worthy the seeing; for <hi>Chrisostome</hi> hath many friends, and the
place wherein he commanded himself to bee buried is not half a league from hence.
I doe mean to be there, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and doe render thee many thanks for the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:30"/>
delight thou hast given me, by the relation of so pleasant a History. O, quoth the Goat-Heard,
I doe not yet know the half of the Adventures succeeded to <hi>Marcela</hi>'s lovers;
but peradventure wee may meet some Sheepheard on the way to morrow that will tell
them unto us. And for the present you will doe well to goe take your rest under some
roof, for the air might hurt your wound, although the Medicine be such that I have
applied to it, that any contrary accidents needs not much to be feared. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
being wholy out of patience with the Goat-Heards long discourse, did sollicite for his
part his Master so effectually as he brought him at last into <hi>Peters</hi> Cabin, to take his
rest for that night; whereinto after he had entred, he bestowed the remnant of the
might in remembrances of his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in imitation of <hi>Marcelaes</hi> Lovers. <hi>Sancho
Panca</hi> did lay himself down between <hi>Rozinante</hi> and his Asse, and slept it out, not like a
disfavored Lover, but like a man stamped and bruised with tramplings.</p>

when five of the six Goat-heards arising, went to awake <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and demanded of him whether he yet intended to goe to
<hi>Chrisostome</hi>'s Buriall, and that they would accompany him. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
that desired nothing more, got up and commaunded <hi>Sancho</hi>
to saddle and empannell in a trice; which he did with great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and with the like they all presently began their journey. And
they had not yet gone a quarter of a league, when at the crossing of a path-way they saw
six Sheepheards comming towards them, apparrelled with black skinns, and crowned
with Garlands of <hi>Cypresse</hi> and bitter <hi>Enula Campana.</hi> Every one of them carried in
his hand a thick truncheon of Elme. There came likewise with them two Gentlemen
a horse-back, very well furnished for the way, with other three Lacquies that attended
on them. And as soon as they encountred, they saluted one another courteously, and
demanded whether they travelled; and knowing that they all went towards the place
of the buriall, they began their journey together. One of the horse-men speaking to his
companion, said, I think (Mr. <hi>Vivaldo)</hi> we shall account the time well imployed that
we shall stay to see this so famous an entertainment; for it cannot chuse but be famous
according to the wonderfull things these Sheepheards have recounted unto us, as well
of the dead Sheepheard, as also of the murthering Sheepheardesse. It seems so to mee
likewise, quoth <hi>Vivaldo.</hi> And I say, I would not only stay one day, but a whole week
rather then misse to behold it. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanded of them, what they had heard
of <hi>Marcela</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome?</hi> The Traveller answered, That they had encountred
that morning with those Sheepheards, and that by reason they had seen them apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in that mournfull attire, they demanded of them the occasion thereof, and one of
them rehearsed it, recounting the strangenesse and beauty of a certain Sheepheardesse
called <hi>Marcela;</hi> and the amorous pursuits of her by many, with the death of that
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> to whose buriall they rode. Finally, he told all that again to him, that
<hi>Peter</hi> had told the night before.</p>
                     <p>This discourse thus ended, another began, and was, that he who was called <hi>Vivaldo,</hi>
demanded of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> the occasion that moved him to travell thus armed through
so peaceable a countrey? To whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, the profession of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
doth not license or permit me to doe other: Good dayes, cockering and ease
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54746:30"/>
were invented for soft Courtiers; but Travell, Unrest, and Arms were only invented
and made for those which the world terms Knights Errant, of which number I my self
(although unworthy) am one, and the least of all. Scarce had they heard him say this,
when they all held him to be wood. And to find out the truth better, <hi>Viualdo</hi> did ask him
again, what meant the word <hi>Knights Errant?</hi> 
                        <q>Have you not read then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
the Histories and Annals of <hi>England,</hi> wherein are treated the famous acts of
King <hi>Arthur,</hi> whom we continually call in our <hi>Castilian Romance,</hi> King <hi>Artus?</hi>
of whom it is an ancient and common tradition in the Kingdome of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi>
that he never dyed, but that he was turned by art of Inchantment into a <hi>Crow;</hi> and
that in processe of time he shall return again to raign, and recover his Scepter and
Kingdom. For which reason, it cannot be proved, that ever since that time untill this,
any English man hath killed a Crow. In this good Kings time was first instituted
the famous order of Knighthood, of the Knights of the Round Table, and the love
that is there recounted, did in every respect passe as it is laid down between Sir <hi>Launce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
du Lake,</hi> and Queen <hi>Genever</hi> the honourable Lady <hi>Quintaniona</hi> being a dealer,
and privie thereto. Whence sprung that so famous a Dittie, and so celebrated here
in <hi>Spain</hi> of, <hi>Never was Knight of Ladies so well served as</hi> Launcelot <hi>when that hee in
Brittain arrived, &amp;c.</hi> with that progresse so sweet and delightfull of his amorous
and valiant Acts: And from that time forward, the Order of Knight went from
hand to hand, dilating and spreading it self through many and sundry parts of the
World. And in it were famous and renowned for their feats of Armes, the valiant
<hi>Amadis of Gaule,</hi> with all his progenie untill the fifth generation: and the valourous
<hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania;</hi> and the never-duely-praised <hi>Tirante the White,</hi> together
with Sir <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Hampton,</hi> Sir <hi>Gay</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Sir <hi>Eglemore,</hi> with diverse others
of that Nation and Age. And almost in our dayes we saw, and communed, and
heard of the invincible and valiant Knight <hi>Don Belianis of Greece!</hi> This then good
Sirs, is to be a Knight Errant; and that which I have said is the Order of Chivalry:
wherein, as I have already said, I, although a sinner, have made profession, and the
same doe I professe that those Knights professed, whom I have above mentioned;
and therefore I travell through these Solitudes and Desarts, seeking Adventures, with
full resolution to offer mine own Arm and Person to the most dangerous that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
shall present, in the aid of weak and needy persons.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By these reasons of <hi>Don-Quixot</hi>'s the travellers perfectly perceived that he was
none of the wisest, and knew the kinde of folly wherewithall he was crossed, whereat
those remained wonderfully admired: that by the relation of the others came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it: and <hi>Vivaldo</hi> who was very discreete, and likewise of a pleasant disposition,
to the end they might passe over the rest of the way without heavines unto the rock of
the buriall, which the Sheepheards said was neere at hand, he resolved to give him
further occasion to passe onward with his follies, and therefore said unto him. Me
thinkes, Sir Knight, that you have profest one of the most austere professions in the
world. And I doe constantly hold that even that of the <hi>Charterhouse Munkes</hi> is not
neer so straight. <q>It may bee as straight as our profession, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but
that it should be so necessary for the world, I am within the breadth of two fingers
to call it in doubt. For if we would speak a truth, the Souldier that puts in execution
his Captains command, doth no lesse then the very Captain that commands him.
Hence I infer, That Religious men doe with all peace and quietnesse seek of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the good of the Earth. But Souldiers and wee Knights doe put in execution
that which they demand, defending it with the valour of our Armes, and files of our
Swords: not under any roof; but under the wide Heavens, made as it were in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
a mark to the insupportable Sun beams, and in Winter to the rage of withering
Frosts. So that wee are the Ministers of God on earth, and the Armes wherewith
he executeh here his Justice. And as the Affairs of Warr, and things thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
cannot be put in execution without sweat, labour and travell; it follows
that those which professe warfare take questionlesse greater pain then those which in
quiet, peace, and rest doe pray unto God, that he will favour and assist those that need
<pb facs="tcp:54746:31"/>
it. I mean not therefore to affirm, nor doth it once passe through my
thought, that the state of a Knight Errant is as perfect as that of a retyred religious
man, but only would infer through that which I my self suffer, that it is doubtlesly
more laborious, more battered, hungry, thirsty, miserable, torn and lowsie. For the
Knights Errant of times past, did without all doubt, suffer much woe and misery in
the discourse of their life. And if some of them ascended at last to Empires, won by
the force of their life. And if some of them ascended at last to Empires, won by
the force of their Arms, in good faith it cost them a great part of their sweat and
blood: And if those which mounted to so high a degree had wanted those inchanters
and wise men that assisted them, they would have remained much defrauded of their
desires, and greatly deceived of their hopes.</q> I am of the same opinion, replyed the
Traveller: but one thing among many others hath seemed to me very ill in Knights
Errant, which is when they perceive themselves in any occasion to begin any great and
dangerous Adventure, in which appears manifest perill of losing their lives, they never
in the instant of attempting it remember to commend themselves to God, as every
Christian is bound to doe in like dangers; but rather doe it to their Ladies with so great
desire and devotion as if they were their Gods; a thing which in my opinion smells of
gentillisme. <q>Sir, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they can doe no lesse in any wise, and the
Knight Errant which did any other, would digresse much from his duty. For now
it is a received use and custome of errant Chivalry, that the Knight adventurous, who
attempting of any great feat of Arms shall have his Lady in place, do mildly and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
turn his eyes towards her, as it were by them demanding that she doe favour
and protect him in that ambiguous trance which he undertakes; and moreover if
none doe hear him, he is bound to say certain words between his teeth, by which he
shall with all his heart commend himself to her: and of this wee have innumerable
examples in Histories. Nor is it therefore to be understood that they doe omit to
commend themselves to God, for they have time and leisure enough to doe it, in the
progresse of the work.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For all that, replied the Traveller, there remains in me yet one scruple, which is, That
often times, as I have read, some speech begins between two Knights Errant, and from
one word to another their choler begins to be inflamed, and they to turn their horses,
and to take up a good piece of the Field, and without any more adoe, to run as fast as
ever they can drive to encounter again; and in the midest of their race, doe commend
themselves to their dames, and that which commonly ensues of this encountring is, that
one of them falls down, thrown over the crupper of his horse, past through and through
by his enemies Launce; and it befalls the other, that if he had not caught fast, of his
horse main, he had likewise faln. And I here cannot perceive how he that is slain had
any leisure to commend himself unto God in the discourse of this so accelerate and
hasty a work. Me thinks it were better that those words which he spent in his race on
his Lady, were bestowed as they ought, and as every Christian is bound to bestow them.
And the rather, because I conjecture, that all Knights Errant have not Ladies to whom
they may commend themselves; for all of them are not amorous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That cannot be, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I say it cannot be that there's any Knight
Errant without a Lady: For it is as proper and essentiall to such to be enamoured,
as to Heaven to have starrs: And I dare warrant that no History hath yet been seen,
wherein is found a Knight Errant without love: for by the very reason that he were
found without them, he would be convinced to be no legitimate Knight, but a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard;
and that he entred into the Fortresse of Chivalry, not by the Gate, but by
leaping over the <hi>Staccado</hi> like a Robber and a Thiefe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet notwithstanding, replied the other, I have read (if I doe not forget my self)
that <hi>Don Gataor,</hi> brother to the valourous <hi>Amadis du Gaule,</hi> had never any certain
Mistris, to whom he might commend himself; and yet for all that he was nothing lesse
accounted of, and was a most valiant and famous Knight. To that objection our <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
answered, One Swallow makes not a Summer. How much more that I
know, that the Knight whom you alledge, was secretly very much enamoured? besides
that that his inclination of loving all Ladies well, which he thought were fair, was a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54746:31"/>
naturall inclination, which hee could not govern so well. But it is in conclusion suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
verified, that yet hee had one Lady whom hee crowned Queen of his Will, to
whom hee did also commend himself very often and secretly, for he did not a little glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be so secret in his Loves.</p>
                     <p>Then Sir, if it bee of the essence of all Knights errant to bee in love, quoth the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
then may it likewise bee presumed that you are also enamoured, seeing that it is
annext to the profession? And if you doe not prize your selfe to bee as secret as <hi>Don
Gataor,</hi> I doe entreate you as earnestly as I may, in all this companies name and mine
owne, that it will please you to tell us the name, countrey, quality and beauty of your
Ladie, for I am sure shee would account her self happy to think that all the world doth
know shee is beloved and served by so worthy a Knight as is your self. <q>Here <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
breathing forth a deep sigh, said, I cannot affirm whether my sweet Enemy
delight or no, that the world know how much shee is beloved, or that I serve her.
Only I dare avouch (answering to that which you so courteously demanded) that
her name is <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> her countrey <hi>Toboso,</hi> a Village of <hi>Mancha:</hi> her calling must
bee at least of a Princesse, seeing shee is my Queene and Lady, her beauty soveraigne;
for in her are verified, and give glorious lustre to all those impossible and <hi>Chimericall</hi>
attributes of beauty, that <hi>Poets</hi> give to their Mistresses; that her haires are gold, her
forehead the Elisian fields, her browes the Arkes of Heaven, her Eyes Sunnes, her
cheekes Roses, her Lips Currall, her Teeth Pearles, her neck Alablaster, her Bosom
Marble, Ivory her Hands, and her whitenesse Snow; and the Parts which modesty
conceales from humane sight, such as I think and understand, that the discreet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
may prize, but never be able to equalize them: her linage, progeny, and
pedegree wee desire to know likewise, quoth <hi>Vivaldo.</hi> To which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
she is not of the ancient Romane <hi>Curcios, Cayes,</hi> or <hi>Scipios,</hi> nor of the
moderne <hi>Colomnas</hi> or <hi>Vrsinos,</hi> nor of the <hi>Moncadas</hi> or <hi>Requese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
of <hi>Catalunia,</hi> and much lesse of the <hi>Rebelias</hi> and <hi>Villanovas</hi> of <hi>Valencia, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foxes,
Nucas, Rocabertis, Corelias, Alagones, Vrreas, Fozes</hi> and <hi>Gurreas</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,
Cerdas, Manziquez, Mendocas,</hi> and <hi>Guzmanes</hi> of <hi>Castile, Lancasters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>
and <hi>Meneses</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but shee is of those of <hi>Toboso</hi> of the <hi>Mancha;</hi> a linage
which though it bee moderne is such as may give a generous beginning to the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
families of ensuing ages. And let none contradict mee in this, if it bee not
with those conditions that <hi>Cerbino</hi> put at the foote of <hi>Orlandoes</hi> Armour, To
wit:
<q>
                              <l>Let none from hence presume these Armes to move,</l>
                              <l>But hee that with <hi>Orlando</hi> dares his force to prove.</l>
                           </q>
                        </q>
Although my linage bee of the <hi>Cachopines</hi> of <hi>Laredo,</hi> replied the Traveller, yet dare I
not to compare it with that of <hi>Toboso</hi> in the <hi>Mancha,</hi> although to speake sinceerely, I
never heard any mention of that linage you say untill now, What quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
is it possible that you never heard of it till now?</p>
                     <p>All the company travelled, giving marveilous attention to the reasons of those two;
and even the very Goatheards and Sheepheards began to perceive the great want of
judgement that was in <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> only <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> did verily beleeve, that all his
Masters words were most true, as one that knew what hee was, from the very time of
his byrth. But that wherein his belief staggered somwhat, was of the beautifull <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea</hi>
of <hi>Toboso;</hi> for hee had never heard speake in his life before of such a name or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
although he had dwelled so many yeers hard by <hi>Toboso.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as they travelled in these discourses, they beheld discending betwixt the clift of
two loftie Mountaines to the number of twenty Sheepheards, all apparelled in skinnes
of black wooll, and crowned with Garlands; which as they perceived afterward,
were all of Ewe and Cypresse; sixe of them carried a Beere, covered with many sorts
of flowres and boughs. Which one of the Goatheards espying, hee said, those that
come there are they which bring <hi>Chrisostom's</hi> body, and the foote of that Mountain is
<pb facs="tcp:54746:32"/>
the place where hee hath commanded them to bury him. These words were occasion
to make them haste to arive in time; which they did just about the instant that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had said downe the Corps on the ground: and foure of them, with sharp pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes
did dig the Grave at the side of a hard Rock. The one and the others saluted
themselves very courteously, and then <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and such as came with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to behold the Beere, wherein they saw laid a dead body, all covered with flowres,
and apparelled like a Sheepheard of some thirty yeeres old; and his dead countenance
shewed that he was very beautifull and an able bodied man. He had placed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him in the Beer, certain Books, and many Papers, some open and some shut, and
altogether, as well those that beheld this, as they which made the grave; and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were present kept a marvellous silence, untill one of them which carried the
dead man, said to another; See well <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> whether this be the place that <hi>Crisostome</hi>
meant seeing that thou wouldest have all so punctually observed, which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Testament. This is it, answered <hi>Ambrosio;</hi> for many times my unfortunate
friend recounted to me in it the History of his mishaps; even there he told me that he
had seen that cruel enemy of mankinde first; and there it was, where he first broak his
affection to as honest as they were amorous: and there was the last time wherein <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cela</hi>
did end to resolve, and began to disdain him, in such sort that shee set end to
the Tragedie of his miserable life. And here in memory of so many misfortunes he
commanded himself to be committed to the bowels of eternall oblivion, and turning
himself to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and to the other Travellers, he said: This body Sirs which
you doe now behold with pittifull eyes, was the depository of a soul wherein heaven
had hourded up an infinite part of his Treasures. This is the body of <hi>Crisostome,</hi> who
was peerlesse in wit, without fellow for courtesie, rare for comlinesse, a Phoenix for
friendship, magnificent without measure, grave without presumption, pleasant without
offence; and finally, the first in all that which is good, and second to none in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
mischances. He loved well, and was hated; he adored, and was disdained;
hee prayed to one no lesse savage then a Beast; he importuned a heart as hard a Marble;
he pursued the Winde; he cryed to Desarts; he served Ingratitude; and he obteyned
for reward, the spoyles of death in the mid'st of the carier of his life: to which a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesse
hath given end whom he laboured to eternize, to the end she might ever live
in the memories of men, as those papers which you see there might very well prove, had
he not commanded me to sacrifice them to the fire, as soon as his body was rendred to
the earth.</p>
                     <p>If you did so, quoth <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> you would use greater rigour and cruelty towards them
then their very Lord, nor is it discreet or justly done, that his will be accomplished,
who commands any thing repugnant to reason. Nor should <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> himself
have gained the reputation of wisedome, if he had permited that to be put in execution
which the divine <hi>Mantuan</hi> had by his will ordeined. So that Seignior <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> now
that you commit your friends body to the earth, doe not therefore commit his labour
to oblivion: for though he ordeined it as one injured, yet are not you to accomplish it,
as one void of discretion: but rather cause, by giving life to these papers, that the
cruelty of <hi>Marcela</hi> may live eternally, that it may serve as a document to those that
shall breath in insuing ages, how they may avoid and shun the like downfalls: For
both my self and all those that come here in my companie, doe already know the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of your enamoured and despairing friend; the occasion of his death; and what
hee commanded e're he deceased: out of which lamentable relation may be collected,
how great hath been the Crnelty of <hi>Marcela;</hi> the Love of <hi>Crisostome;</hi> the Faith of
your Affection, and the Conclusion which those make, which doe rashly run through
that way, which indiscreet Love doth present to their view. We understood yester
night of <hi>Crisostomes</hi> death, and that he should be enterred in this place; and therefore
we omitted our intended journies both for curiosity and pittie, and resolved to come
and behold with our eyes that, the relation whereof did so much grieve us in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And therefore wee desire thee (discreet <hi>Ambrosio)</hi> both in reward of this our
compassion, and also of the desire which springs in our breasts to remedie this disaster,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54746:32"/>
if it were possible: but chiefly I for my part request thee, that omitting to burn these
Papers, thou wilt license me to take away some of them. And saying so, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the Sheepheards answer, he stretched out his hand and took some of them that
were next to him. Which <hi>Ambrosio</hi> perceiving, said, I will consent Sir for courtesies
sake, that you remain Lord of those which you have seized upon; but to imagine that
I would omit to burn these that rest, were a very vain thought. <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> who did long
to see what the Papers contained which he had gotten, did unfold presently one of them
which had this title, <hi>A Dittie of despair. Ambrosio</hi> overheard him, and said; That is
the last paper which this unfortunate Sheepheard wrote; and because Sir, that you
may see the terms to which his mishaps conducted him; I pray you to read it; but in
such manner as you may be heard; for you shall have leisure enough to doe it whil'st
the grave is a diging. I will doe it with all my heart, replyed <hi>Vivaldo;</hi> and all those that
were present, having the like desire, they gathered about him; and he reading it with a
cleer voyce pronounced it thus.</p>

                        <hi>Chrisostomes Canzone</hi> liked wonderfully all the hearers, although the reader thereof
affirmed that it was not conformable to the relation that he had received ef <hi>Marcelaes</hi>
virtue and care of her self. For in it <hi>Crisostome</hi> did complain of jealousies, suspicions,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:34"/>
and absence, being all of them things that did prejudice <hi>Marcelaes</hi> good fame. To this
objection <hi>Ambrosio</hi> answered (as one that knew very well the most hidden secrets of
his friend) you must understand Sir, to the end you may better satisfie your own doubt,
That when the unfortunate Sheepheard wrote that <hi>Canzone,</hi> he was absent from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cela;</hi>
from whose presence he had wittingly withdrawn himself, to see if he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
some part of his excessive passions, procured by absence. And as every thing doth
vex an absent Lover, and every fear afflict him; so was <hi>Crisostome</hi> likewise tormented
by imagined jealousies and feared suspicions, as much as if they were reall and true. And
with this remains the truth in her perfection and poynt of <hi>Marcelaes</hi> virtue; who
excepting that she is cruel, and somewhat arrogant, and very disdainfull; very envy it
self neither ought, nor can attaint her of the least defect. You have reason, quoth
<hi>Vivaldo,</hi> and so desiring to read another paper, he was interrupted by a marvellous vision
(for such it seemed) that unexpectedly offered it self to their view: Which was, That
on the top of the Rock wherein they made the grave, appeared the Sheepheardesse
<hi>Marcela,</hi> so fair, that her beauty surpassed far the fame that was spread thereof; such as
had not beheld her before, did look on her then with admiration and silence; and those
which were wont to view her remained no lesse suspended then the others, which never
had seen her. But scarce had <hi>Ambrosio</hi> eyed her, when with an irefull &amp; disdaining minde,
he spake these words. Com'st thou by chance, O fierce Basilisk of these Mountains!
to see whether the wounds of this wretch will yet bleed at thy presence? Or doest thou
come to insult and vaunt in the Tragicall feats of thy stern nature? Or to behold from
that height, like another mercilesse <hi>Nero,</hi> the Fire of inflamed <hi>Rome?</hi> Or arrogantly
to trample this infortunate Carkasse, as the ingratefull daughter did her father <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin's?</hi>
Tell us quickly, why thou commest, or what thou doest most desire? For
seeing I know that <hi>Crisostomes</hi> thoughts never disobeyed thee in life, I will likewise
cause that all those his friends shall serve and reverence thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I come not here, good <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> to any of those ends thou sayest, quoth <hi>Marcela;</hi>
but only to turn for mine honour, and give the world to understand, how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
have all those which make me the Authour eyther of their own pains, or of <hi>Criso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom's</hi>
death; and therefore I desire all you that be here present, to lend attention unto
me; for I mean not to spend much time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> or words, to perswade to the disceet, so
manifest a truth. Heaven, as you say, hath made me beautifull, and that so much
that my feature moves you to love, almost whether you will or no. And for the
affection you shew unto me, you say I and you affirm, that I ought to love you again: I
know by the naturall instinct that <hi>Iove</hi> hath bestowed on me, That each fair thing is
amiable: but I cannot conceive, why, for the reason of being beloved, the partie
that is so beloved for her beauty, should be bound to love her Lover, although he bee
foul. And seeing that foul things are worthy of hate, It is a bad argument to say,
I love thee because fair; and therefore thou must affect me although uncomely. But
set the case that the beauties occur equall on both sides, it follows not therefore,
that their desires should run one way: For all beauties doe not enamour; for some
doe only delight the sight, and subject not the will: For if all beauties did enamour
and subject together, mens wills would ever run confused and straying, without being
able to make any election; for the beautifull subjects being infinite, the desires must
also perforce be infinite: And as I have heard, true Love brooks no division, and
must needs be voluntary, and not inforced. Which being so, as I presume it is; why
would you have me subject my will forcibly, without any other obligation then that,
that you say you love me? If not, tell me: If heaven had made me foul, as it hath
made me beautifull, Could I justly complain of you because you affected me not? How
much more, seeing you ought to consider, that I did not chuse the beauty I have;
for, such as it is, heaven bestow'd it <hi>gratis,</hi> without my demanding or electing it. And
even as the Viper deserves no blame for the poyson she carries, although therewithall
she kill, seeing it was bestowed on her by nature: So doe I as little merit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
because beautifull; for beauty in an honest woman is like fire a far off,
or a sharp edged Sword; for neither that burns nor this cuts any but such as come
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54746:34"/>
neer them. Honour and Virtues are the ornaments of the Soul, without which, the
fairest body is not to be esteemed such. And if that honesty be one of the virtues that
adorneth and beautifieth most the body and Soul; Why should shee that is beloved,
because fair, adventure the losse thereof, to answer his intention, which only for his
pleasures sake labours that she may lose it, with all his force and industry? I was born
free, and because I might live freely, I made election of the solitude of the Fields:
The Trees of these mountains are my companions; the cleer water of these streams
my mirrours. With the Trees and Waters I communicate my thoughts and beauty:
I am a parted Fire, and a Sword laid aloofe. Those whom I have enamoured with
my sight, I have undeceived with my words. And if desires be susteined by hopes,
I never having given any to <hi>Chrisostome</hi> or to any other, it may well be said, that he
was rather slain by his own obstinacy, then by my cruelty. And if I be charged that
his thoughts were honest; and that I was therefore oblieged to answer unto them:
I say, that when in that very place where you make his Sepulchre, he first broak
his minde unto mee: I told him that mine intention was to live in perpetuall soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and that only the earth should gather the fruits of my solitarinesse, and the
spoyles of my beauty. And if he would after this my resolution persist obstinately
without all hope, and against the winde; what wonder is it that he should be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the mid'st of the Gulf of his rashnesse? If I had entertained him, then were I
false: If I had pleased him, then should I doe against my better purposes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
He strived being perswaded to the contrary: He dispaired e're he was hated.
See then if it be reason that I bear the blame of his torment. Let him complain who
hath been deceived: Let him dispair to whom his promised hopes have failed: Let
him confesse it whom I shall ever call: Let him vaunt whom I shall admit. But let
him not call me cruell or an homicide, whom I never promised, deceived, called, or
admitted. Heaven hath not yet ordeined that I should Love by destiny; and to
think that I will doe it by election may be excused. And let this generall caveat serve
every one of those which sollicite me for his particular benefit: And let it he known,
that if any shall hereafter dye for my Love, that he dies not jealous or unfortunate:
For whosoever loves not any, breeds not in reason jealousie in any; nor should any
resolutions to any be accounted disdaynings. He that calls me a Savage and Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk,
let him shun me as a hurtfull and prejudiciall thing. He that calls me ungratefull,
let him not serve me. Hee that's strange, let him not know me. He that's cruell, let
him not follow me: For this Savage, this Basilisk, this Ingrate, this Cruell and
Strange one, will neither seek, serve, know, or pursue any of them. For if <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes</hi>
impatience and headlong desire slew him; why should mine honest proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and care be inculped therewithall? If I preserve mine integrity in the society of
these Trees; why would any desire me to lose it, seeing every one covets to
have the like himself, to converse the better among men? I have, as you all know,
riches enough of mine own, and therefore doe not covet other mens. I have a free
condition, and I doe not please to subject me: Neither doe I love or hate any. I
doe not deceive this man, or sollicite that other; Nor doe I jest with one, &amp; passe
the time with another. The honest conversation of the <hi>Pastoraes</hi> of these Villages,
and the care of my Goats doe entertain me. My desires are limited by these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
and if they doe issue from hence, it is to contemplate the beauty of Heaven,
steps wherewithall the Soul travells toward her first dwelling.</q> And ending here,
without desiring to hear any answer, she turned her back and entred into the thickest
part of the wood, that was there at hand, leaving all those that were presently marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
admired at her beauty &amp; discretion.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Sheepheards present, that were wounded by the powerfull beams of her
beautifull eyes, made profer to pursue her, without reaping any profit out of her mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
resolution made there in their hearing; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> noting, and thinking
that the use of this Chivalry did jump fitly with that occasion, by succouring distressed
Damzels, laying hand on the pommell of his sword, he said in loud and intelligible
words: <q>Let no person of whatsoever state or condition he be, presume to follow
<pb facs="tcp:54746:35"/>
the fair <hi>Marcela,</hi> under pain of falling into my furious indignation. Shee hath
shewn by cleer and sufficient reasons, the little or no fault she had in <hi>Crisostomes</hi>
death, and how far she lives from meaning to condescend to the desires of any of her
Lovers; for which respect it is just, that instead of being pursued and persecuted, she
be honoured and esteemed by all the good men of the world; for she shews in it,
that it is only she alone that lives therein with honest intention.</q> Now whether it was
through <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> menaces, or whether because <hi>Ambrosio</hi> requested them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with the obligation they ought to their good friend: none of the Sheepheards
moved or departed from thence untill the grave being made, and <hi>Crisostomes</hi> Papers
burned, they laid the body into it, with many tears of the beholders. They shut the
Sepulchre with a great stone, untill a Monument were wrought, which <hi>Ambrosio</hi> said
he went to have made, with an Epitaph to this sense.
<q>
                           <l>HEre, of a loving Swain,</l>
                           <l>The Frozen Carkasse lies;</l>

                           <l>And dyed through disdain.</l>
                           <l>Stern rigour hath him slain,</l>

                           <l>By whom love doth dilate</l>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They presently strewed on the grave many flowers and boughs, and every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling
a while with his friend <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> did afterward bid him farewell, and departed.
The like did <hi>Vivaldo</hi> and his companion: And <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> bidding his Hoste and
the Travellers adieu, they requested him to come with them to <hi>Sivill,</hi> because it was a
place so fit for the finding of Adventures, as in every street and corner thereof are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more then in any other place whatsoever. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rendred them thanks for
their advice, and the good will they seemed to have to gratifie him, and said, he neither
ought nor would goe to <hi>Sivill,</hi> untill he had freed all those Mountains of Theeves
and Robbers, whereof, as fame ran, they were full. The Travellers perceiving his
good intention, would not importune him more; but bidding him again farewell, they
departed, and followed on their journey; in which they wanted not matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
as well of the History of <hi>Marcela</hi> and <hi>Crisostome,</hi> as of the follies of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
who determined to goe in the search of the Sheepheardesse <hi>Marcela,</hi> and
offer unto her, all that he was able to doe in her service: But it befell him not as he
thought, as shall be rehearsed in the discourse of this true Historie. Giving end here to

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE wise <hi>Cyd Hamete Venengeli</hi> recounteth, that as soone as
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had taken leave of the Goatheards, his Hostes,
the night before, and of all those that were present at the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of the Sheep-heard <hi>Crysostome;</hi> hee and his Squire did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
enter into the same Wood, into which they had seen the
beautifull Sheepheardesse <hi>Marcela</hi> enter before; And having
travelled in it about the space of two houres without finding of
her, they arived in fine to a pleasant Meadow, inriched with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of flourishing grasse, neere unto which runnes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
and refreshing streame, which did invite, yea constraine them thereby to passe
over the heat of the day, which did then beginne to enter with great fervor and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> alighted, and leaving the Asse and <hi>Rozinante</hi> to the
spaciousnesse of these Plaines, to feede on the plenty of grasse that was there, they ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sackt
their Wallet, where without any ceremonie the master and man did eate with
good accord and fellowship, what they found therein. <hi>Sancho</hi> had neglected to tie <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi>
sure, that hee knew him to bee so sober and little wanton, as all the Mares of
the Pasture of <hi>Cordova</hi> could not make him to think the least sinister thought. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
did ordain, or rather the Devill who sleeps not at all houres, that a Troope of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Mares, belonging to certain <hi>Yanguesian</hi> Carriers, did feed up and down in the same
Valley: which Carriers are wont, with their beasts, to passe over the heates in places
situated neere unto grasse and water. And that wherein <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hapned to bee,
was very fit for their purpose. It therefore befell that <hi>Rozinante</hi> tooke a certain desire
to sollace himself with the Lady Mares, and therefore as soone as hee had smelt them,
abandoning his naturall pace and custome, without taking leave of his Master, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
a little swift trot, and went to communicate his necessities to them. But they,
who as it seemed, had more desire to feede then to sollace them, entertained him with
their heeles and teeth, in such sort, as they broke all his gyrts, and left him in his naked
hayre, having overthrown the Saddle. But that which surely grieved him most was,
that the Carriers perceiving the violence that was offered by him to their Mares, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:54746:36"/>
presently to their succours, with clubs and truncheons, and did so belabour him,
as they farely laid him along. Now in this season <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the bombasting of <hi>Rozinante)</hi> approached breathlesse, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said to
<hi>Sancho,</hi> for as much as I can perceive friend <hi>Sancho</hi> these men are no Knights, but base
rascally people of vile quality: I say it, because thou mayst help mee to take due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for the outrage which they have done before our face to <hi>Rozinante.</hi> What a divel
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what revenge should wee take, if these bee more then twenty, and wee
but two, and peradventure but one and a half. I am worth a hundred, replied
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and without making any longer discourse, hee set hand to his sword, and
flew upon the <hi>Yanguesians,</hi> and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> moved by his Lords example did the like:
when with the first blow <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> piercing a buffe coate that one of them wore,
wounded him grievously in the shoulder. The <hi>Yanguesians</hi> seeing themselves so rudely
handled by two men only, they being so many, ran to the stakes and truncheons of
their Carriage, and hemming in their Adversaries in the midst of them. they laid on
them with admirable speede and vehemency. True it is that at the second Peale they
struck <hi>Sancho</hi> downe to the ground, and the like hapned to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> his dexterity
and courage being nothing availeable in that traunce; and his fate so ordayning hee fell
just at his Coursers feete, who had not yet gotten up; by which wee may ponder the
fury wherewithall truncheons batter, being placed in wrathfull and rusticall fists. The
Carriers perceiving the evill they had committed, trussing up their loading with all
possible speede, followed on their way, leaving both the Adventurers in a bad fashion,
and a worse talent. The first that came to himself was <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who seeing his
Lord neere unto him, said with a weake and pittifull voice, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote!</hi> O Sir
<hi>Don-Quixote!</hi> what wouldst thou have brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied the Knight, with the
like efeminate and dolefull tune? I would, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> have of your worship, a draught
or two of the liquor of <hi>Feoblas,</hi> if you have any of it at hand, perhaps it is good to cure
broken bones, as well as it helps wounds, What would wee want, unhappy that I am
replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if I had it here, but I sweare unto these <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> by the
faith of a Knight errant, that before two daies passe (if fortune dispose not otherwise)
I will have it in my power, or it shall hardly escape my hands. I pray you, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
within how many dayes think you shall wee bee able to stirre our feete? I can say
of my selfe, quoth the crushed Knight, that I cannot set a certain term to the dayes of
our recovery, but I am in the fault of all; for I should not have drawn my Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
men that are not Knights, as well as I am, and therefore I beleeve that the God
of Battels hath permitted that this punishment should bee given unto mee, in paine of
transgressing the lawes of Knighthood. Wherefore brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> it is requisite that
thou beest advertized of that which I shall say unto thee now, for it importeth both our
goods very much, and is, that when thou beholdest that the like rascally Rabble doe us
any wrong, doe not wait till I set hand to my Sword against them; for I will not doe
it in any sort: But draw thou thine and chastise them at thy pleasure; and if any
Knights shall come to their assistance and succour, I shall know then how to defend
thee, and offend them with all my force, for thou hast by this perceived by a thousand
signes and experiences, how far the valour of this mine invincible Arme extendeth it
self (so arrogant remained the poore Knight, through the victory hee had gotten of the
hardy <hi>Biscaine.)</hi> But this advice of his Lord seemed not so good to <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> as
that hee would omit to answere unto him, saying, Sir, I am a peaceable, quiet and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
man, and can dissemble any injury, for I have wife and children to maintaine and
bring up; wherefore let this likewise bee an advice to you (seeing it cannot be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement)
that I will not set hand to my Sword in any wise, bee it against Clowne
or Knight; and that from this time forward, I doe pardon, before God, all the
wrongs that they have done, or shall doe unto mee, whether they were, bee, or shall
bee done by high or low person, rich or poore, Gentleman or Churle, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any state or condition. Which being heard by his Lord, hee said; I could wish to
have breath enough, that I might answere thee with a little more case, or that the griefe
which I feele in this rib were asswaged ever so little, that I might <hi>Panca</hi> make thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54746:36"/>
the errour wherein thou art. Come here poor fool, if the gale of fortune hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
so contrarie, doe turn in our favour swelling the sayles of our desire in such sort
as we may securely and without any hindrance arrive at the Haven of any of those
Islands, which I have promised unto thee; what would become of thee, if I conquering
it, did make thee Lord thereof, seeing thou wouldest disable thy self in respect thou are
not a Knight, nor desirest to be one, nor wouldest have valour or will to revenge thine
injuries, or to defend thy Lordships? For thou must understand, that in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Provinces newly conquered, the minds of the Inhabitants are never so
throughly appeased or weded to the affection of their new Lord, that it is not to be
feared, that they will worke some noveltie to alter things again, and turn, as men say,
afresh to trie Fortune. And it is therefore requisite that the new possessor have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to Govern, and valour to offend, and defend himself in any Adventure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
In this last that hath befaln us, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and valour of which you speak; but I vow unto you, by the faith of a poor
man, that I am now fitter for plaisters then discourses. I pray you try whether you
can arise, and we will help <hi>Rozinante,</hi> although he deserves it not; for he was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
cause of all these troubles; I would never have believed the like before of <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante,</hi>
whom, I ever held to be as chaste and peaceable a person as my self. In fine, they
say well, that one must have a long time to come to the knowledge of bodies; and that
there's nothing in this life secure.</p>
                     <p>Who durst affirm that after those mightie blows which you gave to that unfortunate
Knight Errant, would succeede so in poste, and as it were in your pursuit this so furious
a tempest of staves, that hath discharged it on our shoulders? Thine <hi>Sancho,</hi>

grief of this disgrace. And were it not that I imagine, (but why doe I say imagine?)
I know certainly that all these incommodities are annex'd to the exercise of Armes, I
would here dye for very wrath and displeasure. To this the Squire answered, Sir, seeing
these disgraces are of the <hi>[Cosecha]</hi> essence of Knighthood, I pray you whether they
succeed very often, or whether they have certain times limited wherein they befall?
For me thinks within two Adventures more, we shall wholly remain dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>abled for
the third, if the Gods in mercy doe not succour us. Know friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> That the life of Knights Errant is subject to a thousand dangers and
misfortunes: And it is also as well in the next degree and power to make them Kings
and Emperours, as experience hath shewn in sundry Knights, of whose Histories I have
intire notice. And I could recount unto thee now (did the pain I suffer permit me) of
some of them which have mounted to those high degrees which I have said, only by the
valour of their Arm. And the very same men found them both before and after, in divers
miseries and calamities. For the valorus <hi>Amadis of Gaule</hi> saw himself in the power
of his mortall enemie <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the Inchanter, of whom the opinion runs infallible,
that he gave unto him, being his prisoner, more then two hundred stripes with his horse
bridle, after he had tyed him to a pillar in his base-Court. And there is moreover a
secret Authour of no little credit, who sayes, That the <hi>Cavalier del Febo,</hi> being taken in
a Gin, like unto a snatch, that slipt under his feet in a certain Castle, after the fall found
himself in a deep Dungeon under the earth, bound hands and feet; and there they gave
unto him a Glister of Snow-water and Sand, which brought him almost to the end
of his life; And were it not that he was succoured in that great distresse, by a wise man
his very great friend, it had gone ill with the poor Knight. So that I may very well
passe among so many worthy persons; for the dangers and disgraces they suffered
were greater then those which we doe now indure. For, <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would have thee to
understand, That these wounds which are given to one, with those instruments that
are in ones hand, by chance, doe not disgrace a man: And it is written in the Laws
of single combat, in expresse terms, That if the Shoe-maker strike another with the Last
which he hath in his hand, although it be certainly of wood; yet cannot it be said, That
he who was stricken, had the Bastanado. I say this, to the end thou may'st not think,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:37"/>
although we remain bruised in this last conflict, that therefore we be disgraced; for the
armes which those men bore, and wherewithall they laboured us, were none other then
their pack-staves, and as far as I can remember, never a one of them had a tuck, sword
or dagger. They gave mee no leisure, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> to looke to them so neerely,
for scarce had I laid hand on my Trunchant, when they blist my shoulders with their
Pines, in such sort as they wholly deprived mee of my sight and the force of my feet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
striking mee down on the place where I yet lie straught, and where the pain of
the disgrace received by our Cudgeling doth not so much pinch mee, as the grief of the
blowes, which shall remaine as deeply imprinted in my memorie as they doe in my back.
For all this thou shalt understand brother <hi>Panca,</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that there is no
remembrance which time will not end, nor grief which death will not consume. What
greater misfortune quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> can there bee then that which only expecteth time
and death to end and consume it? If this our disgrace were of that kinde which might
bee cured by a payre or two of Playsters, it would not bee so evill; but I begin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that all the salves of an Hospitall will not suffice to bring them to any good terms.
Leave off <hi>Sancho,</hi> and gather strength out of weakenesse, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for so
will I likewise doe, and let us see how doth <hi>Rozinante;</hi> for mee thinks that the lest part
of this mishap hath not faln to his lot: You ought not to marvell at that, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
seeing hee is likewise a Knight errant; that whereat I wonder is that mine Asse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
there without payment, where wee are come away without Ribs. Fortune
leaves alwaies one dore open in disasters, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whereby to remedie
them. I say it, because that little beast may supply <hi>Rozinanties</hi> want, by carrying of
mee from hence unto some Castle, wherein I may bee cured of my wounds. Nor doe
I hold this kinde of riding dishonourable; for I remember to have read that the good
old <hi>Silenus</hi> tutor of the merry God of laughter, when hee entred into the Citie of the
hundred gates, rode very fairly mounted on a goodly Asse. It is like, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
that hee rode as you say upon an Asse; but there is great difference betwixt riding and
being cast athwart upon one like a Sack of rubbish. To this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered,
The wounds that are received in Battell, doe rather give honour then deprive men of it.
Wherefore friend <hi>Panca</hi> doe not reply any more unto mee, but as I have said, arise as
well as thou canst, and lay mee as thou pleasest upon thy beast, and let us depart from
hence before the night overtake us in these Desarts. Yet I have heard you say, quoth
<hi>Panca,</hi> that it was an ordinary custome of Knights errant to sleepe in Downes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts
the most of the yeere, and that so to doe they hold for very good hap. That is,
said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> when they have none other shift, or when they are in Love; and
this is so true as that there hath been a Knight that hath dwelt on a Rock, exposed to the
Sunne, and the Shadow, and other annoyances of Heaven, for the space of two yeeres,
without his Ladies knowledge, and <hi>Amadis</hi> was one of that kind, when calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Beltinebros</hi> hee dwelt in the <hi>Poore Rock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> nor doe I know punctually eight yeeres or
eight moneths, for I doe not remember the History well; let it suffice that there hee
dwelt doing of penance, for some disgust which I know not, that his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> did
him. But leaving that apart <hi>Sancho,</hi> dispatch and away before some other disgrace
happen, like that of <hi>Rozinante</hi> to the Asse. Even there lurks the Devill, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
and so breathing thirty sobs, and threescore sighes, and a hundred and twenty discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and execrations against him that had brought him there, hee arose, remayning
bended in the midst of the way, like unto a Turkish bow, without being able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
himself; and notwithstanding all this difficulty, hee harnessed his Asse (who had
been also somwhat distracted by the overmuch liberty of that day) and after he hoysted
up <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who were he endowed with a tongue to complain, would certainly have
borne his Lord and <hi>Sancho</hi> companie. In the end <hi>Sancho</hi> laid <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> on the
Asse, and tied <hi>Rozinante</hi> unto him, and leading the Asse by the halter, travelled that
way which hee deemed might conduct him soonest toward the high way. And fortune
which guided his affaires from good to better, after hee had travelled a little league,
discovered it unto him, neere unto which hee saw an Inne, which in despight of him,
and for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> pleasure must needes bee a Castle, <hi>Sancho</hi> contended that it was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54746:37"/>
an Inne, and his Lord that it was not; and their controversie indured so long, as they
had leisure before they could decide it to arive at the lodging; into which <hi>Sancho</hi>
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
farther verifying of the dispute, entred with all his loading.</p>

of <hi>Sancho</hi> what disease he had? <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, that it was
nothing but a fall down from a Rock, and that his Ribs were thereby
somewhat bruised. This Inn-keeper had a wife, not of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that those of that trade are wont to be; for she was of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
nature, and would grieve at the calamities of her neighbours,
and did therefore presently occur to cure <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> causing
her daughter, a very comely young maiden, to assist her to cure her Guest. There like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
served in the Inn an <hi>Asturian</hi> wench, who was broad-faced, flat-pated, sadle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosed,
blinde of one eye, and the other almost out, true it is, that the comelinesse of
her body supplied all the other defects: She was not seven palmes long from her feet
unto her head; and her shoulders, which did somewhat burden her, made her look
oftner to the ground then she would willingly. This beautifull piece did assist the
young maiden and both of them made a very bad bed for <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in an old wide
chamber, which gave manifest tokens of it self, that it had sometimes served many yeers
only to keep chopt straw for horses: in which was also lodged a Carrier, whose bed
was made a little way off from <hi>Don-Quixotes,</hi> which though it was made of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasse,
and coverings of his Mules, was much better then the Knights, that only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
four boards roughly plained, placed on two unequall tressels; A flock-Bed,
which in the thinnest seemed rather a Quilt, full of pellets; and had not they shewn
that they were wooll, through certain breaches made by antiquity on the Tick, a man
would by the hardnesse rather take them to be stones; a pair of sheets made of the
skins of Targets; a coverlet, whose threds if a man would number, he should not lose
one only of the account.</p>
                     <p>In this ungracious bed did <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lie, and presently the Hostesse and her
daughter anoint him all over, and <hi>Maritornes</hi> (for so the <hi>Asturian</hi> wench was
called) did hold the candle. The Hostesse at the plaistring of him, perceiving him to be
so bruised in Sundry places, she said unto him, that those signes rather seemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of blows then of a fall. They were not blows, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> but the Rock had
many sharp ends and knobs on it, whereof every one left behinde it a token; And I
desire you good Mistrisse, quoth he, to leave some flax behinde, and there shall not
want one that needeth the use of them; for I assure you my back doth likewise ake.
If that be so, quoth the Hostesse, it is likely that thou didest also fall. I did not fall,
quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> but with the suddain affright that I took at my Masters fall, my
body doth so grieve me, as me thinks I have been handsomely belaboured. It may
well happen as thou saiest, quoth the Hostesses daughter; for it hath befaln me sundry
times to dream, that I fell down from some high Tower, and could never come to the
ground; and when I awaked, I did finde my self so troubled and broken, as if I had
verify faln. There is the point Masters, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that I without dreaming
at all; but being more awake then I am at this hour, found my self to have very few
lesse tokens and marks then my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hath. How is this Gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:54746:38"/>
called? quoth <hi>Maritornes</hi> the <hi>Asturian. Don-Quixote of the Mancha,</hi> replyed
<hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and he is a Knight Errant, and one of the best and strongest that have
been seen in the world these many ages. What is that, a Knight Errant? quoth the
wench. Art thou so young in the world, that thou knowest it not? answered <hi>Sancho
Panca.</hi> Know then sister mine, that a Knight Errant is a thing, which in two words
you see well cudgelled, and after becomes an Emperour. To day he is the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
creature of the world, and the most needy; and to morrow he will have
two or three Crowns of Kingdoms to bestow upon his Squire. If it be so, quoth the
Hostesse; why then hast not thou gotten at least an Earldome, seeing thou art this good
Knight his Squire? It is yet too soon, replyed <hi>Sancho;</hi> for it is but a moneth sithence
we began first to seek Adventures; and we have not yet encountred any worthy of the
name. And sometimes it befalls, that searching for one thing we encounter another.
True it is, that if my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> recover of this wound or fall, and that I be not
changed by it, I would not make an exchange of my hopes for the best title of Spain.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did very attentively listen unto all these discourses, and siting up in his
Bed, as well as he could, taking his Hostesse by the hand; he said unto her: <q>Believe
me, beautifull Lady, that you may count your self fortunate, for having harboured
my person in this your Castle, which is such, that if I doe not praise it; it is because
men say, that proper praise stinks; but my Squire will inform you what I am: only
this I will say my self, That I will keep eternally written in my memory the service
that you have done unto me, to be gratefull unto you for it whilest I live. And I
would it might please the highest Heavens that Love held me not so enthral'd and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his Laws as he doth, and to the eyes of that ingratefull fair, whose name I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
mutter, then should those of this beautifull Damzell presently signiorize my
Libertie.</q> The Hostesse, her daughter, and the good <hi>Maritornes</hi> remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
hearing the Speech of our Knight Errant, which they understood as well
as if he spoken Greek unto them; but yet they conceived that they were words of
complements and Love, and as people unused to hear the like language, they beheld
and admired him, and he seemed unto them a man of the other world; and so return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him thanks with Tavernly phrase for his large offers, they departed. And the
<hi>Asturian Maritornes</hi> cured <hi>Sancho,</hi> who needed her help no lesse then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
                     <p>The Carrier and shee had agreed to passe the night together, and she had given unto
him her word, that when the Guests were quiet and her Master sleeping, she would
come unto him and satisfie his desire, as much as he pleased. And it is said of this
good wench, that she never passed the like promise, but that she performed it, although
it were given in the mid'st of a wood, and without any witnesse; for she presumed to
be of gentle blood; and yet she held it no disgrace to serve in an Inn; for she was
wont to affirm, that disgraces and misfortunes brought her to that state. The hard,
narrow, niggard, and counterfeit Bed, whereon <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lay, was the first of the
four, and next unto it was his Squires, that only conteined a Mat and a Coverlet, and
rather seemed to be of shorn Canvasse then Wooll: After these two Beds followed that
of the Carrier, made, as we have said, of the Pannels and Furniture of two of his best
Mules, although they were twelve all in number, fair, fat, and goodly beasts; for he
was one of the richest Carriers of <hi>Arevalo,</hi> as the Authour of this History affirmeth,
who maketh particular mention of him, because he knew him very well, <hi>[Here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
taxeth some one cunningly to be descended of a Moorish race]</hi> and besides some
men say, that he was somewhat a kinn unto him. Omitting that <hi>Cid Mahamat Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nengeli</hi>
was a very exact Historiographer, and most curious in all things, as may be
gathered very well, seeing that those which are related being so minute and triviall, he
would not overslip them in silence.</p>
                     <p>By which those grave Historiographers may take example, which recount unto us
matters so short and succinctly, as they doe scarce arrive to our knowledge, leaving
the most substantiall part of the works drowned in the Inkhorne, either through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
malice, or ignorance. Many good fortunes beside the Authour of <hi>Tablante de

Tomillas,</hi> Lord with what precisenesse doe they describe every circumstance? to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I say, that after the Carrier had visited his Mules, and given unto them their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
refreshing, hee stretched himselfe in his Coverlets, and expected the coming of
the most exquisite <hi>Maritornes. Sancho</hi> was also, by this, plaistred and laid downe in
his bed, and though hee desired to sleepe, yet would not the grief of his ribs permit
him. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with the paine of his sides, lay with both his eyes open, like a
Hare. All the Inne was drowned in silence, and there was no other light in it then that
of a Lampe, which hung lighted in the midst of the entry. This marvailous quietnesse
and the thoughts which alwaies represented to our Knight the memory of the successes
which at every pace are recounted in books of Knighthood (the principall Authors of
this mishap) called to his imagination one of the strangest follies that easily may bee
conjectured; which was, hee imagined that hee arived to a famous Castle (for as wee
have said, all the Innes wherein hee lodged seemed unto him to bee such) and that the
Inkeepers daughter (daughter to the Lord of the Castle) who, overcome by his comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and valour, was enamoured of him, and had promised that shee would come to
solace with him for a good space, after her Father and Mother had gone to bed. And
holding all this chymera and fiction, which hee himself had built in his brain, for most
firm and certain, he began to be vexed in minde, and to think on the dangerous trance,
wherein his honesty was like to fall, and did firmly purpose in heart not to commit any
disloyalty against his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> although very <hi>Queen Genever,</hi> with her
Lady <hi>Queintanonina,</hi> should come to sollicite him. Whilst thus he lay thinking of these
follies, the houre approached (that was unluckie for him) wherein the <hi>Austurian</hi> wench
should come, who entred into the chamber in search of her Carrier, in her smock, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
&amp; her hair trust up in a coif of sustain, with soft &amp; wairy steps. But she was scarce
come to the door, when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> felt her, and arising and siting up in his bed, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of his plaisters, <hi>[Bismas]</hi> &amp; with great grief of his ribs, he stretched forth his arms
to receive his beautifull Damzell, the <hi>Austurian,</hi> who crouching, and silently went gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
with her hands to finde out her sweet heart, and incountred with <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi>
armes, who presently seized very strongly upon one of her wrists, and drawing her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him (shee daring not to speak a word) hee caused her to sit upon his beds side,
and presently groped her smock, and although it was of <hi>[Harpiller]</hi> the strongest Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase,
hee thought it was most subtle and fine Holland. Shee wore on her wrists certain
bracelets of glasse, which hee esteemed to bee precious, orientall-pearles. Her haire
which was almost as rough as a horse taile, hee held to bee wires of the glistringest gold
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whose brightnesse did obscure that of the Sunne. And her breath which
certainly smelled like to stale salt fish, reserved from over night, seemed unto him to
have a most redolent, aromaticall and sweet smell; and finally hee painted her in his
phantasie of the same very form and manner as hee had read in his bookes of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
of a certain Princesse which came to visit a Knight who was grievously wounded,
being overcome by his love, embellished with all the ornaments that here wee have
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted;
and the blindnesse of this poore Gallant was such, as neither the touching,
savour or other things that accompanied the good Damzell could undeceive him, being
such as were able to make any other, save a Carrier, vomet up his bowels; but rather
hee made full acount that hee held the Goddesse of Love between his armes, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her still very fast, hee began to court her with a low and amorous voice in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<q>I could wish to finde my self in termes, most high, and beautifull Lady, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to recompence so great a favour, as that which with the presence of your match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
feature you have shewn unto mee: but fortune (who is never weary of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the good) hath pleased to lay mee in this bed, wherein I lie so broken and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that although I were desirous to satisfie your will, yet is it impossible; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seeing to that impossibility may bee added a greater, to wit, the promised Faith
which I have given to the unmatchable <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> the only Lady of my most
hidden thoughts; for did not this let mee, doe not hold mee to bee so senslesse and
madde a Knight as to overslip so fortunate an occasion as this, which your bounty
<pb facs="tcp:54746:39"/>
hath offered to mee,</q> 
                        <hi>Maritornes</hi> remained sweating through anxiety, to see her self
held so fast by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and without eyther understanding, or giving attention
to his words, shee laboured all that shee could to free her self from him without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word. The Carrier, whose bad intention kept him still waking, did feare his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from the time that shee first entred into the roome, and did attentively give eare to
all <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> discourses, and jealous that the <hi>Asturian</hi> should break promise with
him, for any other, hee drew neerer unto <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> bed, and stood quiet to see
whereunto those words which hee could not understand tended; But viewing that the
wench strived to depart, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laboured to with-hold her, the jest seeming
evill unto him, hee up with his arme, and discharged so terrible a blow on the enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Knights jawes, as hee bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content here withall,
hee mounted upon the Knight, and did tread on his ribs, and passed them all over with
more then a trot.</p>
                     <p>The Bed which was somwhat <hi>[Endeble]</hi> weake, and not very firme of foundation,
being unable to suffer the addition of the Carrier, fell downe to the ground, with so
great a noise, as it waked the Inkeeper; who presently suspecting that it was one of
<hi>Maritornes</hi> conflicts, because shee answered him not, having called her lowdly, hee
forthwith arose and, lighting of a Lamp, hee went towards the place where hee heard
the noyse. The Wench, perceiving that her Master came, and that hee was extreme
cholericke, did, all ashamed and troubled, run into <hi>Sancho Pancaes</hi> bed, who slept all
this while very soundly, and there crouched, and made her selfe as little as an Eg.</p>
                     <p>Her Master entred, crying, Whore where art thou? I dare warrant that these are
some of thy doings. By this <hi>Sancho</hi> awaked, and feeling that bulk lying almost wholly
upon him, he thought it was the night Mare, and began to lay with his fists here and
there about him very swiftly and among others wraught <hi>Maritornes</hi> I know not how
many blows; who grieved for the pain she indured there, casting all honesty aside,
gave <hi>Sancho</hi> the exchange of his blows so trimly, as she made him to awake in despight
of his sluggishnesse. And finding himself to be so abused of an uncouth person, whom
he could not behold, he arose and caught hold of <hi>Maritornes</hi> as well as he could, and
they both began the best fight and pleasantest skirmish of the world.</p>
                     <p>The Carrier perceiving by the light which the Inn-keeper brought in with him, the
lamentable state of his Mistrisse, abandoning <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he instantly repaired to
give her the succour that was requisite, which likewise the Inn-keeper did, but with
another meaning; for he approached with intention to punish the wench, beleeving
that shee was infallibly the cause of all that harmony: And so as men say, the Cat to
the Rat, the Rat to the Cord, the Cord to the Poste: So the Carrier struck <hi>Sancho,
Sancho</hi> the wench, she returned him again his liberality with interest, and the In-keeper
laid load upon his maid also: And all of them did mince it with such expedition, as
there was no leisure at all allowed to any one of them for breathing. And the best of
all was, that the Inn-keepers lamp went out, and then finding themselves in darknesse
they belaboured one another so without compassion, and at once, as wheresoever the
blow fell, it bruised the place pittifully.</p>
                     <p>There lodged by chance that night in the Inn one of the Squadron of these, which are
called of the old Holy Brotherhood of <hi>Toledo [The Holy Brotherhood, or the</hi> Sancta
Hermandad, <hi>are a certain number of men, whose chief office is to free the High-way from
Robbers]</hi> he likewise hearing the wonderfull noyse of the fight, laid hand on his
Rod of Office, and the tinn box of his Titles, and entred into the chamber without
light, saying, Stand still to the Officer of Justice, and to the Holy Brotherhood. And
saying so, the first whom he met, was the poor battered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who lay over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
in his Bed, stretched, with his face upward without any felling, and taking
hold of his beard, he cryed out incessantly, Help the Justice. But seeing that he whom
he held fast, bowed neither hand or foot, he presently thought that he was dead, and
that those battaillants that fought so eagerly in the Room, had slain him; wherefore
he lifted his voyce and cryed out loudly, saying, Shut the Inn door, and see that none
escape; for here they have kil'd a man. This word Astonished all the Combattants so
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54746:39"/>
much, as every one left the Battail in the very terms, wherein this voyce had overtaken
them. The Inn-keeper retyred himself to his Chamber, the Carrier to his Coverlets,
the Wench to her Couch, and only the unfortunate <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were
not able to move themselves from the place wherein they lay. The Officer of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Brotherhood in this space letting slip poor <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> beard, went out for light,
to search and apprehend the Delinquents; but he could not finde any: For the Inn-keeper
had purposely quenched the Lamp, as he retyred to his Bed, wherefore the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
was constrained to repair to the chimney, where with great difficulty, after he had
spent a long while doing of it, he at last lighted a Candle.</p>

                        </gap> Thou
mayest certainly believe it, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for either I know very little, or
else this Castle is Inchanted. For I let thee to wit; but thou must first swear to keep
secret that which I mean to tell thee now, untill after my death. So I swear, quoth
<hi>Sancho.</hi> I say it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> because I cannot abide to take away any bodies
honour. Why, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> again, I swear that I will conceale it untill after your
Worships dayes; and I pray God that I may discover it to morrow. Have I wrought
thee such harm <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed the Knight, as thou wouldest desire to see me end so
soon? It is not for that Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but because I cannot abide to keep things
long, lest they should rott in my custody. <q>Let it be for what thou pleasest, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
for I doe trust greater matters then that to thy love and courtesie. And
that I may rehearse it unto thee briefly, know, that a little while since, the Lord of
this Castles daughter came unto me, who is the most fair and beautifull Damzell that
can be found in a great part of the earth; what could I say unto thee of the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of her person? what of her excellent wit? what of other secret things? which
that I may preserve the faith due unto my Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> I passe over in
silence. I will only tell thee, that Heaven envious of the inestimable good that fortune
had put in my hands: Or perhaps (and that is most probable) this Castle, as I
have said, is Inchanted; just at the time when we were in most sweet and amorous
speech, I being not able to see or know from whence it came, there arrived a hand
joyned to the arm of some mighty Gyant, and gave me such a blow on the jawes, as
they remain all bathed in blood; and did after so thump and bruise me, as I feel my
self worse now, then yesterday, when the Carriers, through <hi>Rozinantes</hi> madnesse, did
use us thou knowest how! By which I conjecture, that the treasure of this Damzels
beauty is kept by some Inchanted Moor, and is not reserved for me.</q> Nor for me,
quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I have been bumbasted by more then four hundred Moors, which
have hammer need in such sort, as the bruising of the Pack-staves was gilded bread and
spice cakes in comparison of it: But Sir, I pray you tell me; How can you call this
<pb facs="tcp:54746:40"/>
a good and rare Adventure, seeing we remain so pittifully used after it? And yet your
harms may be accounted lesse, in respect you have held, as you said, that incomparable
beauty between your arms: But I, what have I had other then the greatest blows that
I shall ever have in my life? Unfortunate that I am, and the Mother that bare me,
that neither am a errant Knight, nor ever means to be any, and yet the greatest part of
our mishaps still falls to my lot! It seems that thou wast likewise beaten, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
Evill befall my linage, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> have not I told you I was? Be not
grieved Friend, replyed the Knight; for I will now compound the precious <hi>Balsamum,</hi>
which will cure us in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
                     <p>The Officer having by this time alighted his Lamp, entred into the Room to see him
whom he accounted to be dead; and as soon as <hi>Sancho</hi> saw him, seeing him come in
in his shirt, his head lapt up in a kerchiff, the lamp in his hand, having withall a very
evill-favoured countenance, he demanded of his Lord: Sir, is this by chance the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
Moor, that turns anew to torment us, for somewhat that is yet unpunished?
He cannot be the Moor, answered <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for Nigromancers suffer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be seen by any. If they suffer not themselves to be seen, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> they
suffer themselves at least to be felt; if not, let my shoulders bear witnesse. So might
mine also, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but notwithstanding this is no sufficient argument to
prove him, whom wee see to be the inchanted Moor: As thus they discoursed the
Officer arrived, and finding them to commune in so peaceable and quiet manner, he
rested admired. Yet <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lay with his face upward as he had left him, and
was not able to stir himself, he was so beaten and beplaistered. The Officer approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
demanded of him; Well how doest thou good fellow? I would speak more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if I were but such a one as thou art: Is it the custome of
this Countrey, you Bottle-head, to talk after so rude a manner to Knights Errant?
The other impatient to see one of so vile presence, use him with that bad language,
could not indure it; but lifting up the Lamp, oyle and all, gave <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> such a
blow on the pate with it, as he broak his head in one or two places, and leaving all in
darknesse behinde him, departed presently out of the chamber. Without doubt (quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing this accident) Sir that was the inchanted Moor; and I think he keepeth
the treasure for others, and reserveth only for us fists and Lamp-blows. It is as thou
sayest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and therefore we are not to make account of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,
or be worth and angry at them; for in respect they are invisible and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall,
wee shall not finde him on whom we may take revenge, though we labour
ever so much to doe it. Arise therefore, <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou beest able, and call to the
Constable of this Fortresse, and procure me some Oyle, Wine, Salt, and Vinegar, that
I make the wholsome <hi>Balsamum;</hi> for verily I believe that I doe need it very much at
this time, the blood runneth so fast out of the wound which the Spirit gave me even
now. <hi>Sancho</hi> then got up with grief enough of his bones, and went without light to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Inn-keepers, and encountred on the way the Officer of the Holy Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
who stood hearkning what did become of his enemy; to whom he said; Sir,
whosoever thou beest, I desire thee, doe us the favour and benefit to give me a little
Rosemary, Oyle, Wine, and Salt, to cure one of the best Knights Errant that is in the
earth, who lyeth now in that Bed, sorely wounded by the hands of an inchanted Moor
that is in this Inn. When the Officer heard him speak in that manner, he held him to
be out of his wits; and because the dawning began, he opened the Inn door, and told
unto the Host that which <hi>Sancho</hi> demanded. The Inn-keeper presently provided all
that he wanted, and <hi>Sancho</hi> carried it to his Master, who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld his head between both
his hands, and complained much of the grief that the blow of his head caused, which
did him no other hurt then to raise up two blisters somewhat great, and that which he
supposed to be blood, was only the humor which the anxiety and labour of minde he
past in this last dark Adventure, had made him to sweat.</p>
                     <p>In resolution <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took his Simples, of which he made a compound, mixing
them all together, and then boyling of them a good while, untill they came (as he
thought) to their perfection; he asked for a Violl wherein he might lay this precious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54746:40"/>
liquor, but the Inn being unable to afford him any such, hee resolved at last to put it
into <hi>[Hosa de lata]</hi> a tinne oyle-pot, which the Host did freely give him, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hee said over the pot eighty <hi>pater nosters,</hi> and as many <hi>Aves, Salves</hi> and <hi>Creeds,</hi>
and accompanied every word with a Crosse, in forme of Benediction, at all which
Ceremonies <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Inne-keeper, and the Officer of the holy-Brotherhood
were present, for the Carrier went very soberly to dresse and make ready his
Mules.</p>
                     <p>The liquor being made, hee himselfe would presently make experience of the virtue
of that precious <hi>Balsamum,</hi> as hee did imagine it to bee, and so did drinke a good
draught of the overplus that could not enter into his pot, being a quart or thereabouts;
and scarce had hee done it when hee began to vomit so extremly, as hee left nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
up in his stomack, and through the paine and agitation caused by his vomits, he fell
into a very abundant and great sweat, and therefore commanded himselfe to bee well
covered, and left alone to take his case. Which was done forthwith, and hee slept three
houres, and then awaking found himselfe so wonderfully eased, and free from all brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and paine, as hee doubted not but that hee was throughtly whole; and therefore
did verily perswade himself, that hee had hapned on the right manner of compounding
the <hi>Balsamum</hi> of <hi>Fierabras:</hi> and that having that Medicine, hee might boldly from
thenceforth, undertake any ruines, battailes, conflicts or adventures, how dangerous

                        <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who likewise attributed the suddain cure of his Master to Miracle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
that it would please him to give him leave to sup up the remainder of the <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi>
which rested in the kettle, and was no small quantity; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and hee lifting it up between both hands, did with a good faith, and better talent,
quaff it off all, being little lesse then his Master had dranke. The successe then of the
History is, that poore <hi>Sanchoes</hi> stomack was not so delicate as his Lords, wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee could cast hee was tormented with so many cruell pangs, loathings, sweats and
dismayes, as hee did verily perswade himself that his last houre was come; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
himself to bee so afflicted and troubled, hee cursed the <hi>Balsamum,</hi> and the theefe
which had given it to him. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing of him in that pittifull taking, said, I
beleeve <hi>Sancho,</hi> all this evill befalleth thee because thou art not dubbed Knight; for I
perswade my selfe, that this liquor cannot helpe any one that is not. If your worship
knew that, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> (evill befall me and all my linage) why did you therfore consent
that I should taste it?</p>
                     <p>In this time the drench had made his operation, and the poore Squire did so swift
and vehemently discharge himself by both channels; as neither his ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, or canvase co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
could serve after to any use. Hee sweat and sweat again, with such excessive
swoonings, as not only himselfe, but likewise all the beholders did verily deeme that his
life was ending. This storme and mishap endured about some two houres, after which
hee remained not cured as his Master, but so weary and indisposed, as he was not able
to stand.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who as wee have said, felt himself eased and cured, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
depart to seek Adventures, it seeming unto him that all the time which he abode
there was no other then a depriving both of the world and needfull People of his favour
and assistance: and more through the security and confidence that hee had in his <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum;</hi>
and carried thus away by this desire, hee himselfe sadled his Horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi>
and did empannell his Squires beast, whom hee likewise holpe to apparell himself, and
to mount upon his Asse. And presently getting a horse-back, hee rode over to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Inne, and laid hand on a Javelin that was there, to make it serve him instead
of a Launce. All the People that were in the Inn stood beholding him, which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty in number.</p>
                     <p>The In-keepers daughter did also looke upon him, and hee did never withdraw his
eye from her, and would ever and anon breathe forth so dolefull a sigh, as if hee had
plucked it out of the bottom of his heart, which all the beholders tooke to proceede
from the grief of his Ribs, but especially such as had seen him playstered the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb facs="tcp:54746:41"/>
And being both mounted thus a Horse-back, he called the Inn keeper and said
unto him with a grave and staid voyce. <q>Many and great are the favours, Sir Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which I have received in this your Castle, and doe remain most oblieged to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
you for them, all the dayes of my life. And if I may pay or recompence them
by revenging of you upon any proud Miscreant that hath done you any wrongs;
know that it is mine Office to help the weak, to revenge the wronged, and to chastise
Traytors. Call therefore to memory, and if you finde any thing of this kinde to
commend to my correction, you need not but once to say it; for I doe promise you
by the order of Knighthood, which I have received to satisfie and appay you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your own desire.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Inn-keeper answered him again with like gravity and staidnesse, saying; Sir
Knight, I shall not need your assistance when any wrong is done to me; for I know
very well my self, how to take the revenge that I shall think good, when the injury is
offered. That only which I require is, That you defray the charges whereat you have
been here in the Inn this night, as well for the straw and barley given to your two
horses, as also for both your beds. This then is an Inn, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> That it
is, and an honourable one too, replyed the Inn-keeper. Then have I hitherto lived in an
errour, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for in very good sooth I took it till now to be a Castle,
and that no mean one neither. But since that it is no Castle, but an Inn, that which
you may doe for the present time is, to forgive me those expences; for I cannot doe
ought against the custome of Knights Errant; of all which I most certainly know
(without ever having read untill this present any thing to the contrary) that they never
payed for their lodging, or other thing, in any Inn wheresoever they lay. For, by all
Law and right, any good entertainment that is given unto them, is their due, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the insupportable travells they indure, seeking of Adventures both day and
night, in Summer and Winter, a foot &amp; a horse-back, with thirst and hunger, in heat and
cold, being subject to all the distemperatures of Heaven, and all the discommodities of
the earth. All that concerns me nothing, replyed the Innkeeper; pay unto me my
due, and leave these tales and Knighthoods apart; for I care for nothing else, but how
I may come by mine own. Thou art a mad and a bad Host, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>
And saying so, he spur'd <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and flourishing with his Javelin, he issued out of
the Inn in despight of them all, and without looking behinde him to see once whether
his Squire followed, he road a good way off from it.</p>
                     <p>The Inn-keeper seeing he departed without satisfying him, came to <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
to get his mony of him, who answered; That since his Lord would not pay, he would
likewise give nothing; forbeing, as he was, Squire to a Knight Errant, the very same rule
and reason that exempted his Master from payments in Inns and Taverns ought also to
serve and be understood as well of him. The Inn-keeper grew wroth at these words
and threatned him, That if he did not pay him speedily, he would recover it in manner
that would grieve him. <hi>Sancho</hi> replyed, swearing by the Order of Knighthood,
which
his Lord had received, that he would not pay one Denier, though it cost him his life;
for the good and anncient Customes of Knights Errant should never through his default
be infringed; nor should their Squires which are yet to come into the world ever
complain on him, or upbraid him for transgressing or breaking so just a duety. But his
bad fortune ordeined that there were at the very time in the same Inn four Clothiers
of <hi>Segovia,</hi> and three Poynt-makers of the Stews of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and two neighbours of
the Market of <hi>Sivill,</hi> all pleasant folk, well minded, malicious, and playsome; all
which pricked, and in a manner moved all at one time, and by the very same spirit came
neer to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and pulling him down off his Asse, one of them ran in for the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
Coverlet, and casting him into it, they looked up, and seeing the house was
somewhat too low for their intended businesse, they determined to goe into the base
Court, which was over head, only limitted by Heaven; and then <hi>Sancho</hi> being laid in
the midest of the Blanket, they began to tosse him aloft, and sport themselves with him,
in the manner they were wont to use Dogs at Shrovetide.</p>
                     <p>The out-cries of the miserable betossed Squire, were so many and so lowd, as they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54746:41"/>
arived at last to his Lords hearing, who standing a while to listen attentively what it
was, beleved that some new Adventure did approach, untill hee perceived, at last, that
hee which cried was his Squire, wherefore turning the Reignes, hee made towards the
Inne with a loathsome gallop, and finding it shut, hee rode all about it to see whether
hee might enter into it, But scarce was hee arived at the walles of the base Court.
which were not very high, when hee perceived the foule play that was used toward his
Squire, for hee saw him descend and ascend into the ayre againe with such grace and
agilitie, that did his choller permit, I certainly perswade my selfe hee would have burst
for laughter. Hee assayed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> mount the wall from his Horse, but hee was so bruised
and broken, as hee could not doe so much as alight from his back. Wherefore from
his back hee used such reproachfull and vile language to those which tossed <hi>Sancho,</hi>
as it is impossible to lay them downe in writing. And notwithstanding all his scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
speech, yet did not they cease from their laughter and labour; nor the flying <hi>Sancho</hi>
from his complaints, now and then medled with threats, now and then with intreaties,
but availed very little, nor could prevaile, untill they were constrained by wearinesse
to give him over. Then did they bring him his Asse againe, and helping him up upon it,
they lapt him in his <hi>[Gavay]</hi> mantle; and the compassionate <hi>Maritornes</hi> beholding
him so afflicted and orelaboured, thought it needfull to helpe him to a draught of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so brought it him from the well, because the water thereof was coolest. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
tooke the pot, and laying it to his lips, hee abstained from drinking by his Lords
perswasion, who cryed to him alowd, saying, Sonne <hi>Sancho</hi> drinke not water, drinke
it not Sonne, for it will kill thee. Behold I have here with mee the most holy <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi>
(and shewed him the oyle-pot of the drenches hee had compounded) for with
only two drops that thou drinkest, thou shalt without all doubt remaine whole and
sound. At those words <hi>Sancho</hi> looking behinde him, answered his Master with a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
voice, have you forgotten so soone how that I am so Knight, or doe you desire
that I vomit the remnant of the poore bowels that remaine in mee since yester night,
keepe your liquor for your selfe in the Devills name, and permit mee to live in Peace;
and the conclusion of this speech and his beginning to drinke, was done all in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
but finding at the first draught that it was water, hee would not taste it any more
but requested <hi>Maritornes</hi> that shee would give him some Wine, which shee did streight
with a very good will, and likewise paid for it out of her owne purse; for in effect it is
written of her, that though shee followed that trade, yet had shee some shadowes and
lineaments in her of Christianity. As soone as <hi>Sancho</hi> had drunken hee visited his As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with his heeles twice or thrice; and the Inne being opened hee issued out of it, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad that hee had paid nothing, and gotten his desire, although it were to the cost
of his ordinary sureties, to wit, his shoulders. Yet did the Inne-keeper remaine pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of his Wallets, as a payment for that hee ought him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when hee departed as hee never missed them. After hee departed, the Inne-keeper
thought to have shut up the Inne doore againe, but the Gentlemen-tossers would not
permit, being such folke that if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> were verily one of the Knights of the
round Table, yet would not they esteem him two chips.</p>

beheld him in that case, hee said to him, now doe I
wholly perswade my selfe friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that that Castle or Inne,
is doubtlesse inchanted. For those which made pastime with thee
in so cruell manner, what else could they bee but Spirits, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

saw, that whilst I stood at the Barrier of the yeard, beholding the
acts of thy sad Tragedy; I was not in any waies able either to mount it, or alight from
<hi>Rozinante,</hi> for as I say, I thinke they held mee then inchanted. For I vow to thee by
mine honour, that if I could have either mounted or alighted, I would have taken such
vengeance on those lewd and treacherous Caitiffs, as they should remember the jest
for ever, though I had therefore adventured to transgresse the lawes of Knighthood.
Which as I have oft times said unto thee, permitteth not any Knight to lay hands on
one that is not Knighted, if it bee not in defence of his proper life and person, and that
in case of great and urgent necessitie. So would I also have revenged my selfe, quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> if I might, were they Knights or no Knights, but I could not; and yet I doe
infallibly beleeve, that those which tooke their pleasure with mee, were neither ghosts
nor inchanted men as you say, but men of flesh and bones as wee are, and all of them,
as I heard them called whilest they tossed mee, had proper names, for one was termed

of the yeard, or alighting off your Horse was only inchantments in you. Whereby
I doe cleerely collect thus much; That these Adventures which wee goe in search of,
will bring us at last to so many disventures, as wee shall not bee able to know which is
our right foote. And that which wee might doe best, according to my little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
were to returne us againe to our Village, now that it is reaping time,

content may there bee in this world, or what pleasure can equall that of winning a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,

quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> although I doe not know it; only this I know, that since wee became

vanquishing mine Enemie, whereof you spake even now. That is it which grieves mee,
as it should thee also <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> But I will procure hereafter to get
a Sword made with such art, that whosoever shall weare it, no kinde of inchantment

to <hi>Amadis,</hi> when he called himself, <hi>The Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> which was one
of the best that ever Knight had in this world; for besides the virtue that I told, it
did also cut like a Razor; and no Armour, were it ever so strong or inchanted, could
stand before it. I am so fortunate, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that when this befell, and that you
found such a sword, it would only serve and be beneficial, and stand instead such as
are dubed Knights, as doth your <hi>Balsamum,</hi> whilest the poor Squires are cram'd full
with sorrows. Fear not that <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for fortune will deal with
thee more liberally then so.</p>
                     <p>In these discourses <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his Squire road, when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiving
a great and thick dust to arise in the way, wherein he travelled, turning to <hi>Sancho</hi> said,
this is <hi>(Sancho)</hi> the day, wherein shall be manifest the good which Fortune hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for me. This is the day, wherein the force of mine arme must be shewn as much
as in any other whatsoever; and in it I will doe such fears, as shall for ever remain
recorded in the books of fame: Doest thou see, <hi>Sancho,</hi> the dust which ariseth
there? know that it is caused by a mighty Army, and sundry and innumerable Nations,
which come martching there. If that be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> then must there be two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
for on this other side is raised as great a dust. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turned back to
behold it, and seeing it was so indeed, he was marvellous glad, thinking that they were
doubtlesly two Armies, which came to fight one with another, in the midest of that
spacious Plain: For he had his fantasie ever replenished with these battails, inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
successes, ravings, loves, and challenges, which are reheased in books of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
And all that ever he spoak, thought, or did, was addrest and applyed to the
like things: And the dust which he had seen, was raised by two great Flocks of Sheep,
that came through the same Field by two different wayes, and could not be discerned
by reason of the dust, untill they were very neer. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did affirm that they
were two Armies, with so very good earnest as <hi>Sancho</hi> believed it, and demanded of him,
Sir what then shall we two doe? What shall we doe (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but assist
the needfull and weeker side: For thou shalt know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

a very beautifull and gracious Princesse, and moreover a Christian; and her Father
refuseth to give her to the Pagan King, untill first he abandon <hi>Mahomet's</hi> false Sect,

thy Duty; for it is not requisite that one be a Knight, to the end he may enter into
such battails. I doe apprehend that my self, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> very well; But whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to finde him again after the
Conflict? for I think it is not the custome to enter into battail mounted on such a
Beast. <q>It is true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that which thou mayest doe is, to leave him
to his Adventures, and care not whether he be lost or found; for we shall have so
many horses, after coming out of this Battail Victors, that very <hi>Rozinante</hi> himself is
in danger to be changed for another. But be attentive; for I mean to describe unto
thee the principall Knights of both the Armies. And to the end thou mayest the

The fear that thou conceivest <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> maketh thee that thou
canst neither hear nor see aright; for one of the effects of fear, is to trouble the Senses,
and make things appear otherwise then they are; and seeing thou fearest so much, retire

                     <p>The Sheep-heards that came with the flock, cryed to him to leave off, but seeing

where art thou? come to mee, for I am but one Knight alone, who desire to prove
my force with thee man to man, and deprive thee of thy life, in paine of the wrong
thou doest to the valiant <hi>Pentapolin</hi> the <hi>Garamiante.</hi> At that instant a stone gave him
such a blow on one of his sides, as did bury two of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

as it broke it into peeces, and carried away with it besides, three or foure of his

and the second blow, as the poore Knight was constrained to fall down off his horse.

<pb facs="tcp:54746:44"/>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> approached so neer, that he laid almost his eyes on his Masters mouth, and it
was just at the time that the <hi>Balsamum</hi> had now wrought his effect in <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
his stomack, and at the very season that <hi>Sancho</hi> went about to look into his mouth,
he disgorged all that he had in his stomack, with as great violence as it had been shot out
of a Musket, just in his compassive Squires beard. O holy Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> quoth
<hi>Sancho!</hi> what is this that hath befaln me? the poor man is mortally wounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt; for he vomiteth up blood at his mouth. But looking a little neerer to it,
he perceived in the colour and smell that it was not blood, but the <hi>Balsamum</hi> of his
Masters oyl-bottle, whereat he instantly took such a loathing, that his stomack like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
turned, and he vomited out his very bowels almost, all in his Masters face: and
so they both remained like Pearles. Soone after <hi>Sancho</hi> ranne to his Asse to take
somewhat to clear himself, and to cure his Lord out of his wallet, which when he found
wanting [<hi>Having left it behind him in the Inn when he rann away and paid nothing for his
lodging.</hi>] he was ready to runn out of his wits: there he begann a new to curse himself,
and made a firme resolution in minde, that he would leave his Master and turn to his
Countrey again, although he were sure both to lose his wages, and the hope of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the promised Island.</p>
                     <p>By this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> arose, and setting his left hand to his mouth, that the rest of
his teeth might not fall out, he caught hold on the Raines of <hi>Rozinantes</hi> bridle with
the
other, who had never stir'd from his Master (such was his loyalty and good nature)
he went towards his Squire, that leaned upon his Asse, with his hand under his cheek,
like one pensative and malecontent. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing of him in that guise,
with such signes of sadnesse, said unto him: Know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that one man is not
more
then another, if he doe not more then another. All these storms that fall on us
are arguments that the time will waxe calm very soon, and that things will have better
successe hereafter; for it is not possible that either good or ill be dureable. And hence
we may collect that our misfortunes having lasted so long, our fortune and weale
must be likewise neer: And therefore thou oughtest not thus to afflict thy self for the
disgraces that befall me, seeing no part of them fall to thy lot. How not, quoth
<hi>Sancho?</hi> Was he whom they tossed yester day in the Coverlet by fortune, any other
mans sonne then my Fathers? and the Wallet that I want to day, with all my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
was it any others then mine own? What doest thou want thy Wallet <hi>Sancho,</hi>
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> I that I doe, quoth hee. In that manner replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
We have nothing left us to eat to day. That would be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
if we could not finde among these Fields the hearbs which I have heard you say you
know, wherewithall such unluckie Knights Errant as you are wont to supply like needs.
For all that, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I would rather have now a quarter of a loaf, or a
cake and two Pilchers heads, then all the hearbs that <hi>Diascoridles</hi> describeth,
although
they came glosed by Doctor <hi>Laguna</hi> himself: But yet for all that, get upon thy beast,
<hi>Sancho</hi> the good, and follow me; for God, who is the provider for all Creatures, will
not fail us; and principally seeing we doe a work so greatly to his service as we doe,
seeing he doth not abandon the little Flies of the Air, nor the Wormlings of the Earth,
nor the Spawnlings of the Water: And he is so mercifull that he maketh his Sunne
shine on the good and the evill, and Rains on sinners and just men. You were much
fitter, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to be a Preacher, then a Knight Errant. Knights Errant knew,
and ought to know somewhat of all things, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> For there hath been
a Knight Errant, in times past, who would make a Sermon or discourse in the midest
of a Camp royall, with as good grace as if he were graduated in the University of
<hi>Paris:</hi>
by which we may gather, that the Launce never dulled the Pen; nor the Pen the
Launce. Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let it be as you have said, and let us depart hence,
and procure to finde a lodging for this night, where, I pray God, may be no Coverlets,
and Tossors, nor Spirits, nor inchanted Moors; for if there be, I'le bestow the Flock
and the Book on the Devill. Demand that of God Sonne <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and lead me where thou pleasest; for I will leave the election of our lodging to thy
choyse for this time: yet I pray thee give me thy hand, and feel how many cheek teeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54746:44"/>
or others, I want in this right side of the upper jaw; for there I feel most pain. <hi>Sancho</hi>
put in his finger, and whilest he felt him, demanded; how many cheek teeth were you
accustomed to have on this side? Four, quoth he, besides the hindermost; all of them
very whole and sound. See well what you say Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> I say four, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if they were not five; for I never in my life drew, or lost any tooth;
nor hath any faln or been worm-eaten, or mard by any rhume. Well then, quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> you have in this nether part but two cheek teeth and a half; and in the upper
neither a half, nor any; for all there is as plain as the palm of my hand. Unfortunate
I (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hearing the sorrowfull news that his Squire told unto him) for
I had rather lose one of my armes, so it were not that of my Sword: For <hi>Sancho,</hi>
thou must wit, that a mouth without cheek-teeth, is like a Mill without a Mill-stone;
and a tooth is much more to be esteemed then a Diamond.</p>
                     <p>But wee which professe the rigorous Lawes of Armes, are subject to all these disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
wherefore mount gentle friend and give the way, for I will follow thee what
pace thou pleasest, <hi>Sancho</hi> obeyed, and rode the way where hee thought hee might
find lodging, without leaving the high way, which was there very much beaten. And
going thus by little and little (for <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his paine of his jawes did not suffer
him rest, or make overmuch haste) <hi>Sancho</hi> to entertain him and divert his thought by
saying some things, began to aboord him in the forme wee meane to rehearse in the
Chapter ensuing.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>EE thinks, good Sir, that all the mishaps that befell us these dayes past,
are without any doubt, in punishment of the sinne you committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the order of Knighthood, by not performing the Oath you
swore, not to eate bread on table clothes, nor to sport with the Queen
with all the rest which ensueth, and you vowed to accomplish untill
you had wonne the Helmet of <hi>Malandrino,</hi> or I know not how the
Moore is called, for I have forgotten his name. Thou sayst right <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
but to tell the truth indeede, I did wholly forget it; and thou maist likwise
thinke certainly, that because thou didst not remember it to mee in time, that of the
Coverlet was inflicted as a punishment on thee. But I will make amends, for we have
also manners of reconciliation for all things in the Order of Knighthood. Why did I
by chance sweare any thing, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> it little imports, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that
thou hast not sworne, let it suffice that I know thou art not very cleere from the fault
of an accessary. And therefore at all Adventures it will not bee ill to provide a remedy.
If it bee so quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> beware you doe not forget this againe, as you did that of the
Oath, for if you should, perhaps those spirits will take againe a fancie to solace
themselves with mee, and peradventure with you your selfe, if they see you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate.</p>
                     <p>Being in these and other such discourses, the night overtook them in the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could discover any lodging, and that which was worst of all, they were
almost famisht with hunger, for by the losse of their wallets, they lost at once both
their provision and warder-house. And to accomplish wholly this disgrace, there
succeeded a certain Adventure, which certainly hapned as we lay it down, without
<pb facs="tcp:54746:45"/>
any addition in the world, and was this; The night did shut up with some darknesse,
yet notwithstanding they travelled on still, <hi>Sancho</hi> believing, that since that was the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
there must be within a league or two in all reason some Inn. Travailing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as I have said, in a dark night, the Squire being hungry, and the Master having
a good stomack, they saw coming towards them in the very way they travailed, a great
multitude of lights, resembling nothing so well as wandring stars. <hi>Sancho</hi> beholding
them, was struck into a wonderfull amazement, and his Lord was not much better:
The one drew his Asse halter, the other held his horse; and both of them stood still,
beholding attentively what that might be; and they perceived that the lights drew still
neerer unto them; and the more they approached, they appeared the greater; at the
sight <hi>Sancho</hi> did tremble, like one infected by the favour of Quick-silver; and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
hair stood up like bristles, who animating himself a little, said; <hi>Sancho,</hi> this
must be questionlesse a great and most dangerous Adventure, wherein it is requisite
that I shew all my valour and strength. Unfortunate I, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if by chance
this Adventure were of Ghosts! as it seemeth to me that it is; where will there be
ribs to suffer it? Be they never so great Ghosts, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I will not consent
that they touch one hair of thy Garmens: For if they jested with thee the other time,
it was because I could not leap over the walls of the yard; but now we are in plain
Field, where I may brandish my Sword as I please. And if they inchant and benum
you, as they did the other time, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> what will it then avail us to be in open
Field or no? For all that, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I pray thee <hi>Sancho</hi> be of good courage;
for experience shall shew thee how great my valour is. I will and please God, quoth
<hi>Sancho:</hi> And so departing somewhat out of the way, they began again to view earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what that of the travailling lights might be; and after a very little space they espied
many white things, whose dreadfull visions did in that very instant abate <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
his courage, and now began to chatter with his teeth like one that had the cold of a
Quartan; &amp; when they did distinctly perceive what it was, then did his beating and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of teeth increase; for they discovered about some twenty, all covered with white
a horse-back, with Tapers lighted in their hands; after which followed a Litter covered
over with black, and then ensued other six a horse-back attired in mourning, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
their Mules, even to the very ground; for they perceived that they were not
horses by the quietnesse of their pace. The white folk road murmuring somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves with a low and compassive voyce: Which strange vision, at such
an hour, and in places not inhabited, was very sufficient to strike fear into <hi>Sancho's</hi>
heart, and even in his Masters. If it had been any other then <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but <hi>Sancho</hi>
tumbled here and there, being quite overthrown with terrour. The contrary hapned
to his Lord, to whom in that same hour his imagination represented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> him most
lively, the Adventure wherein he was to be such a one, as he oft times had read in his
books of Chivalry. For it is figured unto him, that the litter was a Beer, wherein was
carried some grievously wounded or dead Knight, whose revenge was only reserved for
him. And without making any other discourse he set his Launce in the rest, seated
himself surely in his Saddle, and put himself in the midst of the way by which the white
folk must forcibly passe, with great spirit &amp; courage. And when he saw them draw neer,
he said with a lowd voyce; Stand Sir Knight, whosoever you be, and render me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what you are? from whence you come? where you goe? and what that is
which you carry in that Beer? For according as you shew either you have done to
others, or others to you some injury: And it is convenient and needfull that I know
it, either to chastise you, for the ill you have committed; or else to revenge you of the
wrong which you have suffered. Wee are in haste, quoth one of the white men, and
the Inn is far off; and therefore cannot expect to give so full a relation as you request;
and with that spurring his Mule, passed forward. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> highly disdaining at
the answer, took by the bridle and held him, saying, Stay proud Knight, and be better
mannered another time, and give me account of that which I demanded; if not, I
desie you all to mortall battail. The Mule whereon the white man road, was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fearfull and skittish; and being taken thus rudely by the bridle, shee took such a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54746:45"/>
fright, that rising up on her hinder legs, she unhorsed her Rider; one of the Lacquies
that came with them, seeing him fallen, began to revile <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who being by
this throughly inraged, without any more adoe, putting his Launce in the rest, rann
upon one of the Mourners, and threw him to the ground very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore wounded: And
turning upon the rest (it was a thing worthy the noting) with what dexterity, he did
assault, break upon them, and put them all to flight; and it seemed none other,
but that <hi>Rozinante</hi> had gotten then wings, hee bestirred himself so nimbly and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously.</p>
                     <p>All those white men were fearfull people, and unarmed; and therefore fled away
from the Skirmish in a trice, and began to traverse that field with their Tapers burning,
that they seemed to be Maskers that use to runn up and down in nights of jove and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.
The Mourners likewise were so laped up and muffled, by their mourning
weeds as they could scarce stir them; so that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did, without any danger
of his person, give them all the Bastanado; and caused them to forsake their rooms
whether they would or no: For all of them did verily think that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o man,
but a Devill of Hell, that met them to take away the dead body, which they carried
in the Litter. All this did <hi>Sancho</hi> behold, marveilously admiring at his Master bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which made him say to himself, my Master is infallibly as strong and valiant as
he said!</p>
                     <p>There lay on the ground by him whom his Mule had overthrown, a wax Taper
still burning, by whose light <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceived him, and comming over to him,
he laid the poynt of his Launce upon his face, saying, that he should render himself,
or else he would slay him. To which the other answered; I am already rendred more
then enough, seeing I cannot stir me out of the place, for one of my legs is broken.
And if you be a Christian I desire you not to kill me; for therein you would commit
a great sacriledge, I being a Licenciate, and have received the first Orders. Well then,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> what Divill brought thee hither being a Church-man? Who
Sir, replyed the overthrown, but my misfortune? Yet doth a greater threaten thee,
said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if thou doest not satisfie me in all that which I first demanded of
thee. You shall easily be satisfied, quoth the Licenciate; and therefore you shall wit,
that although first of all I said I was a Licentiate, I am none, but a Batcheler, and am
called <hi>Alonso Lopez,</hi> born at <hi>Alcovendas,</hi> and I came from the City of <hi>Baeca,</hi> with
eleven other Priests, which are those that fled away with the Tapers; wee travailed
towards <hi>Segovia,</hi> accompanying the dead body, that lies in that Litter, of a certain
Gentleman who dyed in <hi>Baeca,</hi> and was there deposited for a while, and now as I
say, we carty his bones to his place of buriall, which is in <hi>Segovia,</hi> the place of his birth.
And who killed him, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> God, quoth the Batcheler, with certain
pestilentiall feavers that he took. In that manner, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> our Lord hath
delivered me from the paines I would have taken to revenge his death, if any other had
slain him; Hee having killed him that did, there is no other remedy but silence, and to
lift up the shoulders; for the same I must my self have done, if he were likewise pleased
to slay me. And I would have your reverence to understand, that I am a Knight of
the <hi>Mancha,</hi> called <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and mine Office and Exercise is, to goe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World righting of wrongs, and undoing of injuries. I cannot understand
how that can be of righting wrongs, quoth the Batcheler, seeing you have made mee
who was right before, now very crooked by breaking of my leg, which can never bee
righted again, as long as I live; and the injury which you have undone in me, is none
other but to leave me so injured, as I shall remain injured for ever. And it was very
great disventure to have encountred with you that goe about to seek Adventures. All
things, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> succeed not of one fashion: The hurt was Master Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<hi>Alonso Lopez,</hi> that you travelled thus by night covered with those Surplices, with
burning Tapers, and covered with weeds of dole, so that you appeared most properly
some bad thing, and of the other world; and so I could not omit to fulfill my duty, by
assaulting you, which I would have done, although I verily knew you to be the Sathans
themselves of Hell. For, for such I judged and accounted you ever till now.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:46"/>Then since my bad fortune hath so disposed it, quoth the Batcheler, I desire you good
Sir Knight errant (who hath given mee so evill an errant) that you will help mee to
get up from under this Mule, who holds still my leg betwixt the stirrop and saddle. I
would have staid talking untill to morrow morning, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and why did you expect so long to declare your griefe to mee? hee presently called for <hi>Sanch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Panca</hi> to come over, but hee had little minde to doe; for hee was otherwise imployed, ransacking of a sumpter-Mule which those good folke brought with them, well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

or could contain, hee laid it on his beast, and then presently after repayred to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and holpe to deliver the good Batcheler from the oppression of his Mule. And
mounting him again on it, hee gave him his Taper, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> bad him to follow his fellowes, of whom hee should desire Pardon in his name for the wrong he had done
them. For it lay not in his hands to have done the contrary. <hi>Sancho</hi> said to him also, if
those Gentlemen would by chance know, who the valorous Knight is that hath used
them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, you may say unto them that he is the famous <hi>Don-Quixote of Mancha,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
called the Knight of the <hi>Illfavored face.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With this the Batcheler departed, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanded of <hi>Sancho,</hi> what had
moved him to call him <hi>the Knight of the illfavored face,</hi> more at that time then at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
I will tell you that quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> I stood beholding of you a pretty while by
the Taper light which that unluckie man carrieth, and truly you have one of the evill-favoredst
countenances, of late, that ever I saw; Which either proceedeth of your
being tyred after this Battaile, or else through the losse of your teeth. That is not the
reason, said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> But rather, it hath seemed fit to the wise man, to whose charge is left the writing of my History that I take some appellative name, as all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Knights of yore have done: for one called himselfe, <hi>The Knight of the burning
Sword;</hi> another that <hi>of the Vnicorne;</hi> this, him <hi>of the Phoenix;</hi> the other, that <hi>of the
Damzells;</hi> another the Knight of the <hi>Griphen;</hi> and some other <hi>the Knight of Death;</hi>
and by these names and devices they were known throughout the compasse of the earth.
And so I say, that the wise man whom I mentioned set in thy minde and tongue the
thought to call mee <hi>the Knight of the illfavored face,</hi> as I meane to call my selfe from
henceforth, and that the name may become mee better, I will upon the first occasion
cause to bee painted in my shield, a most illfavoured countenance. You neede not
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> spend so much time and money in having the like countenance painted;
but that which you may more easily doe is, to discover your owne, and looke directly
on those that behold you, and I will warrant you, that without any more adoe, or
new painting in your Shield, they will call you him <hi>of the illfavored face;</hi> And let this bee said in jest, that hunger and the want of your teeth, have given you, as I have said,
so <hi>evillfavoured a face,</hi> as you may well excuse all other heavy portraitures. <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi>
laught at his Squires conceit, and yet neverthelesse hee purposed to call himselfe
by that name, as soone as ever hee should have commodity to paint his Shield or
Buckler.</p>
                     <p>And after a pause he said to <hi>Sancho;</hi> I beleeve I am Excommunicated, for having
laid violent hands upon a consecrated thing. <hi>[Canon. 72. Distinct. 134.] Iuxta illud:
si quis suadente diabolo, &amp;c.</hi> Although I am certain I laid not my hands upon him, but
only this Javelin; and besides, I did not any way suspect that I offended Priests or
Church-men, which I doe respect and honour as a <hi>Catholick</hi> and faithfull <hi>Christian;</hi>
but rather that they were shadowes and spirits of the other world. And if the worst hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I remember well that which befell the <hi>Cid Ruy Diaz,</hi> when hee broke that other
Kings Embassadors chair before the Popes holinesse, for which hee excommunicated
him, and yet for all that the good <hi>Roderick Vivar</hi> behaved himself that day like an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and valiant Knight.</p>
                     <p>About this time the Batcheler departed, as is said, without speaking a word, and
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would faine have seene whether the corps that came in the Litter was bones or no, but <hi>Sancho</hi> would not permit him, saying, Sir you have finished this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Adventure, most with your safety of any one of those I have seene. This People,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54746:46"/>
although overcome and scattered, might perhaps fall in the consideration that hee who
hath overcome them is but one person alone, and growing ashamed thereof, would
perhaps joyne and unite themselves and turne upon us and give us enough businesse to
doe. The Asse is in good plight according to my desire, and the mountaine at hand,
and hunger oppresseth us, therefore wee have nothing else to doe at this time but retire
our selves with a good pace, and as it is said, <hi>to the grave with the Dead, and let them live to the Bread.</hi> And pricking on his Asse, hee requested his Master to follow him,
who seeing that <hi>Sancho</hi> spoke not without reason, hee spur'd after him without reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and having travailed a little way, between two small Mountaines they found a
large and hidden Valley, where they alighted; and <hi>Sancho</hi> lightning his beast, and lying
both along upon the greene grasse, holpen by the sauce of hunger, they broke their
fasts, dined, eate their Beaver and Supper all at one time; satisfying their apetites with
more then one dish of cold meate, which the dead Gentlemans Chaplaines (which
knew how to make much of themselves) had brought for their provision: But here
succeeded another discommodity which <hi>Sancho</hi> accounted not as the least, and was,
that they had no wine to drink; no, nor as much as a dropp of water to rinse their
mouthes, and being scorched with drought, <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiving the field where they were full of thick and green grasse, said that which shall ensue in the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

This counsell was allowed by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore
leading <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the Bridle, and <hi>Sancho</hi> his Asse by the halter, after laying up the
reversion of their Supper, they set on through the plaine, only guided by their guesse,
for the night was so darke as they could not see a jot. And scarce had they travailed
two hundred paces when they heard a great noise of water, as if it fell headlong from
some great and steep Rock. The noise did cheere them very much, and standing to
heare from whence it sounded, they heard unawares another noyse, which watered all
the continent; they conceived before, specially in <hi>Sancho,</hi> who as I have noted was
naturally very fearfull and of little spirit. They heard I say certain blowes strucken
with proportion, with a kinde of ratling of irons and chaines, which accompanied by
the furious sound of the water, might strike terror into any other heart but <hi>Don-Quixotes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The night, as wee said, was darke, and they hapned to enter in among certaine tall
and loftie trees, whose leaves moved by a soft gale of winde, made a fearfull and still
noyse; so that the solitude, situation, darknesse and the noyse of the water, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the leaves concurring, did breed horror and affright. But specially seeing that
the blowes never ceased, the winde slept not, nor the morning approached, whereunto
may bee added that they knew not the place where they were. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

with his valiant heart, leaped on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and embracing his Buckler,

true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but fear hath eyes which can see things under the ground, and much
more in the skies. And besides, we may gather by good discourse, that the day is not
far off. Let it be as little off as it lists, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> it shall never be recorded
of me, that either tears, or prayers could ever disswade me from performing the duty
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54746:47"/>
of a Knight; and therefore good <hi>Sancho</hi> hold thy peace, for God who hath inspired me to attempt this unseen and fearfull Adventure, will have an eye to my weale, and
also to comfort thy sorrow. And that thou hast therefore to doe, is to make straigh
my gyrts, and remain here; for I will return shortly either alive or dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiving his Lords last resolution, and how little his teares, counsailes or
prayers could availe, resolved to profit himselfe a little of his wit, and make him if hee
could to expect untill day, and so when hee did fasten the gyrts, hee softly, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
felt, tyed his Asses halter to both <hi>Rozinantes</hi> legs so falt, that when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
thought to depart hee could not, for that his Horse could not goe a step, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Sancho</hi> seeing the good successe of his guile, said, behold Sir how Heaven, moved by

grew wood at this, and yet the more hee spurred him, hee was the lesse able to goe;
wherefore without perceiving the cause of his Horses stay, hee resolved at last to bee
quiet, and expect either till the morning, or else till <hi>Rozinante</hi> would please to depart,
believing verily that the impediment came of some other cause, and not from <hi>Sancho;</hi>
and therefore said unto him: Since it is so <hi>Sancho,</hi> that <hi>Rozinante</hi> cannot stir him,
I am content to tarry till the dawning, although her tardines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e cost me some tears.
You shall have no cause to weep, replyed <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I will entertain you telling of
Histories untill it be day if you will not alight and take a nap upon these green hearbs,
as Knights Errant are wont, that you may be the fresher, and better able to morrow,
to attempt that monstrous Adventure which you expect. What doest thou call alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or sleeping, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Am I peradventure one of those Knights that
repose in time of danger? Sleep thou who wast borne to sleep, or doe what thou
please; for I will doe that which I shall see fittest for my pretence. Good Sir be not
angry, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I did not speak with that intention: And so drawing neer
unto him, he set one of his hands on the pomell of the saddle, and the other hinder in
such sort, that he rested imbracing his Lords left thigh, not daring to depart from
thence the bredth of a finger, such was the fear he had of those blows, which all the
while did sound without ceasing.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Don Quixote</hi> commanded him to tell some tale to passe away the time, as hee
had promised, and <hi>Sancho</hi> said hee would, if the feare of that which hee heard
would
suffer him. Yet, quoth hee, for all this I will encourage my selfe to tell you one,
whereon if I can hit aright, and that I bee not interrupted, is the best History that ever
you
heard, and bee you attentive for now I begin. <hi>It was, that it was, the good that

good Sir, that the beginning that ancient men gave to their tales, was not of
ordinary things, and it was a sentence of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Roman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

the harme bee for him that searches it:</hi> Which is as fit for this place as a ring for a finger,
to the end that you may bee quiet, and not to goe seeke your owne harme to any place,
but that wee turne us another way, for no body compelleth us to follow this, where
so many feares doe surprize us. Prosecute this tale <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and
leave the charge of the way wee must goe to mee. I say then quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Estremadura,</hi> there was a Sheepheard, I would say a Goateheard. And as I
say of my tale, this Goatheard was called <hi>Lope R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

on a Sheepheardesse who was called <hi>Torralua,</hi> the which Sheepheardesse called <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralua</hi>
was daughter to a rich Heard-man, and this rich heard-man. If thou tellest thy
tale <hi>Sancho</hi> after that manner, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> repeating every thing twice that
thou sayest, thou wilt not end it these two dayes; tell it succin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tly, and like one of
judgement, or else say nothing. Of the very same fashion that I tell, are all tales told
in my Countrey and I know not how to tell it any other way, nor is it reason that you
should aske of mee to make new customes. Tell it as thou pleasest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
for since fortune will not otherwise, but that I must heare thee, goe forward. So that
my deere Sir of my Soule, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that as I have said already, this Sheep heard
<pb facs="tcp:54746:48"/>
was in love with <hi>Torralua</hi> the Sheepheard esse, who was a round wench, scornefull, and
drew somwhat neere to a man, for shee had Mochachoes, for mee thinks I see her now
before my face. Belike then, quoth <hi>Don Quixote</hi> thou knewest her? I did not know
her quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but hee that told mee the tale, said it was so certaine and true, that
I might when I told it to any other, very well sweare and affirme that I had seene it all
my selfe. So that dayes passing and dayes coming, the Devill who sleepes not, and that
troubles all <hi>[Yque tod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sheepheard bore to the Sheepheardesse turned into man-slaughter and ill will, and
the cause was according to bad tongues; a certaine quantity of little jealousies that shee
gave him, such as they past the line, and came to the forbidden <hi>[A Spanish Proverb
touching their jealousie.]</hi> And the Sheepheard did hate her so much afterward that
hee was content to leave all that Countrey because hee would not see her, and goe
where his eyes should never looke upon her. <hi>Torralua</hi> that saw her selfe disdayned by
<hi>Lope,</hi> did presently love him better then ever shee did before; that is a naturall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of women, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to disdaine those that love them, and to affect
those which hate them. Passe forward <hi>Sancho.</hi> It hapned quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the
Sheepheard set his purpose in execution, and gathering up his Goates, hee travelled
through the fields of <hi>Estremadura,</hi> to passe into the Kingdom of <hi>Portugall. Torralua,</hi>
which knew it well, followed him a foote and bare legged, a farre off, with a Pilgrims
staffe in her hand, and a Wallet hanging at her neck, where they say that shee carried
a peece of a looking-glasse, and another of a combe, and I know not what little bottle
of changes for her face. But let her carry what shee carries, for I will not put my selfe
now to verifie that: Only I'le say that they say, that the Sheepheard arived with his
Goates to passe over the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> which in that season was swoln very much,
and overflowed the banks, and at the side where hee came there was neither boate nor
barke, nor any to passe himself or his Goats over the River, for which hee was very
much grieved, because hee saw that <hi>Torralua</hi> came very neere, and shee would trouble
him very much with her prayers and teares. But hee went so long looking up and
downe, that hee spyed a fisher, who had so little a boate, as it could only hold one
man and a Goate at once, and for all that hee spake and agreed with him to passe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and three hundred Goates that hee had over the River. The fisher-man entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the boate, and caried over one Goate, hee returned and past over another, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
back again and past over another. Keep you Sir good account of the Goates, that
the fisherman ferries over, for if one only bee forgotten, the tale will end, and it will
not be possible to tell one word more of it. Follow on then, and I say, that the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
place on the other side was very dirty and slippery, which made the fisherman spend
much time coming too and fro. Yet for all that he turned for another Goate, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and another.</p>
                     <p>Make account quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that thou hast past them all over, for otherwise
thou wilt not make an end of passing them in a whol yeeres space. How many said
<hi>Sancho</hi> are already past over? What a Devill know I, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> See there
that which I said quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you should keepe good account. By <hi>Iove</hi> the tale
is ended therefore, for there is no passing forward. How can that bee, said <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi>
is it so greatly of the essence of this History to know the Goates that are past so
exactly and distinctly, that if one of the number bee missed thou canst not follow on
with thy tale? No Sir, in no sort, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> for as soone as I demanded of you to tell
mee how many Goates past over, and that you answered mee you knew not, in that
very instant it went from me out of my memorie all that was to bee told, and yfaith it
was of great virtue and content. So then quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the tale is ended; it
is as certainly ended as is my Mother quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Surely, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
thou hast recounted one of the rarest tales or Histories that any one of the world could
thinke upon, and that such a manner of telling or finishing a tale, was never yet seene,
or shall bee seene againe, although I never expected any other thing from thy good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
But I doe not greatly marvaile, for perhaps those senselesse strokes, have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
thine understanding. All that may bee said <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I know in the discourse
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54746:48"/>
of my tale there is no more to be said, but that there is ends, where the errour of count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goats that were wafted over the River begins. Let it end in a good hour
where it lists, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and let us trie whether <hi>Rozinante</hi> can yet stir
himself; then did he turn again to give him the spurs, and he to leap as he did at the first
and rest anew, being unable to doe other, he was so well shackled.</p>
                     <p>It hapned about this time, that either through the cold of the morning, or that <hi>Sancho</hi> had eaten at supper some lenative meats, or that it was a thing naturall (and
that is most credible) he had a desire to doe that which others could not doe for him;
but such was the fear that entred into his heart, as he dared not depart from his Lord
the bredth of a straw; and to think to leave that which he had desired undone, was
also impossible; therefore his resolution in that perplexed exigent (be it spoken with
pardon) was this; he loosed his right hand, wherewithall he held fast the hinder part
of the saddle, and therewithall very softly, and without any noyse, he untied the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
poynt wherewithall his breeches were only supported, which, that being let slip,
did presently fall down about his legs like a pair of bolts: After this lifting up his shirt
the best he could, he exposed his buttocks to the aire, which were not the least: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, which as he thought was the chiefest thing requisite to issue out of that terrible
anguish and plunge; he was suddainly troubled with a greater, to wit, That he knew
not how to disburden himself without making a noyse: which to avoyd first he shut
his teeth close, lifted up his shoulders, and gathered up his breath as much as he might:
yet notwithstanding all these diligences, he was so unfortunate, that he made a little
noyse at the end, much different from that which made him so fearefull. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
heard it, and said, What noyse is that <hi>Sancho?</hi> I know it not Sir, quoth he; I think
it be some new thing for Adventures, or rather disventures never begin with a little.
Then turned' he once again to trie his hap, and it succeeded so well, that without
making any rumour or noyse, but that which he did at the first, he found himself free
of the loading the troubled him so much.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> having the sense of smelling, as perfect as that of his hearing; and
<hi>Sancho</hi> stood so neer, or rather joyned to him, as the vapours did ascend upward, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
by a direct line, he could not excuse himself but that some of them must needs
touch his nose. And scarce had they arrived, but that he occurd to the usuall remedy,
and stopped it very well between his fingers, and then said with a snaffling voyce: Me
thinks <hi>Sancho</hi> that thou art much afraid. I am indeed, replyed <hi>Sancho;</hi> but wherein
I pray you, doe you perceive it now more then ever? In that thou smellest now more
then ever, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and that not of Amber. It may be so, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi>
yet the fault is not mine, but yours, which bring me at such unseasonable hours, through
so desolate and fearfull places. I pray thee friend retire thy self two or three steps
back, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> holding his fingers still upon his nose; and from henceforth
have more care of thy person, and of the respect thou owest to mine; for I see the
overmuch familiarity that I use with thee, hath ingendred this contempt. I dare wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you think I have done somewhat with my person that I ought
not. Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> it is the worse to stir it thus. And thus in
these and such like conversation the Master and the Man passed over the night. And
<hi>Sancho</hi> seeing that the morning approached, he loosed <hi>Rozinante</hi> very warily, and tyed
up his hose, <hi>Rozinante</hi> feelling himself (although hee was not naturally very coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious)
hee seemed to rejoyce, and began to beat the ground with his hoofs; for by
his leave he could never yet curvet. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing that <hi>Rozinante</hi> could now
stir, accounted it to be a good signe, and an incouragement of him to attempt that
timorous Adventure.</p>
                     <p>By this <hi>Aurora</hi> did display her purple mantle over the face of Heaven, and every
thing appeared distinctly, which made <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceive that he was among a
number of tall Chesnut-trees, which commonly make a great shadow: He heard like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
those incessable stroaks, but could not espie the cause of them; wherefore giving
<hi>Rozinante</hi> presently the spur, and turning back again to <hi>Sancho,</hi> to bid him farewell,
he commanded him to stay for him there three dayes at the longest, and that if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb facs="tcp:54746:49"/>
not after that space, he should make full account that <hi>Iove</hi> was pleased hee
should end his dayes in that dangerous Adventure.</p>
                     <p>After this charge given by <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee repeated to him againe the
embassage and errant hee should cary in his behalfe to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the reward of his services hee should not feare any thing, for hee had left his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
made before hee departed from his Village, where hee should finde himselfe

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed touching all that which pertained to his hyre, according to the rate of the time
hee had served. But if God would bring him off from that Adventure safe and sound,
and without danger, hee might fully account to receive the promised Island. Here
<hi>Sancho</hi> began anew to weepe, hearing againe the pittifull discourses of his good Lord,
and determined not to abandon him untill the last trance and end of that affaire, and
out of these teares and honourable resolution of <hi>Sancho,</hi> the author of this History col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
that it is like hee was well borne, or at the very least an old <hi>Christian,</hi> whose grief
did move his Master a little, but not so much as he should shew the least argument of
weakness, but rather dissembling it the best he could, he followed on his way towards
the way of the water, and that where the stroakes were heard. <hi>Sancho</hi> followed him a
foote, leading as he was wont his Asse by the halter, who was the inseparable fellow of
his prosperous or adverse fortunes.</p>
                     <p>And having travelled a good space among these Chesnut and shady trees, they came
out into a little plaine that stood at the foote of certaine steepe Rocks, from whose
tops did precipitate it self a great fall of water. There were at the foot of those rockes
certaine houses, so ill made, as they rather seemed ruines of buildings then houses;
from whence as they perceived, did issue the fearfull rumour and noyse of the stroaks,
which yet continued. <hi>Rozinante</hi> at this dreadfull noyse did start, and being
made quiet by his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> did by little and little draw neer to the
houses, recommending himself on the way most devoutly to his Ladie <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to <hi>Iove,</hi> desiring him that hee would not forget him. <hi>Sancho</hi> never departed from
his Lords side, and stretched out his neck and eyes as farr as he might through <hi>Rozinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
his legg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, to see if he could perceive that which held him so fearfull and suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And after they had travelled about a hundred paces, more at the dubling of a
point of a Mountaine they saw the very cause patent and open (for there could bee
none other) of that so hideous and fearefull a noyse that had kept them all the night
so doubtfull and affrighted, and was (O Reader if thou wilt not take it in bad part)
six iron Maces that fulled cloath, which with their interchangeable blowes, did forme
that marvelous noyse.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw what it was, hee waxed mute and all ashamed. <hi>Sancho</hi>
beheld him, and saw that hee hanged his head on his breast with tokens that hee was
somewhat ashamed. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> looked also on his Squire, and saw his cheeks swolne
with laughter, giving withall evident signes that hee was in danger to burst, if he vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not that passion, whereat all <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> melancholy little prevayling, he could
not, beholding <hi>Sancho,</hi> but laugh also himselfe. And when <hi>Sancho</hi> saw his Master begin
the play, hee let slip the prisoner, in such violent manner pressing his sides with both
his hands, to save himselfe from bursting. Foure times hee ended, and other foure he
renewed his laughter, with as great impulse and force as at the first, whereat <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi>
was wonderfully enraged, but chiefly hearing him say, in jibing manner; I would
have thee know friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I was borne by the disposition of Heaven in this our
age of Iron, to renewe in it that of gold, or the golden world. I am hee for whom are
reserved all dangerous, great and valorous feats. And in this sort hee went repeating
all or the greatest part of the words <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had said the first time that they
heard the timerous blowes, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiving that <hi>Sancho</hi> mock't him, grew so
ashamed and angry withall, that lifting up the end of his lance, hee gave him two such
blowes on the back, as if hee had received them on his pate, would have freed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
from paying him any wages, if it were not to his Heires. <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing that hee
gayned so ill earnest by his jests, fearing that his Master should goe onward with it, he
said unto him with very great submission; Pacifie your selfe good Sir, for by <hi>Iove</hi> I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54746:49"/>
did but jest. But why doest thou jest? I tell thee I doe not jest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
Come here Master Merriman, thinkest thou that as those are iron Maces to full Cloth,
if they were some other dangerous Adventure, that I have not shewn resolution
enough to undertake and finish it? Am I by chance oblieged, being, as I am, a Knight,
to know and distinguish noyses, and perceive which are of a Fulling-Mill, or no?
And more it might (as it is true) that I never saw any before as thou hast done, base
Villain that thou art, born and braught up among the like: if not, make thou that these
six Maces be converted into Giants, and cast them in my beard one by one, or all
together; and when I doe not turn all their heels up, then mock me as much as thou
pleasest.</p>
                     <p>No more good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I confesse I have been somewhat too laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
but tell me I pray you, now that we are in peace, as God shall deliver you out
of all Adventures that may befall you as whole and sound, as he hath done out
of this: Hath not the great fear we were in, been a good subject of laughter, and a
thing worthy the telling? At least I, for of you, I am certain that you doe not yet
know what fear or terrour is. I doe not denye, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but that which
befell us is worthy of laughter; yet ought it not to be recounted, for as much as all
persons are not so discreet, as to know how to discerne one thing from another, and set
every thing in his right poynt. You know at least wise, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> how to set your
Javelin in his poynt, when poynting at my pate you hit me on the shoulders, thanks be
to God, and to the diligence I put in going aside. But farewell it, for all will away
in the bucking; and I have heard old folk say, That man loves thee well who makes
thee to weep: And besides great Lords are wont after a bad word which they say
to one of their Servingmen, to bestow on him presently a pair of hose. But I know
not yet what they are wont to give them after blows, if it be not that Knights Errant
give after the Bastanado Islands, or Kingdoms on the continent. The Die might run
so favourably; quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as all thou hast said might come to passe; and
therefore pardon what is done since thou art discreet, and knowest that a mans first
motions are not in his hand. And be advertised of one thing from hence forward
to the end to abstain, and carry thy self more respectively in thy over-much liberty
of speech with me) that in as many books of Chivalry as I have read, which are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
I never found that any Squire spoak so much with his Lord, as thou doest with
thine: which in good sooth I doe attribute to thy great indiscretion and mine; thine
in respecting me so little; mine in not making my self to be more regarded. Was not
<hi>Gandalin, Amadis du Gaules</hi> Squire Earl of the firm Island? and yet it is read of
him, that hee spoak to his Lord with his Cap in his hand, his head bowed, and his body
bended <hi>(more Turcesco.)</hi> What then shall we say of <hi>Gasabel, Don Gataors</hi> Squire,
who was so silent, as to declare us the excellencie thereof, his name is but once repeated
in all that so great and authenticall a History? Of all which my words <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou
must infer, that thou must make difference between the Master and the man; the Lord
and his Serving-man; the Knight and his Squire. So that from this day forward we
must proceed with more respect, not letting the clew run so much; for after what
way soever I grow angry with thee, it will be bad for the Pitcher. The rewards and
benefits that I have promised thee will come in their time; and if they doe not, thy
wages cannot be lost (as I have already said to thee).</p>
                     <p>You say very well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but fain would I learn (in case that the time of
rewards came not, and that I must of necessity trust to my wages) how much a Knight
Errants Squire did gain in times past? Or if they did agree for moneths, or by dayes
as Masons men. I doe not think, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that they went by the hire,
but only trusted to their Lords courtesie. And if I have assigned wages to thee in my
sealed Testament, which I left at home, it was to prevent the worst; because I know
not yet what successe Chivalry may have in these our so miserable times; and I would
not have my Soul suffer in the other world for such a minuity as is thy wages. For thou
must understand, that in this world there is no state so dangerous as that of Knights
Errant. That is most true, replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing the only sound of the Maces of a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:50"/>
Fulling-Mill could trouble and disquiet the heart of so valiant a Knight as you are.
But you may be sure, that I will not hereafter once unfold my lips to jest at your doings,
but only to honour you as my Master and naturall Lord. By doing so, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
thou shalt live on the face of the earth; for next to our parents, we are
bound to respect our Masters, as if they were our Fathers.</p>

before: within a while after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> espied one a horse-back,
that bore on his head somewhat that glistered like gold;
and scarce had he seen him, when he turned to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and said,
Me thinks <hi>Sancho</hi> that there's no proveb that is not true; for they are all sentences
taken out of experience it self, which is the universall mother of Sciences; and specially
that proverb that sayes, <hi>Where one door is shut another is opened.</hi> I say this, because if
fortune did shut yester night the door that we searched deceiving us in the Adventure
of the iron Maces, it layes us how wide open the door that may addresse us to a better
and more certain Adventure, whereon if I cannot make a good entrie, the fall shall be
mine, without being able to attribute it to the little knowledge of the Fulling Maces,
or the darkenesse of the night; which I affirm, because, if I be not deceived, there
comes one towards us, that wears on his head the helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> for which I
made the Oath. See well what you say Sir, and better what you doe quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi>
for I would not with that this were new Maces to batter us and our understanding.
The Divell take thee for a man, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Helmet and fulling Maces? I know not, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but if I could speak
as much now as I was wont, perhaps I would give you such reasons, as you your self
should see how much you are deceived in that you speak. How may I be deceived in
that I say, scrupulous traytor, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Tell me; seest thou not that
Knight which comes riding towards us on a dapple gray horse, with a Helmet of gold
on his head? That which I see and finde out to be so, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> is none other
then a man on a gray Asse like mine own, and brings on his head somewhat that shines.
Why that is <hi>Mambrino's</hi> Helmet, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> stand aside and leave me
alone with him; thou shalt see how without speech, to cut off delayes, I will conclude
this Adventure, and remain with the Helmet as mine own, which I have so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired:
I will have care to stand off: but I turn again to say, that I pray God, that it
be a purchase of gold, and not Fulling-Mills: I have already said unto thee, that thou
doe not make any more mention, no not in thought of those Maces: For if thou doest,
said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I vow, I say no more, that I will batter thy soul. Here <hi>Sancho</hi>
fearing lest his Master would accomplish the vow which he had thrown out as round
as a bowle, held his peace.</p>
                     <p>This therefore is the truth of the History of the Helmet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Horse and Knight, which
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw: There was in that Commarke two villages, the one so little as it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54746:50"/>
had neither shop nor Barber, but the greater that was neere unto it, was furnished of
one; and hee therefore did serve the little village when they had any occasion, as now
it befell that therein lay one sick and must bee let blood, and another that desired to
trimme his Beard; for which purpose the Barber came, bringing with him a brazen
Bason: and as hee travelled, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y chance began to rayne, and therefore clapt his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on his head to save his hat from stayning, because it belike was a new one. And the
Bason being cleane scowred, glistered halfe a league off. Hee rode on a gray Asse, as
<hi>Sancho</hi> said; and that was the reason why <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke him to bee a dapple
gray Steed: Hee likewise took the Barber for a Knight, and his glistering Bason
for a Helmet of gold; for hee did with all facilitie apply every thing which hee
saw to his raving Chivalrie and ill-errant thoughts. And when hee saw that the poor
Knight drew neere, without setling himselfe to commune with him, hee inrested his
<hi>[Sancon]</hi> Javelin low on the thigh, and ran with all the force <hi>Rozinante</hi> might, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to strike him thorow and thorow; and drawing neere unto him, without stoping
his Horse, hee cryed defend thy selfe Caytif, or else render unto mee willingly that
which is my due by all reason.</p>
                     <p>The Barber who so without fearing or surmising any such thing, saw that Fantasie
and Spirit came upon him, had no other remedy to avoid the blow of the Launce but
to fall off of his Asse to the ground: and scarce had hee touched the earth, when ris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up againe as light as a Deer, he runn away so swiftly through the plane, as the
winde could scarce overtake him; leaving behind him on the ground his Bason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rested content, and said, that <hi>Pagan</hi> which lost it was discreet,
and did imitate the <hi>Castor,</hi> who seeing himself hotly pursued by the hunters, which tears
&amp; cuts away that with his teeth, for which hee knows by naturall instinct he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Then hee commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to take up the Helmet, who lifting it said, the Bason
is a good one by God, and is as well worth a Riall of eight as a marmedie; and giving
it to his Lord, hee presently set it on his head, turning about every way, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee could get the Beaver, and seeing hee could not finde it, hee said. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
for whome this famous Helmet was first forged, had doubtlesly a very
great Head; and that which grieves mee principally is, that this Helmet wants the one
halfe.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> haard him call the Bason a Helmet, hee could not contain his laughter,
but presently remembering of his Masters choler, hee chek't it in the midst. Why dost
thou laugh <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixotes.?</hi> I laugh said hee, to thinke on the great
head the <hi>Pagan,</hi> owner of this Helmet, had; for it is for all the world like a Barbers
Bason. Know <hi>Sancho</hi> that I imagine, quoth <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that this famous peece of
this inchanted Helmet did fall by some strange accident into some ones hands that knew
not the worth thereof, and seeing it was of pure gold, without knowing what hee did,
I thinke hee hath molten the halfe, to profit himselfe therewithall, and made of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
ther halfe this, which seemes a Barbers Bason, as thou sayest: But bee what it list, to
mee who knows well what it is, his transmutation makes no matter; for I will dresse it
in the first towne where I shall finde a Smith, as that which the God of forges made for
the God of Warre shall not surpasse, no nor come neere it; and in the meane while I
will weare it as I may; for somthing is better then nothing: and more, seeing it may
very well defend mee from the blow of a stone. That's true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if it bee
not throwne out of a sling, such as that of the battle of the two Armies, when they
blessed your Worships cheeke teeth, and broke the bottle wherein you carried the most
blessed drench which made mee vomit up my guts. I doe not much care for the losse of
it <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for as thou knowest I have the receite in memory; so have
I likewise quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but if ever I make it or taste it again in my life, I pray God
that here may bee mine end. How much more I never meane to thrust my selfe, into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occasion wherein I should have neede of it; for I meane with all my five sences to
keepe my selfe from hurting any, or being hurt. Of being once againe tost in a Coverlet
I say nothing, for such disgraces can hardly bee prevented, and if they befall, there is
no other remedie but patience, and to lift up the shoulders, keepe in the breath, shut
<pb facs="tcp:54746:51"/>
the eyes, and suffer our selves to be borne where Fortune and the Coverlet pleaseth.</p>
                     <p>Thou art a bad Christian <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hearing him say so; for thou
never forgetest the injuries that are once done to thee: know that it is the duty of
noble and generous mindes, not to make any account of toyes. What leg hast thou
brought away lame? what rib broken? or what head hurt, that thou canst not yet
forget that jest? for the thing being well examined, it was none other then a jest or
pastime; for if I did not take it to be such, I had returned by this to that place, and
done more harme in thy revenge, then that which the Greeks did for the rape of <hi>Helen:</hi>
who if she were in these times, or my <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in hers, she might be sure she should
never have gained so much fame for beauty as she did: And saying so, he pierced the
skie with a sigh. Then said <hi>Sancho,</hi> let it passe for a jest, since the revenge cannot
passe in earnest. But I know well the quality both of the jest and earnest, and also that
they shall never fall out of my memory, as they will never out of my shoulders. But
leaving this apart, what shall we doe with this dapple gray stead, that looks so like a
gray Asse, which that <hi>Martin</hi> left behinde, whom you overthrew, who according as
he laid feet on the dust and made haste, he mindes not to come back for him again;
and by my beard the gray beast is a good one. I am not accustomed, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
to ransack and spoyl those whom I overcome; nor is it the practise of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
to take their horses and let them goe a foot: if that it befall the Victor to lose
in the conflict his own; for in such a case it is lawfull to take that of the Vanquished
as won in fair warre. So that <hi>Sancho</hi> leave that Horse, or Asse, or what else thou
pleasest to call it; for when his owner sees us departed, he will return again for it.
God knows, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> whether it will be good or no for me to take him, or at
least change for mine own, which me thinks is not so good. Truely the Laws of
Knighthood are straight, since they extend not themselves to licence the exchange of
one Asse for another: And I would know whether they permit at least to exchange
the one harnesse for another. In that I am not very sure, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and as
a case of doubt (untill I be better informed) I say that thou exchange them, if by
chance thy need bee extream. So extream, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that If they were for mine
own very person, I could not neede them more. And presently, enabled by the
Licence, he made <hi>mutatio Caparum,</hi> and set forth his beast like a hundred holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes.</p>
                     <p>This being done they broak their fast with the reliques of the spoyles they had made
in the Camp of Sumpter horse, and drunk of the Mills streams, without once turning
to look on them (so much they abhor'd them for the marveilous terrour they had
strucken them in) and having by their repast cut away all cholerick and melancholick
humours, they followed on the way which <hi>Rozinante</hi> pleased to lead them (who
was the depository of his Masters will, and also of the Asses; who followed him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
wheresoever he went, in good amity and company. For all this they returned
to the high-way, wherein they travelled at randome, without any certain deliberation
which way to goe. And as they thus travailed, <hi>Sancho</hi> said to his Lord, Sir, will you
give me leave to commune a little with you; for since you have imposed upon me
that sharp commandement of silence, more then four things have rotted in my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack;
and one thing that I have now upon the tip of my tongue, I would not wish for
any thing that it should miscarrie. Say it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and be brief in thy
reasons; <hi>for none is delightfull if it bee prolix.</hi> I say then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I have
beene these later daies, considering how little is gained by following these Adventures,
that you doe through these Desarts and crosse waies, where though you overcome and
finish the most dangerous; yet no man sees or knowes them, and so they shall remaine
in perpetuall silence, both to your prejudice, and that of the fame which they deserve.
And therefore mee thinks it were better (still excepting your better judgement herein)
that wee went to serve some Emperour, or other great Prince that maketh warre, in
whose service you might shew the valour of your Person, your marvelous force, and
wonderfull Judgement: which being perceived by the Lord whom wee shall serve, hee
must perforce reward us, every one according to his deserts; and in such a place will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54746:51"/>
not want one to record your noble acts for a perpetuall memory: of mine I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
seeing they must not transgresse the Squire-like limits; although I dare avouch
that if any notice bee taken in Chivalry of the feats of Squires, mine shall not fall away
betwixt the lines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> thou sayest not ill, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but before such a thing come to
passe, it is requisite to spend some time up and down the World, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
seeking of Adventures; to the end, that by atchieving some, a man may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
such fame and renown, as when hee goes to the Court of any great Monarch,
hee bee there already known by his works, and that hee shall scarcely bee perceived
to enter at the gates by the boyes of that Citie, when they all will follow and inviron
him, crying out aloud, That is the Knight of the Sunne, or the Serpent, or of some
other device, under which hee hath atchieved strange Adventures. This is hee (will
they say) who overcame in single sight the huge Giant <hi>Brocabruno</hi> of the invincible
strength. Hee that disinchanted the great <hi>Sophie</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> of the large inchantment
wherein hee had lien almost nine hundred years. So that they will thus goe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
his acts from hand to hand; and presently the King of that Kingdome,
moved by the great bruit of the boyes and other people, will stand at the Windows
of his Pallace, to see what it is; And as soon as hee shall eye the Knight, knowing
him by his Armes, or by the <hi>Impresa</hi> of his Shield, he must necessarily say, Up, goe
all of you my Knights, as many of you as are in Court, forth, to receive the flower
of Chivalry, which comes there. At whose commandement they all will salley, and
hee himself will come down to the midest of the stairs, and will imbrace him most
straightly, &amp; will give him the peace, kissing him on the cheek; and presently will carrie
him by the hand to the Queens Chamber, where the Knight shall finde her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by the Princesse her daughter, which must bee one of the fairest and debonair
Damzels that can be found throughout the vast compasse of the earth: After this
will presently and in a trice succeed, that shee will cast her eye on the Knight, and
hee on her, and each of them shall seem to the other no humane creature, but an
Angell; and then without knowing how, or how not, they shall remain captive
and intangled in the intricable amorous Net, and with great care in their mindes,
because they know not how they shall speak to discover their anguish and feeling.
From thence the King will carrie him without doubt, to some quarter of his Pallace
richly hanged; where, having taken off his Armes, they will bring him a rich Mantle
of Scarlet, furred with Ermines, to wear; and if hee seemed well before, being
Armed; hee shall now look as well, or better, out of them. The night being come,
hee shall Sup with the King, Queen, and Princesse, where he shall never take his eye
off her, beholding unawares of those that stand present, and shee will doe the like with
as much discretion: for, as I have said, shee is a very discreet Damzell. The Tables
shall bee taken up; there shall enter unexpectedly in at the hall, an ill-favoured
little Dwarff, with a fair Lady that comes behinde the Dwarff between two Giants,
with a certain Adventure wrought by a most ancient wise man; and that hee who
shall end it, shall be held for the best Knight of the World. Presently the King
will command all those that are present to prove it, which they doe, but none of them
can finish it, but only the new come Knight to the great proof of his fame. Whereat
the Princesse will remain very glad, and will be very joyfull and well apaid, because
shee hath setled her thoughts in so high a place. And the best of it is. That this King,
or Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Knight his guest doth ask him (after hee hath been in the Court a few dayes)
licence to goe and serve him in that Warre. The King will give it with a very good
will, and the Knight will kisse his hands courteously for the favour hee doth him
therein: And that night he will take leave of his Ladie the Princesse by some win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a Garden that looks into her Bed-chamber, by the which he hath spoaken to her
oft times before, being a great means and help thereto, a certain Damzell which the
Princesse trusts very much. He sighs, and she will fall in a swond, and the Damzell
will bring water, to bring her to her self again. Shee will bee also full of care because
<pb facs="tcp:54746:52"/>
the morning draws neer, and she would not have them discovered for any her
Ladies honour. Finally, the Princesse will return to her self, and will give out her
beautifull hands at the window to the Knight, who will kisse them a thousand and a
thousand times, and will bathe them all in tears. There it will remain agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them two, the means that they will use to acquaint one another with their
good or bad successes; and the Princesse will pray him to stay away as little time as
he may, which hee shall promise unto her, with many Oaths and Protestations.
Then will he turn again to kisse her hands, and take his leave of her with such feeling,
that there will want but little to end his life in the place: hee goes from thence
to his Chamber, and casts himself upon his Bed; but he shall not be able to sleep
a nap for sorrow of his departure: Hee will after get up very early, and will goe
to take leave of the King, the Queene and Princesse. They tell him (having taken
leave of the first two) that the Princesse is ill at ease and that shee cannot bee visited:
the Knight thinks that it is for griefe of his departure, and the which ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ngs launceth
him a new to the bottom of his heart. whereby hee will bee almost constrained to
give manifest tokens of his griefe: the damzel that is privie to their loves will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and must note all that passeth, and goe after to tell it to her Mistrisse, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
her with teares, and sayes, unto her that one of the greatest afflictions shee
hath is, that shee doth not know who is her Knight, or whether hee bee of blood
royall or no: Her Damzell will assure her againe, that so great bountie, beauty and
valour as is in her Knight, could not finde place but in a great and royall subject. The
carefull Princesse will comfort her selfe with this hope, and labor to bee cheerefull
left shee should give occasion to her Parents to suspect any sinister thing of her; and
within two dayes agayne shee will come out in publique. By this the Knight is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
hee fights in the war, and overcomes the Kings enemie, hee winnes many
Cities, and triumphs for many Battles, hee returnes to the Court, hee visits his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and speaks to her at the accustomed place, hee agreeth with her to demand her of
the King for his wife, in reward of his services, whereunto the King will not
consent, because hee knowes not what hee is: but for all this, eyther by carying her
away, or by some other manner, the Princesse becomes his wife, and hee accounts
himselfe therefore very fortunate, because it was after known that the same Knight
is sonne to a very valorous King, of I know not what Countrey; for I beleeve it is
not in all the Mappe. The Father dies, and the Princesse doth inherit the Kingdome,
and thus in two words our Knight is become a King, Here in this place enters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the commoditie to reward his Squire, and all those that holpe him to ascend
to so high an estate. Hee marries his Squire with one of the Princesses Damzels,
which shall doubtlesly be the very same that was acquainted with his love, who is some
principall Dukes daughter.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That's it I seek for, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and all will goe right; therefore I will leave to
that; for every whit of it which you said will happen to your self, without missing a
jot, calling your self, <hi>The Knight of the ill-favoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ace.</hi> Never doubt it <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for even in the very same manner, and by the same steps that I have
recounted here, Knights Errant doe ascend, and have ascended to be Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
This only is expedient, That we enquire what King among the Christians or
Heathens makes warr and hath a fair daughter: but we shall have time enough to
bethink that, since as I have said we must first acquire fame in other places, before we
goe to the Court. Also I want another thing, that put case that we find a Christian
or Pagan King, that hath warrs and a fair daughter, and that I have gained incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
fame throughout the wide-world, yet cannot I tell how I might finde that I
am descended from Kings, or that I am at the least Cousen Germain removed
of an Emperour? for the King will not give mee his daughter untill this bee first very
well proved, though my works deserve it never so much; so that I feare to lose
through this defect, that which mine owne hath merited so well. True it is that I am
a Gentleman of a known house of propriety and possession; and perhaps the wise man
that shall write my History will so beautifie my kindred and discent, that hee will finde
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54746:52"/>
mee to bee the fift or sixe discent from a King; for thou must understand <hi>Sancho,</hi> that
there are two manners of lineages in the world. Some that derive their Pedegree from
Princes and Monarchs, whom time hath by little and little diminished and consumed,
and ended in a point like <hi>Pyramydes.</hi> Others that tooke their beginning from base
people, and ascend from degree unto degree, untill they become at last great Lords.
So that all the difference is, That some were that which they are not now; and others
are that which they were not; and it might bee that I am of those, and after good exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
my beginning might bee found to have beene famous and glorious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
the King, my father in lawe ought to bee content, whosoever hee were: and
when hee were not, yet shall the Princesse love mee in such sort, that shee shall in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of her Fathers teeth admitt mee for her Lord and Spouse, although shee knew
mee to bee the son of a water-bearer. And if not, here in this place may quader well
the carying of her away perforce, and carying of her where best I liked; for either time
or death must needs end her fathers displeasure.</p>
                     <p>Here comes well to passe that, <hi>Sancho,</hi> which some damned fellowes are wont to say;
<hi>Seeke not to get that with a good will, which thou maist take perforce,</hi> although it were
better said, <hi>The leaps of a shrub is more worth then good mens intreaties.</hi> I say it to this
purpose, that if the King your father in law will not condiscend to give unto you
the Princesse my Mistresse, then there's no more to be done, but as you say to
her, steal away and carry her to another place: but all the harme is, that in the mean
while that composition is unmade, and you possesse not quietly your Kingdome,
the poor Squire may whistle for any benefit or pleasure you are able to doe him, if it
bee not that the damzel of whom you spoke even now, run away with her Lady, and
that hee passe away his misfortunes now and then with her, untill heaven ordaine some
other thing: for I doe think that his Lord may give her unto him presently, if shee
please to be his lawfull Spouse. There's none that can deprive thee of that, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Why, so that this may befall, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's no more but to
commend our selves to God and let Fortune runne where it may best addresse us. God
bring it so to passe, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as I desire, and thou hast need of <hi>Sancho;</hi> and
let him be a wretch that accouts himself one. Let him be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I am an
old Christian; and to be an Earl, there is no more requisite. I, and 'tis more then
enough, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for that purpose; and though thou werest not, it made
not much matter; for I being a King, may give thee nobility, without eyther buying
of it, or serving me with nothing: For in creating thee an Earle, loe thereby thou art
a Gentleman. And let men say what they please; they must in good faith, call thee
Right Honourable, although it grieve them never so much. And think you, quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> that I would not authorize my <hi>Litado.</hi> Thou must say <hi>Dictado</hi> or dignity,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and not <hi>Litado,</hi> for that's barbarous word. Let it be so, quoth
<hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> I say that I would accommodate all very well; for I was once the
Warner of a <hi>Confratriety,</hi> and the Warners gown became me so well, that every one
said I had a presence sit for the Provest of the same. Then how much more when I
shall set on my shoulders the Royall Robe of a Duke, or bee apparrelled with gold and
pearls after the custome of strange Earls? I doe verify believe that men will come a
hundred leagues to see me. Thou wilt seem very well, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but thou
must shave that beard very often; for as thou hast it now so bushie, knit, and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
if thou shavest it not with a Razor at the least every other day, men will know
that thou art as farre from Gentilitie as a Musquet can carrie. What more is there
to be done, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> then to take a Barber and keep him hired in my house? yea,
and if it be necessary, hee shall ride after me, as if hee were a Master of Horse to some
Noble man. How knowest thou, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that Noble men have their
Masters of Horses riding after them? Some few years agoe I was a moneth in the
Court, and there I saw that a young little Lord rode by for his pleasure, they said hee
was a great <hi>Grandee:</hi> there followed him still a horse-back a certain man turning
every way that he went, so as he verily seemed to bee his horse taile. I then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the cause, why that man did not ride by the others side, but still did follow
<pb facs="tcp:54746:53"/>
him so? They answered me that he was Master of his horses, and that the <hi>Grandees</hi>
were accustomed to carrie such men after them. Thou sayest true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and thou mayest carrie thy Barber in that manner after thee; for <hi>customes came not all
together,</hi> nor were not invented at once: And thou mayest bee the first Earl that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Barber after him. And I doe assure thee that it is an Office of more trust to
trim a mans beard then to saddle a horse. Let that of the Barber rest to my charge,
quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and that of procuring to be a King, and of creating me an Earl, to
yours. It shall bee so, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> And thus lifting up his eyes, hee saw
that which shall bee recounted in the chapter following.</p>

in this most grave, lofty, divine, sweet, conceited History,
That after these discourses past between <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his
Squire <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> which we have laid down in the last Chapter,
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lifting up his eyes, saw that there came in the very
same way wherein they rode, about some twelve men in a company
on foot, inserted like Bead-stones in a great chain of iron, that was
tyed about their necks, and every one of them had manacles besides on their hands.
There came to conduct them two on horse-back and two others a foot: The horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had fire-lock pieces; Those that came a foot, darts and swords. And as soon as
<hi>Sancho</hi> saw them, hee said; This is a chain of Gally-slaves, people forced by the King
to goe to the Gallies. How? people forced, demanded <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> is it possible
that the King will force any body? I say not so, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> but that it is peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which are condemned for their offences to serve the King in the Gallies perforce.
In resolution, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> (howsoever it bee) this folk, although they bee
conducted, goe perforce, and not willingly. That's so, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Then if that bee
so, here falls in justly the execution of my Function, to wit, the dissolving of violences
and outrages, and the succouring of the afflicted and needfull. I pray you Sir, quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> to consider that the Justice, who represents the King himself, doth wrong or
violence to nobody; but only doth chastise them for their committed crimes.</p>
                     <p>By this the chaine of slaves arrived, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with very courteous termes
requested those that went in their guard, that they would please to informe him of the
cause wherefore they carried that people away in that manner? One of the guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
a Horse-back answered, that they were slaves condemned by his Majesty to the
Gallies, and there was no more to be said, neither ought he to desire any farther know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
For all that, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I would faine learne of every one of them
in particular the cause of his disgrace: and to this did add other such and so cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
words, to move them to tell him what he desired, as the other guardian a Horse-back
said. Although we carry here the Register and testimony of the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of every one of these wretches, yet this is no time to hold them here long, or
take out the Processes to reade; draw you neerer and demaund it of themselves, for
they may tell it and they please, and I know they will; for they are men that take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
both in acting and relating knaveries.</p>
                     <p>With this licence, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himself would have taken, although they had
not given it him, he came to the chaine, and demanded of the first for what offence
he went in so ill a guise? Hee answered that his offence was no other then for being
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54746:53"/>
in love; for which cause only hee went in that manner. For that and no more, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Well, if enamoured folk be cast into the Gallies, I might have
been rowing there a good many dayes agoe. My love was not such as you conjecture,
quoth the slaue, for mine was that I loved so much a basket well heaped with fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
as I did embrace it so straightly, that if the Justice had not taken it away from
me by force, I would not have forsaken it to this hour by my good will. All was done
in <hi>Flagrante,</hi> there was no leisure to give me torment, the cause was concluded, my
shoulders accommodated with a hundred, and for a supplement three prices of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupes,</hi>
and the worke was ended. What are <hi>Garrupes,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote? Garrupes</hi>
are Gallies, replyed the slave, who was a young man of some four and twenty years
old, and said he was borne in <hi>Piedrahita.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demaunded of the second his cause of offence, who would answer
nothing he went so sad and melancholy. But the first answered for him, and said, Sir
this man goes for a <hi>Canary-bird,</hi> I meane for a Musitian and Singer. Is it possible,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that Musitians and Singers are likewise sent to the Gallies? Yes
Sir, quoth the slave, for there's nothing worse then to sing in anguish. Rather, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I have heard say that he <hi>which sings doth affright and chase away his harms.</hi>
Here it is quite contrary, quoth the slave, for <hi>He that sings once, weeps all his life after.</hi>
I doe not understand it, said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> But one of the Gardians said to him,
Sir Knight, to <hi>sing in anguish,</hi> is said among this people <hi>non Sancta,</hi> to confesse upon
the rack. They gave this poor wretch the torture, and hee confessed his delight, that
hee was a <hi>Quartrezo,</hi> that is a stealer of Beasts: And because hee hath confessed, hee
is likewise condemned to the Gallies for six yeers, with an <hi>Amen</hi> of two hundred
blows, which hee bears already with him on his shoulders: And he goes alwaies thus
sad and pensative, because the other theeves that remain behinde, and also those which
goe here doe abuse, despise, and scorn him for confessing, and not having a courage
to say <hi>Non:</hi> For they say a <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </hi> hath as many letters as a <hi>Yea;</hi> and that a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is very fortunate, when his life or his death only depends of his own tongue, and
not of witnesses or proofs: And in mine opinion they have very great reason. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
think the same, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And passing to the third, hee demanded that which hee had done of the rest, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him out of hand, and that pleasantly: I goe to the Lady <hi>Garrupes</hi> for five yeers,
because I wantted ten Duccats. I will give twenty with all my heart to free thee from
that misfortune, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> That, quoth the Slave, would be like one that
hath money in the midest of the Gulf, and yet dies for hunger, because hee can get no
meat to buy for it. I say this because if I had those twenty Duccats which your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
liberality offers me, in due season, I would have so annointed with them the Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
pen, and whetted my Lawyers wit so well, that I might to day see my self in the
midest of the Market of <hi>Cocodover</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and not in this way trayled thus like a
Gray-hound: but God is great. Patience, and this is enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went after to the fourth, who was a man of a venerable presence,
with a long white beard which reached to his bosome. Who hearing himself demanded
the cause why he came there, began to weep, and answered not a word. But the fift
Slave lent him a tongue, and said, This honest man goes to the Gallies for four yeers,
after he had walked the Ordinary apparrelled in pompe, and a horse-back. That is,
quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> as I take, after hee was carried about to the shame and publique
view of the People. You are in the right, quoth the Slave; and the crime for which
hee is condemned to this pain, was, for being a Broker of the ear, I, and of all the body
too; for in effect I mean that this Gentleman goeth for a Baud, and likewise for
having a little smack and entrance in witch-craft. If that smack and insight in witch-craft
were not added, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hee merrited not to goe and row in the
Gallies for being a pure Baud, but rather deserved to govern and be their Generall.
For the Office of a Baud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is not like every other ordinary Office, but rather of great
discretion and most necessary in any Common-wealth well governed, and should not
be practised but by people well borne; and ought besides to have a <hi>Veedor,</hi> [Veedor

all other trades, and a certain appointed number of men known, as are of the other
Brokers of the Exchange. And in this manner many harms that are done might bee
excused, because this Trade and Office is practised by indiscreet people of little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
such as are women of little more or lesse; young Pages and Jesters of few
yeers standing, and of lesse experience; which in the most urgent occasions, and when
they should contrive a thing artificially, the crumms freeze in their mouthes and fists;
and they know not which is their right hand. Fain would I passe forward, and give
reasons why it is convenient to make choyse of those which ought in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
to practise this so necessary an Office: but the place and season is not sit for it.
One day I will say it to those which may provide and remedy it: only I say now, that
the assumpt or addition of a Witch, hath deprived me of the compassion I should
otherwise have, to see those gray hairs and venerable face in such distresse for being a Baud. Although I know very well that no Sorcery in the world can move or force
the will as some ignorant persons think (for our will is a free power, and there's no
Hearb nor Charm can constrain it.) That which certain simple women, or cousening companions make, are some mixtures and poysons, wherewithall they cause men runne madd, and in the mean while perswade us that they have force to make one love well,
being (as I have said) a thing most impossible to constrain the Will. That is true,
quoth the old man, and I protest Sir, that I am wholly innocent of the imputation of
Witch-craft. As for being a Baud I could not denie it: but yet I never thought that
I did ill therein; for all mine intention was, that all the world should disport them,
and live together in concord and quietnesse without griefs or quarrels: but this my
good desire availed me but little to hinder my going there; from whence I have no
hope ever to return, my yeers doe so burden me, and also the stone, which lets me not
rest an inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nt. And saying this, hee turned again to his lamentations as at the first;
and <hi>Sancho</hi> took such compassion on him, as setting his hand into his bosome, hee drew
out a couple of shillings and gave it him as an almes.</p>
                     <p>From him <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> past to another, and demanded his fault, who answered
with no lesse, but with much more pleasantnesse then the former: I goe here because
I have jested somewhat too much with two Cousen Germains of mine own, and with
two other sisters which were none of mine own: Finally, I jested so much with them
all that thence resulted the increase of my Kindred so intricately, as there is no Casuist
that can well resolve it. All was proved by me, I wanted favour, I had no money,
and was in danger to lose my head: Finally, I was condemned for six yeers to the
Gallies. I consented it, as a punishment of my fault; I am young, and let my life
but hold out a while longer and all will goe well. And if you Sir Knight, carry any
thing to succour us poor folk, God will reward you it in heaven, and wee will have
care here on earth to desire God in our dayly prayers for your life and health, that
it bee as long and as good as your good countenance deserves. Hee that said this went
in the habit of a Student, and one of the Guard told him that hee was a great talker,
and a very good Latinist.</p>
                     <p>After all these came a man of some thirty yeers old, of very comely personage, save only that when hee looked, hee seemed to thrust the one eye into the other: Hee was differently tyed from the rest; for hee carried about his legg so long a chain, that it
tyred all the rest of his body: And hee had besides two iron rings about his neck, the
one of the chain, and the other of that kinde which are called <hi>A keep friend,</hi> or the foot
of a friend; from whence descended two irons unto his middle, out of which did
stick two manacles, wherein his hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> were locke up with a great hanging lock; so as
hee could neither set his hands to his mouth, nor bend down his head towards his hands.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanded why hee was so loaden with iron more then the rest? The
guard answered, because hee alone hath committed more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

was a more desperate knave; and that although they carried him tyed in that sort, yet
went they not sure of him, but feared hee would make an escape. What falts can he have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54746:54"/>
so grievous, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> since hee hath only deserved to bee sent to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?
hee goeth, replyed the guard to them for ten yeers, which is equivalent to a civill death; never strive to know more but that this man is the notorious <hi>Gines of Passamonte,</hi> who is otherwise called <hi>Ginesilio of Parapilla.</hi> Master Commissary, quoth the slave, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I am called <hi>Gines,</hi> and not <hi>Ginesilio;</hi> and <hi>Passamonte</hi> is my sirname, and not <hi>Parapilla</hi>

but one day sombodie shall know whether I bee called <hi>Ginesilio</hi> of <hi>Parapilla.</hi> Why doe
not they call thee so couzener; quoth the Guard? They doe said <hi>Gines,</hi> but I will make that they shall not call mee so, or I will fleece them, there where I mutter under my teeth. Sir Knight, if you have any thing to bestow on us, give it us now, and be gone
in the name of God; for you doe tyre us with your too curious search of knowing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

there is nothing more to bee desired: and leaves the booke pawned in the Prison for
two hundred Rials: and likewise meane to redeeme it, quoth <hi>Gines,</hi> though it were in for as many Duckets.</p>
                     <p>Is it so good a worke, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> It is so good replyed <hi>Gines,</hi> that it
quite puts down <hi>Lazarillo de Tormes,</hi> and as many others as are written or shall bee
written of that kinde: for that which I dare affirme to you is, that it treats of true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
and those so delightfull that no like invention can bee compared to them. And
how is the booke intituled, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> It is called, said he, <hi>The life of Gines of
Passamonte.</hi> And is it yet ended said the Knight? How can it be finished replyed he, my
life being not yet ended? Since all that is written is from the hour of my byrth untill
that instant that I was sent this last time to the Gallies. Why then belike you were there
once before (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> to serve God and the King, I have been in there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(quoth <hi>Gines)</hi> nor doth it grieve mee very much to returne unto them; for there
I shall have leisure to finish my Booke, and I have many things yet to say: and in the
Gallies of Spaine, there is more resting time then is requisite for that businesse, although
I shall not neede much time to pen what is yet unwritten; for I can, if neede were,
say it all by roate. Thou seemest to bee ingenuous, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

knaves, quoth the Commissary. I have already spoken to Master Commissary,
quoth <hi>Passamonte,</hi> to goe faire aod softly; for the Lords did not give you that rod, to the end you should abuse us wretches that goe here, but rather to guide and carry us
where his Majesty hath commanded, if not, by the life of—'tis enough that perhaps one
day may come to light, the spottes that were made in the Inne. And let all the world
peace and live well, and speake better, for this is now too great a digression. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
held up his rod to strike <hi>Passamonte</hi> in answere of his Threats, but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
put himselfe betweene them, and intreated him not to use him hardly, seeing it was not
much that one who caried his hands so tyed, should have his tongue somwhat free, and
then turning himself toward the slaves he said:</p>
                     <p>I have gathered out of all that which you have said, deere brethren, that although
they punish you for your faults, yet that the paines you goe to suffer doe not very well
please you, and that you march toward them with a very ill will, and wholy constrained,
and that perhaps the little courage this fellow had on the Rack, the want of money that
the other had, the small favour that a third enjoyed, and finally the wrested Sentence
of the Judge, and the not executing that Justice that was on your sides, have beene
cause of your miserie. All which doth present it selfe to my memory in such sort, as it
<pb facs="tcp:54746:55"/>
perswadeth, yea and inforceth me to effect that for you, for which heaven sent me into
the world, and made me professe that Order of Knighthood which I follow, and that
vow which I made therein to favour and assist the needfull, and those that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by others more potent. But for as much as I know that it is one of the parts
of prudence, not to doe that by foul means which may be accomplished by fair; I will
intreat those Gentlemen your Guardians and Commissary they will please to loose and
let you depart peaceably; for there will not want others to serve the King in better
occasions; for it seems to me a rigorous manner of proceeding, to make Slaves of them
whom God and nature created free. How much more good Sits of the guard (added
<hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> seeing these poor men have never committed any offence against you?
let them answer for their sinns in the other world: there is a God in heaven, who is not
negligent in punishing the evill, nor rewarding the good: And it is no wise decent,
that honourable men should bee the executioners of other men, seeing they cannot
gain or lose much thereby. I demand this of you in this peaceable quiet manner, to
the end that if you accomplish my request, I may have occasion to yeeld you thanks;
and if you will not doe it willingly, then shall this Launce and this Sword, guided by
the invincible valour of mine arme force you to it.</p>
                     <p>This is a pleasant doting, answered the Commissary, and an excellent jest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
you have finished your large reasoning. Would you (good Sir Knight)
have us leave unto you those the King forceth, as if wee had authority to let them goe,
or you to command us to doe it. Goe on your way in a good hour gentle Sir, and
settle the Bason you bear on your head somewhat righter, and search not thus whether
the Cat hath three feet. Thou art a Cat, and a Rat, and a Knave, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> And so with word and deed at once, hee assaulted him so suddainly, as without
giving him leisure to defend himself, hee struck him down to the earth very sore
wounded with a blow of his Launce; and as fortune would, this was hee that had the
fire-lock piece: the rest of the guard remained astonished at the unexpected accident:
but at last returning to themselves, the horse-men set hand to their swords, and the
foot-men to their darts, and all of them set upon <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who expected them very quietly: And doubtlesly hee would have been in great danger, if the Slaves
perceiving the occasion offered to bee so fit to recover liberty, had not procured it by
breaking the chain wherein they were linked. The Hurliburly was such as the guards
now began to runne to hinder the Slaves from untying themselves, now to offend
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> who assaulted them; so that they could doe nothing available to keep their Prisoners. <hi>Sancho</hi> for his part holp to lose <hi>Gines of Passamonte,</hi> who was the first
that leaped free into the field without clog, and setting upon the overthrown Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary,
he disarmed him of his sword and piece, and now ayming at the one and then
at the other with it, without discharging, made all the guards to abandon the field,
as well for feare of <hi>Passamontes</hi> piece, as also to shun the marvellous showre of stones
that the Slaves, now delivered, poured on them. <hi>Sancho</hi> grew marveilous sad at this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
for hee suspected that those which fled away, would goe and give notice of the
violence committed to the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> which would presently issue in troops to search the Delinquents: And said as much to his Lord, requesting him to depart
presently from thence, and imbosk himself in the Mountain, which was very neer.
All is well, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I know now what is fit to bee done: And so calling
together all the Slaves that were in a tumult, and had stript the Commissary naked,
they came all about him, to hear what he commanded, to whom he said:</p>
                     <p>It is the part of people well borne to gratifie and acknowledge the benefits they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
ingratitude being one of the sins that most offendeth the highest. I say it Sirs,
to this end, because you have by manifest tryall seen that which you have received at
my hand, in reward whereof I desire, and it is my will, that all of you loaden with
that chain from which I even now freed your necks, goe presently to the Citie
of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and there present your selves before the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and
recount unto her, that her Knight <hi>of the ill-favoured face</hi> sends you there to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his service to her; and relate unto her at large the manner of your freedome, all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54746:55"/>
you that have had such noble fortune, and this being done you may after goe where
you please.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gines de Passamonte</hi> answered for all the rest, saying; that which you demand, good
Sir (our Releaser) is most impossible to bee performrd, by reason that wee cannot
goe altogether through these wayes, but alone and divided, procuring each of us to hid
himselfe in the bowels of the earth, to the end wee may not bee found by the <hi>Holy-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,</hi>
which will doubtlesly set out to search for us: that therefore which you may
and ought to doe in this exigent is, to change this service and homage of the Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
of <hi>Toboso,</hi> into a certaine number of <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and <hi>Creedes,</hi> which wee will say

running or resting, in peace or in war; but to thinke that wee will returne againe to
take up our chaynes, or set our selves in the way of <hi>Toboso,</hi> is as hard as to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that it is now night, it being yet scarce ten of the clock in the morning, and to
demand such a thing of us, is as likely as to seeke for Peares of the Elme-tree. I sweare

with thy tayle betweene thy legs, and beare all the chaine in thy neck. <hi>Passamonte</hi> who
was by nature very chollerick, knowing assuredly that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was not very wise
(seeing hee had attempted such a desperate Act, as to seeke to give them liberty) seeing
himselfe thus abused, winked on his Companions, and going a little aside, they sent
such a showre of stones on <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as hee had no leisure to cover himselfe with
his Buckler, and poore <hi>Rozinante</hi> made no more account of the spurre, then if his sides
were made of Brasse. <hi>Sancho,</hi> ranne behinde his Asse, and by his meanes sheltred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the clowd and showre of stones, that rained upon both. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
could not cover himselfe so well, but that a number of stones struck him in the body
with so great force, as they overthrew him at last to the ground, and scarce was hee
fallen when the Student leapt upon him and tooke the Bason off his head, and gave him
three or foure blowes with it on the shoulders, and after struck it so oft about the
ground as hee almost broke it in peeces. They tooke from him likewise a Cassock
which hee wore upon his Armour, and thought also to take away his stockins but that
they were hindred by his Greaves. From <hi>Sancho</hi> they tooke away his Cassocke,
and
left him in his hayre, and dividing all the spoyles of the Battaile among themselves, they
departed every one by the way hee pleased, troubled with greater care how to escape
from the <hi>Holy brotherhood</hi> which they feared, then to lade themselves with the iron
chayne, and goe and present themselves before the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso.</hi> The Asse
and <hi>Rozinante; Sancho</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> remayned alone. The Asse stood pensative,
with his head hanging downewards, shaking now and then his eares, thinking that the
storme of stones was not yet past, but that they still buzzed by his head, <hi>Rozinante</hi>
lay overthrowne by his Master, who was likewise struck downe by another blowe of a
stone; <hi>Sancho</hi> in feare of the bullets of the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> most
discontent to see himselfe so misused by those very same to whom hee had done so much
good.</p>

I have heard say oft-times, that to doe good to men unthankfull, is
to cast water into the Sea. If I had believed what thou said'st to
me, I might well have prevented all this grief: but now that is past,
patience, and be wiser another time. You will take warning as
much by this, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as I am a Turk. But since you say, that
if you had believed me, you had avoided this grief, believe me now
and you shall eschue a greater: for you must wit, that no Knighthood nor Chival<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is of any authority with the <hi>Holy Brotherhood;</hi> for it cares not two farthings for all the
Knights Errant in the world; and know, that me thinks I hear their arrows buz about
mine ears already. <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou art a naturall coward, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou may'st not say that I am obstinate, and that I never follow thine advice,
I will take thy counsell this time, and convey my self from that furie which now thou
fearest so much: but it shall bee on a condition, that thou never tell alive nor dying
to any mortall Creature, that I retired or withdrew my self out of this danger for
fear; but only to satisfie thy requests: For if thou sayest any other thing, thou shalt
belie me most falsly: and even from this very time till that, and from thence untill
now I give thee the lie herein; and I say thou lyest, and shalt lie as oft times as thou
sayest or doest think the contrary; and doe not reply to me: For in onely thinking
that I withdraw my self out of, any perill, but principally this, which seems to carry
with it some shadow of fear: I am about to remain and expect here alone, not only
for the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> which thou namest and fearest; but also for the Bretheren
of the <hi>twelve Tribes,</hi> for the <hi>seven Macchabees,</hi> for <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and for all the
other Brothers and Brotherhoods in the world. Sir, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> to retire is not
to flie; and to expect is wisdome, when the danger exceepeth all hope: and it is the
part of a wise men to keep himself safe to day for to morrow; and not to adventure
himself wholy in one day. And know, that although I be but a rude Clown, yet doe
I for all that understand somewhat of that which men call good government: and
therefore doe not repent your self for following mine advice, but mount on <hi>Rozinante</hi>

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> leaped on his horse, without replying a word, and <hi>Sancho</hi> guiding him
on his Asse, they both entred into that part of <hi>Sierra Morena [A great and large Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Spain]</hi> that was neer unto them: <hi>Sancho</hi> had a secret designe to cross over it
all, and issue at <hi>Viso</hi> or <hi>Amadovar</hi> of <hi>Campo,</hi> and in the mean time to hide themselves
for some dayes among those craggie and intricate Rocks, to the end they might not
bee found by the <hi>Holy Bortherhood,</hi> if it did make after them. And hee was the more incouraged to doe this, because hee saw their Provision which hee carried on his Asse
had escaped safely out of the skirmish of the Gally-slaves; a thing which hee accounted
to bee a miracle, considering the diligence that the Slaves had used to search and carrie
away all things with them. They arrived that night into the very mid'st and bowels
of the Mountain, and there <hi>Sancho</hi> thought it fittest to spend that night, yea and some
other few dayes also, at least as long as their Victuales indured, and with this resolution
they took up their lodging among a number of Cork-Trees that grew between two
Rocks. But fatall chance, which according to the opinion of those that have not the

Mountain, and his fortune and fears led him just to the place where it had first addrest
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his Squire, just at such time as hee might perceive them, and they
both at that instant fallen asleep: And as evill-men are evermore ingratefull, and
that necessity forceth a man to attempt that which it urgeth, and likewise that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
redresse prevents the expectation of a future, <hi>Gines,</hi> who was neither gratefull nor
gratious, resolved to steal away <hi>Sancho</hi> his Asse, making no account of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> as
a thing neither saleable nor pawnable: <hi>Sancho</hi> slept soundly, and so hee stole his

                        <hi>Sancho</hi> comforted himself again with this promise, and dryed up his tears, moderated
his sighs, and gave his Lord thanks for so great a favour: And as they entred in farther
among those Mountains wee cannot recount the joy of our Knight, to whom those
places seemed most accommodate to atchieve the Adventures hee searched for. They
reduced to his memory the marvellous accidents that had befaln Knights Errant in like
Solitudes and Desarts: And hee rode so over-whelmed and transported by these
thoughts, as hee remembred nothing else; nor <hi>Sancho</hi> had any other care (after hee
was out of fear to bee taken) but how to fill his belly with some of the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>licks which
yet remained of the Clericall spoyles; and so hee followed his Lord, taking now and then
out of a basket (which <hi>Rozinante</hi> carried for want of the Asse) some meat, lining there-withall
his paunch: and whilest hee went thus imployed, hee would not have given a

                     <p>But whilst he was thus busied, he espyed his Master labouring to take up with the
point of his Javeline, some bulk or other that lay on the ground, and went towards
him to see whether hee needed his help just at the season that he lifted up a saddle
Cushion and a Portmantue fast to it, which were half <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the weather, yet they weighed so much that <hi>Sanchoes</hi> assistance was requisite to
take them up: and straight his Lord commanded him to see what was in the Wallet.
<hi>Sancho</hi> obeyed with expedition. And although it was shut with a chaine and
hanging lock, yet by the parts which were torn he saw what was within, to wit four
fine Holland shirts, and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> both curious and clean: and moreover a
handkercher, wherein was a good quantity of Gold: which he perceiving said, Blessed
bee Heaven which hath once presented to us a beneficiall Adventure: And searching
for more, he found a Tablet very costly bound. This <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took of him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him to keep the gold with himself; for which rich favour <hi>Sancho</hi> did presently
kisse his handes: and after taking all the linnen, hee clapt it up in the bag of their
Virtuals. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> having stored all these things, said; Me thinks <hi>Sancho</hi> (and
it cannot bee possible any other) that some trav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ler having left his way, past through
this Mountain, and being encountred by thieves, they slew him, and buried him in this
secret place. It cannot bee so, answered <hi>Sancho;</hi> for if they were Theeves, they
<pb facs="tcp:54746:57"/>
would not have left this money behind them. Thou sayest true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and therefore I cannot conjecture what it might be: but stay a while, we will see
whether there be any thing written in these Tablets, by which we may vent and
finde out that which I desire. Then he opened it, and the first thing that he found
written in it, as it were a first draught, but done with a very faire Character,
was a Sonnet which he read aloud, that <hi>Sancho</hi> might also hear it, and was this
which ensues.

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54746:58"/>Having read the Letter, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, Wee can collect lesse by this then by the
Verses, what the Authour is, other then that hee is some disdained Lover. And so
passing over all the book, hee found other Verses and Letters, of which he could read
some, others not at all. But the summe of them all were, Accusations, Plaints, and
Mistrusts, Pleasures, Griefs, Favours, and Disdains, some Solemnized, others De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored. And whilest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> past over the Book, <hi>Sancho</hi> past over the Malet,
without leaving a corner of it or the Cushion unsearched, or a seam unript, nor a lock
of wooll uncarded, to the end that nothing might remain behinde for want of dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or carelessenesse. The found gold which past a hundred crowns, had stir'd in
him such a greedinesse to have more. And though hee got no more then that which
hee found at the first, yet did hee account his flights in the Coverlet, his vomitting of
the Drench, the benedictions of the Pack-staves, the blows of the Carrier, the losse of
his Wallet, the robbing of his Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hee had past in the service of his good Lord and Master, for well imployed; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself to be more then well payed by the gifts received of the money they found.
The Knight of the <hi>Ill-favoured face</hi> was the while possessed with a marvellous desire to
know who was the owner of the malet, conjecturing by the Sonnet and Letter, the
gold and Linnen, that the enamoured was some man of worth, whom the disdain and
rigour of his Lady had conducted to some desperate termes. But by reason that no
body appeared, through that inhabitable and Desart place, by whom hee might bee
informed, hee thought on it no more, but only rode on, without choosing any other
way then that which pleased <hi>Rozinante</hi> to travail, who took the plainest and easiest to
passe thorow having still an imagination that there could not want some strange Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
amid'st that Forrest.</p>
                     <p>And as he rode on with this conceit, hee saw a man on the top of a little Mountain
that stood just before his face, leap from Rock to Rock, and Tuff to Tuff, with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>full
dexterity. And as hee thought was naked, had a black and thick beard; the
hairs many and confusedly mingled; his feet and leggs bare; his thighs were covered
with a pair of hose, which seemed to bee of murry Velvet, but were so torn, that they
discovered his flesh in many places: His head was likewise bare; and although hee
past by with the haste wee have recounted, yet did <hi>The Knight of the ill-favoured face</hi>
note all these particulars; and although hee endeavoured, yet could not hee follow
him; for it was not in <hi>Rozinantes</hi> power, in that weake state wherein hee was, to
travail so swiftly among those Rocks chiefly being naturally very slow and fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> after espying him, did instantly imagine him to bee the owner of the
Cushion and Malet; and therefore resolved to goe on in his search, although hee
should spend a whole yeer therein among those Mountains; and commanded <hi>Sancho</hi>
to goe about the one side of the Mountain, and hee would goe the other, and, quoth
hee, it may befall, that by using this dilligence, wee may incounter with that man which
vanished so suddainly out of our sight.</p>
                     <p>I cannot doe so, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for that in parting one step from you, fear presently
so assalts me with a thousand visions and affrightments. And let this serve you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
for a warning to the end you may not henceforth part me the black of a nail from
your presence. It shall be so, answered <hi>The Knight of the ill-favoured face:</hi> and I am very
glad that thou doest thus build upon my valour, the which shall never fail thee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou didest want thy very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oul; and therefore follow me by little and
little or as thou mayest, and make of thine eyes two Lant-hornes; for wee will
give a turne about this little Rock, and perhaps wee may meet with this man
whom we saw even now, who doublesly can bee none other then the owner of our
booty.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed, It were much better not to finde him: for if wee should
meet him, and were by chance the owner of this money, it is most evident that I must
restore it to him; and therefore it is better without using this unprofitable dilligence,
to let me possesse it <hi>bona fide,</hi> untill the true Lord shall appear by some way lesse cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:54746:59"/>
and dilligent: which perhaps may fall at such a time as it shall bee all spent; and
in that case I am free from all Processes by priviledge of the King.</p>
                     <p>Thou deceivest thy self, <hi>Sancho,</hi> therein, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> for seeing wee are
fallen already into suspition of the owner, wee are bound to search and restore it to
him: and when wee would not seek him out, yet the vehement presumption that wee
have of it, hath made us possessors <hi>mala-fide,</hi> and renders us as culpable as if hee whom
we surmise were verily the true Lord. So that, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> be not grieved to
seek
him, in respect of the grief whereof thou shalt free me if he be found. And saying so
spur'd <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> followed after a foot, animated by the hope of the young
Asses his Master had promised unto him: And having compassed a part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they found a little stream, wherein lay dead, and half devoured by Doggs and
Crows, a Mule saddled and bridled, all which confirmed more in them the suspition,
that hee which fled away was owner of the Mule and Cushion. And as they looked on
it, they heard a whistle, much like unto that which Sheepheards use as they keep
their Flocks, and presently appeared at their left hand a great number of Goats, after
whom the Goatheard that kept them, who was an aged man followed on the top of
the Mountain; and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> cried to him, requesting him to come down to
them: who answered them again as loudly; demanding of them, who had brought
them to those Desarts rarely trodden by any other then Goats, Wolves, or other
Savage Beasts which frequented those Mountains? <hi>Sancho</hi> answered him, That if hee
would descend where they were, they would give him account thereof.</p>
                     <p>With that the Sheepheard came down, and arriving to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
was, hee said; I dare wager that you look on the hyred Mule which lies dead there
in that bottome; well, in good faith, he hath lien in that very place these six moneths.
Say, I pray you, have not you met in the way with the Master thereof? Wee have
encountred no body but a Cushion and a little Malet, which we found not very far
off from hence. I did likewise finde the same, replyed the Goat-heard, but I would
never take it up nor approach to it, fearfull of some misdemeanor, or that I should
be hereafter demanded for it as for a stealth. For the Divell is crafty, and now and
then something ariseth, even from under a mans feet, whereat he stumbles and falls,
without knowing how or how not.</p>
                     <p>That is the very same, I say, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> for I likewise found it, but would not
approach it the cast of a stone: There I have left it; and there it remains as it was;
for <hi>I would not have a Dog with a Bell.</hi> Tell me good fellow, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
dost thou know who is the owner of all these things?</p>
                     <p>That which I can say, answered the Goat-heard, is, that about some six moneths
past, little more or lesse, there arrived at a certain Sheep fold some three leagues off, a
young Gentleman of comely personage, and presence, mounted on that very Mule
which lies dead there, and with the same Cushion and Malet which you say you met,
but touched not. Hee demanded of us, which was the most hidden and inaccessable
part of the Mountain? And we told him that this wherein we are now: And it is true;
for if you did enter but half a league farther, perhaps you would not finde the way out
again so readily: and I doe greatly marvell how you could finde the way hither it
self; for there is neither high way nor path that may addresse any to this place. I say
then, that the young man, as soon as he heard our answer, he turned the bridle, and
travelled towards the place we shewed to him, leaving us all with very great liking of
his comelinesse, and marvelled at his demand and speed, wherewith he departed and
made towards the Mountain: and after that time, we did not see him a good many
of dayes, untill by chance one of our Sheepheards came by with our provision of
victuals, to whom hee drew nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, without speaking a word, and spurned and bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

welfavour'dly, and after went to the Asse which carried our victuals, and taking away
all the Bread and Cheese that was there, hee fled into the Mountain with wonderfull
speed.</p>
                     <p>When we heard of this, some of us Goat-heards, we went to search for him, and
spent therein almost two dayes in the most solitary places of this Mountain, and in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54746:60"/>
end found him lurking in the hollow part of a very tall and great Corke-tree; who as
soon as he perceived us, came forth to meet us with great staidnesse; His apparrell was
all torn; his visage disfigured, and toasted with the Sunne in such manner, as we could
scarce know him, if it were not that his attire, although rent, by the notice we had of
it, did give us to understand that he was the man for whom we sought. He saluted us
courteously, and in brief and very good reasons he said, that we ought not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
seeing him goe in that manner; for that it behoved to doe so, that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
a certain penance injoyned to him, for the many sinns hee had committed.
We prayed him to tell us what he was; but we could never perswade him to it. Wee
requested him likewise, that whensoever hee had any need of meat (without which hee
could not live) hee should tell us where we might finde him, and wee would bring it
to him with great love and dilligence; and that if he also did not like of this motion,
that he would at least wise come and ask it, and not take it violently, as he had done
before from our Sheepheards. He thanked us very much for our offer, and intreated
pardon of the assults passed, and promised to ask it from thence forward for Gods
sake, without giving annoyance to any one. And touching his dwelling or place of
abode, he said, That he had none other then that where the night overtook him,
and ended his Discourse with so feelling laments, that we might well be accounted
stones which heard him, if therein we had not kept him company, considering the state
wherein wee had seen him first; and that wherein now he was. For as I said, he was
a very comely and gracious young man, and shewed by his courteous and orderly
speech, that he was well borne, and a Court-like person: For though wee were all
Clowns, such as did hear him, his Gentility was such as could make it self known, even
to rudenesse it self: And being in the best of his Discourse, he stopt and grew silent,
fixing his eyes on the ground a good while, wherein we likewise stood still suspended,
expecting in what that distraction would end, with no little compassion to behold it;
for we easily perceived that some accident of madness had surprized him, by his staring &amp;
beholding the earth so fixedly, without once moving the eye-lid; And other times by
the shutting of them, the byting of his lips, and bending of his brows. But very spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
after, he made us certain thereof himself: for rising from the ground (wheron he
had thrown himself a little before) with great furie, he set upon him that sate next
unto him, with such courage and rage, that if wee had not taken him away, he would
have slain him with blows and bites; and hee did all this, saying, O treacherous <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
here, here thou shalt pay me the injurie that thou did'st me; these hands shall
rent out the heart, in which doe harbour and are heaped all evills together, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
fraud and deceit: And to these hee added other words, all addrest to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise
of that <hi>Fernando,</hi> and to attach him of treason and untruth.</p>
                     <p>Wee tooke from him at last, not without difficulty, our fellow, and hee without
saying a word departed from us, embushing himselfe presently among the bushes and
brambles, leaving us wholly disabled to follow him in those rough and unhaunted pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
By this wee gathered that his madnesse comes to him at times, and that some one
called <hi>Fernando,</hi> had done some ill worke of such weight, as the termes shew, to which
it hath brought him. All which hath after beene yet confirmed as often (which were
many times) as hee came out to the fields, sometimes to demand meat of the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
and other times to take it of them perforce; for when hee is taken with this fit
of madnesse, although the Sheepheards doe offer him meat willingly, yet will not hee
receive, unlesse hee take it with buffets: and when hee is in his right sense, hee asks it
for Gods sake, with courtesie and humanitie, and renders many thanks, and that not
without teares. And in very truth, Sir, I say unto you, quoth the Goat-heard, that
I and foure others, whereof two are my men, other two my friends, resolved yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
to search untill wee found him, and being found, either by force or faire meanes,
wee will carry him to the towne of <hi>Almodaver,</hi> which is but eight leagues from hence,
and there will wee have him cured, if his disease may bee holpen, or at least wee shall
learne what hee is, when hee turnes to his wits, and whether hee hath any friends to
whom notice of his misfortune may bee given. This is, Sirs, all that I can say concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:54746:61"/>
that which you demand of mee; and you shall understand that the owner of those
things which you saw in the way, is the very same, whom you saw passe by you so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and nimble: for <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had told him by this, that hee had seen that man goe
by, leaping among the Rocks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rested marvailously admired at the Goatheards tale, and with greater
desire to know who that unfortunate mad-man was, purposed with himselfe, as he had
already resolved, to search him throughout the Mountaines, without leaving a corner
or Cave of it unsought, untill hee had gotten him. But Fortune disposed the matter
better then hee expected; for hee appeared in that very instant in a clift of a Rock, that
answered to the place where they stood speaking, who came towards them, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
somwhat to himselfe, which could not bee understood neere at hand, and much
lesse a farre off: His aparrell was such as wee have delivered, only differing in this, as
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceived when hee drew neerer, that hee wore on him, although torne,
a leather Jerkin, perfumed with <hi>Amber;</hi> by which hee throughly collected, that the
person which wore such attire was not of the least qualitie.</p>
                     <p>When the young man came to the place where they discoursed, hee saluted them
with a hoarce voice, but with great courtesie: and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> returned him his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
with no lesse complement; and alighting from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> hee advanced to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him with very good carriage and countenance, and held him a good while
streightly betweene his armes, as if hee had known him of long time. The other,
whom wee may call <hi>The unfortunate Knight of the Kock,</hi> as well as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> the
<hi>Knight of the illfavored face;</hi> after hee had permitted himselfe to bee imbraced a while,
did step a little off from our Knight, and laying his hand on his shoulders, began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him earnestly, as one desirous to call to minde whether hee had ever seene him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
being perhaps no lesse admired to see <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> figure, proportion and
Armes, then <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was to view him. In resolution, the first that spoke after the
imbracing, was the ragged Knight, and said what wee will presently recount.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Historie affirmes, that great was the attention wherewithall
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> listned to the <hi>unfortunate Knight of the Rock,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his speech on this manner: Truly, good Sir, whatsoever you
bee (for I know you not) I doe with all my heart gratifie the signes
of affection and courtesie which you have used towards mee, and
wish heartily that I were in termes to serve with more then my will,
the good-will you beare towards mee, as your courteous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
denotes; but my fate is so niggardly, as it affords mee no other meanes to repay
good works done to mee, then only to lend mee a good desire sometime to satisfie
them.</p>
                     <p>So great is mine affection, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to serve you, as I was fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
never to depart out of these Mountaines untill I had found you, and known of
your selfe whether there might bee any kinde of remedy found for the griefe that this
your so unusuall a kinde of life argues doth possess your soule; and if it were requisite,
to search it out with all possible diligence: and when your disasters were knowne of
those which clap their doores in the face of comfort, I intended in that case to beare a
part in your lamentations, and plaine it with the dolefull note; for it is a consolation
in afflictions, to have one that condoles in them. And if this my good intention may
merit any acceptance, or bee gratified by any courtesie, let mee intreat you Sir, by the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54746:61"/>
excesse thereof, which I see accumulated in your bosome; and joyntly I conjure you
by that thing which you have, or doe presently most affect; that you will please to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
unto mee who you are, and what the cause hath beene that perswaded you to come
to live and die in these Desarts, like a bruite beast, seeing you live among such, so alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from your selfe, as both your attyre &amp; countenance demonstrate. And I doe
vow (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> by the high order of Chivalry, which I (although unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and a sinner) have received; and by the profession of Knighes Errant, that if you
doe pleasure mee herein, to assist you with as good earnest as my profession doth binde
mee, eyther by remedying your disaster, if it can bee holpen; or else by assisting you
to lament it, if it bee so desperate.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of the Rock,</hi> who heard him of the <hi>Illfavored face</hi> speake in
that manner,
did nothing else for a great while, but behold him again and again, and re-behold him
from top to toe, And after viewing him well hee said, If you have any thing to eate,
I pray you give it mee for Gods sake, and after I have eaten I will satisfie your demand
throughly, to gratifie the many courtesies and undeserved proffers you have made unto
mee. <hi>Sancho,</hi> and the Goatheard presents the one out of his Wallet, the other out of
his Scrip, tooke some meate and gave it to the Knight of the <hi>Rock</hi> to allay his hunger,
and hee did eate so fast, like a distracted man, as hee left no intermission betweene bit
and bit, but clapt them up so swiftly, as hee rather seemed to swallow then to chew
them; and whilest hee did eate, neither hee or any of the rest spake a word; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ended his dinner, hee made them signes to follow him, as at last they did, unto a
little Meadow seated hard by that place, at the fold of a Mountaine, where being ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
hee stretched himselfe on the grasse, which the rest did likewise in his imitation,
without speaking a word, untill that hee after setling himselfe in his place, began in this
manner; If Sirs, you please to heare the exceeding greatnesse of my disasters briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed,
you must promise mee, that you will not interrupt the file of my dolefull nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
with either demand or other thing; for in the very instant that you shall doe it,
there also must remaine that which I say depending. These words of our ragged
Knights, called to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> remembrance the tale which his Squire had told unto
him, where hee erred in the account of his Goates which had passed the River, for
which that Historie remained suspended. But returning to our ragged man, hee said;
This prevention which now I give, is to the end that I may compendiously passe over
the discourse of my mishaps; for the revoking of them to remembrance, only serves
mee to none other stead, then to increase the old, by adding of new misfortunes; and
by how much the fewer your questions are, by so much the more speedily shall I have
finished my pittifull discourse; and yet I meane not to omit the essentiall point of my
woes untouch't, that your desires may bee herein sufficiently satisfied. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
in his owne, and his other companions name, promised to perform his request, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he began his relation on this manner.</p>
                     <p>My name is <hi>Cardenic,</hi> the place of my byrth, one of the best Cities in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> my
linage noble, my parents rich, and my misfortunes so great, as I thinke my parents
have ere this deplored, and my kinsfolke condoled them; being very little able with
their wealth to redresse them; for the goods of fortune are but of small vertue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
the disasters of Heaven. There dwelt in the same Citie a Heaven, wherein love
had placed all the glorie that I could desire: so great is the beauty of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel
as noble and rich as I, but more fortunate, and lesse constant then my honourable
desires expected. I loved, honoured and adored this <hi>Luscinda,</hi> almost from my very
infancy, and shee affected mee likewise, with all the integritie and good will which with
her so young yeeres did accord. Our parents knew our mutuall amitie, for which they
were nothing agrieved, perceiving very well, that although wee continued it, yet could
it have none other end but that of Matrimonie; a thing which the equalitie of our
blood and substance, did of it selfe almost invite us to. Our age and affection increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in such sort, as it seemed fit for <hi>Luscinda's</hi> father, for certaine good respects, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mee the entrance of his house any longer; imitating in a manner therein <hi>Tisbi,</hi> so
much solemnized by the Poets, her parents, which hindrance served only to add flame
<pb facs="tcp:54746:62"/>
to flame, and desire to desire: for although it set silence to our tongues, yet would
they not impose it to our Pens, which are wont to expresse to whom it pleased, the
most hidden secrecies of our souls, with more libertie then the tongue; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the beloved doth often distract, trouble, and strike dumb the boldest
tongue and firmest resolution. O Heavens! how many Letters have I written unto
her? What cheerfull and honest answers have I received? How many Ditties and
amorous Verses have I composed, wherein my soul declared and published her passions,
declined her inflamed desires, entertained her remembrance, and recreated her will?
In effect, perceiving my self to be forced, and that my soul consumed with a perpetuall
desire to behold her, I resolved to put my desires in execution, and finish in an instant
that which I deemed most expedient for the better atchieving of my desired, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
reward; which was (as I did indeed) to demaund her of her father for my
lawfull Spouse.</p>
                     <p>To which he made answer, That he 'did gratifie the good will which I shewed by
honouring him, and desire to honour my self with pawns that were his: But seeing
my Father yet lived, the motion of that matter properly most concerned him: For if
it were not done with his good liking and pleasure, <hi>Luscinda</hi> was not a woman to be
taken or given by stealth. I rendred him thanks for his good will, his words seeming
unto me very reasonable, as that my father should agree unto them, as soon as I should
explain the matter; and therefore departed presently to acquaint him with my desires;
who at the time which I entred into a chamber, wherein he was, stood with a letter open
in his hand; and espying me, e're I could break my minde unto him, gave it me, saying;
By that Letter, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> you may gather the desire that Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> bears, to doe
you any pleasure or favour.</p>
                     <p>This Duke <hi>Ricardo,</hi> as I think you know Sirs already, is a <hi>Grandee</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose
Dukedome is seated in the best part of all <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> I took the Letter and read it,
which appeared so urgent, as I my self accounted it would be ill done, if my father did
not accomplish the contents thereof, which were indeed, that he should presently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
me to his Court, to the end I might be companion (and not servant) to his
eldest sonne; and that hee would incharge himself with the advancing of me to such
preferments as might be answerable unto the value and estimation hee made of my
person. I past over the whole Letter, and was strucken dumb at the reading thereof;
but chiefly hearing my Father to say, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> thou must depart within two dayes, to
accomplish the Dukes desire; and omit not to render Almighty God thanks, which
doth thus open the way, by which thou mayest attain in fine to that which I know
thou doest merit: And to these words added certain others of Fatherly counsell and
direction. The term of my departure arrived, and I spoke to my <hi>Luscinda</hi> on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
night, and recounted unto her all that passed, and likewise to her father, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to overslip a few dayes, and defer the bestowing of his daughter else-where,
untill I went to understand Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> his will; which he promised me, and shee
confirmed it with a thousand oaths and promises.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I came to Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s Court, and was so friendly received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by him, as even very then envie began to exercise her accustomed Function, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forthwith emulated by the ancient Servitors; perswading themselves, that the
tokens the Duke shewed to doe me favours could not but turn to their prejudice. But
hee that rejoyced most at mine arrivall was a second sonne of the Dukes, called <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
who was young, gallant, very comely, liberall and amorous; who within a
while after my coming, held me so deerly, as every one wondred thereat: And though
the elder loved me well, and did me favour; yet was it in no respect comparable to
that wherewithall <hi>Don Fernando</hi> loved and treated me. It therefore befell, that as there
is no secresie amongst friends so great, but they will communicate it the one to the
other; and the familiarity which I had with <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was now past the limits of
favour, and turned into dearest amitie: He revealed unto me all his thoughts; but
chiefly one of his Love, which did not a little molest him: For he was enamoured on
a Farmers daughter that was his Fathers Vassall, whose parents were marvellous rich,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54746:62"/>
and shee her self so bautifull, warie, discret, and honest, as never a one that knew her
could absolutely determine wherein, or in which of all her perfections shee did most
excell, or was most accomplished. And those good parts of the beautifull Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide,
reduced <hi>Don-Fernando</hi> his desires to such an exigent, as hee resolved that hee
might the better gaine her good will, and conquer her integritie, to passe her a promise
of marriage; for otherwise hee should labour to effect that which was impossible, and
but strive against the streame. I, as one bound thereunto by our friendship, did
thwart and disswade him from his purpose with the best reasons, and most efficacious
words I might: and seeing all could not prevaile, I determined to acquaint the Duke
<hi>Ricardo</hi> his father therewithall; But <hi>Don Fernando</hi> being very crafty and discreete, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
and feared as much, because hee considered that in the law of a faithfull servant,
I was bound not to conceale a thing that would turne so much to the prejudice of the
Duke my Lord, and therefore both to divert and deceive mee at once, that hee could
finde no meanes so good, to deface the remembrance of that beautie out of his minde,
which held his heart in such subjection, then to absent himselfe for certaine moneths;
and hee would likewise have that absence to be this, That both of us should depart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and come to my fathers house, under prettence (as he would informe the Duke)
that he went to see and cheap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n certain great horses that were in the City wherein I
was borne; a place of breeding the best horses in the world.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had I heard him say this (when borne away by the naturall propension each
one hath to his Countrey, and my love joyn'd) although his designment had not been
so good, yet would I have ratified it, as one of the most expedient that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
because I saw occasion and oportunity so fairly offered, to return and see again
my <hi>Luscinda.</hi> And thereof set on by this thought and desire, I approved his opinion,
and did quicken his purpose, perswading him to prosecute it with all possible speed;
for absence would in the end work her effect in despight of the most forcible and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
thoughts; And when he said this to me, he had already, under the title of a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
(as it was afterward known) reaped the fruits of his longed desires, from his
beautifull Countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y-Maid, and did only await an oportunity to reveal it without his
own detriment, fearfull of the Duke his fathers indignation, when he should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r.</p>
                     <p>It afterward hapned, that as love in young men is not for the most part Love, but last,
the which (as it ever proposeth to it self as his last end and period, is delight) so as soon
as it obteineth the same, it likewise decayeth and maketh forcibly to retire that which
was tearmed Love; for it cannot transgresse the limits which Nature hath assigned it
which boundings are meares, Nature hath in no wise allotted to true and sincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I would say, that as soon as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> had injoyed his Countrey-Lasse, his
desires weakned, and his importunities waxed cold; and if at the first he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eigned an
excuse to absent himself, that he might with more facility compasse them, he did now
in very good earnest procure to depart, to the end hee might not put them in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Duke gave him licence to depart, and commanded me to accompany him.
Wee came to my Citie, where my Father entertained him according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> talling.
I saw <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and then again were reviv'd (although indeed they were neither dead
nor mortified) my desires, and acquainted <hi>Don Fernando</hi> (alas, to my totall ruine)
with them, because I thought it was not lawfull by the law of amity to keep any thing
concealed from him: There I dilated to him, on the Beauty, Wit, and Discretion of
<hi>Luscinda,</hi> in so ample manner, as my prayses stirred in him a desire to view a Damzell
so greatly adorned, and inriched with so rare endowments: And this his desire I
(through my misfortune) satisfied, shewing her unto him by the light of a candle, at
a window where wee two were wont to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le together; where he beheld her to bee such
as was sufficient to blot out of his memory all the beauties which ever hee had viewed
before. Hee stood mute, beside himself, and ravished; and moreover rested so greatly
enamoured, as you may perceive in the discourse of this my do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>efull narration: And
to inflame his desires the more (a thing which I fearfully avoyded, and only discovered
to heaven) fortune so disposed; that hee found after me one of her Letters, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:54746:63"/>
she requested that I would demand her of her father for wife, which was so discreete,
honest and amorously penned, as he said after reading it, that in <hi>Luscinda</hi> alone were
included all the graces of Beauty and Understanding joyntly, which were divided and
separate in all the other women of the world.</p>
                     <p>Yet in good sooth I will here confesse the truth, that although I saw cleerely how
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
<hi>Luscinda</hi> was thus extold by <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> yet did not her prayses please mee
so much pronounced by him; and therefore began to feare and suspect him, because he
let no moment overslip us, without making some mention of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and would
still himselfe begin the Discourse, were the occasion ever so far fetched, a thing
which rowsed in mee I cannot tell what jealousie; not that I did feare any traverse in
<hi>Luscindaes</hi> loyalty, but yet for all my Fates made mee the very thing which they most
assured mee: and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> procured to read all the papers I sent to <hi>Luscinda,</hi> or
shee to mee, under pretext that hee tooke extraordinary delight to note the witty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of us both. It therefore fell out, that <hi>Luscinda</hi> having demanded of mee a booke
of Chivalry to read, wherein shee took marveilous delight, and was that of <hi>Amadis
du Gaule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Scarce had <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> well heard him make mention of bookes of Knighthood,
when hee replyed to him. If you had, good sir, but once told mee at the beginning of
your historicall narration, that your Lady <hi>Luscinda</hi> was affected to the reading of
Knightly Adventures, you needed not to have used any amplification to indeer or make
plaine unto mee the eminencie of her wit, which certainly could not in any wise bee so
excellent and perspicuous as you have figured it, if shee wanted the propension and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you have rehearsed, to the perusing of so pleasing discourses; so that henceforth,
with mee, you neede not spend any more words to explane and manifest the height of
her beauty, worths and understanding, for by this only notice I have received of her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to bookes of Knighthood, I doe confirme her for the most faire and accomplished
woman for all perfections in the world; and I would to God, good Sir, that you had
also sent her together with <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Histories of the good <hi>Don Rugel of Grecia,</hi> for
I am certaine, the Lady <hi>Luscinda</hi> would have taken great delight in <hi>Darayda</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raya,</hi>
and in the witty conceits of the Sheepheard <hi>Darinel,</hi> and in those admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his Bucolicks, sung and rehearsed by him with such grace, discretion and libertie.
But a time may come, wherein this fault may bee recompenced, if it shall please you to
come with mee to my Village; for there I may give you three hundred Bookes, which
are my Soules greatest contentment, and the entertainment of my life; although I doe
now verily beleeve that none of them are left, thanks bee to the malice of evill and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Enchanters. And I beseech you to pardon me this transgression of our agreement
at the first, promised not to interrupt your Discourses; for when I heare any motion
made of Chivalry or Knights Errant, it is no more in my power to omit to speake of
them, then in the Sunne-beames to leave off warming, or in the Moones to render
things humid. And therefore I intreate pardon, and that you will prosecute your Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
as that which most imports us.</p>
                     <p>Whilest <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> spoke those words, <hi>Cardenio</hi> hanged his head on his breast,
giving manifest tokens that hee was exceeding sad. And although <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
him twice to follow on with his Discourse, yet neither did he lift up his head, or
answere a word, till at last, after hee had stood a good while musing, hee held up his
head and said; It cannot bee taken out of my minde, nor is there any one in the world
can deprive me of the conceit, or make me beleeve the contrary; and hee were a bottle-head,
that would think or beleeve otherwise then that the great villain Mr. <hi>Elisabat</hi> the
Barbar kept Queen <hi>Madasima</hi> as his Lemman.</p>
                     <p>That is not so, I vow by such and such, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in great choler (and as
hee was wont, rapt out three or foure round oathes) It is great malice, or rather vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
to say such a thing. For Queene <hi>Madasima</hi> was a very noble Lady, and it ought
not to bee presumed that so high a Princesse would fall in love with a Quack-salver, and
whosoever thinks the contrary, lies like an arrant Villaine, as I will make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
a horseback or a foote, armed or disarmed, by night or by day, or as he best liketh.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54746:63"/>
                        <hi>Cardenio</hi> stood beholding him very earnestly as hee spoke these words, whom the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his madnesse had by this possessed, and was not in plight to prosecute his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor would <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> give eare to it, he was so mightily disgusted to hear Queen
<hi>Madasima</hi> detracted.</p>
                     <p>A marvellous accident! for hee took her defence as earnestly, as if she were verily
his true and naturall Princesse, his wicked books had so much distracted him. And
<hi>Cardenio</hi> being by this furiously madd, hearing himself answered with the lye, and the
denomination of a Villaine, with other the like outrages, hee took the rest in ill part;
and lifting up a stone that was neer unto him, gave <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> such a blow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
as he overthrew him to the ground on his back. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> seeing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
so roughly handled, set upon the fool with his fist shut; and the ragged man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his assault in such manner, as he likewise overthrew him at his feet with one fist,
and mounting afterward upon him, did work him with his feet like a piece of dough:
And the Goat-heard who thought to succour him, was like to incur the same danger.
And after he had overthrown and beaten them all very well, he departed from them
and entred into the wood very quietly. <hi>Sancho</hi> arose, and with rage to see himself so
belaboured without desert, he ran upon the Goat-heard to be revenged on him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was in the fault, who had not premonished them, how that mans raving fits
did take him so at times; for had they been advertised thereof, they might have stood
all the while on their guard.</p>
                     <p>The Goat-heard answered, that he had already advised them thereof; and if he had
not been attentive thereunto, yet he was therefore nothing the more culpable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> replyed, and the Goat-heard made a rejoynder thereunto; but their
disputation ended at last in the catching hold of one anothers beards, and be-fisting
themselves so uncompassionately, as if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had not pacified them, they
would have torne one another to pieces. <hi>Sancho</hi> holding still the Goat-heard fast,
said unto his Lord, Let me alone, Sir <hi>Knight of the Ill-favoured face;</hi> for on this man
who is a Clown as I am my self, and no dubed Knight, I may safely satisfie my self
of the wrong hee hath done me, by fighting with him hand to hand like an honourable
man. It is true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but I know well, that hee is in no wise culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to demand of the Goat-heard, whether it were possible to meet again with
<hi>Cardenio;</hi> for he remained possessed with an exceeding desire to know the end of his
History.</p>
                     <p>The Goat-heard turned again to repeat what he had said at the first, to wit, that
he knew not any certain place of his abode; but if hee haunted that Commark any
while, he would some time meet with him, either in his madd or modest humour.</p>

on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> hee commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to follow him, who obeyed
but with a very ill will; and thus they travelled by little and little,
entring into the thickest and roughest part of all the Mountaine, and
<hi>Sancho</hi> went almost burst with a desire to reason with his Master, and
therefore wished in minde that hee would once begin, that he might
not transgresse his commandement of silence imposed on him, but
growing at last wholly impotent to containe himselfe speechlesse any longer: Good
Syr <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I pray you give mee your blessing, and license; for I meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart
from this place, and returne to my house, my wife and children, with whom I
shall bee, at least, admitted to reason and speake my pleasure; for that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to have mee keepe you company through these Desarts, night and day, and that I
may not speake when I please, is but to bury mee alive. Yet if Fortune had so happily
disposed our affaires, as that beasts could speake as they did in <hi>Guisopetes</hi> time, the
harme had beene lesse, for then would I discourse a while with <hi>Rozinante</hi> (seeing my

good, and in this sort would I weave my mishaps; for it is a stubborne thing, and that
cannot bee borne with patience, to travell all the dayes of our life, and not to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any other thing then tramplings under feete, tossings in Coverlets, blowes of stones
and buffets, and bee besides all this forced to sow up our Mouthes, a man daring not
to breake his minde, but to stande mute like a poste. <hi>Sancho,</hi> I understand thee now,

thee to speake; account therefore that commandement revoked, and say what thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
on condition that this revocation be only available and of force whilest we dewll

mee, what benefit could you reape by taking Queene <hi>Magimasaes</hi> part? Or what was
it to the purpose that that Abbat was her friend or no? For if you had let it slip, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you were not his Judge, I verily beleeve that the foole had prosecuted his tale, and
wee should have escaped the blow of the stone, the trampling under feete and spurnings;
yea, and more then five or six good buffets. Yfaith <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if thou knowest as well as I did, how honourable and principall a Lady was Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasima,</hi>
thou wouldst rather say that I had great patience, seeing I did not strike him
on the mouth, out of which such blasphemies issued; for it is a very great dishonour to
aver or thinke that any Queene would fall in love with a Barber. For the truth of the
History is, that Master <hi>Elisabat,</hi> of whom the mad man spoke, was very prudent, and
a man of a sound judgemen, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the Queene as her Tutor and Physitian; but to
thinke that shee was his Lemman, is a madnesse worthy the severest punishment: and
to the end thou maist see that <hi>Cardenio</hi> knew not what hee said, thou must understand
that when he spoke it, he then was wholy beside himself.</p>
                     <p>That's it which I say, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you ought not to make recount of words
spoken by a Foole; for if fortune had not assisted you, but addressed the stone to your
head, as it did to your breast, wee should have remained in good plight, for having tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
so earnestly in that my Ladies defence, whom God confound: and think you that

                        <hi>Cardenio</hi> would not escape the dangers of the Law, by reason of his madnesse? Any
Knight Errant, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> is bound to turn for the honour of women,
of what quality soever, against<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of so high degree and worth, as was Queen <hi>Madesina,</hi> to whom I bear particular
affections for her good parts? For besides her being marvellous beautifull, shee was
moreover very prudent and patient in her calamities, which were very many, and the
company and counsells of Master <hi>Elisabat</hi> proved very beneficiall and necessary, to
induce her to bear her mishaps with prudence and patience: and hence the ignorant
and ill-meaning Vulgar took occasion to suspect and affirm, that shee was his friend:
but I say again they lie, and all those that doe either think or say it, doe lie a thousand
times.</p>
                     <p>Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I neither say it nor think it; let those affirm any such thing,

lightly, they have given account to God thereof by this: I come from my Vineyard;
I know nothing: I am not afraid to know other mens lives: For he that buyes and
lyes, shall feel it in his purse: How much more seeing I was borne naked, aud am now
naked, I can neither win nor lose? A man is but a man, though he have a hose on his
head; but howsoever, what is that to me? And many think there is a Sheep
where there is no Fleece. But who shall bridle a man's understanding when men are
prophane? Good God, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote!</hi> how many follies hast thou inserted
here? and how wide from our purpose are those proverbs which thou hast recited?
Honest <hi>Sancho,</hi> hold thy peace, and from henceforth indeavour to serve thy Master,
and doe not meddle with things which concern thee nothing; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
with all thy five Senses, that whatsoever I have done, doe, or shall doe, is
wholly guided by reason, and conformable to the rules of Knighthood, which I know
better then all the other Knights that ever profest them in the world. Sir, quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> and it is a good rule of Chivalry, that wee goe wandring and lost among these
Mountains in this sort, without path or way, in the search of a mad-man, to whom
peradventure after hee is found, will return a desire to finish what hee began, not of
his tale, but of your head and my ribs, by indeavouring to break them soundly and
thorowly.</p>
                     <p>Peace I say <hi>Sancho,</hi> once again, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for thou must wit, that the
desire of finding the mad-man alone brings me not into these parts so much, as that
which I have in my minde to atchieve a certain Adventure, by which I shall acquire
eternall renown and fame, throughout the universall face of the earth; and I shall
therewithall seal all that which may render a Knight Errant compleat and famous.
And is the Adventure very dangerous, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca?</hi> No, answered the <hi>Knight
of the Ill-favoured face,</hi> although the Die might runne in such sort, as wee might cast
a hazard instead of an incounter; but all consists in thy diligence. In mine, quoth
<hi>Sancho?</hi> Yes (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> for if thou returnest speedily from the place
whereunto I mean to send thee, my pain will also end shortly, and my glory commence
very soon after: and because I will not hold thee long suspended, awaiting to hear the
effect of my words, I would have thee to know, that the famous <hi>Amadis du Gaule</hi> was
one of the most accomplished Knights Errant. I doe not say well, saying he was one;
for hee was the only, the first, and prime Lord of as many as lived in his age. An evill
yeer and a worse moneth for <hi>Don Belianis,</hi> or any other that shall dare presume to
compare with him; for I swear, that they all are questionlesse deceived. I also say,
that when a Painter would become rare and excellent in his Art, hee procures to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the patterns of the most singular Masters of his Science: And this very rule runns
currant throughout all other Trades and Exercises of account, which serve to adorn a
well disposed Commonwealth; and so ought and doth he that means to obtain the
name of a prudent and patient man, by imitating <hi>Vlysses,</hi> in whole person and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
doth <hi>Homer</hi> delineate unto us the true pourtraiture of patience and sufferance;
as likewise <hi>Virgil</hi> demonstrates under the person of <hi>Eneas,</hi> the duty and valour of a
pious sonne, and the Sagacity of a hardy and expert Captain, not shewing them such
<pb facs="tcp:54746:65"/>
as indeed they were, but as they should be, to remain as an example of Virtue, to
ensuing Posterities. And in this very manner was <hi>Amadis</hi> the Noth-star and Sunne
of valourous and amorous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Knights, whom all we ought to imitate which march under
the ensignes of Love and Chivalry. And this being so manifest as it is, I finde, friend
<hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Knight Errant who shall imitate him most, shall likewise bee neerest
to attain the perfection of Armes: And that wherein this Knight bewrayed most
his Prudence, Valour, Courage, Patience, Constancie and Love, was when he retyred
himself to doe penance, being disdained by his Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> to the <hi>Poor Rock,</hi> changing
his name unto that of <hi>Beltenebros,</hi> a name certainly most significative and proper for
the life which he had at that time willingly chosen. And I may more easily imitate him
herein, then in cleaving of Gyants, beheading of Serpents, killing of Monsters, over-throwing
of Armies, putting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Navies to flight, and finishing of Inchantments. And
seeing that this Mountain is so fit for that purpose, there is no reason why I should
overslip the occasion, which doth so commodiously proffer me her Locks.</p>
                     <p>In effect, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what is it you meane to doe in these remote places? Have
not I told thee already, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I meane to follow <hi>Amadis,</hi> by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here the despayred, wood, and furious man? To imitate likewise the valiant <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando,</hi>
where hee found the tokens by a Fountaine that <hi>Angelica the faire</hi> had abused he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
selfe with <hi>Medozo,</hi> for greefe whereof hee ran mad, and pluckt up Trees by their roots,
troubled the water of cleere Fountaines, slew Sheepheards, destroyed their Flocks, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the sheep-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olds, overthrew houses, trayled Mares after him, and committed a
hundred thousand other insolencies worthy of eternall fame and memorie? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I meane not to imitate <hi>Roldan,</hi> or <hi>Orlands,</hi> or <hi>Rowland</hi> (for hee had all these
names) exactly in every mad pranke that hee played: Yet will I doe it the best I can,
in those things which shall seeme unto mee most essentiall. And perhaps I may rest
contented with the only imitation of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who without indammaging any by his
ravings, and only using these of feeling laments, ariving to as great fame thereby as any
one whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Knights which performed the like penances, were
moved by some reasons to doe the like austerities and follies; but good Sir, what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
hath beene offered unto you to become madd? What Lady hath disdayned you?
Or what arguments have you found, that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso</hi> hath ever dallied
with Moore or Christian? There is the point, answered our Knight, and therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the perfection of mine affaires; for that a Knight Errant doe runne madd upon any
just occasion, deserves neither prayse nor thanks; the wit is in waxing madd without
cause, whereby my Mistresse may understand, that if drie I could doe this, what would
I have done being watered? How much more seeing I have a just motive through the
proli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e absence that I have made from my ever supremest Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso?</hi> For
as thou mightest have heard read in <hi>Marias Ambrosio</hi> his Sheepheard,
<q>
                           <l>To him that absent is,</l>
                           <l>All things succeede amiss.</l>
                        </q>
So that friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would not have thee lavish time longer in advising, to let slip
so rare, so happy and singular an imitation. I am madd, and will bee madd, untill
thou returne againe with answere upon a Letter, which I meane to send with thee to
my Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> and if it bee such as my loyalty deserves, my madnesse and penance
shall end; but if the contrary, I shall runne madd in good earnest, and bee in that state
that I shall apprehend nor feele any thing. So that howsoever I bee answered, I shall
issue out of the conflict and paine wherein thou leavest me by joying the good thou shalt
bring mee, as wise, or not feeling the evill thou shalt denounce, as mad. But tell mee
<hi>Sancho,</hi> keepest thou charily yet the helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> which I saw thee take up
from the ground the other day, when that ungratefull fellow thought to have brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
it into pieces, but could not; by which may be collected the excellent temper
thereof?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54746:65"/>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> answered to this demand, saying, I cannot suffer or bear longer, Sir
<hi>Knight of the Ill-favoured face,</hi> nor take patiently many things which you say;
and I beginne to suspect by your words, that all that which you have said to mee
of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> and of gaining Kingdomes and Empires, of bestowing Islands and
other gifts and great things, as Knights Errant are wont, are all matters of ayre and lies,
all couzenage or couzening, or how else you please to term it: for he that shall hear you
name a Barbers Bason, <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet, and that you will not abandon that
errour in more then four dayes; what other can he think, but that hee who affirms
such a thing doth want wit and discretion? I carry the Bason in my Bagge all battered
and boared, and will have it mended, and dresse my beard in it at home, if God shall
doe me the favour that I may one day see my Wife and Barnes.</p>
                     <p>Behold, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I doe likewise swear, that thou haste the
shallowest pate that ever any Squire had or hath in the World: is it possible, that in
all the time thou hast gone with me, thou couldest not perceive, that all the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Knights Errant doe appear <hi>Chimera's,</hi> follies, and desperate things, being quite
contrary? Not that they are indeed such; but rather by reason that wee are still haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a crue of Inchanters, which change and transforme our acts making them
seem what they please, according as they like to favour or annoy us. And so this
which seems to thee a Barbers Bason, is in my conceit <hi>Mambrino</hi> his Helmet, and to
another will appear in some other shape. And it is doubtlesly done by the profound
Science of the wise man my friend, to make that seem a Bason, which really and truely
is <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet; because that it being so precious a Jewell, all the world
would pursue me to deprive me of it; but now seeing that it is to like a Barbers Bason,
they indeavour not to gain it, as was cleerly shewed in him that thought to break
it the other day, and would not carry it with him, but left it lying behinde him on
the ground; for yfaith hee had never left it, did he know the worthinesse thereof.
Keep it friend, for I need it not at this present, wherein I must rather di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Armes I weare, and remain as naked as I was at the hour of my birth, if I shall
take the humour rather to imitate <hi>Orlando</hi> in doing of my penance, then <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilest thus hee discoursed, hee arived to the foote of a loftie Mountaine, which
stood like a hewn Rock, divided from all the rest, by the skyrt whereof glyded a smooth
River, hemmed in on every side by a greene and flourishing Meadow, whose verdure
did marveilously delight the greedy beholding eye. There were in it also many wilde
Trees, and some plants and floures, which rendred the place much more pleasing. <hi>The
Knight of the illfavored face</hi> made choice of this place to accomplish therein his
penance, and therefore as soone as hee had viewed it, hee began to say with a loud
voice, like a distracted man, these words ensuing. This is the place where the humor
of mine eyes shall increase the liquid veines of this Chrystall Current, and my continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and deepe sighes shall give perpetuall motion to the leaves of these mountanie Trees,
in testimony of the paine which my oppressed heart doth suffer. O you, whosoever ye
bee, Rusticall Gods, which have your Mansion in this inhabitable place, give care to
the plaints of this unfortunate Lover, whom a long absence, and a few imagined suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
have conducted to deplore his state among these Desarts, and make him exclame
on the rough condition of that Ingrate and Faire, who is the top, the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>, the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od,
terme and end of all humane beauty. O ye <hi>Napeas</hi> and <hi>Driades,</hi> which doe wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
inhabite the Thickets and Groves, so may the nimble and lascyvious <hi>Satyres,</hi> by
whom (although in vaine) you are beloved, never have power to interrupt your sweet
rest, as you shall assist mee to lament my disasters, or at least attend them, whilest I
dolefully breathe them. O <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> the day of my night, the glory of my
paine, North of my travells, and starre of my Fortunes; so heav'n enrich thee with the
highest, whensoever thou shalt demand it, as thou wilt consider the place and passe,
unto which thine absence hath conducted mee, and answere my faith and desires in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
and gracious manner. O solitary Trees (which shall from henceforward
keepe company with my solitude) give tokens with the soft motion of your boughs,
that my presence doth not dislike you. O thou my Squire, and gratefull companion in
<pb facs="tcp:54746:66"/>
all prosperous and adverse successes, beare well away what thou shalt see mee doe here,
to the end that thou mayest after promptly recount it as the totall cause of my ruine.
And saying so, he alighted from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and taking off in a trice his bridle and sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
he struck him on the buttock, saying, Hee gives thee Liberty that wants it himself;
O horse! as famous for thy works as thou art unfortunate by thy Fates: Goe where
thou pleasest; for thou bearest written in thy forehead, how that neither the <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griphon</hi>
of <hi>Astolpho,</hi> nor the renowned <hi>Frontino,</hi> which cost <hi>Bradamant</hi> so deerly,
could compare with thee for swiftnesse.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> had viewed and heard his Lord speak thus, hee likewise said, Good
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ide him that freed us from the pains of unpannelling the gray Asse; for if he were
here yfaith he should also have two or three claps on the buttocks, &amp; a short Oration in
his praise: yet if he were here, I would not permit any other to unpannell him, seeing
there was no occasion why; for he good Beast was nothing subject to the passions of
Love, or despair, no more then I, who was his Master when it pleased God: And in
good sooth, Sir <hi>Knight of the Ill-favoured face,</hi> if my departure and your madnesle
bee in good earnest, it will bee needfull to saddle <hi>Rozinante</hi> again, that he may supply
the want of mine Asse; for it will shorten the time of my departure and return again:
And if I make my voyage afoot, I know not when I shall arrive there, or return here
back unto you; for in good earnest I am a very ill footman.</p>
                     <p>Let it be as thou likest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for thy designe displeaseth me nothing;
and therefore I resolve that thou shalt depart from hence after three dayes; for in the
mean space thou shalt behold what I will doe and say for my Ladies sake, to the end
thou mayest tell it to her. Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what more can I view then that
which I have seen already? Thou art altogether wide of the matter, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
for I must yet teare mine apparrell, throw away mine Armour, and beat my
head about these Rocks, with many other things of that kinde that will strike thee into
admiration. Let me beseech you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> see well how you give your self those
knocks about the Rocks; for you might happen upon some one so ungracious a Rock,
as at the first rap would dissove all the whole <hi>Machina</hi> of your Adventures and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and therefore I would be of opinion, seeing that you doe hold it necessary that
some knocks be given with the head, and that this enterprize cannot be accomplished
without them, that you content your self, seeing that all is but seigned, counterfeited,
and a Jest, that you should, I say, content your self with striking it on the water, or
on some other soft thing, as Cotten, or Wooll, and leave to my charge the exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof; for I will tell to my Lady, that you strike<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> your head against the point of
a Rock which was harder then a Diamond.</p>
                     <p>I thank thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> for thy good will, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but I can assure thee
that all these things which I doe, are no Jests, but very serious Earnests; for otherwise
wee should transgresse the Statutes of Chivalry, which command us not to avouch any
untruth, on pain of relapse, and to doe one thing for another, is as much as to lye.
So that my head-knocks must be true, firm, and sound ones, without any sophisticall
or fantasticall shaddow: and it will be requisite that thou leave me some lint to cure
me, seeing that Fortune hath deprived us of the <hi>Balsamum</hi> which we lost. It was
worse to have lost the Asse, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing that at once with him we have lost our
Lint, and all our other provision: and I intreat you most earnestly not to name again
that accursed drink; for in only hearing it mentioned, you not only turn my guts in
me, but also my soul. And I request you moreover, to make account that the terme
of three dayes is already expired, wherein you would have me take notice of your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
for I declare them already for seen, and will tell wonders to my Lady; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
goe write your Letter, and dispatch me with all haste; for I long already to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and take you out of this Purgatory wherein I leave you.</p>
                     <p>Doest thou call it a Purgatory, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Thou had'st done
better, had'st thou called it Hell; or rather worse, if there be any thing worse then
that. I call it so (quoth <hi>Sancho) Quia in inferno nulla est retentio,</hi> as I have heard
say.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54746:66"/>
I unddrstand not, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> what <hi>retentio</hi> meaneth. <hi>Retentio</hi> (quoth
<hi>Sancho)</hi> is that, whosoever is in Hell, never comes, nor can come out of it. Which
shall fall out contrary in your person, or my feet shall goe ill, if I may carry spurs to
quicken <hi>Rozinante:</hi> and that I may safely arrive before my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boso,</hi>
for I will recount unto her such strange things of your follies and madnesse
(for they be all one) that you have, and doe daily, as I will make her as soft as a Glove,
although I found her at the first harder then a Cork tree: with whose sweet and
hony answer, I will return in the ayre as speedily as a Witch, and take you out of
this Purgatory, which is no Hell, although it seems one, seeing there is hope to escap
from it; which as I have said, they want which are in hell: and I beleeve you will
not contradict me herein.</p>
                     <p>Thou hast reason, answered <hi>The Knight of the illfavoured face,</hi> but how shall I write
the Letter, and the warrant for the receipt of the Colts also? added <hi>Sancho.</hi> All shall
bee inserted together, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and seeing wee have no paper, wee may
doe well, imitating the ancient men of times past, to write our minde in the leaves of
Trees or waxe, yet waxe is as hard to bee found here as paper. But now that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
my selse, I know where wee may write our minde well, and more then well, to
wit, in <hi>Cardinio's</hi> Tablets, and thou shalt have care to cause the letters to bee written
out againe fairely, in the first Village wherein thou shalt finde a Schoole master; or if
such a one bee wanting, by the Cleark of the Church; and beware in any sort that thou
give it not to a Notary or Court-Clearke to bee copied, for they write such an intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling-confounding
processe Letter, as <hi>Satan</hi> himself would scarce bee able to reade it.
And how shall wee doe for want of your name and subscription, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Why
answered <hi>Don-Quixote, Amadis</hi> was never wont to subscribe to his Letters. I, but
the warrant to receive the three Asses must forcibly bee subsigned; and if it should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
bee copied, they would say the former is false, and so I shall rest without my
Colts, The Warrant shall bee written and firmed with my hand in the Tablets, which
as soone as my Neece shall see, shee shall make no difficulty to deliver thee them. And
as concerning the love-letter, thou shalt put this subscription to it; <hi>Yours untill death,
The Knight of the ill-favored face;</hi> and it makes no matter though it bee written by any
stranger; for as much as I can remember, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> can neyther write nor read, nor
hath shee seene any Letter, no, not so much as a Character of my writing all the dayes
of her life: For my love and hers have beene ever <hi>Platonicall,</hi> never extending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
farther then to an honest regard and view the one of the other, and even this same
so rarely, as I dare boldly sweare, that in these dozen yeeres which I love her more
deerely then the light of these mine eyes, which the earth shall one day devour.
I have not seen her four times, and perhaps of those same four times shee hath
scarce perceived once that I beheld her. Such is the case and closenesse wherewithall
her parents <hi>Lorenco Corcuelo</hi> and her Mother <hi>Aldonca Nogales,</hi> have brought her
up. Ta, ta, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso</hi> is <hi>Lorenco Corcuelo</hi> his
Daughter, called by another name <hi>Aldonca Loreno?</hi> The same is shee, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and it is shee that merits to bee Empresse of the vast Universe. I know
her very well, replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I dare say, that she can throw an Iron barr as well
as any the strongest Lad in our Parish. I vow by the giver, that 'tis a Wench of the
mark, tall and stout, and so sturdy withall, that she will bring her chinn out of the mire,
in despite of any Knight Errant, or that shall err, that shall honour her as his Lady.
Out upon her, what a strength and voyce shee hath? I saw her on a day stand on the
topp of the Church steeple, to call certain servants of her Fathers, that laboured in a
fallow field; and although they were half a league from thence, they heard her as well
as if they were at the foot of the Steeple: And the best that is in her is, that shee is
nothing coy; for shee hath a very great smack of Courtship, and playes with every one,
and Jibes and Jests at them all. And now I affirm, Sir <hi>Knight of the Ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

that not only you may, and ought to commit raving follies for her sake; but eke you
may with just title also despair and hang your self: For none shall hear thereof, but
will say you did very well, although the Divell carried you away. And fain would I
<pb facs="tcp:54746:67"/>
bee gone, if it were for nothing else but to see her: for it is many a day since I saw
her, and I am sure shee is changed by this; for womens beauty is much impaired by
going alwaies to the field, exposed to the Sunne and weather.</p>
                     <p>And I will now, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> confesse a truth unto you, that I have lived untill
now in a marvellous errour, thinking well and faithfully that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was
some great Princesse, on whom you were enamoured, or such a person as merited
those rich presents which you bestowed on her, as well of the <hi>Biscaines,</hi> as of the Slaves,
and many others that ought to bee, as I suppose, correspondent to the many victories
which you have gained, both now and in the time that I was not your Squire. But
pondering well the matter, I cannot conceive why the Lady <hi>Aldonea Lorenco;</hi> I
mean the Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> of these should care whether these vanquished men
which you send or shall send, doe goe and kneel before her. For it may befall, that she
at the very time of their arrivall bee combing of Flax or threshing in the Barn, whereat
they would be ashamed, and shee likewise laugh, and bee somewhat displeased at the
present.</p>
                     <p>I have oft told thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> many times that thou art too great a prattler, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and although thou hast but a grosse wit, yet now and then thy frumps
nip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: But to the end thou mayest perceive the faultinesse of thy brain, and my discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I will tell thee a short History, which is this: There was once a widow fair,
young, free, rich, and withall very pleasant and jocund, that fell in Love with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
round and well-set servent of a Colledge: his Regent came to understand it;
and therefore said on a day to the Widow, by the way of fraternall correction, Mistriss,
I doe greatly marvell, and not without occasion, that a woman so principall, so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
so rich, and specially so wittie, could make so ill a choise, as to waxe enamoured
on so foul, so base, and foolish a man as such a one, we having in this house so many
Masters of Art, Graduates and Divines, amongst whom you might have made choise
as among Peers, saying. I will take this, and I will not have that. But shee answered
him thus, with a very pleasant and good grace: You are, Sir, greatly deceived, if you
deem that I have made an ill choise in such a one, let him seem never so great a fool:
for to the purpose that I mean to use him, hee knows as much or rather more Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
then <hi>Aristotle.</hi> And so, <hi>Sancho,</hi> is likewise <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso</hi> as much worth
as the highest Princesse of the World, for the effect I mean to use her: For all the
Poets which celebrate certain Ladies at pleasure, thinkest thou that they all had Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisses?
No: Doest thou believe that the <hi>Amarillis,</hi> the <hi>Files, Silvias, Dianas,
Galateas, Alcidas,</hi> and others such like, wherewithall the Books, Ditties, Barbers
Shops, and Theaters are filled, were truely Ladies of flesh and bones, and their Mistrisses
which have and doe celebrate them thus? No certainly, but were for the greater part

                        </gap>eigned, to serve as a subject of their Verses, to the end the Authours might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
amorous, and men of courage enough to bee such. And thus it is also suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for me to believe and think that the good <hi>Aldonca Lorenco</hi> is fair and honest:
As for her Parentage it matters but little; for none will send to take information
thereof, to give to her an habit; and I make account of her as of the greatest Princesse
in the World: For thou oughtest to know, <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou knowest it not already,
that two things alone incite men to love more then all things else, and those be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
beauty, and a good name: And both these things are found in <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in
their prime; For none can equall her in fairnesse, and few come neer her for a good
report. And for a finall conclusion, I imagine, that all that which I say, is really so,
without adding or taking ought away. And I doe imagine her in my fantasie to bee
such, as I could with her, as well in beauty as principality: And neither can <hi>Helen</hi>
approach, nor <hi>Lucrece</hi> come neer her; no, nor any of those other famous women,
Greek, Barbarous, or Latine, of foregoing ages. And let every one say what hee
pleaseth; For though I should be reprehended for this by the ignorant, yet shall I not
therefore be chastised by the more observant and rigorous sort of men.</p>
                     <p>I avouch, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you have great reason in all that you say, and that I
am my self a very Asse, But alas! why doe I name an Asse with my mouth, seeing one
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54746:67"/>
should not mention a Rope in ones house that was hanged? but give me the Letter, and
farewell, for I will change. With that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> drew out his Tablets, and going
aside, began to indite his Letter with great gravity; which ended, he called <hi>Sancho</hi>
to read it to him, to the end he might bear it away in memory, left by chance hee
did lose the Tablets on the way, for such were his crosse fortunes, as made him fear
every event. To which <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, saying, Write it there twice or thrice in the
book, and give me it after; for I will carry it safely by Gods grace. For to think that
I will be able ever to take it by rote, is a great folly; for my memory is so short, as I doe
many times forget mine own name: But yet for all that read it to me, good Sir; for I
would bee glad to hear it, as a thing which I suppose to be as excellent, as if it were
cast in a mould. Hear it then, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for thus it sayes.</p>

It goes very well (quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi>) subsign it therefore, I pray you. It needs no
seal (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but only my Rubrick, which is as valible as if it were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
not only for three Asses, but also for three hundred. My trust is in you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Sancho,</hi> permit me, for I will goe saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and prepare your self to

for it will turn my stomack, and I shall not bee able to keep my self from weeping;
and my head is yet so sore since yester night through my lamentations, for the losse of

                     <p>In good faith, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> I think thou art grown as mad as my
self. I am not so mad, replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I am more cholerick. But setting that
aside, say, What will you eat untill my return? Doe you mean to doe as <hi>Cardenio,</hi>
and take by the high-wayes side perforce from the Sheepheards? Care thou not for
that, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for although I had it, yet would I not eat any other thing
then the Hearbs and Fruits that this Field and Trees doe yield; for the perfection of
mine affair consists in fasting, and the exercise of other castigations. To this <hi>Sancho</hi>
replyed, Doe you know what I fear? that I shall not finde the way to you again here
where I leave you, it is so difficult and obscure. Take well the marks, and I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
to keep here-about, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> untill thou come back again; and
will moreover about the time of thy return mount to the tops of these high Rocks, to
see whether thou appearest: but thou shouldest doe best of all, to the end thou mayest
not stay and misse me, to cut down here and there certain boughs, and strew them on
the way as thou goest, untill thou beest out in the Plains, and those may after serve thee
as bounds and marks, by which thou mayest again finde me when thou returnest, in
imitation of the clue of <hi>Theses</hi> Labyrinth.</p>
                     <p>I will doe so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and then cutting downe certaine boughes, hee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

upon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> commended very seriously to his care, that
hee should tender him as hee would his owne person, hee made on towards the Plaines,

with that departed, although his Lord importuned him to behold two or three follies
ere hee went away: But scarce had hee gone a hundred paces, when hee returned and

when hee was all alone, the History sayes, that after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
had ended his friskes and leapes, naked from the gyrdle downward,
and from that upward aparelled; seeing that his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> was
gone, and would behold no more of his mad pranks; hee ascended
to the top of a high Rock, and began there to thinke on that whereon
hee had thought often times before, without ever making a full reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
therein, to wit, whether were it better to imitate <hi>Orlando</hi> in his unmeasurable
furies, then <hi>Amadis</hi> in his melancholy moodes; and speaking to himselfe would say,
If <hi>Orlando</hi> was so valorous and good a Knight, as men say, what wonder seeing in fine
hee was inchanted and could not bee slaine, if it were not by clapping a pinne to the
soale of his foot; and therefore did weare shooes still that had seven folds of yron in the
soales? although these his draughts stood him in no stead at <hi>Roncesuales</hi> against <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo
del Carpio,</hi> which understanding them, pressed him to death betweene his armes.
But leaving his valour apart, let us come to the losing of his wits, which it is certaine
hee lost through the signes hee found in the Forrest, and by the news that the Sheep-heard
gave unto him, that <hi>Angelica</hi> had slept more then two noone-tydes with the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Moore Medoro</hi> of the curled locks, him that was Page to King <hi>Argamante:</hi> and if
hee understood this, and knew his Lady had played beside the cushion, what wonder
was it that hee should runne madd? But how can I imitate him in his furies, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imitate him in their occasion? for I dare sweare for my <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> that
all the dayes of her life shee hath not seene one <hi>Moore,</hi> even in his owne attyre as
hee is, and shee is now right as her mother bore her: and I should doe her a manifest

other raving tricke, gained as great fame of being amorous, as any one else whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
For that which his Historie recites was none other, then that seeing himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by his Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> who had commanded him to withdraw himselfe from her
presence, and not appeare againe in it untill shee pleased: hee retyred himselfe in the
company of a certaine Hermit, to the poore-Rock, and there crammed himselfe with

And this being true, as it is, why should I take now the paines to stripe my selfe all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and offend these Trees, which never yet did mee any harme? Nor have I any
reason to trouble the cleere waters of these brookes, which must give mee drinke when I
am thirsty. Let the remembrance of <hi>Amadis</hi> live, and bee imitated in ev'ry thing as
much as may bee, by <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha:</hi> of whom may bee said what was
said of the other, that though hee atchieved not great things, yet did hee die in their
pursuite. And though I am not contemned or disdained by my <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> yet it is
sufficient as I have said already, that I bee absent from her; therefore hands to your

take, and yee famous actions of <hi>Amadis,</hi> occur to my remembrance, and instruct me
where I may best beginne to imitate you. Yet I know already, that the greatest thing
hee did use was Prayer, and so will I. And saying so, hee made him a payre of Beades
of great Gaules, and was very much vexed in minde for want of an Eremite, who
might heare his confession, and comfort him in his afflictions; and therefore did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
himselfe walking up and downe the little greene field, writing and graving in the
rindes of Trees, and on the smoothe sands many verses, all accommodated to his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and some of them in the prayse of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> But those that were found tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
finished, and were legible after his owne finding againe in that place, were only
these ensuing.

The addition of <hi>Toboso</hi> to the name of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> did not cause small laughter in those

that if in the naming of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> hee did not also add that <hi>Of Toboso,</hi> the time could
not bee understood; and in truth it was so, as hee himself did afterward confesse. Hee

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54746:69"/>
in the search of some hearbs to sustein his languishing forces, he entertained himself all
the time of <hi>Sancho</hi> his absence; who had he staid three weeks away as hee did but
three dayes, <hi>The Knight of the Ill-favoured face</hi> should have remained so disfigured, as
the very mother that bore him would not have known him.</p>
                     <p>But now it is congruent, that leaving him swallowed in the gulfs of sorrow and
verifying, we turn and recount what hapned to <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> in his Embassage; which
was, that issuing out to the high-way, hee presently took that which led towards <hi>Toboso,</hi>
and arrived the next day following to the Inn where the disgrace of the Coverlet befell
him; and scarce had he well espied it, but presently hee imagined that he was once again
flying in the aire; and therefore would not enter into it, although his arrivall was at such
an hour as hee both might and ought to have stayed, being dinner time, and he himself
likewise possest with a marvelous longing to taste some warme meat; for many dayes
past he had fed altogether on cold Viands. This desire enforced him to approach to
the Inn, remaining still doubtfull, notwithstanding, whether hee should enter into it or
no. And as hee stood thus suspended, there issued out of the Inn two persons which
presently knew him, and the one said to the other, Tell me, Master Licentiate, is not
that horseman that rides there <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> hee whom our Adventurers old woman
said departed with her Master for his Squire? It is, quoth the Licentiat, and that is our
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his horse: And they knew him so well, as those that were the Curate
and Barber of his own Village, and were those that made the search and formall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
against the Books of Chivalry: and therefore as soon as they had taken full no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> and <hi>Rozinante,</hi> desirous to learn news of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they drew
neer unto him; and the Curate called him by his name, saying, Friend <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi>
where is your Master? <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> knew them instantly, and desirous to conceal the
place and manner wherein his Lord remained, did answer them, that his Master was in
a certain place with-held by affairs for a few dayes, that were of great consequence and
concerned him very much, and that hee durst not for both his eyes discover the place to
them. No, no (quoth the Barber) <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> if thou doest not tell us where hee
sojourneth, wee must imagine (as wee doe already) that thou hast rob'd and slain him,
specially seeing thou commest thus on his horse; and therefore thou must in good faith
get us the horses owner, or else stand to thine answer. Your threats fear me nothing,
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I am not a man that Robs or Murthers any one: every man is slain
by his destinie, or by God that made him. My Lord remains doing of penance in the
midest of this Mountain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>with very great pleasure. And then hee presently recounted
unto them, from the beginning to the end, the fashion wherein he had left him, the
Adventures which had befaln, and how hee carried a Letter to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea of
Toboso,</hi> who was <hi>Larenco Corcuelo</hi> his daughter, of whom his Lord was enamoured up
to the Livers.</p>
                     <p>Both of them stood greatly admired at <hi>Sancho</hi>'s relation, and although they knew
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>'s madnesse already, and the kinde thereof, yet as often as they heard speak
thereof, they rested newly amazed. They requested <hi>Sancho</hi> to shew them the Letter
that he carried to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso.</hi> Hee told them that it was written in
Tablets, and that hee had expresse order from his Lord to have it fairly copied out in
paper, at the first Village whereunto he should arrive. To which the Curate answered,
bidding shew it unto him, and he would write out the copie very fairly.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Sancho</hi> thrust his hand into his bosome, and searched the little book, but could
not finde it, nor should not, though hee had searched till Dooms-day; for it was in
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>'s power, who gave it not to him, nor did hee ever remember to demand it.
When <hi>Sancho</hi> perceived that the book was lost, hee waxed as wan &amp; pale as a dead man,
and turning again very speedily to feel all the parts of his body, hee saw cleerly that it
could not bee found; and therefore without making any more adoe, hee laid hold on
his own beard with both his fists, and drew almost the one half of the hair away, and
afterward bestowed on his face and nose in a <hi>momento</hi> half a dozen such cuffs, as
hee bathed them all in blood: which the Curate and Barber beholding, they asked him
what had befalne him, that hee intreated himself so ill? What should befall me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb facs="tcp:54746:70"/>
swered <hi>Sancho,</hi> but that I have lost at one hand, and in an instant three Colts, whereof
the least was like a Castle? How so, quoth the Barber? Marry, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have
lost the Tablets wherein were written <hi>Dulcineas</hi> Letter, and a schedule of my Lords,
addrest to his Neece, wherein hee commanded her to deliver unto me three Colts, of
four or five that remained in his house: And saying so, hee recounted the losse of his
gray Asse: The Curate comforted him, and said, that as soon as his Lord were found,
hee would deal with him to renew his grant, and write it in Paper, according to the
common use and practise; for as much as those which were written in Tablets, were
of no value, and would never be accepted nor accomplished.</p>
                     <p>With this <hi>Sancho</hi> took courage, and said, if that was so, he cared not much for the
losse of <hi>Dulcineas</hi> Letter; for he knew it almost all by rote. Say it then, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth
the Barber, and we will after write it. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> stood still and began to scratch his
head, to call the Letter to memory, and now would hee stand upon one leg, and now
upon another. Sometimes hee looked on the earth, other whiles upon Heaven, and
after he had gnawn off almost the half of one of his nails, and held them all the while
suspended, expecting his recitall thereof, he said after a long pause; On my soul, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

the beginning was thus; <hi>High and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Barber, he said not, but <hi>super-humane</hi> or <hi>Sovereigne Ladie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and presently followed, if I well remember. <hi>He that is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and wants sleepe, and the hurt man doth kisse your worships hands, ingrate and very
scornefull faire.</hi> And thus hee went roving untill hee ended in <hi>Yours untill death, The
Knight of the ill-favoured face.</hi> Both of them tooke great delight to see <hi>Sancho</hi>'s good
memorie, and praysed it to him very much, and requested him to repeate the Letter
once or twice more to them, that they might also beare it in memorie, to write it at
the due season. <hi>Sancho</hi> turned to recite it againe and againe, and at every repetition
said other three thousand Errors. And after this hee told other things of his Lord, but
spoke not a word of his owne tossing in a Coverlet, which had befaln him in that Inne,
into which hee refused to enter. Hee added besides, how his Lord, in bringing him a
good dispatch from his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> would forthwith set out to endeavour
how hee might become an Emperour, or at the least a Monarch; for they had so agreed
betweene themselves both, and it was a very easie matter for him to become one, such
was the valour of his Person and strength of his arme. And that when hee were one,
hee would procure him a good marriage; for by that time hee should bee a widower at
the least; and hee would give him one of the Emperours Ladies to wife, that were an
Inheritrix of some great and rich state on the firme land, for now hee would have no
more Islands. And all this was related so seriously by <hi>Sancho,</hi> and so in his perfect
sence, hee scratching his nose ever and anon as hee spoke, so as the two were stricken
into a new amazement, pondering the vehemencie of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> frenzie, which
carried quite away with it, in that sort, the judgement of that poore man, but would
not labour to dispossesse him of that Errour, because it seemed to them, that since it
did not hurt his Conscience, it was better to leave him in it; that the recitall of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
might turn to great recreation, and therefore exhorted him to pray for the health
of his Lord; for it was a very possible and contingent thing to arive in the processe of
time to the dignity of an Emperor, as he said, or at least, to that of an Archbishop, or
other calling equivalent to it.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Sancho</hi> demanded of them, Sirs, if fortune should turne our affaires
to another course, in such sort as my Lord abandoning the purpose to purchase
an Empire, would take in his head that of becomming a Cardinall, I would faine
learne of you here, what Cardinalls-Errant are wont to give to their Squires?
They are wont to give them (quoth the Curate) some simple Benefice, or some
Parsonage, or to make them Clerkes or Sextons, or Vergers of some Church, whose
living amount to a good penny rent, beside the profit of the Altar, which is
oft-times as much more. For that it is requisite (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> that the Squire
bee not married, and that hee know how to helpe Masse at least: and if that bee so
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54746:70"/>
unfortunate I, that both am married, and knows not besides the first letter of the
A, B, C. what will then become of me, if my Master take-the humour to bee an Arch-Bishop,
and not an Emperour, as is the Custome and use of Knights Errant? Doe not
afflict thy minde for that, friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Barber) for wee will deal with thy
Lord here, and wee will counsell him, yea wee will urge it to him as a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that hee become an Emperour, and not an Arch-Bishop; for it will
bee more easie for him to bee such a one, by reason that hee is more valorous then
learned.</p>
                     <p>So me thinks (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> although I know he hath ability enough for all. That
which I mean to doe for my part is, I will pray unto our Lord to conduct him to that
place wherein he may serve him best, and give me greatest rewards. Thou speakest like
a discreet man (quoth the Curate) and thou shalt doe therein the dutie of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
But that which wee must indeavour now, is to devise how wee may winn thy
Lord from prosecuting that unprofitable penance hee hath in hand, as thou sayest:
And to the end wee may think on the manner how, and eat our dinner withall, seeing it
is time, let us all enter into the Inn. <hi>Sancho</hi> bade them goe in, and hee would stay for
them at the door, and that he would after tell them the reason why he had no minde to
enter, neither was it in any sort convenient that he should; but he intreated them to
bring him somewhat forth to eat that were warm, and some Provand for <hi>Rozinante.</hi>
With that they departed into the lodging, and within a while after the Barber brought
forth unto him some meat: And the Curate and the Barber, after having pondered
well with themselves what course they were to take to attain their design; the Curate
fell on a device very fit both for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> humour, and also to bring their purpose
to passe; and was, as he told the Barber, that hee had bethought him, to apparell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
like a Lady Adventurous, and that he therefore should doe the best that he could
to fit himself like a Squire, and that they would goe in that habit to the place where
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sojourned, feigning that she was an afflicted and distressed Damzell, and
would demand a boon of him, which hee as a valorous Knight Errant would in no
wise denye her; and that the gift which hee meaned to desire, was to intreat her to
follow her where she would carry him, to right a wrong which a naughty Knight had
done unto her; and that shee would besides pray him not to command her to unmask
her self, or inquire any thing of her estate, untill hee had done her that right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> against that
bad Knight. And by this means he certainly hoped that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would grant
all that he requested in this manner: And in this sort they would fetch him from thence
and bring him to his Village, where they would labour with all their power, to see
whether his extravagant frenzie could bee recovered by any remedy.</p>

of the Inn-keepers wife a Gown and a Kerchief, leaving her in
pawn thereof a fair new Cassock of the Curates. The Barber made
him a great beard of a pyed Oxes tayle, wherein the Inn-keeper was
wont to hang his Horse-combe. The Hostesse demanded of them
the occasion why they would use these things? The Curate recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

use. Then mounted the Barber likewise on his Mule, with his beard hanging down
to the girdle, half red and half white, as that which as wee have said was made of
the taile of a pyed coloured Oxe: then taking leave of them all, and of the good <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornes,</hi>
who promised (although a sinner) to say a Rosary to their intention, to the end
that God might give them good successe, in so Christian and difficult an adventure,
as that which they undertooke. But scarce were they gone out of the Inne, when
the Curate begann to dread a little that he had done ill, in apparrelling himself in that
wise, accounting it a very indecent thing, that a Priest should dight himself so, although
the matter concerned him never so much. And acquainting the Barber with his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
hee intreated him that they might change attires, seeing it was much more just
that hee, because a Lay-man, should faine the oppressed Lady, and himself would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Squire; for so his dignitie would be less prophaned; to which if he would
not condescend, he resolved to passe on no farther, although the Divell should
carrie therefore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> away. <hi>Sancho</hi> came over to them about this season; and
seeing them in that habit hee could not contain his laughter. The Barber (to bee brief)
did all that which the Curate pleased, and making thus an exchange of inventions, the
Curate instructed him how hee should behave himself, and what words he should use
to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to press and move him to come away with him and forsake the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
and love of that place which hee had chosen to perform his vain penance.</p>
                     <p>The Barber answered, that he would set every thing in his due poynt and perfection,
though he had never lessoned him; but would not set on the array, untill they came
neer to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> abode; and therefore folded up his clothes, and
Master Parson his beard, and forthwith went on their way, <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> playing the
guide, who recounted at large to them all that had hapned with the mad-man whom
they found in the Mountain; concealing notwithstanding the booty of the Malet,
with the other things found therein: for although otherwise most simple, yet was our
young man an ordinary vice of fools, and had a spice of covetousness.</p>
                     <p>They arrived the next day following to the place where <hi>Sancho</hi> had left the tokens of
boughs, to finde that wherein his Master sojourned: and having taken notice thereof,
hee said unto them that that was the entry; and therefore they might doe well to appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
themselves, if by change that might be a mean to procure his Lords liberty; for they
had told him already, that on their going and apparrelling in that manner consisted
wholly the hope of freeing his Lord, out-of that wretched life hee had chosen; and
therefore did charge him on his life, not to reveal to his Lord in any case what they
were, nor seem in any sort to know them: and that if he demanded (as they were sure
hee would) whether hee had delivered his Letter to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> hee should say hee did,
and that by reason she could not read, shee answered him by word of mouth, saying,
that shee commanded, under pain of her indignation, that presently abandoning so
austere a life, hee would come and see her; for this was most requisite, to the end that
moved therewithall, and by what they meant likewise to say unto him, they made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
account to reduce him to a better life; and would besides perswade him to that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54746:71"/>
course instantly, which might set him in the way to become an Emperour or Monarch;
for as concerning the being an Archbishoppe he needed not to feare it at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> listned to all the talke and instruction, and bore them away well in memorie,
and gave them great thanks for the intention they had to counsell his Lord to become an
Emperour, and not an Archbishop; for as hee said, hee imagined in his simple judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that an Emperour was of more abilitie to reward his Squire then an Archbishop
Errant. Hee likewise added, that hee thought it were necessarie hee went somwhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them to search him, and deliver his Ladies answere; for perhaps it alone would be
sufficient to fetch him out of that place, without puting them to any farther paines. They
liked of <hi>Sancho Pancaes</hi> device, and therefore determined to expect him untill his return
with the news of finding his Master. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> entred in by the Clifts of the
Rocks (leaving them both behinde together) by which ran a little smoothe streame,
to which other Rocks, and some trees that grew neere unto it, made a fresh and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
shadow. The heats, and the day wherein they arived there, was one of those of
the moneth of <hi>August,</hi> when in those places the heate is intolerable: the hour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three in the afternoon. All which did render the place more gratefull, and
invited them to remain therein untill <hi>Sancho's</hi> return. Both therefore resting there
quietly under the shadow, there arrived to their hearing the sound of a voyce, which
without being accompanied by any instrument, did resound so sweet and melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
as they remained greatly admired, because they esteemed not that to be a place
wherein any so good a Musician might make his abode. For although it is usually
said, that in the Woods and Fields are found Shepheards of excellent voyces, yet is
this rather a Poeticall indeerment, then an approved truth; and most of all when they
perceived that the verses they heard him singing were not of rustick composition, but
rather of delicate and Courtly invention. The truth whereof is confirmed by the
verses, which were these:

whether they might hear any thing else: But perceiving that the silence continued a
prettie while, they agreed to issue and seek out the Musician, that sung so harmoniously.
And being ready to put their resolution in practise, they were again arrested by the
same voyce, the which touched their ears anew with this Sonnet.

                     <p>The Song was concluded with a profound sigh; and both the others lent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
eare to heare if hee would sing any more; but perceiving that the Musick was
converted into throbs and dolefull plaints, they resolved to goe and learn who was
the wretch, as excellent for his voyce, as dolorous in his sighs: and after they had
gone a little at the doubling of the poynt of a cragg, they perceived one of the very
same form and fashion that <hi>Sancho</hi> had painted unto them, when hee told them the
History of <hi>Cardenio;</hi> which man espying them likewise, shewed no semblance of fear
but stood still with his head hanging on his breast like a male-content, not once
lifting up his eyes to behold them from the first time, when they unexpectedly
arrived.</p>
                     <p>The Curate who was a man very well spoken (as one that had already intelligence
of his misfortune; for he knew him by his signes) drew neerer to him, and prayed and
perswaded him with short, but very forcible reasons, to forsake that miserable life, left
hee should there eternally lose it, which of all miseries would prove the most miserable.
<hi>Cardenio</hi> at this season was in his right sense, free from the furious accident that distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
him so often; &amp; therefore viewing them both attyred in so strange &amp; unusuall a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
from that which was used among those Desarts, he rested somewhat admired; but
chiefly hearing them speak in his affair, as in a matter known (for so much he gathered
out of the Curates speeches:) and therefore answered in this manner. I perceive
well, good Sirs (whosoever you be) that Heaven which hath alwayes care to succour
good men; yea even and the wicked many times, hath without any desert, addrest unto
me by these Desarts and places so remote from vulgar haunt; persons, which laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mine eyes with quick and pregnant reasons, the little I have to lead this kinde of
life, doe labour to remove me from this place to a better: And by reason they know
not as much as I doe, and that after escaping this harme, I shall fall into a far greater,
they account me perhaps for a man of weak discourse; and what is worse for one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54746:72"/>
wholly devoid of judgement? And were it so, yet is it no marvell; for it seems to me
that the force of the imagination of my disasters is so bent and powerfull in my destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that I, without being able to make it any resistance, doe become like a stone, void
of all good feeling and knowledge: and I come to know the certainty of this truth,
when some men doe recount and shew unto me tokens of the things I have done
whilest this terrible accident over-rules me; and after I can doe no more, then be
grieved, though in vain, and curse, without benefit, my too froward fortune; and
render as an excuse of my madnesse the relation of the cause thereof, to as many as
please to hear it: for wise men perceiving the cause, will not wonder at the effects.
And though they give me no remedie, yet at least will not condemn me; for it will
convert the anger they conceive at my mis-rules, into compassion of my disgraces: And
Sirs, if by chance it be so, that you come with the same intention that others did, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
you, e're you inlarge farther your discreet perswasions, that you will give eare a
while to the relation of my mis-haps; for perhaps when you have understood it, you
may save the labour that you would take, comforting an evill wholy incapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
                     <p>Both of them, which desired nothing so much as to understand from his own mouth
the occasion of his harmes, did intreate him to relate it, promising to doe nothing else
in his remedie or comfort, but what himselfe pleased. And with this the sorrowfull
Gentleman began his dolefull Historie, with the very same words almost that hee had
rehearsed it to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and the Goat-heard a few dayes past, when by occasion of
Master <hi>Elisabat</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> curiositie in observing the <hi>Decorum</hi> of Chivalrie, the
tale remained imperfect, as our Historie left it above. But now good fortune so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
things, that his foolish fit came not upon him, but gave him leisure to continue
his Storie to the end; and so ariving to the passage that spoke of the Letter <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi>
found in the booke of <hi>Amadis du Gaule, Cardenio</hi> said that hee had it very well
in memorie; and the sence was this.</p>

                     <p>This Letter moved mee to demand <hi>Luscinda</hi> of her father for my wife, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
recounted; and by it also <hi>Luscinda</hi> remayned in <hi>Don Ferdinandoes</hi> opinion crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for one of the most discreete women of her time. And this billet Letter was that
which first put him in minde to destroy mee ere I could effect my desires. I told to <hi>Don
Ferdinando</hi> wherein consisted all the difficultie of her fathers protracting of the mariage,
to wit, in that my father should first demand her; the which I dared not to mention
unto him, fearing lest hee would not willingly consent thereunto; not for that the
qualitie, bountie, virtue and beautie of <hi>Luscinda</hi> were to him unknowne, or that shee
had not parts in her able to ennoblish and adorne any other linage of Spayne whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
But because I understood by him, that he desired not to marry mee, untill he had
<pb facs="tcp:54746:73"/>
seen what Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> would doe for me. Finally, I told him that I dared not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
it to my father, as well for that inconvenience, as for many others that made me so
afraid, without knowing what they were, as me thought my desires would never take
effect.</p>
                     <p>To all this <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> made mee answere, that hee would take upon him to
speake to my father, and perswade him to treate of that affaire also with <hi>Luscindaes.</hi>
O ambitious <hi>Marius!</hi> O cruell <hi>Cataline!</hi> O facinorous <hi>Quila!</hi> O trecherous <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalon!</hi>

daughter, committed by</hi> Roderick <hi>King of Spayne, brought in the Moores, and destroyed
all the Countrie.]</hi> O covetous <hi>Iudas!</hi> Traytor, cruell, revengefull and couzening,
what indeserts did this wench commit, who with such plaines discovered to thee the
secrets and delights of her heart? What offence committed I against thee? What
words did I speake, or councell did I give, that were not all addrest to the increasing
of thine honour and profit? But on what doe I (the worst of all Wretches) complain!
seeing that when the current of the Starres doth bring with it mishaps, by reason they
come downe precipitately from above, there is no earthly force can withhold, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
industry prevent or evacuate them. Who would have imagined that <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
a noble Gentleman, discreete, oblieged by my deserts, and powerfull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whatsoever the amorous desire would exact of him, where and whensoever it sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on his heart, would (as they say) become so corrupt, as to deprive mee of one only
sheepe, which yet I did not possesse? But let these considerations bee laid apart as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
that wee may knit up againe the broken thred of my unfortunate History.
And therefore I say that <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> beleeving, that my presence was a hindrance
to put his treacherous and wicked designe in execution, hee resolved to send mee to his
eldest brother, under pretext to get some money of him, for to buy sixe great Horses,
that hee had of purpose, and only to the end I might absent my selfe, bought the very
same day that hee offered to speake himselfe to my father, and would have mee goe for
the money (because hee might bring his treacherous intent the better to passe) could I
prevent this Treason? Or could I perhaps but once imagine it? No truely; but rather
glad for the good Merchandize hee had made, did make preffer of my selfe to depart
for the money very willingly. I spoke that night to <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and acquainted her with
the Agreement past betweene mee and <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> biding her to hope firmly, that
our good just desires would sort a wished and happy end. Shee answered mee againe
(as little suspecting <hi>Don Ferdinandoes</hi> treason as my selfe) biding mee to returne with
all speede, because shee beleeved that the conclusion of our affections should bee no
longer deferred, then my father deferred to speake unto hers. And what was the cause
I know not, but as soone as shee had said this unto mee, her eyes were filled with tears,
and somwhat thwarting her throat, hindred her from saying many other things, which
mee thought shee strived to speak.</p>
                     <p>I rested admired at this new accident, untill that time never seene in her, for alwaies
as many times as my good fortune and diligence granted it, wee conversed with all
sport and delight, without ever intermedling in our discourses any teares, sighes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
suspicions or feares. All my speech was to advance my fortune; for having
received her from Heaven as my Lady and Mistresse, then would I amplifie her beautie,
admire her worth, and prayse her discretion. Shee on the other side would returne mee
the exchange, extolling in mee, what shee, as one enamoured, accounted worthy of
laud and commendation. After this wee would recount a hundred thousand toyes and
chances befaln our neighbours and acquaintance, and that to which my presumption
dared farthest to extend it selfe, was sometimes to take her beautifull and Ivorie hands
perforce and kisse them as well as I might, thorow the rigorous strictnesse of a nigard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yron grate which divided us. But the precedent night to the day of my sad depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
shee wept, sob'd and sighed, and departed, leaving mee full of confusion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
assaults, amazed to behold such new and dolefull tokens of sorrow and feeling in
<hi>Luscinda.</hi> But because I would not murder my hopes, I did attribute all these things
to the force of her affection towards mee, and to the griefe which absence is wont to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54746:73"/>
stir in those that love one another deerly, To bee briefe, I departed from thence sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
and pensive, my Soule being full of imaginations and suspicions, and yet know
not what I suspected or imagined: Cleere tokens, foretelling the sad successe and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
which attended mee. I arived to the palce where I was sent, and delivered my
Letter to <hi>Don Ferdinandoes</hi> brother, and was well entertayned, but not well dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for hee commanded mee to expect (a thing to mee most displeasing) eight dayes,
and that out of the Duke his fathers presence; because his brother had written unto
him to send him certaine moneys unknowne to his father. And all this was but false
<hi>Don Ferdinandoes</hi> invention, for his brother wanted not money wherewithall to have
dispatched mee presently, had not hee written the contrary.</p>
                     <p>This was so displeasing a commandement and order, as almost it brought me to terms
of disobeying it, because it seemed to me a thing most impossible to sustein my life so
many dayes in the absence of my <hi>Luscinda;</hi> and specially having left her so sorrowfull
as I have recounted; yet notwithstanding I did obey like a good servant, although
I knew it would be with the cost of my health. But on the fourth day after I had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
there came a man in my search with a Letter, which he delivered unto me, and
by the indorsement I knew it to be <hi>Luscinda's;</hi> for the hand was like hers: I opened
it (not without fear and assailment of my senses) knowing that it must have been some
serious occasion which could move her to write unto me, being absent, seeing shee did
it so rarely even when I was present. I demanded of the Bearer, before I read, who had
delivered it to him? and what time hee had spent in the way? Hee answered me, That
passing by chance at mid-day through a street of the City, a very beautifull Lady did
call him from a certain window: Her eyes were all be-blubbered with tears, and said
unto him very hastily; Brother, if thou beest a Christian, as thou appearest to bee one,
I pray thee for Gods sake, that thou doe forthwith addresse this Letter to the place and
person that the superscription assigneth (for they bee well known;) and therein thou
shalt doe our Lord great service.</p>
                     <p>And because thou mayest not want means to doe it, take what thou shalt finde
wraped in that handcerchif: And saying so, shee threw out of the window a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerchif,
wherein were laped up a hundred Rialls, this Ring of gold which I carry here,
and that Letter which I delivered unto you; and presently, without expecting mine
answer, shee departed, but first saw me take up the handkerchif and Letter; and then I
made her signes that I would accomplish herein her command: and after perceiving
the pains I might take in bringing you it, so well considered, and seeing by the indorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that you were the man to whom it was addrest: for, Sir, I know you very well,
and also oblieged to doe it by the tears of that beautifull Lady, I determined not to
trust any other with it, but to come and bring it you my self in person; and in sixteen
hours since it was given unto me, I have travelled the journey you know, which is at
least eighteen leagues long. Whilest the thankfull new Messenger spake thus unto me
I remained in a manner hanging on his words, and my thighs did tremble in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as I could very hardly sustein my self on foot: yet taking courage, at last I opened
the Letter, whereof these were the Contents</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>THe word that <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> hath past unto you to speak
to your father, that hee might speak to mine, hee hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
more to his own pleasure then to your profit. For, Sir,
you shall understand that hee hath demanded me for his wife; and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(borne away by the advantage of worths which hee supposes to bee in
<hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> more then in you) hath agreed to his demand in so
good earnest, as the espousals shall bee celebrated within these two dayes,
and that so secretly and alone, as only the Heavens and some folk of
<pb facs="tcp:54746:74"/>
the house shall bee witnesses. How I remain, imagine, and whether it
bee convenient you should return, you may consider; And the successe
of this affair shall let you to perceive, whether I love you well or no. I
beseech Almightie God, that this may arrive unto your hands, before
mine shall be in danger to joyn it self with his, which keepeth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
faith so ill.</p>

                     </floatingText>
                     <p>These were, in summe, the contents of the Letter, and the motives that perswaded
me presently to depart, without attending any other answer, or other monies: for
then I conceived cleerly, that it was not the buy-all of the horses, but that of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
which had moved <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> to send me to his brother. The rage which I
conceived against him, joyned with the fear to lose the Jewell which I had gained by so
many yeers service, and desires, did set wings on me, for I arrived as I had flyen next
day at mine owne City, in the houre and moment fit to goe speake to <hi>Luscinda.</hi>
I entred secretly, and left my Mule whereon I rode in the honest mans House that
had brought mee the Letter, and my fortune purposing then to bee favourable to mee,
disposed so mine affaires, that I found <hi>Luscinda</hi> siting at that yron-grate, which was
the sole witnesse of our Loves. <hi>Luscinda</hi> knew mee streight and I her, but not as wee
ought to know one another: But who is hee in the world that can truely vaunt that
hee hath penetrated, and throughly exhausted the confused thoughts and mutable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of women? Truly none. I say then, to proceed with my tale, that as soon as
<hi>Luscinda</hi> perceived me, shee said, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> I am attyred with my wedding Garments,
and in the Hall doth wait for me the Traitor <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> and my covetous father
with other witnesses, which shall rather bee such of my death, then of mine espousals;
bee not troubled deer friend, but procure to bee present at this sacrifice, the which if
I cannot hinder by my perswasions and reasons, I carry hidden about me a Ponyard se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
which may hinder more resolute forces by giving end to my life, and a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to thee, to know certain the affection which I have ever borne, and doe bear unto
thee. I answered her troubled and hastily, fearing I should not have the leisure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
unto her, saying, Sweet Ladie, let thy works verifie thy words; for if thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
a Ponyard to defend thy credit, I doe here likewise bear a Sword wherewithall
I will defend thee, or kill my self, if fortune proove adverse and contrary. I believe
that she could not hear all my words, by reason shee was called hastily away, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
for that the Bridegroom expected her comming. By this the night of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
did throughly fall, and the Sunne of my gladnesse was set; and I remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
light in mine eyes, or discourse in my understanding. I could not finde the way
into her house, nor could I moove my self to any part: yet considering at last how
important my presence was, for that which might befall in that adventure, I animated
my self the best I could, and entred into the house; and as one that knew very well
all the entries and passages thereof, and specially by reason of the trouble and businesse
that was then in hand, I went in unperceived of any: And thus without beeing seen,
I had the oportunity to place my self in the hollow room of a window of the same Hall,
which was covered by the ends of two encountring pieces of Tapestry, from whence
I could see all that was done in the Hall, remaining my self unviewed of any. Who
could now describe the assaults and surprizals of my heart while I there abode? the
thoughts which incountred my minde? the considerations which I had? which were
so many and such, as they can neither bee said, nor is it reason they should. Let it suffice
you to know, that the Bridegroom entred into the Hall without any ornament, wearing
the ordinary array hee was wont, and was accompanied by a Cousin Germane of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda's,</hi>
and in all the Hall there was no stranger present, nor any other then the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Servants: Within a while after, <hi>Luscinda</hi> came out of the Parlour, accompanied
by her mother and two waiting maids of her own, as richly attired and deckt as her
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54746:74"/>
calling and beauty deserved, and the perfection of Courtly pomp and bravery could
afford: my distraction and trouble of minde lent me no time to note particularly the
apparrell shee wore, and therefore did only marke the colours, which were Carnation
and White; and the splendour which the precious Stones and Jewels of her Tires, and
all the rest of her Garments yeelded: yet did the singular beauty of her fair and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
tresses surpasse them so much, as being in competencie with the precious Stones,
and flame of four Links that lighted in the Hall, yet did the splendour thereof seem
farr more bright and glorious to mine eyes. O memory! the mortall enemie of mine
case, to what end serves it now to represent unto me the uncomparable beauty of that
my adored enemie? Were it not better, cruell memory! to remember and represent
that which shee did then, that being moved by so manifest a wrong, I may at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
to lose my life, since I cannot procure a revenge? Tire not, good Sirs, to hear
the digressions I make; for my grief is not of that kinde that may bee rehearsed suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly
and speedily, seeing that in mine opinion every passage of it is worthy of a large
discourse.</p>
                     <p>To this the Curate answered, that not only they were not tyred or wearied, hearing
of him; but rather they received marvellous delight to hear him recount each minuity
and circumstance, because they were such as deserved not to bee past over in silence,
but rather merited as much attention as the principall parts of the History. You shall
then wit (quoth <hi>Cardenio)</hi> that as they thus stood in the Hall the Curate of the Parish
entred, and taking them both by the hand to doe that which in such an act is required
at the saying of, <hi>Will you Lady</hi> Luscinda <hi>take the Lord</hi> Don Ferdinando, <hi>who is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for your lawfull Spouse, according as our holy mother the Church commands?</hi> I thrust
out all my head and neck out of the Tapestry, and with most attentive ears and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
minde setled my self to hear what <hi>Luscinda</hi> answered, expecting by it the sentence
of my death, or the confirmation of my life. O! if one had dared to sally out at that
time, and cried with a loud voyce; O <hi>Luscinda, Luscinda!</hi> see well what thou doest;
consider withall what thou owest me! Behold how thou art mine, and that thou
canst not bee any others; note that thy saying of yea, and the end of my life shall bee
both in one instant. O Traytor <hi>Don Ferdinando!</hi> Robber of my Glory! Death of my
Life! what is this thou pretendest? what wilt thou doe? Consider that thou canst not
Christian-like atchieve thine intention, seeing <hi>Luscinda</hi> is my Spouse, and I am her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
O foolish man now that I am absent, and farre from the danger, I say what I
should have done, and not what I did. Now after that I have permitted my deer

The Curate stood expecting <hi>Luscindaes</hi> answer a good while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> shee gave it; and in
the end, when I hoped that shee would take out the Ponyard to stab her self, or would
unloose her tongue to say some truth, or use some reason or perswasion that might
redound to my benefit, I heard her in stead thereof answer with a dismaied and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
voyce the word, <hi>I will:</hi> And then <hi>Don Fernando</hi> said the same; and giving her the
Ring, they remained tyed with an indissoluble knot. Then the Bridegroom comming
to kisse his Spouse, shee set her hand upon her heart, and fell in a trance between her
Mothers armes.</p>
                     <p>Now only remains untold the case wherein I was, seeing in that ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which I had heard
my hopes deluded, <hi>Luscindaes</hi> words and promises Falsisied, and my self wholly disabled
to recover in any time the good which I lost in that instant; I rested void of counsell,
abandoned (in mine opinion) by heaven, proclaimed an enemie to the earth which up-held
me the aire denying breath enough for my sighs, and the water humour sufficient
to mine eyes; only the fire increased in such manner, as I burned throughly with rage
and jealousie. All the house was in a tumult for this suddain amazement of <hi>Luscinda;</hi>
and as her Mother unclasped her bosome to give her the aire there appeared in it a
paper folded up, which <hi>Don Fernando</hi> presently seized on, and went aside to read it by
the light of a torch; and after hee had read it, her sate down in a chair, laying his hands
<pb facs="tcp:54746:75"/>
on his cheek, with manifest signes of Melancholy discontent, without bethinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the remedies that were applyed to his Spouse to bring her again to her self. I
seeing all the folk of the house thus in an uproar, did adventure my self to issue, not
weighing much whether I were seen or no, bearing withall a resolution (if I were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
to play such a rash part, as all the World should understand the just indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my brest, by the revenge I would take on false <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and the mutable
and dismayed Traytresse: But my destiny which hath reserved me for greater evills
(if possibly there bee any greater then mine owne) ordained that instant my wit should
abound, whereof ever since I have so great want; and therefore without will to take
revenge of my greatest enemies (of whom I might have taken it with all facilitie, by
reason they suspected so little my being there) I determined to take it on my self, and
execute in my self the pain which they deserved, and that perhaps with more rigour
then I would have used toward them if I had slain them at that time, seeing that the
suddain death finisheth presently the pain; but that which doth lingringly torment kills
alwaies, without ending the life.</p>
                     <p>To bee short, I went out of the house, and came to the other where I had left my
Mule, which I caused to bee sadled, and without biding mine Host adieu, I mounted
on her and rode out of the City, without daring, like another <hi>Lot,</hi> to turne back and
behold it; and then seeing my selfe alone in the Fields, and that the darknesse of the
night did cover mee, and the silence thereof invite mee to complaine, without respect
or feare to bee heard or known; I did let slip my voice, and untyed my tongue with so
many curses of <hi>Luscinda</hi> and <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> as if thereby I might satisfie the wrong
they had done mee. I gave her the title of Cruell, Ingratefull, False and Scornefull,
but specially of Covetous, seeing the riches of mine Enemy had shut up the Eyes of her
affection, to deprive mee thereof, and render it to him with whom fortune had dealt
more frankly and liberally; and in the midst of this tune of maledictions and scornes,
I did excuse her saying; That it was no marvell that a Mayden kept close in her parents
house, made and accustomed alwaies to obey them, should at last condiscend to their
Will, specially, seeing they bestowed upon her for husband, so noble, so rich and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
a Gentleman, as to refuse him, would bee reputed in her, to proceede eyther from
want of judgement, or from having bestowed her affections else-where, which things
must of force greatly prejudice her good opinion and renowne. Presently would I
turne againe to say, that though shee had told them that I was her spouse, they might
easily perceive that in choosing mee, shee had not made so ill an election that shee
might not bee excused, seeing that before <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> offered himselfe, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
could not happen to desire, if their wishes were guided by reason, so fit a match
for their daughter as my selfe; and shee might easily have said, before shee put her selfe
in that last and forcible passe of giving her hand, that I had already given her mine,
which I would come out to consesse, and confirme all that shee could any way faine in
this Case; and concluded in the end, that little Love, lesse Judgement, much
Ambition and desire of greatnesse caused her to forget the Words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
shee had deceived, entertayned and sustayned mee in my firme hopes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desires.</p>
                     <p>Using these words, and feeling this unquietnesse in my breast, I travelled all the rest
of the night, and struck about dawning into one of the entries of these Mountaines,
through which I travelled three dayes at random, without following or finding any
path or way, untill I arived at last to certaine Medowes and Fields, that lye, I know
not in which part of these Mountaines; and finding there certaine Heards, I demanded
of them which way lay the most craggy and inaccessible places of these Rocks, and they
directed mee hither; and presently I travelled towards it, with purpose here to end my
life: and entring in among those Desarts, my Mule, through wearinesse and hunger,
fell dead under mee, or rather as I may better suppose, to disburden himself of so vile
and unprofitable a burden as hee carried of mee. I remained a foote, overcome by
nature, and pierced through and through by hunger, without having any helpe, or
knowing who might succour mee; and remained after that manner, I know not how
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54746:75"/>
long, prostrate on the ground, and then I rose againe without any hunger, and I found
neere unto mee certaine Goat-heards, who were those doubtlesly that fed mee in my
hunger: for they told me in what manner they found me, and how I spake so many
foolish and mad words, as gave certain argument that I was devoid of Judgement:
and I have felt in my self since that time that I injoy not my wits perfectly, but rather
perceive them to bee so weakned and impaired, as I commit a hundred follies, tearing
mine apparrell, crying lowdly through these Desarts, cursing my fates, and idlely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the beloved name of mine enemie, without having any other intent or discourse
at that time then to endeavour to finish my life e're long; and when I turne to my
self, I am so broken and tyred, as I am scarce able to stir me. My most ordinary Mansion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
is in the hollownesse of a Cork-Tree, sufficiently able to cover this wretched Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse.
The Cow-heards and the Goat-heards that feed their Cattell here in these
Mountains, moved by charity, gave me sustenance, leaving meat for me by the wayes
and on the Rocks which they suppose I frequent, and where they think I may finde it;
and so, although I doe then want the use of reason, yet doth naturall necessity induce me
to know my meat, and stirreth my apppetite to covet, and my will to take it: They tell
me when they meet me in my wits, that I doe other times come out to the high-wayes
and take it from them violently, even when they themselves doe offer it unto me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.
After this manner doe I passe my miserable life, untill Heaven shall bee pleased
to conduct it to the last period, or so change my memorie, as I may no more remember
the beauty and treacherie of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> or the injurie done by <hi>Don Ferdinando;</hi> for
if it doe me this favour, without depriving my life, then will I convert my thoughts
to better discourses: if not, there is no other remedy but to pray God to receive
my soul into his mercie; for I neither finde valour nor strength in my self to rid my
bodie out of the straights, wherein for my pleasure I did at first willingly intrude it.</p>
                     <p>This is, Sirs, the bitter relation of my disasters; wherefore judge if it bee such as
may be celebrated with lesse feeling and compassion then that, which you may by this
time have perceived in my self: And doe not in vain labour to perswade or counsell
me that which reason should afford you may bee good for my remedie; for it will
work no other effect in me then a medicine prescribed by a skilfull Physician, to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
that will in no sort receive it. I will have no health without <hi>Luscinda;</hi> And since
shee pleaseth to alienate her self, being or seeing shee ought to be mine; so doe I also
take delight to bee of the retinue of mis-hap, although I might be a retainer to good
fortune. Shee hath ordained that her changing shall establish my perdition: And I will
labour by procuring mine own losse, to please and satisfie her will: And it shall bee
an example to ensuing ages, that I alone wanted that wherewith all other wretches
abounded, to whom the impossibility of receiving comfort prooved sometimes a cure;
but in me it is an occasion of greater feeling and harme, because I am perswaded that
my harmes cannot end even with very death it self, Here <hi>Cardenio</hi> finished his large
Discourse, and unfortunate and amourous Historie; and just about the time that the

to my designes, by affording me leisure to communicate my mis-haps to Heaven with
Plaints, then that if any mortall man living, since there is none upon earth from whom
may be expected counsell in doubts, ease in complaints, or in harmes remedie? The
Curate and his companions heard and understood all the words cleerly: and for as
much as they conjectured (as indeed it was) that those Plaints were delivered very
neer unto them, they did all arise to search out the Plaintiff; and having gone some
twenty steps thence, they beheld a young Youth behinde a Rock, sitting under an Ash-Tree,
and attyred like a Country Swain, whom by reason his face was inclined, as hee sate
washing of his feet in the clear stream that glided that way, they could not perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
and therefore approached towards him with so great silence, as they were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed
by him, who only attended to the washing of his feet, which were to white, as they
<pb facs="tcp:54746:77"/>
properly resembled two pieces of cleer Crystall, that grew among the other stones of
the stream: The whitenesse and beauty of the feet amazed them, being not made as
they well conjectured, to tread clodds, or measure the steps of lazie Oxen, and holding
the Plough, as the youths apparell would perswade them; and therefore the Curate,
who went before the rest, seeing they were not yet espyed, made signes to the other
two that they should divert a little out of the way, or hide themselves behinde some
broken cliffts that were neer the place, which they did all of them, nothing what the
Youth did with very great attention. Hee wore a little brown Capouch, gyrt very
neer to his body with a white Towell, also a pair of Breeches and Gamashoes of the
same coloured cloth, and on his head a clay-coloured Cap: his Gamashoes were lifted
up half the legg, which verily seemed to bee white Alablaster. Finally having washed
his feet, taking out a linnen Kerchif from under his Cap, hee dryed them therewithall,
and at the taking out of the Kerchif hee held up his face, and then those which stood
gazing on him had leizure to discern an unmatchable beauty, so surpassing great, as
<hi>Cardenio</hi> rounding the Curate in the eare, said, This bodie, since it is not <hi>Luscinda,</hi> can bee

cover her shoulders, but did also hide her round about in such sort, as (her feet exceped)
no other part of her body appeared, they were so neer and long. At this time her hands
served her for a Combe, which as her feet seemed pieces of Crystall in the water, so

                     <p>The poor Gyrl remained so amazed and confounded, as shee answered not a word:
wherefore the Curate and the rest drawing neerer, they took her by the hand, and then
hee prosecuted his Speech saying, What your habit concealed from us, Ladie, your hairs

                     <p>Whilest the Curate made this Speech, the disguised woman stood as one half asleep,
now beholding the one, now the other, without once moving her lip or saying a word;
just like a rusticall Clown, when rare and unseen things to him before, are unexpectedly

But the Curate insisting and using other perswasive reasons, addrest to that effect,
won her at last to make a breach on her tedions silence, and with a profound sigh blow
open her corral gates, saying somwhat to this effect: Since the solitarinesse of these
Rocks hath not beene potent to conceale mee, nor the disheveling of my disordered
haires, licensed my tongue to belie my sexe, it were in vaine for mee to feigne that a new,

so comely, spoke without stop or staggering, with so ready delivery, and so
sweete a voice, as her discretion admired them no lesse then her beauty. And renewing
againe their complements and intreaties to her, to accomplish speedily her promise, she
setting all coynesse apart, drawing on her shoes very modestly, and winding up her
hayre, late her downe on a stone, and the other three about her, where shee used no
little violence to smother certaine rebellious teares that strove to breake forth without
her permission, and then with a reposed and cleare voice she began the History of her

theirs, in not being nobly discended. True it is, that they are not so base, as they
should therefore shame their calling, nor so high as may check my conceit, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades

care of my side, and pleasure of theirs, as I cannot possibly indeere it enough. The times

and other labourers, I did entertaine in those exercises which were both commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable

a little, I would then take some godly booke in hand, or play on the Harpe; for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

passions that afflict the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>This was the life which I led in my fathers house, the recounting whereof so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
hath not beene done for ostentation, nor to give you to understand that I am rich,
but to the end you may note how much, without mine owne fault, have I fall'n from
that happy state I have said, unto the unhappy plight into which I am now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
The Historie therefore is this, that passing my life in so many occupations, and
that with such recollection as might bee compared to a religious life, unseen as I thought
by any other person then those of our house; for when I went to Masse, it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so early, and so accompanied by my Mother and other Mayd-servants, and I my selfe
so cover'd and watchfull, as mine eyes did scarce see the earth whereon I trod: and yet
notwithstanding those of love, or as I may better terme them, of idlenesse, to which
<hi>Lynxes</hi> eyes may not bee compared, did represent mee to <hi>Don
Ferdinandoes</hi> affection
and care, for this is the name of the Dukes younger sonne, of whom I spake before.
Scarce had shee named <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> when <hi>Cardenio</hi> changed colour, and began to
sweate, with such alteration of Bodie and Countenance, as the Curate and Barber
which beheld it, feared that the accident of frenzie did assault him, which was wont (as
they had heard) to possesse him at times. But <hi>Cardenio</hi> did nothing else then sweat, and
stood still beholding now and then the country gyrle, imagining straight what she was,
who without taking notice of his alteration, followed on her discourse in this manner:
And scarce had<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

greatly surprized by my love, as his actions did after give evident demonst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But to conclude, soone the relation of those misfortunes which have no conclusion,
I will over-slip in silence the diligences and practices of <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> used to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto me his affection: he suborned all the folk of the house. He bestowed gifts
and favours on my parents: every day was a holy-day, and a day of sports in the
streets where I dwelled; At night no man could sleep for Musick; The Letters were
innumerable that came to my hands, without knowing who brought them, farsed too
full of amorous conceits and offers, and containing more promises and protestations
then characters: All which not only could not molifie my minde, but rather hardened
it as much if hee were my mortall enemie, and therefore did construe all the indeavours
hee used to gain my good will to bee practised to a contrary end; which I did not
as accounting <hi>Don Fernando</hi> ungentle, or that I estemed him too importan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>; for I
took a kinde of delight to see my self so highly esteemed and beloved so Noble a
Gentleman; nor was I any thing offended to see his papers written in my praise; for,
if I bee not deceived in this poynt, be women ever so foul, wee love to hear men call
us beautifull. But mine honesty was that which opposed it self unto all these things,
and the continuall admonishions of my Parents, which had by this plainly perceived
<hi>Don Fernando's</hi> pretence, as one that cared not all the World should know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t: They
would often say unto me, that they had deposited their honours and reputation in my
virtue alone and discretion, and bade me consider the inequality that was between <hi>Don
Fernando</hi> and me, and that I might collect by it how his thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that if I feared any inconveniencie might befall, to the end they might crosse it, and
cause him to abandon his so unjust a pursuit, they would match me where I most liked
either to the best of that Town or any other Town adjoyning, saying, they might easily
compasse it, both by reason of their great wealth and my good report. I fortified my
resolution and integrity with these certain promises and the known truth which they
told me; and therefore would never answer to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> any word that might
ever so farr off argue the least hope of condiscending to his desires: All which ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of mine which I think he deemed to be disdains, did inflame more his lascivious appetite
(for this is the name wherewithall I intitle his affection towards me) which had it been
such as it ought, you had not known it now, for then the cause of revealing it had not
befaln me. Finally, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> understanding how my parents meant to marrie me,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54746:78"/>
to the end they might make void his hope of ever possessing me: or at least set more
guards to preserve mine honour, and this news or surmize was an occasion that he did
what you shall presently hear.</p>
                     <p>For one night as I sate in my Chamber, only attended by a young Mayden that
served me, I having shut the doors very safe, for fear left through any negligence my
honesty might incur any danger, without knowing or imagining how it might happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
notwithstanding all my dilligences used and preventions, and amid'st the solitude of
this silence and recollection he stood before me in my Chamber: At his presence I was
so troubled, as I lost both sight and speech; and by reason thereof could not crie, nor
I think he would not, though I had attempted it, permit me: For he presently ranne
over to me, and taking me between his armes (for, as I have said, I was so amazed, as I
had no power to defend my self) he spake such things to me, as I know not how it is
possible that so many lies should have ability to fain things resembling in shew so much
the truth; and the Traytor caused tears, to give credit to his words; and sighs, to give
countenance to his intention.</p>
                     <p>I, poor soul, being alone amid'st my friends and weakly practised in such affairs,
began, I know not how, to account his leasings for verities, but not in such sort as his
tears or sighs might any wise move me to any compassion that were not commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And so the first trouble and amazement of minde being past, I began again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
my defective Spirits, and then said to him with more courage then I thought I
should have had; if, as I am my Lord, between your armes, I were between the paws
of a fierce Lyon, and that I were made certain of my Libertie, on condition to doe or
say any thing prejudiciall to mine honour, it would prove as impossible for me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it, as for that which once hath been to leave off his essence and being: Wherefore
even as you have in-gyrt my middle with your armes, so likewise have I tyed fast my
minde with virtuous and forcible desires that are wholy different from yours, as you
shall perceive, if seeking to force me, you presume to passe further with your inordinate
designe: I am your Vassall, but not your Slave; nor hath the nobility of your blood
power, nor ought it to harden, to dishonour, stain, or hold in little account the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of mine; and I doe esteem my self, though a Countrey-Wench and Farmers
Daughter, as much as you can your self, though a Noble-man and a Lord; With me
your violence shall not prevail, your riches gain any grace, your words have power to
deceive, or your fighs and tears bee able to move; yet if I shall finde any of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
mentioned in him whom my Parent shall please to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ow on me for my Spouse,
I will presently subject my will to his, nor shall it ever varie from his minde a jot; So that
if I might remain with honour, although I rested void of delights, yet would I willingly
bestow on you that which you presently labour so much to obtain; all which I doe
say, to divert your straying thought from ever thinking that any one may obtain of me
ought, who is not my lawfull Spouse. If the let only consists therein, most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

here my hand to bee thine alone; and let the Heavens, from which nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
and this Image of our Lady, which thou hast here present, be witnesses of this
truth.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Cardenio</hi> heard her say that she was called <hi>Dorotea</hi> hee fell again into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
suspicion, and in the end confirmed his first opinion to be true; but would not
interrupt her speech, being desirous to know the successe, which hee knew wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
before, and therefore said only, Lady, is it possible that you are named <hi>Dorotea?</hi>
I have heard report of another of that name, which perhaps hath runne the like course
of your misfortunes; but I request you to continue your Relation, for a time may
come wherein I may recount unto you things of the same kinde, which will breede no
small admiration. <hi>Dorotea</hi> noted <hi>Cardenioes</hi> words, and his uncouth and disastrous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,
and then intreated him very instantly, if hee knew any thing of her affaires, hee
would acquaint her therewithall, For if fortune had left her any good, it was only the
courage which shee had to beare patiently any disaster that might befall her, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in her opinion, that no new one could arive, which might increase a whit those
she had already.</p>

after befell of my relation was this: That <hi>Don Fernando</hi> tooke an Image that was in
my Chamber for witnesse of our Contract, and added withall most forcible words and
unusuall oathes, promising unto mee to become my husband: Although I warned him
before hee had ended his speech, to see well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his father, when hee should see him married to one so base, and his Vassall, and that
therefore hee should take heede that my beauty (such as it was) should not blinde him,
seeing hee should not finde therein a sufficient excuse for his errour, and that if hee
meant to doe mee any good, I conjured him by the love that hee bore unto mee, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
my fortunes to roule in their owne spheere, according as my qualitie reached:
For such unequall matches doe never please long, nor persevere with that delight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall

                     <p>All the reasons here rehearsed I said unto him, and many more which now are falne
out of minde, but yet proved of no efficacy to weane him from his obstinate purpose;
even like unto one that goeth to buy, with intention never to pay for what hee takes,
and therefore never considers the price, worth, or defect of the stuffe hee takes co cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
I at this season made a briefe discourse, and said thus to my selfe, I may doe this,
for I am not the first which by Matrimony hath ascended from a low degree to a high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
not shall <hi>Don Fernando</hi> bee the first whom beautie or blind affection (for that
is the most certaine) hath induced to make choice of a Consort equall to his Greatness.
Then since herein I create no new world, nor custome, what error can bee committed
by embracing the honour wherewithall fortune crownes mee: Although it so befell,
that his affection to mee endured no longer then till he accomplisht his will: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, I certes shall still remaine his wife. And if I should disdainfully give him the
repulse, I see him now in such termes, as perhaps forgetting the dutie of a Nobleman,
hee may use violence, and then shall I remaine for ever dishonoured, and also without
excuse of the imputations of the ignorant, which knew not how much without any
fault I have faln into this inevitable danger. For, what reasons may bee sufficiently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to perswade my father and other, that this Nobleman did enter into my Chamber
without my consent? All these demands and Answeres did I in an instant revolve in
mine imagination, and found my selfe chiefly forced (how I cannot tell) to assent to
his Petition, by the witnesses hee invoked, the teares hee shed, and finally by his sweete
disposition and comely feature, which accompanied with so many arguments of unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
affection, were able to conquer and enthrall any other heart, though it were as free
and wary as mine own. Then called I for my waiting-maid, that shee might on earth
accompany the coelestiall witnesses.</p>
                     <p>And then <hi>Don Fernando</hi> turned again to reiterate and confirme his oathes, and added
to his former, other new Saints as witnesses, and wished a thousand succeeding
male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
to light on him, if hee did not accomplish his promise to mee. His eyes againe
waxed moist, his sighes increased, and himselfe inwreathed mee more streightly between
his armes, from which hee had never once loosed mee: and with this, and my May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
departure, I left to bee a Mayden, and hee began to bee a Traytor and a disloyall
man. The day that succeeded to the night of my mishaps came not (I think) so soon
as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> desired it; for after a man hath satisfied that which the appetite covets,
the greatest delight it can take after, is to apart it selfe from the place where the desire
was accomplished. I say this because <hi>Don Fernando</hi> did hasten his departure from mee,
by my maids industrie, who was the very same that had brought him into my Chamber,
hee was got in the street before dawning. And at his departure from mee hee said (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though)
not with so great shew of affection and vehemency as hee had used at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
that I might bee secure of his faith, and that his oathes were firme and most true;
and for a more confirmation of his word, hee tooke a rich Ring off his finger and put it
on mine. In fine hee departed, and I remayned behinde, I cannot well say whether joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or sad; but this much I know, that I rested confused and pensive, and almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54746:79"/>
my self for the late mischance; yet either I had not the heart, or else I forgot to
chide my Maid for her treacherie committed by shutting up <hi>Don Fernando</hi> in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
for as yet I could not determine, whether that which had befaln me, was a good
or an evill.</p>
                     <p>I said to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> at his departure, that he might see me other nights when hee
pleased, by the same means he had come that night, seeing I was his own, and would
rest so, untill it pleased him to let the world know that I was his wife. But hee never
returned again, but the next night following could I see him after, for the space of a
moneth either in the street or Church, so as I did but spend time in vain to expect him;
although I understood that he was still in Town and rode every other day a hunting,
an Exercise to which he was much addicted.</p>
                     <p>Those dayes were, I know, unfortunate and accursed to me, and those hours sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull;
for in them I began to doubt, nay rather wholly to discredit <hi>Don Fernando's</hi>
faith; and my maid did then hear loudly the checks I gave unto her for her presumption,
ever untill then dissembled: And I was moreover constrained to watch and keep guard
on my tears and countenance, lest I should give occasion to my Parents to demand of
me the cause of my discontents, and thereby ingage me to use ambages or untruths to
cover them. But all this ended in an instant, one moment ariving whereon all these
respects stumbled, all honourable discourses ended, patience was lost, and my most
hidden secrets issued in publique; which was when there was spread a certain rumour
throughout the Town within a few dayes after, that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> had married in a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
neer adjoyning a Damzell of surpassing beauty, and of very Noble birth, although not
so rich as could deserve, by her preferment or dowrie, so worthie a husband: it was also
said that shee was named <hi>Luscinda,</hi> with many other things that hapned at their
Spousals worthy of admiration. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hearing <hi>Luscinda</hi> named did nothing else
but lift up his shoulders, bite his lip, bend his brows, and after a little while shed from
his eyes two floods of tears. But yet for all that <hi>Dorotea</hi> did not interrupt the file of
her History, saying, This dolefull news came to my hearing, and my heart, instead of
freezing thereat, was so inflamed with choler and rage, as I had well-nigh run out to the
streets, and with out-cries published the Deceit and Treason that was done to me; but
my furie was presently asswaged by the resolution which I made to doe what I put in
execution the very same night, and then I put on this habit which you see, being given
unto me by one of those that among us Country-folk are called Swains, who was my
fathers servant; to whom I disclosed all my misfortunes, and requested him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
me to the Citie where I understood my enemie sojourned, He, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
my boldnesse, perceiving me to have an inflexible resolution, made offer to
attend on me, as he said, unto the end of the world: And presently after I trussed up
in a pillow-bear a womans attire, some Money and Jewels, to prevent necessities that
might befall; and in the silence of night, without acquainting my treacherous maid
with my purpose, I issued out of my house, accompanied by my servant and many imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
and in that manner set on towards the Citie, and though I went on foot, was
yet born away flying by my desires, to come, if not time enough to hinder that which
was past, yet at least to demand of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> that he would tell me with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
or soul he had done it. I arrived where I wished within two dayes and a half;
and at the entry of the City I demanded where <hi>Luscinda</hi> her father dwelled? and he
of whom I first demanded the question answered me more then I desired to hear; hee
shewed me the house, and recounted to me all that befell at the daughters marriage,
being a thing so publique and known in the City, as men made meetings of purpose to
discourse thereof.</p>
                     <p>Hee said to me, that the very night wherein <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was espoused to <hi>Luscinda,</hi>
after she had given her consent to be his wife, she was instantly assailed by a terrible
accident that struck her into a Trance; and her Spouse approaching to unclapse her
bosome that shee might take the aire, found a paper folded in it, written with <hi>Luscinda's</hi>
own hand, wherein she said and declared, that shee could not be <hi>Don Fernando's</hi> wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was already <hi>Cardenio's,</hi> who was, as the man told me, a very principall Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:54746:80"/>
man of the same Citie; and that if shee had given her consent to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> it was
only done, because shee would not disobey her Parents; in conclusion hee told mee,
that the paper made also mention, how shee had a resolution to kill her selfe presently
after the marriage, and did also lay downe therein the motives shee had to doe it; all
which, as they say, was confirmed by a Ponyard that was found hidden about her, in her
apparell. Which <hi>Don Fernando</hi> perceiving, presuming that <hi>Luscinda</hi> did flout him, and
hold him in little account, hee set upon her ere shee was come to her selfe, and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to kill her with the very same Ponyard; and had done it, if her father and other
friends which were present, had not opposed themselves and hindred his determination.
Moreover, they reported that presently after <hi>Don Fernando</hi> absented himselfe from the
Citie, and that <hi>Luscinda</hi> turned not out of her agonie untill the next day, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to her parents how shee was verily Spouse to that <hi>Cardenio</hi> of whom wee spake
even now. I learned besides, that <hi>Cardenio,</hi> as it is rumor'd, was present at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and that as soone as hee saw her married, being a thing hee would never have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
departed out of the Citty in a desperate moode, but first left behinde him a
letter, wherein hee shewed at large the wrong <hi>Luscinda</hi> had done to him, and that hee
himself meant to goe to some place where people should never after hear of him.
All this was notorious, and publiquely bruited thorowout the Citty, and every one
spoke thereof, but most of all having very soone after understood that <hi>Luscinda</hi> was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from her Parents house and the Citie, for shee could not bee found in neyther of
both, for which her parents were almost beside themselves, not knowing what meanes
to use to finde her.</p>
                     <p>These news reduced my hopes againe to their ranks, and I esteemed it better to finde
<hi>Don Fernando</hi> unmarried then married, persuming that yet the gates of my remedy were
not wholly shut, I giving my selfe to understand that heaven had peradventure set that
impediment on the second marriage, to make him understand what hee ought to the
first; and to remember how hee was a Christian, and that hee was more oblieged to his
Soule then to humane respects. I revolved all these things in my minde, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
did yet comfort my selfe, by fayning large, yet languishing, hopes, to sustain that
life which I now doe so much abhor. And whilest I stayed thus in the Citie, ignorant
what I might doe, seeing I found not <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> I heard a Cryer goe about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
promising great rewards to any one that could finde mee out, giving signes of
the very age and apparell I wore: And I likewise heard it was bruited abroad, that the
Youth which came with mee, had caried mee away from my fathers house. A thing
that touched my soule very neerely, to view my credit so greatly wrak't, seeing that it
was not sufficient to have lost it by my coming away, without the addition of him with
whom I departed, being a subject so base and unworthy of my loftier thoughts. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard this crie, I departed out of the Citie with my servant; who even then began
to give tokens that he faultred in the fidelity hee had promised to me; and both of us
together entred the very same night into the most hidden parts of this Mountain, fearing
lest we might be found. But as it is commonly said, That one evill calls on another,
and that the end of one disaster is the beginning of a greater, so proved it with me; for
my good servant, untill then faithfull and trustie, rather incited by his own Villainy
then my Beauty, thought to have taken the benefit of the oportunity which these inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
places offered, and sollicited me of Love, with little shame and lesse fear of God,
or respect of my self: And now seeing that I answered his impudencies with severe
and reprehensive words, leaving the intreaties aside wherewithall he thought first to
have compast his will, he began to use his force: But just Heaven, which seldome or
never neglects the just mans assistance, did so favour my proceedings, as with my weak
forces and very little labour I threw him down a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eep Rock, and there I left him, I
know not whether alive or dead: And presently I entred in among these Mountains,
with more swiftnesse then my fear and wearinesse required, having therein no other
project or designe then to hide my self in them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> my father and others, which
by his intreaty and means sought for me every where.</p>
                     <p>Some moneths are past since my first comming here, where I found a Heard-man,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54746:80"/>
who carried me to a Village seated in the midest of these Rocks, wherein hee dwelled,
and entertained me, whom I have served as a Sheepheard ever since, procuring as much
as lay in me, to abide stil in the field, to cover these hairs which have now so unexpectedly
betraid me: Yet all my care and industry aviled not, seeing my Master came at last to the
notice that I was no man, but a woman, which was an occasion that the like evill
thought sprung in him, as before in my servant: And as fortune gives not alwais re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
for the difficulties which occur, I found neither Rock nor downfall to cool and
cure my Masters infirmitie, as I had done for my man; and therefore I accounted it a
lesse inconvenience to depart thence, and hide my self again among these Desarts, then
to adventure the tryall of my strength or reason with him: Therefore, as I say, I turned
to imbosk my self, and search out some place, where, without any encumbrance, I might
intreat Heaven with my sighs and tears, to have compassion on my mis-hap, and lend
me industry and favour, either to issue fortunately out of it, or else to die amid'st these
solitudes, not leaving any memory of a wretch, who hath ministred matter, although
not through her own default, that men may speak and murmur of her, both in her own
and in other Countries.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is, Sirs, the true relation of my Tragedie; see therefore now and
judge, whether the sighs you heard, the words to which you listened,
and the tears that gushed out at mine eyes, have not had sufficient
occasion to appear in greater abundance: and having considered
the quality of my disgrace, you shall perceive all comfort to be vain,
seeing the remedie thereof is impossible: Only I will request at
your hands one favour, which you ought and may easily grant, and
is, That you will addresse me unto some place, where I may live secure from the fear
and suspicion I have to be found by those which I know doe dayly travell in my pursuit:
for although I am sure that my Parents great affection toward me doth warrant me
to be kindely received and entertained by them; yet the shame is so great that possesseth
me, only to think that I shall not return to their presence in that state which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
as I account it far better to banish my self from their sight for ever, then once to
behold their face with the least suspicion that they again would behold mine, divorced
from that honestie which whilom my modest behaviour promised. Here shee ended,
and her face suddainly over-run by a lovely scarlet, perspicuously denoted the feeling
and bashfullnesse of her soul.</p>
                     <p>The audients of her sad storie, felt great motions both of pittie and admiration, for
her misfortunes: and although the Curate thought to comfort and counsell her forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
yet was hee prevented by <hi>Cardenio,</hi> who taking her first by the hand, said at last;
Ladie, thou art the beautifull <hi>Dorotea,</hi> daughter unto rich <hi>Cleonardo. Dorotea</hi> rested
admired when shee heard her fathers name, and saw of how little value he seemed who
had named him; for we have already recounted how raggedly <hi>Cardenio</hi> was clothed;
and therefore shee said unto him, And who art thou, friend, that knowest so well my
fathers name; for untill this hour (if I have not forgotten my self) I did not once
name him throughout the whole discourse of my unfortunate Tale? I am (answered
<pb facs="tcp:54746:81"/>
                        <hi>Cardenio</hi> the unluckie Knight, whom <hi>Luscinda</hi> (as thou saidst) affirmed to bee her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
I am the disastrous <hi>Cardenio,</hi> whom the wicked proceeding of him that hath
also brought thee to those termes wherein thou art, hath conducted mee to the state in
which I am, and thou maist behold ragged, naked, abandoned by all humane comfort;
and what is worse, void of sense; seeing I only enjoy it but at some few short times,
and that, when heaven pleaseth to lend it mee. I am hee <hi>Dorotea,</hi> that was present at
<hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> unreasonable wedding, and that heard the consent which <hi>Luscinda</hi> gave
him to bee his wife. I was hee that had not the courage to stay and see the end of her
trance, or what became of the paper found in her bosome; for my soule had not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
or sufferance to behold so many misfortunes at once, and therefore abandoned the
place and my patience together, and only left a Letter with mine Host, whom I intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to deliver it into <hi>Luscinda</hi> her owne hands, and then came into these Desarts, with
resolution to end in them my miserable life, which since that houre I have hated as my
most mortall Enemie: But Fortune hath not pleased to deprive mee of it, thinking it
sufficient to have impaired my wit, perhaps reserving me for the good successe befaln mee
now in finding of your selfe; for that being true (as I beleeve it is) which you have
here discoursed, peradventure it may have reserved yet better hap for us both in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters
then wee expect.</p>
                     <p>For presupposing that <hi>Luscinda</hi> cannot marry with <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> because shee is
mine, nor <hi>Don Fernando</hi> with her because yours; and that shee hath declared so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
the same, wee may well hope that heaven hath meanes to restore to every one that
which is his owne, seeing it yet consists in being not made away or annihilated. And
seeing this comfor remaines, not sprung from any very remote hope, nor founded on
idle surmises, I request thee faire Lady, to take another resolution in thine honourable
thought, seeing I meane to doe it in mine, and let us accomodate our selves to expect
better successe: For I doe vow unto thee by the faith of a Gentleman and <hi>Christian,</hi>
not to forsake thee, untill I see thee in <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> possession, and when I shall
not by reasons bee able to induce him to acknowledge how far hee rests indebted to thee
then will I use the liberty granted to mee as a Gentleman, and with just title challenge
him to the field, in respect of the wrong hee hath done unto thee; forgetting wholly
mine owne injuries, whose revenge I will leave to Heaven, that I may be able to right
yours on earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorotea</hi> rested wonderfully admired, having knowne and heard <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what competent thanks shee might returne him in satisfaction of his large offers,
shee cast her selfe downe at his feete to have kissed them, which <hi>Cardenio</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
and the Licentiat answered for both, praysing greatly <hi>Cardenioes</hi> discourse; and
chiefly intreated, prayed and counselled them, that they would goe with him to his
Village, where they might fit themselves with such things as they wanted, and also take
order how to search out <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> or carie <hi>Dorotea</hi> to her fathers house, or doe else
what they deemed most convenient. <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Dorotea</hi> gratified his courtesies, and
accepted the favour hee profferred. The Barbar also, who had stood all the while silent
and suspended, made them a pretty discourse, with as friendly an offer of himselfe, and
his service as Master Curate; and likewise did brieflie relate the occasion of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thither, with the extravagant kinde of madnesse which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had, and
how they expected now his Squires returne, whom they had sent to search for him.
<hi>Cardenio</hi> having heard him named, remembred presently, as in a dreame, the conflict
past betweene them both, and recounted it unto them, but could not in any wise call to
mind the occasion thereof.</p>
                     <p>By this time they heard one call for them, and knew by the voice, that it was <hi>Sancho
Panchaes,</hi> who because hee found them not in the place where hee had left them, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out for them as lowdly as hee might. They went to meete him, and demanding for
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hee answered, that hee found him all naked to his shyrt, leane, yellow,
almost dead for hunger, and sighing for his Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> and although he had told
him, how shee commanded him to repayre presently to <hi>Toboso,</hi> where shee expected
him, yet notwithstanding hee answered, That hee was determined never to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54746:81"/>
her Beautie, untill hee had done Feats that should make him worthy of her gracious
favour. And then the Squire affirmed if that humour passed on any farther, hee fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Lord would bee in danger never to become an Emperour, as hee was bound in
honour, no, nor a Cardinall, which was the least that could be expected of him.</p>
                     <p>The Licentiat bid him bee of good cheer, for they would bring him from thence
whether he would or no; and recounted to <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Dorotea,</hi> what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> remedie, or at least for the carrying him home to his house.
To that <hi>Dorotea</hi> answered, that shee would counterfeit the distressed Ladie better then
the Barber, and chiefly seeing she had apparrel wherewithall to act it most naturally:
And therefore desired them to leave to her charge the representing of all that which
should bee needfull for the atchieving of their Designe; for shee had read many books
of Knighthood, and knew well the stile that distressed Damzels used, when they reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
any favour of Knights Adventurous. And then need we nothing else, quoth the
Curate, but only to put our purpose presently in execution: For questionlesse good
successe turns on our side, seeing it hath so unexpectedly begun already to open the gates
of your remedy, and hath also facilitated for us that whereof we had most necessity in
this exigent. <hi>Dorotea</hi> took forthwith out of her Pillow-bear a whole Gown of very
rich stuff, and a short Mantle of another green stuff, and a Collar and many other rich
Jewels out of a Boxe, wherewithall she adorned her self in a trice so gorgeously, as
shee seemed a very rich and goodly Ladie: All which, and much more, shee had
brought with her, as shee said, from her house, to prevent what might happen, but never
had any use of them untill then. Her grace, gesture, and beauty liked them all extreamly,
and made them account <hi>Don Fernando</hi> to bee a man of little understanding, seeing
hee contemned such feature. But hee which was most of all admired was <hi>Sancho
Panca,</hi> because, as hee thought (and it was so indeed) that hee had not in all the dayes
of his life before seen so fair a creature; and he requested the Curate very seriously, to
tell him who that beautifull Ladie was? and what shee sought among those thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fares?
This fair Lady, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> answered the Curate, is (as if a man said nothing
shee is so great) Heir apparent by direct line of the mighty Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon,</hi>
and comes in the search of your Lord, to demand a boon of him, which is, that hee
will destroy and undoe a great wrong done unto her by a wicked Gyant; and through
the great fame which is spread over all <hi>Guinea</hi> of your Lords prowesse, this Princesse
is come to finde him out. A happy searcher, and a fortunate finding, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi>
and chiefly, if my Master bee so happy as to right that injury and redresse that wrong
by killing that, ô the mighty Lubber of a Gyant, whom you say! yes, hee will kill him,
I am very certain, if hee can once but meet him, and if hee bee not a Spirit; for my
Master hath no kinde of power over Spirits. But I must request one favour of you,
among others most earnestly, good Master Licentiat, and it is, That to the end my
Lord may not take an humbur of becoming a Cardinall, which is the thing I fear
most in this world) that you will give him counsell to marry this Princesse presently,
and by that means hee shal remain incapable of the dignity of a Cardinall, and will come
very easily by his Empire, and I to the end of my desires; for I have thought well of
the matter, and have found, that it is in no wise expedient that my Lord should become a
Cardinall; for I am wholy unfit for any Ecclesiasticall dignity, seeing I am a married
man: And therefore to trouble my self now with seeking of dispensations to enjoy
Church livings, having, as I have, both wife and children, were never to end: So that
all my good consists, in that my Lord doe marry this Princesse instantly, whose name
yet I know not; and therefore I have not said it. Shee is hight (quoth the Curate) the
Princesse <hi>Micomicona:</hi> for her Kingdome being called <hi>Micomicon,</hi> it is evident shee
must be termed so.</p>
                     <p>That is questionlesse, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I have known many to take their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and surname from the place of their birth, calling themselves <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala,
Iohn</hi> of <hi>Vbeda,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Valedolid;</hi> and perhaps in <hi>Guinea</hi> Princes
and Queens use the same custome, and call themselves by the names of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:82"/>
So I thinke quoth the Curate; and as touching your Masters marriage with her, I will
labour therein as much as lies in my power. Wherewithall <hi>Sancho</hi> remained as well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
as the Curate admired at his simplicitie, and to see how firmly hee had fixed in
his fantasie the very ravings of his Master, seeing hee did beleeve without doubt that his
Lord should become an Emperour. <hi>Dorotea</hi> in this space had gotten upon the Curates
Mule, and the Barber had somwhat better fitted the beard which hee made of the Oxes
tayle on his face, and did after intreat <hi>Sancho</hi> to guide them to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
was, and advertised him withall, that hee should in no wise take any notice of
the Curate or Barber, or confesse in any sort that hee knew them, for therein consisted
all the meanes of bringing <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to the minde to become an Emperour. Yet
<hi>Cardenio</hi> would not goe with them, fearing lest thereby <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might call to
minde their contention; and the Curate thinking also that his presence was not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
remayned with him, letting the others goe before, and these followed a far
off fayre and softlie on foote, and ere they departed, the Curate instructed <hi>Dorotea</hi>
anew, what shee should say, who bid him to feare nothing for shee would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
her part to his satisfaction, and as Bookes of Chivalrie required and laid
downe.</p>
                     <p>They travelled about three quarters of a league, as they espied the Knight, and at last
they discovered him among a number of intricate Rocks, all apparelled, but not armed,
and as soone as <hi>Dorotea</hi> beheld him, shee struck her Palfrey, her well-bearded Barber
following her; and as they approached <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Barber leaped lightly downe
from his Mule and ran towards <hi>Dorotea</hi> to take her downe betweene his armes, who
alighting went with a very good grace towards <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and kneeled before him.
And although hee strived to make her arise, yet shee remayning still on her knees,
spake to him in this manner: I will not arise from hence, thrice valorous and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Knight, untill your bountie and courtesie shall grant unto mee one Boone, which
shall much redound unto your honour and prize of your Person, and to the profit of
the most disconsolate and wronged Damzell that the Sunne hath ever seene. And if it
bee so, that the valour of your invincible Arme bee correspondent to the bruite of your
immortall same, you are obliged to succour this comfortlesse Wight, that comes
from lands so remote, to the sound of your famous name, searching you for to remedy
her mis-haps.</p>
                     <p>I will not answere you a word, faire Lady, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> nor heare a jot of
your affaire, untill you arise from the ground. I will not get up from hence, my Lord,
quoth the afflicted Lady, if first, of your wonted bountie, you doe not grant to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
I doe give and grant it, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> so that it bee not a thing that may
turn to the dammage or hindrance of my King, my Country, or of her that keeps the
key of my Heart and Liberty. It shall not turn to the dammage or hindrance of those
you have said, good Sir, replied the dolorous Damzel: and as shee was saying this
<hi>Sancho Panca</hi> rounded his Lord in the eare, saying softly to him, Sir, you may very
well grant the request she asketh, for it is a matter of nothing, it is only to kill a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Gyant, and she that demands it is the mightie Princesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> Queen of
the great Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Let her bee what shee will, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I will accomplish what I am bound, and my conscience shall inform
me comformable to the State I have professed. And then turning to the Damzell, hee
said, Let your great beauty arise; for I grant to you any boon which you shall please
to ask of me. Why then, quoth the Damzell, that which I demand is, That your mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
person come presently away with me, to the place where I shall carry you;
and doe likewise make me a promise, not to undertake any other Adventure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
untill you revenge me upon a Traytor, who hath, against all Laws both Divine
and Humane, usurped my Kingdome. I say that I grant you all that, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
and therefore, Lady, you may cast away from this day forward all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
that troubles you, and labour that your languishing and dismaied hopes may
recover again new strength and courage; for by the help of God, and that of mine
arme, you shall see your self shortly restored to your Kingdome, and enthronized in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54746:82"/>
the Chair of your ancient and great Estate, in despite and maugre the Traytors that
shall dare gainsay it: and therefore hands to the work; for they say that danger
alwayes follows delay. The distressed Damzell strove with much adoe to kisse his
hand. But <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who was a most accomplished Knight for courtesie,
would never condescend thereunto; but making her arise, hee imbraced her with great
kindnesse and respect; and commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and help him to
Arme himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> took down the Armes forthwith, which hung on a Tree like Trophies, and
searching the Gyrts, armed his Lord in a moment; who seeing himself Armed, said, Let
us in Gods name, depart from hence to assist this great Lady. The Barber kneeled all
this while, and could with much adoe dissemble his laughter, or keep on his Beard that
threatned still to fall off; with whose fall perhaps, they should all have remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bringing their good purpose to passe: And seeing the boon was granted, and noted
the dilligence wherewithall <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made himself ready to depart and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
the same: hee arose and took his Ladie by the hand; and both of them together
holp her upon her Mule; and presently after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> leaped on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and the
Barber got on his Beast, <hi>Sancho</hi> only remaining a foot; where he afresh renewed the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the losse of his gray Asse, with the want procured to him thereby. But all this
hee bore with very great patience, because hee supposed that his Lord was now in the
way, and next degree to bee an Emperour; for he made an infallible account that hee
would marry that Princesse, and at least bee King of <hi>Micomicon:</hi> But yet it grieved
him to think how that Kingdome was in the Country of black Moors; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Nation which should bee given to him for his Vassals should be all black: For
which difficultie his imagination coyned presently a good remedie; and hee discoursed
with himself in this manner. Why should I care though my Subjects be all black
Moors? is there any more to be done then to load them in a Ship and bring them into
<hi>Spain,</hi> where I may sell them, and receive the price of them in ready mony? and with
that money may I buy some Title or Office, wherein I may after live at mine ease all the
dayes of my life. No! but sleep, and have no wit nor abilitie to dispose of things; and to
sell thirty or ten thousand Vassals in the space that one would say, give me those straws.
I will dispatch them all; they shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lie the little with the great, or as I can best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the matter: And bee they ever so black, I will transform them into white or
yellow ones: come neer and see whether I cannot suck well my fingers ends. And
thus hee travailed so solicitous and glad, as hee quite forgot his pain of travailing a foot.
<hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate stood in the mean timebeholding all that passed from behinde
some Brambles, where they lay lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

to issue and joyn in company with them. But the Curate, who was an ingenious and
prompt plotter, devised instantly what was to bee done, that they might attain their
desire: Thus hee took out of his case a pair of Shears, and cut off <hi>Cardenio's</hi> Beard
therewithall in a trice, and then gave unto him to wear a riding Capouch which hee
himself had on, and a black Cloak; and himself walked in a Doublet and Hose: <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio,</hi>
thus attired, looked so unlik that he was before, as he would not have known
himself in a Looking-glasse. This being finished, and the others gone on before whilest
they disguised themselves, they sallied out with facilitie to the high way before <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
or his company; for the Rocks and many other bad passages did not permit
those that were a horse-back to make so speedie an end of their Journey, as they: and
having thorowly past the Mountain, they expected at the foot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his company, who when he appeared, the Curate looked on him very earnestly for a great
space, with inkling that he began to know him: And after hee had a good while beheld
him, hee ran towards him with his armes spread abroad, saying, In a good houre bee
the mirrour of all Knighthood found, and my noble country man <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the
<hi>Mancha;</hi> the flower and cream of Gentility; the shadow and remedie of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and the Quintescence of Knights Errant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and saying this, he held <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
his left thigh embraced. Who, admiring at that which hee heard that man to say and
doe, did also review him with attention, and finally knew him; and all amazed to see
<pb facs="tcp:54746:83"/>
him, made much adoe to alight; but the Curate would not permit him; wherefore
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, Good Master Licentiat permit me to alight; for it is in no sort
decent that I bee a horse-back, and so reverend a person as you goe on foot. I will never
consent thereunto, quoth the Curate, your highnesse must needs stay on horse-back,
seeing that thereon you are accustomed to archieve the greatest feats of Chivalry and
Adventures which were ever seen in our age. For it shall suffice me, who am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Priest, to get up behinde some one of these other Gentlemen that ride in your
company, if they will not take it in bad part; yes, and I will make account that I ride
on <hi>Pegasas,</hi> or the <hi>Zebra [A strange Beast of Affirick that travails very swiftly]</hi> of the
famous Moor <hi>Muzaraque,</hi> who lies yet inchanted in the steep Rock of <hi>Culema,</hi> neer
unto <hi>Alcala</hi> of <hi>Henares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely I did not think upon it, good Master Licentiat, answered <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> yet
I presume my Lady the Princesse will bee well appaid for my sake to command her
Squire to lend you the use of his saddle, and to get up himself on the crupper, if so it
bee that the Beast will bear double. Yes that it will, said the Princesse, for ought I
know; and likewise I am sure it will not bee necessary to command my Squire
to alight, for hee is of himself so courteous and courtly, as hee will in no wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
that an Ecclesiasticall man should goe on foot, when hee may help him to a
horse.</p>
                     <p>That is most certain, quoth the Barber: and saying so he alighted, and intreated
the Curate to take the saddle; to which courtesie he did easily condescend. But by
evill fortune, as the Barber thought to leap up behinde him, the Mule which was in
effect a hired one (and that is sufficient to say it was unhappy) did lift a little her hinder
quarters, and bestowed two or three flings on the aire, which had they hit on Master
<hi>Nicholas</hi> his breast or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te, hee would have bequeathed the quest of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> upon
the Divell: But notwithstanding the Barber was so affrighted, as hee fell on the
ground with so little heed of his beard, as it fell quite off, and lay spread upon the
ground; and perceiving himself without it, he ehad no other shift, but to cover his face
with both his hands, and complain, that all his cheek-teeth were strucken out. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
beholding such a great sheaf of a beard faln away, without jaw or blood, from
the face, he said; I vow this is one of the greatest miracles that ever I saw in my life;
it hath taken and pluckt away his beard as smoothly as if it were done of purpose. The
Curate beholding the danger which their invention was like to incur, if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
went forthwith, and taking up the beard, came to Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> that lay still
playing, and with one push bringing his head towards his own breast, he set it on again,
murmuring the while over him certain words, which he said were a certain prayer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the setting on of faln beards, as they should soon perceive: And so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
set it on handsomely, the Squire remained as well bearded and whole as ever
he was in his life: Whereat <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rested marvellously admired, and requested
the Curate to teach him that prayer when they were at leisure: For hee supposed that
the virtue thereof extended it self farther then to the fastning on of beards, since it was
manifest that the place whence the beard was torne must have remained without flesh,
wounded and ill dight; and seeing it cured all, it must of force serve for more then the
beard. It is true, replyed Master Curate; and then promised to instruct him with the
secret, with the first oportunity that was presented.</p>
                     <p>Then they agreed that the Curate should ride first on the Mule, and after him the
other two, each one by turns, untill they arived to the Inn, which was about some two
leagues thence. Three being thus mounted, to wit, <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Princesse, and
Curate; and the other three on foot, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> the Barber, and <hi>Sancho Panca. Don-Quixote</hi>
said to the Damzell; Madam! let me intreat your Highnesse to lead me the
way that most pleaseth you. And before she could answer, the Licenciat said, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
what Kingdome would you travail? is it by fortune towards that of <hi>Mico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micon?</hi>
I suppose it should be thitherwards, or else I know but little of Kingdoms.
She, who knew very well the Curates meaning, and was her self no Babe, answered,
saying, Yes Sir, my way lies towards that Kingdome. If it be so, quoth the Curate,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54746:83"/>
you must passe through the Village where I dwell, and from thence direct your
course twards <hi>Cartagena,</hi> where you may luckily embarke your selves. And if you have
a prosperous winde, and a quiet and calme Sea, you may come within the space of nine
yeeres to the sight of the Lake <hi>Meona,</hi> I meane <hi>Meolidas,</hi> which stands on this side of
your highnesse Kingdome some hundred dayes journey or more. I take you to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
good Sir quoth shee, for it is not yet fully two yeeres since I departed from
thence, and truly I never almost had any faire weather, and yet notwithstanding I have
arived and come to see that which I so much longed for, to wit, the presence of the
worthie <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> whose renowne came to my notice as soone as
I touched the earth of Spayne with my foote, and moved mee to search for him, to
commend my self to his courtesie, and commit the Justice of my cause to the valour of
his invincible Arme.</p>
                     <p>No more quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I cannot abide to heare my selfe praysed; for I am a
sworne enemy of all adulation: And although this bee not such, yet notwithstanding
the like Discourses doe offend my chaste eares. What I can say to you faire Princesse
is; that whether I have valour or not, that which I have or have not shall bee imployed
in your service, even to the very losse of my life. And so omitting that till this time, let
me intreat good Master Licentiat to tell mee the occasion which hath brought him here
to these quarters so alone, without attendants, and so sleightly attyred, as it strikes mee
in no little admiration? To this I will answere with brevitic quoth the Curate; You
shall understand that Master <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Barber, our very good friend, and my self, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
towards <hi>Sivill,</hi> to recover certaine summes of money which a kinsman of mine,
who hath dwelt these many yeeres in the <hi>Indies</hi> hath sent unto mee; the summe is not a
little one, for it surmounted seventy thousand Rials of eight, all of good weight, see if
it was not a rich gift; and passing yesterday through this way, wee were set upon by
foure Robbers which dispoyled us of all, even to our very beards, and that in such sort,
as the Barber was forced to set on a counterfeit one, and this young man that goeth here
with us (meaning <hi>Cardenio)</hi> was transformed by them anew: &amp; the best of it is, that it is
publickly bruited about all this commark, that those which surprized us were Gally-slaves
who were set at liberty, as is reported, much about this same place, by so valiant a Knight
as in despight of the Commissary and the guard hee freed them all. And questionlesse
hee either was wood, or else as great a knave as themselves, or some one that wanted
both Soule and Conscience, seeing hee let slip the Wolves amidst the Sheepe, the Foxe
among the Hens, and Files hard by Honey, and did frustrate Justice, rebell against his
naturall Lord and King; for hee did so by oppugning his just commandements, and
hath deprived the Gallies of their feet, and set all the <hi>Holy brotherhood</hi> in an uproare,
which hath reposed these many yeeres past. And finally would doe an Act, by which
hee should lose his Soule, and yet not gaine his Bodie. <hi>Sancho</hi> had rehearsed to the
Curate and Barbar the Adventure of the Slaves, which his Lord had accomplished
with such glorie; and therefore the Curate did use this vehemencie as hee repeated it,
to see what <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would say or doe, whose colour changed at every word,
and durst not confesse that hee was himselfe the deliverer of that good People:
and these quoth the Curate, were they that have robbed us: And God of his infinite
Mercy pardon him who hindred their going to receive the punishment they had so
well deserved.</p>

with a Rosarie or beades of inserted People, sorrowfull and unfortunate, and I did for
them that which my Religion exacts: as for the rest, let them verifie it elsewhere, and

I will promptly performe your Will herein, answered <hi>Dorotea,</hi> if it will not

To which <hi>Dorotea</hi> answered thus, Bee then attentive to my Relation. Scarce had shee

                     <p>First of all, good Sirs, I would have you note that I am called; And here shee stood
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54746:84"/>
uspended a while by reason shee had forgotten the name that the Curate had
given unto her; but hee presently occur'd to her succour, understanding the cause, and
said; it is no wonder great Lady, that you bee troubled and stagger whil'st you recount
your misfortunes, seeing it is the ordinary custome of Disasters to deprive those whom
they torment, and distract their memorie in such sort, as they cannot remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
even of their owne very names; as now it proves done in your Highnesse, which
forgets it selfe, that you are called the Princesse <hi>Micomicona,</hi> lawfull inheretrix
of the great Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon:</hi> And with this Note, you may easily reduce
into your dolefull Memory all that which you shall please to rehearse.</p>
                     <p>It is very true (quoth the Damzell) and from henceforth I thinke it will not bee
needfull to prompt mee any more, for I will arive into a safe Port, with the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my authentique History: which is, that my father, who was called the wise <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macrio,</hi>
was very expert in that which was called art Magick, and hee knew by his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that my Mother who was called Queene <hi>Xaramilla,</hi> should die before hee decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and that hee should also passe from this life within a while after, and leave mee an
Orphan: but hee was wont to say, how that did not afflict his minde so much, as that
hee was very certaine, that a huge Giant, Lord of a great Island neere unto my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
called <hi>Pandafilando of the duskie sight;</hi> because, although his Eyes stood in their
right places, yet doe they still looke a squint, which hee doth to terrifie the beholders:
I say that my Father knew that this Giant, when hee should heare of his death, would
passe with a maine power into my Land and deprive mee thereof, not leaving mee the
least Village wherein I might hide my head. Yet might all this bee excused, it I would
marry with him; but as hee found out by his Science, hee knew I would never condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
thereunto, or incline mine affection to so unequall a Marriage. And herein hee
said nothing but truth: for it never past once my thought to espouse that Giant, nor
with any other, were hee ever so unreasonable, and great and mighty. My Father like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
added then, that after his death, I should see <hi>Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that I should in no wise stand to my defence, for that would prove my destruction:
but leaving to him the Kingdome freely without troubles, if I meant to excuse mine
owne death, and the totall ruine of my good and loyall Subjects: for it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to defend my self from the divellish force of the Gyant; I should presently
direct my course towards Spain, where I should finde a redresse of my harmes, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
with a Knight Errant, whose fame should extend it self much about that
time thorowout that Kingdome, and his name should be, if I forget not my self, <hi>Don
Acote</hi> or <hi>Don Gigote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ladie, you would say <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> or as he is called by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
name, <hi>The Knight of the Ill-favoured face.</hi> You have reason, replyed <hi>Dorotea:</hi>
hee said moreover, that he should be high of stature, have a withered face; and that on
the right side, a little under the left shoulder or thereabouts, he should have a tawny
spot with certain hairs like to bristles. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hearing this said to his Squire,
Hold my horse here Sonne <hi>Sancho,</hi> and help me to take off mine apparrell; for I will
see whether I be the Knight of whom the wise King hath prophesied. Why would
you now put off your clothes, quoth <hi>Dorotea?</hi> To see whether I have that spot which
your father mentioned, answered <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> You need not undoe your apparrell
for that purpose, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I know already that you have a spot with the tokens
she named, on the very ridges of your back, and argues you to be a very strong man.
That is sufficient, quoth <hi>Dorotea:</hi> for we must not look too neer, or be over-curious
in our friends affairs; and whether it be on the shoulder or ridge of the back, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
but little; for the substance consists only in having such a mark, and not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it shall be, seeing all is one and the self-same flesh; and doubtlesly my good
father did aim well at all; and I likewise in commending my self to <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>
for surely he is the man of whom my father spoke, seeing the signes of his face agree
with those of the great renown that is spread abroad of this Knight, not only in <hi>Spain,</hi>
but also in <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> for I had no sooner landed in <hi>Osuna,</hi> when I heard so many of
his prowesses recounted, as my minde gave me presently that he was the man in whose
<pb facs="tcp:54746:85"/>
search I travailed. But how did you land in <hi>Osuna,</hi> good Madam, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
seeing it is no Sea Town? Marrie, Sir, quoth the Curate, anticipating <hi>Dorotea's</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
the Princesse would say that after she had landed in <hi>Malaga,</hi> but the first place
wherein she heard tidings of you was at <hi>Osuna.</hi> So I would have said, quoth <hi>Dorotea.</hi>
And it may be very well, quoth the Curate; and I desire your Majestie to continue
your discourse. There needs no farther continuation, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> but that finally
my Fortune hath been so favourable in finding of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as I doe already hold
and account my self for Queen and Lady of all mine Estate, seeing that he, of his wonted
bountie and mignificence, hath promised me the boon, to accompanie me wheresoever
I shall guide him, which shall be to none other place, then to set him before <hi>Pandafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando
of the duskie fight,</hi> to the end you may slay him, and restore me to that which he
hath so wrongfully usurped; for all will succeed in the twinkling of an eye, as the wise
<hi>Tinacrio</hi> my good father hath already foretold; who said moreover, and also left it
written in <hi>Chaldaicall</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> charactars (for I cannot read them) that if the Knight
of the Prophecie, after having beheaded the Gyant, would take me to wife, that I
should in no sort refuse him, but instantly admit him for my Spouse, make him at once
possessor of my self and my Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>What thinkest thou of this, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> then, when he heard
her say so? How likest thou this poynt? Did not I tell thee thus much before? See
now, whether we have not a Kingdome to command, and a Queen whom we may
marry, I swear as much, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> a pox on the knave that will not marry as soon
as Master <hi>Pundahilado</hi> his winde-pipes are cut. Mount then, and see whether the
Queen be ill or no: I would to God all the Fleas of my bed were turned to be such.
And saying so, he gave two or three friskles in the air, with very great signes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and presently went to <hi>Dorotea;</hi> and taking her Mule by the bridle, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
it, and laying himself down on his knees before her, requested her very submissively
to give him her hands to kisse them, in signe that he received her for his Queen and
Ladie. Which of the beholders could abstain from laughter, perceiving the Masters
madnesse and the Servants simplicity? To be brief, <hi>Dorotea</hi> must needs give them unto
him, and promised to make him a great Lord in her Kingdome, when Heaven became
so propitious to her, as to let her once recover and possesse it peaceably. And <hi>Sancho</hi>
returned her thanks, with such words as made them all laugh anew.</p>
                     <p>This is my Historie, noble Sirs, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> whereof only rests untold, That
none of all the Train which I brought out of my Kingdome to attend on me, is now
extant but this well-bearded Squire; for all of them were drowned in a great storm
that over-took us in the very sight of Harbor, whence he and I escaped and
came to land by the help of two planks, on which we laid hold almost by miracle, as
also the whole discourse and mistery of my life seems none other then a miracle, as you
might have noted: And if in any part of the relation I have exceeded, or not observed
a due <hi>decorum,</hi> you must impute it to that which Master Licentiat said to the first of
my History, that continuall pains and afflictions of minde deprives them that suffer the
like of their memory. That shall not hinder me (O high and valourous Ladie) quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> from enduring as many as I shall suffer in your service, be they never so
great or difficult: And therefore I doe now ratifie and confirm the promise I have
made, and doe swear to goe with you to the end of the world, untill I finde out your
fierce enemy, whose proud head I mean to slice off by the help of God and my valorous
arme, with the edge of this (I will not say a good) Sword; thanks be to <hi>Gines</hi> of <hi>Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte</hi>
which took away mine own: this he said murmuring to himself, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
saying, And after I have cut it off, and left you peaceably in the possession of
your state, it shall rest in your own will to dispose of your person as you like best. For
as long as I shall have my memory possessed, and my will captived, and my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yeelded to her, I will say no more; it is not possible that ever I may induce my self
to marry any other although she were a <hi>Phoenix.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had said last of all, of not marrying, disliked <hi>Sancho</hi> so
much, as lifting his voyce with great anger, he said; I vow and swear by my self, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54746:85"/>
you are not in your right wits, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for how is it possible that you can
call the matter, of contracting so high a Princesse as this is, in doubt? Doe you think
that Fortune will offer you at every corners end the like hap of this which is now proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
is my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> perhaps more beautifull? No certainly! nor half so
fair: nay I am rather about to say, that shee comes not to her shoe that is here
present.</p>
                     <p>In an ill hour shall I arrive to possesse that unfortunate Earldome which I expect,
if you goe thus seeking for Mushrubs at the bottome of the Sea: Marry, marry your
self presently; the Divell take you for me, and take that Kingdome comes into your
hands, and being a King, make me presently a Marquesse or Admirall, and instantly
after let the Divell take all if hee pleaseth. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who heard such blasphemies
spoken against his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> could not bear them any longer: and therefore lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Javeling without speaking any word to <hi>Sancho,</hi> gave him therewithall two
such blows, as he over-threw him to the earth: and had not <hi>Dorotea</hi> cried to him, to
hold his hand, he had doubtlesly slain him in the place.</p>
                     <p>Thinkest thou (quoth he after a while) base Peasant, that I shall have alwaies leisure
and disposition to thrust my hand into my pouch, and that there be nothing else but
thou erring, and I pardoning? And doest not thou think of it (excommunicated
Rascall) for certainly thou art excommunicated, seeing thou hast talked so broadly of
the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea?</hi> And doest not thou know, base Slave, Vagabond, that if it were
not for the valour shee infuseth into mine arme, that I should not have sufficient forces
to kill a Flea? Say, scoffer with the Vipers tongue, who doest thou think hath gained
this Kingdome, and cut the head of this Gyant, and made thee a Marquesse (for I
give all this for done already, and for a matter ended and judged) but the worths and
valour of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> using mine arme as the instrument of her act? She fights under
my person, and overcomes in me: And I live and breath in her, and from her I hold
my life and being. O whorson Villain, how ungratefull art thou, that seest thy self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
out from the dust of the earth, to be a Noble-man; and yet doest repay so great a
benefit with detracting the person that bestowed it on thee?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was not so sore hurt, but that he could hear all his Masters reasons very well:
wherefore arising somewhat hastily, hee ran behinde <hi>Doretea</hi> her Palfray, and from
thence said to his Lord, Tell me Sir, if you be not determined to marry with this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
it is most cleer that the Kingdome shall not bee yours: and if it be not, what
favours can you bee able to doe to me? it is of this that I complain me: Marrie your
self one for one with this Princesse, now that we have her here, as it were rained to us
down from Heaven, and you may after turn to my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for I think there bee
Kings in the World that keep Lemmans. As for beauty, I will not intermeddle; for
if I must say the truth, each of both is very fair, although I have never seen the Lady
<hi>Dulcinea.</hi> How! hast thou not seen her blasphemous Traytor, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
as if thou didest but even now bring me a message from her? I say, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I
have not seen her so leisurely, as I might particularly note her beautie and good parts
one by one, but yet in a clap as I saw them, they liked me very well. I doe excuse thee
now, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and pardon me the displeasure which I have given unto thee,
for the first motions are not in our hands. I see that well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and that is the
reason why talk is in me of one of those first motions: And I cannot omit to speake
once at least, that which comes to my tongue. For all that <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
see well what thou speakest; for, <hi>the earthen Pitcher goes so oft to the water.</hi> I will say
no more.</p>
                     <p>Well then, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> God is in heaven, who seeth all these guiles, and shall
be one day Judge of him that sinns most; of me in not speaking well, or of you by not
doing well. Let there be no more, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> but run <hi>Sancho,</hi> and kisse your Lords
hand, and ask him forgivenesse, and from henceforth take more heed how you praise
or dispraise any body, and speak no ill of that Lady <hi>Toboso,</hi> whom I doe not know
otherwise then to doe her service; and have confidence in God, for thou shalt not
want a Lordship wherein thou mayest live like a King. <hi>Sancho</hi> went with his head
<pb facs="tcp:54746:86"/>
hanging downeward, and demanded his Lords hand, which hee gave unto him with a
grave countenance, and after hee hed kissed it, hee gave him his blessing and said to him,
that hee had somwhat to say unto him, and therefore bad him to come somewhat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that hee might speake unto him. <hi>Sancho</hi> obeyed, and both of them going a little
aside, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said unto him, I have not had leisure after thy comming, to demand
of thee in particular, concerning the Ambassage that thou carriedst, and the answere
that thou broughtest back; and therefore now Fortune lends us some oportunitie
and leisure, doe not denie mee the happiness which thou mayest give mee by thy
good newes.</p>
                     <p>Demand what you please quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I will answere you, and I request you
good my Lord, that you bee not from henceforth so wrathfull. Why dost thou say so
<hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> I say it replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> because that these blowes which
you bestowed now, were rather given in revenge of the dissention which the Devill stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
between us two the other night, then for any thing I said against my Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi>
whom I doe honor and reverence as a relike, although she be none, only because shee is
yours. I pray thee good <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> fall not again into those discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for they offend me. I did pardon thee then, and thou knowest that a new offence
must have a new penance.</p>
                     <p>As they talked thus, they espied a Gallant coming towards them, riding on an Asse,
and when hee drew neere, hee seemed to bee an AEgyptian; but <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who
whensoever hee met any Asses, followed them with his eyes and his heart, as one that
thought still on his owne; hee had scarce eyed him, when hee knew that it was <hi>Gines</hi> of
<hi>Passamonte,</hi> and by the looke of the AEgyptian, found out the fleece of his Asse, as in
truth it was; for <hi>Gines</hi> came riding on his gray Asse, who to the end hee might not bee
knowne, and also have commodity to sell his beast, attyred himselfe like an AEgyptian,
whose language and many others hee could speake as well as if they were his mother
tongue. <hi>Sancho</hi> saw him and knew him; and scarce had hee seene and taken notice of
him, when hee cryed out aloud. Ah theese <hi>Ginesillo,</hi> leave my goods behinde thee, set
my life loose, and doe not intermeddle with my ease. Leave mine Asse, leave my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
flie Villane, absent thy selfe thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, and abandon that which is none of thine. He
needed not to have used so many words and frumps, for <hi>Gines</hi> leaped downe at the very
first, and beginning a Trot that seemed rather to bee a Gallop, hee absented himselfe
and fledde farre enough from them, in a moment. <hi>Sancho</hi> went then to his Asse,
and imbracing him said, How hast thou done hitherto, my Darling and Treasure, gray
Asse of mine Eyes, and my deerest Companion? and with that stroked and kissed
him as if it were a reasonable creature. The Asse held his peace, and permitted <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
to kisse and cherish him without answering a Word. All the rest arived, and
congratulated with <hi>Sancho</hi> for the finding of his Asse, but chiefely <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
who said unto him, that notwithstanding that hee found his Asse, yet would not hee
therefore annull his Warrant for the three Colts, for which <hi>Sancho</hi> returned him very
great thanks.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they two travelled together discoursing thus, the Curate said to <hi>Dorotea,</hi>
that shee had very discreetly discharged her selfe, as well in the Historie, as in her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie
and immitation thereof, to the phrase and conceits of Bookes of Knighthood:
Shee answered, That shee did oft times reade bookes of that subject, but that shee
knew not where the Provinces lay, nor Sea-ports, and therefore did only say at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that shee had landed in <hi>Osuna.</hi> I knew it was so quoth the Curate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I said what you heard, wherewithall the matter was souldered. But is it not a
marveilous thing to see with what facilitie the unfortunate Gentleman beleeves all these
inventions and lies, only because they beare the stile and manner of the follies laid down
in his bookes? It is quoth <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and that so rare and beyond all conceite, as I
beleeve, if the like were to bee invented, scarce could the sharpest wits devise such
another.</p>
                     <p>There is yet quoth the Curate, as marvellous a matter as that: for leaving apart the
simplicities which this good Gentleman speakes concerning his frenzie, if you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54746:86"/>
with him of any other subject whatsoever, he will discourse on it with an excellent
method, and shew himself to have a cleer and pleasing understanding: So that if he be
not touched by matters of Chivalry, there is no man but will deem him to be of a sound
and excellent Judgement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> on the other side prosecuted his conversing with his Squire whilest the
others talked together; and said to <hi>Sancho;</hi> Let us two, friend <hi>Pancha,</hi> forget old
injuries, and say unto me now, without any rancour or anger, Where? how? and
when didest thou finde my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea?</hi> What did shee when thou camest? What
said'st thou to her? What answered she? What countenance shewed she as she read
my Letter? And who writ it out fairly for thee? And every other thing that thou
shalt think worthy of notice in this affair to be demanded or answered, without either
addition or lying, or soothing adulation: and on the other side doe not abbreviate it,
lest thou shouldest defraud me thereby of expected delight. Sir, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi>
if I must say the truth, none copied out the Letter for me; for I carried no Letter at
all.</p>
                     <p>Thou sayest true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for I found the Tablets wherein it was written,
with my self, two dayes after thy departure, which did grieve me exceedingly, because
I knew not what thou wouldest doe, when thou didest perceive the want of the Letter;
and I alwaies made full account, that thou wouldest return again from the place where
thou shouldest first misse it. I had done so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I had not borne it away in
memory, when you read it to me, in such sort, as I said it to a Cleark of a Verstrie, who
did copie it out of my understanding, so poynt by poynt, as he said that he never in all
the dayes of his life, although he had read many a Letter of excommunication, read or
seen so fine a Letter as it was. And doest thou hold it yet in memory <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> for after I gave it, seeing it served for none other purpose, I did
willingly forget it: And if I remember any thing, it is that of the <hi>mouldy,</hi> I would say
<hi>Soveraign Ladie;</hi> and the end, <hi>Yours untill death, The Knight of the Ill-favoured
face:</hi> and I put between these two things in the Letter three hundred <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi>
and <hi>Sweet-eyes.</hi>

                        </gap> this liketh me well, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> therefore say on; thou ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived'st;
and what was that Queen of Beauty doing then? I dare
say that thou foundest her threading of Pearls, or imbroydering some
curious Device, with Venice gold, for me her captive Knight. No
that I did not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but winnowing two bushels of Wheat
in the yard of her house.</p>
                     <p>Why then, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou mayest make account that
each corne of that wheat was a grain of Pearl, seeing they were touched by her delicate
hand. And friend, didest thou note well what the Wheat was, whether of the best or
ordinarie? It was not but red, said <hi>Sancho.</hi> Well then, I assure thee, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
that being sifted by her hands, it must needs make very fair bread, and white.
But passe forward: When thou didest deliver my Letter, did she kisse it? Did she
set it on her head? Did she use any ceremony worthy of such a Letter? Or what did
she? When I went to give it unto her, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> she was holding up of her armes
with a good quantity of Wheat that shee had in her Sieve; and therefore said unto me;
<pb facs="tcp:54746:87"/>
Friend, lay down that Letter there on the Sack; for I cannot read it untill I have win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed
all that is here. O discreet Ladie, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> she surely did that, because
she might read it at leisure, and recreate her self therewithall. Forward, <hi>Sancho:</hi> And
as long as she was thus busied, what discourses passed she with thee? What did she
demand of thee concerning me? And thou, what didest thou answer? Say all, good
<hi>Sancho,</hi> say all; recount to me every particularity, and let not the least immunity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Ink-horn.</p>
                     <p>Shee demanded nothing of mee quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I recounted unto her the state I
had left you in for her sake, doing of penance, all naked from the gyrdle upward among
these Rocks, like a bruit Beast, sleeping on the ground, and eating your bread without
Table-cloathes, and that you never combed your Beard, but was weeping and cursing
your fortune. There thou saidst ill (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for I doe not curse my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but rather blesse it, and will blesse it as long as I shall live, seeing it hath made me
worthy to merit the love of so high a Lady as <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso.</hi> Shee is in good faith
so high answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> as shee surpasseth mee almost by a whole cubit. Why how
now <hi>Sancho</hi> said the Knight, hast thou measured thy selfe with her? I did measure my
selfe with her in this manner replyed <hi>Sancho;</hi> that comming over to helpe her to lift up
a sack of Wheate on an Asse, wee joyned so neere, as I well perceived that shee was
more then a great spanne higher then my selfe. That is true quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> but
thinkest thou not that the talenesse of her extended stature is adorned with a thousand
millions of graces and indowments of the soule? But <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou canst not denie me
one thing, when thou didst thus approach her, didst thou not feele a most odoriferous
smell, an aromaticall flagrancy, an—I cannot tell what, so pleasing, as I know not
how to terme it? I say such a sent, as if thou wert in some curious Persumers shoppe?
That which I know, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> is, that I felt a little unfavorie sent, somwhat ramish
and man-like, and I thinke the reason was, because shee had sweat a little, doing of
that exercise. It was not so (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but either thou had'st the mur, or else
didest smell thy self; for I know very well how that Rose among Thorns doth sent,
that Lillie of the Field, and that chosen Amber. It may well be, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> as you have
said; for I have had many times such a smell, as me thought the Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> had
then: and though shee smel'd too, it were no marvell; for one Divell is like
another.</p>
                     <p>And well (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) see here, she hath sifted her corne, and sent it to
the Mill. What did shee after shee had read the Letter? The Letter, said <hi>Sancho:</hi> shee
read it not; for she said she could neither read nor write; and therefore shee tore it
into small pieces, and would have no man to read it, lest those of the Village should
know her secrets, and said, that what I had told her by word of mouth of your love and
extraordinary penance, which you remained doing for her sake, was sufficient. And
finally, she concluded, commanding me to say unto you, that shee had her commended
unto you, and that she remained with greater desire to see you then to write unto you:
and therefore she requested and willed you, as you tendred her affection, that presently
upon sight hereof you should abandon these shrubbie Groves, leave off your Frenzie,
and take presently the way of <hi>Toboso,</hi> if some matter of greater importance did not
occur; for she had very great desire to see and talk with you. She laughed heartily
when I told her that you named your self <hi>The Knigh of the Ill-favoured face.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
for her, whether the beaten <hi>Biscaine</hi> came there? and shee answered, that he
did, and affirmed withall, that he was a very honest man. I asked also for the Gally-Slaves;
but she told me, that shee had seen none of them as yet.</p>
                     <p>All goes well till this, said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> But tell me, I pray thee, What Jewell
did she bestow on thee at thy departure, for reward of the news thou carried'st unto
her of me? For it is an usuall and ancient custome among Knights and Ladies Errant,
to bestow on Squires, Damzels, or Dwafs, which bring them any good tidings of
their Ladies, or Servants, some rich Jewell as a reward and thanks of their welcome
news.</p>
                     <p>It may well be, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I hold it for a very laudible custome; but I think
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54746:87"/>
it was only used in times past; for I think the manner of this our age is only to give a
piece of bread and cheese; for this was all that my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> bestowed on me, and
that over the Yard walls when I took my leave with her: And in signe thereof (well
fare all good tokens) the cheese was made of Sheeps Milk. She is marvellous liberall,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and if she gave thee not a Jewell of gold, it was, without doubt,
because she had none then about her; <hi>But it is not lost that comes at last.</hi> I will see her,
and then all things shall be amended. Knowest thou, <hi>Sancho,</hi> whereat I wonder? it is
at this sodain return: for it seems to me thou wast gone, and hast come back again in
the aire; for thou hast been away but a little more then three dayes, <hi>Toboso</hi> being more
then thirty leagues from hence: And therefore I doe believe that the wise Inchanter
who takes care of mine Affairs, and is my friend (for there is such a one of force, and
there must be, under pain that I else should not be a good Knight Errant) I say, I
verily think that wise man holp thee to trample unawares of thy self: for there are wise
men of that condition which will take a Knight Errant sleeping in his bed; and without
knowing how or in what manner, hee will wake the next day a thousand leagues from
that place where hee fell asleep: And were it not for this, Knights Errant could not
succour one another in their most dangerous exigents, as they doe now at every step.
For it oft-times befalls, that a Knight is fighting in the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> with
some divellish <hi>Fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o,</hi> some dreadfull shaddow, or fierce Knight, where he is like to
have the worst; and in this poynt of death, when he least expects it, there appears
there on the top of a Cloud, or riding in a Chariot of fire, another Knight his friend,
who was but even then in <hi>England,</hi> and helps him, and delivers him from death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
again that night to his own lodging, where he Sups with a very good appetite; and
yet for all that, is there wont to bee two or three thousand leagues from the one to the
other Countrey. All which is compassed by the industrie and wisedome of those skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Inchanters that take care of the said valorous Knights.</p>
                     <p>So that, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am not hard of belief in giving thee credit, that thou hast gone
and returned in so short a time from this place to <hi>Toboso,</hi> seeing, as I have said, some
wise man my friend hath (belike) transported thee thither by stealth, and unaware of
thy self. I easily think it, replyed <hi>Sancho;</hi> for <hi>Rozinante</hi> travailed, in good faith, as
lustily as if he were an Aegyptians Asse, with Quick-silver in his ears. And thinkest
thou not, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that he had not Quick-silver in his eares? yes, and a
legion of Devills also to help it, who are folk that doe travail and make others goe as
much as they list without any wearinesse.</p>
                     <p>But leaving all this apart, what is thine opinion that I should doe now, concerning
my Ladies commandement, to goe and see her? for although I know that I am bound
to obey her behests; yet doe I finde my self disabled at this time to accomplish them,
by reason of the grant I have made to the Princesse that comes with us, and the Law
of Armes doth compell me to accomplish my word rather then my will: on the one
side I am assaulted and urged by a desire to goe and see my Ladie; on the other, my
promised faith, and the glory I shall winne in this enterprize, doe incite and call me
away. But that which I resolve to doe, is to travaill with all speed that I may quickly
arive to the place where that Giant is, and will cut off his head at my coming: and
when I have peaceably installed the Princesse in her Kingdome, will presently return
to see the light that doth lighten my senses; to whom I will yield such forcible reasons
of my so long absence, as she shall easily condescend to excuse my stay, seeing all doth
redound to her glory and fame: For all that I have gained, doe win, or shall hereafter
atchieve by force of Armes in this life, proceeds wholy from the gracious favour she
pleaseth to bestow upon me, and my being hers.</p>
                     <p>O God! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I perceive that you are greatly diseased in the pate. I pray
you Sir, tell me whether you mean to goe this long voyage for nought, and let slip and
lose so rich and so noble a preferment as this; where the dowrie is a Kingdome, which
is in good faith, as I have heard say, twenty thousand leagues in compasse, and most
plentifully stored with all things necessary for the susteining of humane life; and that
it is greater then <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Castile</hi> joyned together? Peace, for Gods love, and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:88"/>
blush at your owne words, and take my councell, and marry presently in the first vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
that hath a Parish-Priest: and if you will not doe it there, can you wish a better
commoditie then to have our own Master Licentiat, who will doe it most excellently;
And note that I am old enough to give counsaile, and that this which I now deliver, is
as fit for you, as if it were expresly cast for you in a mould. For a Sparrow in the fist, is
worth more then a flying Bittor.
<q>
                           <l>For hee that can have good, and evill doth choose,</l>
                           <l>For ill that betides him, must not Patience loose.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if thou givest mee councell to marry, to the end I
may become a King after I have slaine the Giant, and have commoditie thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
thee, and give thee what I have promised; I let thee to understand that I may
doe all that most easily, without marrying my selfe. For before I enter into the battel,
I will make this condition, that when I come away victor, although I marry not the
Princesse, yet shall a part of the Kingdome bee at my disposition, to bestow upon
whom I please; and when I receive it, upon whom wouldst thou have me bestowe it
but on thy selfe? That is manifest said <hi>Sancho;</hi> but I pray you Sir, have care to choose
that part you would reserve towards the Sea side, to the end that if the living doe not
please me, I may imbarque my black vassails, and make the benefit of them which I have
said. And likewise I pray you not to trouble your mind, thinking to goe and see my
Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> at this time, but travaile towards the place where the Gyant is, and kill
him, and conclude that businesse first; for I sweare unto you, that I am of opinion it
will prove an Adventure of very great honor and profit. I assure thee <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,,</hi> thou art in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight, and I will follow thy counsaile in rather going
first with the Princesse, then to visit <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> And I warne thee not to speake a word
to any body, no, not to those that ride with us, of that which wee have here spoken
and discoursed together; for since <hi>Dulcineae</hi> is so warie and secret, as shee would not
have her thoughts discovered, it is no reason, that I eyther by my self or any other
should detect them.</p>
                     <p>If that bee so quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> why then doe you send all those which you vanquish
by virtue of your arme, to present themselves to my Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> seeing this is as
good as subsignation of your hands-writing, that you wish her well, and are enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on her? And seeing that those which goe to her, must forcibly lay them down on
their knees before her presence, and say that they come from you to doe her homage,
how then can the thoughts of you both bee hidden and concealed? O! how great a
foole art thou, and how simple quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Dost not thou perceive <hi>Sancho,</hi>
how all this results to her greater glory? For thou oughtest to wit, that in our Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceedings, it is great honour, that one Lady alone have many Knights Errant for
her Servitors, without extending their thoughts any farther then to serve her, only for
her high worths, without attending any other reward of their many and good desires,
then that shee will deigne to accept them as her Servants and Knights. I have heard
preach, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> that men should love our Saviour with that kinde of love, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his owne sake, without beeing mooved thereunto eyther by the hope of Glory,
or the feare of Payne; although for my part I would love and serve him, for what
hee is able to doe. The Devill take thee for a Clowne, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how
sharpe and pertinently doest thou speake now and then, able to make a man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that thou hast studied? Now by mine honesty, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> I can neither reade
nor write.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> perceiving them drowned thus in their Discourses, cryed out to
them to stay and drinke of a little Fountaine that was by the way. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to <hi>Sanchoes</hi> very great contentment, who was already tyred with telling him so
many lies, and was afraid his Master would intrap him in his owne words. For although
hee knew <hi>Dulcinea</hi> to bee of <hi>Toboso,</hi> yet had hee never seene her in his life. And <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>
had by this time put, on the apparell <hi>Doroten</hi> wore when they found her in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54746:88"/>
Mountaines, which though they were not very good, yet exceeded with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
those which hee had himselfe before; And alighting hard by the Fountaine, they
satisfied with the provision the Curate had brought with him from the Inne, although
it were but little, the great hunger that pressed them. And whilest they tooke their
ease there, a certaine young stripling that travelled, passed by, who looking very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
on all those which sate about the Fountaine, hee ranne presently after to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and imbracing his Legs, hee said, weeping downright: O my Lord, doe
not you know mee? Looke well upon mee, for I am the youth <hi>Andrew,</hi> whom you
unloosed from the Oake whereunto I was tyed. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> presently knew him, and
taking him by the hands, hee turned to those that were present and said, Because you
may see of how great importance it is, that there bee Knights Errant in the World, to
undoe wrongs and injuries that are committed in it by the insolent and bad men which
live therein, you shall wit that a few daies past, as I rode through a Wood, I heard
certaine lamentable screetches and cries, as of some needefull and afflicted person: I
forthwith occur'd, borne away by my profession towards the place from whence the
lamentable voyce founded, and I found tied to an Oaken tree, this boy whom you see
here in our presence, for which I am marvelous glad, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ause if I shall not say the truth,
hee may check mee. I say that hee was tyed to the Oake starke naked form the middle
upward, and a certaine Clowne was opening his flesh with cruell blowes that hee gave
him with the reines of a bridle; which Clowne, as I after understood, was his Master.
And so soone as I saw him, I demanded the cause of those cruell stripes. The rude fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
answered, that hee beate him because hee was his servant, and that certaine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
of his proceeded rather from being a theefe, then of simplicity. To which this
childe answered; Sir, hee whips mee for no other cause, but by reason that I demand
my wages of him. His Master replyed, I know not now what speeches and excuses,
the which although I heard, yet were they not by mee admitted. In resolution, I
caused him to bee loosed, and tooke the Clownes Oath, that hee would take him home,
and pay him there his wages, one Riall upon another; I, and those also perfumed.
Is it not true sonne <hi>Andrew?</hi> Didst not thou note with what a domaniering coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
I commanded it, and with what humilitie hee promised to accomplish all
that I imposed, Commanded and Desired? Answere mee, bee not ashamed, nor
stagger at all, but tell what passed to these Gentlemen, to the end it may bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
seene how necessary it is, as I have said, to have Knights Errant up and down the
high-wayes.</p>
                     <p>All that which you have said, quoth the boy, is very true; but the end of the matter
succeeded altogether contrary to that which you imagined. How contrarie, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Why hath not the Peasant paid thee? He not only hath not paid me,
answered the boy, but rather as soon as you were passed the wood, and that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
both alone, he turned again and tyed me to the same tree, and gave me afresh
so many blows, as I remained another S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> all flayed; and at every blow
he said some jest or other in derision of you: So that if I had not felt the pain of the
stripes so much as I did, I could have found in my heart to have laughed very heartily.
In fine, he left me in such pittifull case, as I have been ever since curing my selfe in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitall,
of the evill which the wicked Peasant did then unto me. And you are in the fault
of all this; for if you had ridden on your way, and not come to the place where you
were not sought for, nor intermedled your self in other mens affairs, perhaps my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
had contented himself with giving me a dozen or two of stroaks, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after have loosed, and payed me my wages: But by reason you dishonoured
him so much without cause, and said to him so many Villains, his choler was inflamed;
and seeing he could not revenge it on you, finding himself alone, he disburdened the
showre on me so heavily, as I greatly fear that I shall never again be mine own man.
<q>The hurt consisted in my departure (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for I should not have
gone from thence, untill I had seen thee payed: For I might have very well known
by many experiences, that there is no Clown that will keep his word, if he see the
keeping of it can turn any way to his damage: But yet, <hi>Andrew,</hi> thou doest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb facs="tcp:54746:89"/>
member how I swoar, that if he paied thee not, I would return &amp; seek him out, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
finde him, although he conveyed himself into a Whales belly.</q> That's true, quoth
<hi>Andrew;</hi> but all avails not. Thou shalt see whether it avails or no presently, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>
and saying so, got up very hastily, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded <hi>Sancho</hi> to bridle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who
was feeding whilest they did eate. <hi>Dorotea</hi> demanded of him, what he meant to doe?
He answered, that he would goe and finde out the Villain, and punish him for using
such bad proceedings, and cause <hi>Andrew</hi> to be paid the last <hi>denier,</hi> in despite of as many
Peasants as lived in the world. To which she answered, intreating him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that hee could not deale with any other Adventure, according to his promise,
untill hers were atchieved; and seeing that hee himself knew it to bee true, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any other, that hee should pacifie himselfe, untill his returne from her
Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>You have reason, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and therefore <hi>Andrew</hi> must have patience
perforce, untill my return (as you have said, Madame) and when I shall turne again
I doe swear unto him, and likewise renew my promise, never to rest, untill he be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and payed. I believe not in such Oaths, quoth <hi>Andrew;</hi> but would have as much
money as might carry me to <hi>Sivill,</hi> rather then all the revenges in the world: Give me
some meat to eate, and carry away with me, and God be with you and all other Knights
Errant, and I pray God that they may prove as erring to themselves as they have been
to me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> took out of his Bagg a piece of bread and cheese, and giving it to the Youth,
said, Hold brother <hi>Andrew,</hi> for every one hath his part of your misfortune. I pray
you what part thereof have you, said <hi>Andrew?</hi> This piece of bread and cheese that
I bestow on thee, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for God only knows whether I shall have neede of it
again, or no: for thou must wit, friend, that we the Squires of Kinghts Errant are
very subject to great hunger and evill luck, yea, and to other things which are better
felt then told. <hi>Andrew</hi> laid hold on his bread and cheese; and seeing that no body
gave him any other thing, he bowed his head and went on his way: True it is, that hee
said to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> at his departure: For Gods love, good Sir Knight Errant, if you
shall ever meet me again in the plight you have done, although you should see me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in pieces, yet doe not succour or help me, but leave me in my disgrace; for it cannot bee
so great, but that a greater will result from your help, upon whom, and all the other
Knights Errant that are borne in the world, I pray God his curse may alight. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
thought to arise to chastise him; but he ran away so swiftly, as no man durst
follow him; and our Knight remained marvellously ashamed at <hi>Andrews</hi> tale; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the rest with much adoe supprest their desire to laugh, lest they should throughly
confound him.</p>

travailed all that day, and the next, without incountring any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
venture of price, untill they arived at the only bugg and scar-crow
of <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> &amp; though he would full fain have excused his entry
into it, yet could hee in no wise avoid it: The Inn-Keeper, the
Hostesse, her Daughter, and <hi>Maritornes</hi> seeing <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and
<hi>Sancho</hi> return, went out to receive them with tokens of great love
and joy, and he entertained them with grave countenance and applause, and bade them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54746:89"/>
to make him ready a better Bed then the other which they had given unto him the time
before. Sir, quoth the Hostesse, if you would pay us better then the last time, wee
would give you one for a Prince, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, that he would: They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a reasonable good bed for him in the same wide room where he lay before; and
he went presently to bed, by reason that he arived much tyred, and void of wit. And
scarce was he gotten into his chamber, when the Hostesse leaping suddainly on the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and taking him by the beard, said, Now by my self blessed, thou shalt use my taile
no more for a beard, and thou shalt turne me my taile; for my husbands combe goes
thrown up and down the floor, that it is a shame to see it: I mean the combe that I
was wont to hang up in my good taile. The Barber would not give it unto her for
all her drawing, untill the Licentiat bade him to restore it, that they had now no more
use thereof, but that he might now very well discover himself, and appear in his own
shape, and say to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that after the Gally-slaves had rob'd him, he fled to
that Inne: And if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanded by chance for the Princesse her Squire,
that they should tell him, how she had sent him before to her Kingdome, to give intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to her Subjects, that she returned, bringing with her him that should free and
give them all libertie. With this the Barber surrendred the taile willingly to the
Hostesse, and likewise all the other borrowed wares which she had lent for <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xotes</hi>
deliverie. All those of the Inne rested wonderfull amazed at <hi>Doroteas</hi> beautie,
and also at the comelinesse of the Sheepheard <hi>Cardenio.</hi> Then the Curate gave order
to make readie for them such meat as the Inne could afford: and the Inn-keeper, in
hope of better payment, did dresse very speedily for them, a reasonable good Dinner.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> slept all this while, and they were of opinion to let him take his rest, seeing
sleep was more requisite for his disease then meat. At the Table they discoursed (the
Inn-keeper, his Wife, Daughter, and <hi>Marito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

present) of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> strange Frenzie, and of the manner wherein they found
him. The Hostesse eftsoons recounted what had hapned there between him and the
Carrier; and looking to see whether <hi>Sancho</hi> were present, preceiving that he was away,
she told likewise all the story of his canvasing, whereat they conceived no little content
and pastime: And, as the Curate said, that the originall cause of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
madnesse proceeded from the reading of Books of Knighthood. The Inn-keeper
answered;</p>
                     <p>I cannot conceive how that can bee, for (as I beleeve) there is no reading so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
in this world, and I my selfe have two or three bookes of that kinde with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
papers, which doe verily keepe mee alive, and not only mee but many other. For
in the reaping times, many of the Reapers repayre to this place in the heates of mid day,
and there is evermore some one or other among them that can reade, who takes one of
these bookes in hand, and then some thirty or more of us doe compasse him about, and
doe listen to him with such pleasure, as it hinders a thousand hoary haires; for I dare
say at least of my selfe, that when I heard tell of those furious and terrible blowes that
Knights Errant give, it inflames mee with a desire to become such a one my selfe, and
could finde in my heart to bee hearing of them day and night. I am just of the same
minde, no more, nor no lesse, said the Hostesse, for I never have any quiet houre in my
house, but when thou art hearing those bookes whereon thou art so besotted, as then
thou dost only forget to chide, which is thy ordinary exercise at other times. That is
very true said <hi>Maritornes.</hi> And I in good sooth doe take great delight to heare those
things, for they are very fine, and especially when they tell how such a Ladie lies embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by her Knight under an Orange tree, and that a certaine Damzell keepeth Watch
all the while, readie to burst for envie that shee hath not likewise her sweete-heart; and
very much afraid. I say that all those things are as sweete as honey to mee. And you,
quoth the Curate to the Inn-keepers daughter, what doe you thinke? I know not in
good sooth, Sir quoth shee, but I doe likewise give eare, and in truth although I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it not, yet doe I take some pleasure to heare them, but I mislike greatly those blows
which please my father so much, and only delight in the lamentations that Knights make
being absent from their Ladies; which in sooth doe now and then make mee weepe,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:90"/>
through the compassion I take of them. Well then quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> belike, faire may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
you would remedie them, if such plaints were breathed for your owne sake? I
know not what I would doe, answered the Gyrle, only this I know, that there are
some of those Ladies so cruell, as their Knights call them <hi>Tygers</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other wilde-Beasts. And <hi>good Iesus,</hi> I know not what un-Souled folke they bee,
and so without Conscience, that because they will not once behold an honourable man,
they suffer him eyther to die or run mad. And I know not to what end serves all that
coynesse. For if they doe it for honesties sake, let them marry with them, for the
Knights desire nothing more. Peace childe, quoth the Hostesse; for it seems that thou
knowest too much of those matters, and it is not decent that Maidens should know
or speak so much. I speak, quoth she, by reason that this good Sir made me the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and I could not in courtesie omit to answer him. Well, said the Curate, let
me intreat you, good mine Host, to bring us here those Books; for I would fain see
them.</p>
                     <p>I am pleased, said the Inn-keeper: And then entring into his Chamber, he brought
forth a little old Malet shut up with a chain; and opening thereof, hee took out three
great Books and certain Papers written with a very fair Letter. The first Book hee
opened was that of <hi>Don Cirongilio of Thracia:</hi> The other <hi>Felixmarte of Hircania:</hi>
And the third, <hi>The History of the great Captain, Goncalo Hernandez of Cordova,</hi> with
the life of <hi>Diego Garcia of Paredes</hi> adjoyned. As soon as the Curate had read the
Titles of the two Books, he said to the Barber, We have now great want of our friends,
the old woman and Neece. Not so much as you think, quoth the Barber; for I know
also the way to the yard or the chimney, and in good sooth, there is a fire in it good
enough for that purpose. Would you then, quoth the Host, burn my Books? No
more of them, quoth the Curate, but these first two of <hi>Don Cirongilio</hi> and <hi>Felixmarte,</hi>
are my Books. Perhaps, quoth the Inn-keeper, Hereticall or Flegmaticall, that you
would thus roughly handle them. Schismaticall thou wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ldest have said, quoth the
Barber, and not Flegmaticall. It is so, said the Inn-keeper; but if you will needs burn
any, I pray you, rather let it be that of <hi>the great Captain,</hi> and of that <hi>Diego Garcia;</hi> for
I would rather suffer one of my Sonnes to bee burned then any one of those other two.
Good friend, these two Books are lying, and full of follies and vanities; but that of
<hi>the great Captain</hi> is true, and containeth the arts of <hi>Goncalo Hernandez of Cordova,</hi>
who for his sundrie and noble acts merited to be tearmed by all the world <hi>The great
Captain,</hi> a name famous, illustrious, and only deserved by himself and this other <hi>Diego
Garcia of Paredes</hi> was a noble Gentleman, born in the City of <hi>Truxillo</hi> in <hi>Estremadura,</hi>
&amp; was a most valourous Souldier; and of so surpassing force, as he would detain a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheele
with one hand from turning in the midest of the speediest motion: And stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once at the end of a Bridge with a two-handed Sword, defended the passage against
a mighty Armie that attempted to passe over it; and did so many other things, that
if another who were a stranger and unpassionate had written them, as he did himself
who was the relater and Historiographer of his own Acts, and therefore recounted
them with the modestie of a Gentleman and proper Chronicler, they would have
drowned all the <hi>Hectors, Achillises</hi> and <hi>Rollands</hi> in oblivion.</p>
                     <p>There is a Jest, quoth the Inn-keeper, deale with my father, I pray you see at what
you wonder: A wise tale at the with-holding of the wheele of a Mill.
I swear you ought to read that which is read in <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> who with one
thwart blow cut five mighty Gyants in halfes, as if they were of Beans, like to the little
Friers that Children make of Bean-cods: And set another time upon a great and
most powerfull Army of more then a Million and six hundred thousand Souldiers, and
overthrew and scattered them all like a Flock of Sheep. What then can you say to me
of the good <hi>Don Cirongilio</hi> of <hi>Thracia,</hi> who was so animous and valiant as may bee
seen in his Book; wherein is laid down, That as he sailed along a River, there issued
out of the midest of the water a Serpent of fire, and he, as soon as he perceived it, leaped
upon her, and hanging by her scalie shoulders, he wrung her throat so straitly between
both his armes, that the Serpent perceiving her self to be well-nigh strangled, had no
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54746:90"/>
other way to save her self but by diving down into the deeps, carrying the Knight away
with her, who would never let goe his gripe, and when they came to the bottom, hee
found himself by a Palace in such faire and pleasant gardens, as it was a wonder; and
presently the Serpent turned into an old man, which said to him such things as there is
no more to be desired. Two figs for the <hi>Great Captain,</hi> and that <hi>Diego Garcia,</hi> of whom
you speake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorotea</hi> hearing him speake thus, said to <hi>Cardenio,</hi> Mee thinks our Host wants but
little to make up a second part of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> So it seemes to mee likewise, replyed
<hi>Cardenio,</hi> for as wee may conjecture by his words, hee certainly beleeves that every
thing written in those bookes, passed just as it is laid downe, and barefooted-Friers
would bee scarce able to perswade him the contary. Know friend (quoth the Curate to
the In-keeper) that there was never any such man as <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> or <hi>Don-Chirongilio</hi>
of <hi>Thracia,</hi> nor other such Knights as bookes of Chivalry recount; for all is
but a device and fiction of idle wits that composed them, to the end that thou sayest, to
passe over the time, as your readers doe in reading of them: For I sinceerely sweare
unto thee, that there were never such Knights in the world, nor such Adventures and
ravings hapned in it. Cast that bone to another dog quoth the In-keeper, as though I
knew not how many numbers are five, and where the shooe wrests mee now. I pray
you Sir, goe not about to give mee pap, for by the Lord I am not so white. Is it not a
good sport that you labour to perswade mee, that all that which these good bookes say
are but ravings and fables, they being printed by Grace and Favour of the Lords of the
Privie Councell; as if they were folke that would permit so many lies to bee printed at
once, and so many Battells and Enchantments, as are able to make a man run out of his
wits: I have told thee already friend (said the Curate) that this is done for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
of our idle thoughts, and so even as in well governed Comonwealths, the
playes at Chesse, Tennis and Trucks are tolerated for the pastime of some men which
have none other occupation, and either ought not or cannot worke, even so such books
are permitted to bee printed; presuming (as in truth they ought) that no man would
be found so simple and ignorant, as to hold any of these bookes for a true Historie. And
if my leisure permitted, and that it were a thing requisite for this Auditory, I could say
many things concerning the subject of bookes of Knighthood, to the end that they
should bee well contrived, and also bee pleasant and profitable to the Readers; but I
hope somtime to have the commodity to communicate my conceit with those that may
redresse it. And in the meane while you may beleeve good mine Host, what I have said,
and take to you your books, and agree with their truths or leasings as you please, and
much good may it doe you; and I pray God that you halt not in time on the foote that
your guest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> halteth. Not so quoth the In-keeper, for I will never bee so
wood as to become a Knight Errant, for I see well, that what was used in the times of
these famous Knights is now in no use nor request.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> came in about the midst of this discourse, and rested much confounded and
Pensative of that which hee heard them say, that Knights Errant were now in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and that the bookes of Chivalry only conteined follies and lies, and purposed
with himselfe to see the end of that voyage of his Lords, and that if it sorted not the
wished successe which hee expected, hee resolved to leave him and return home to his
wife and children and accustomed labour. The Inn-keeper thought to take away his
bookes and budget, but the Curate withheld him saying. Stay a while, for I would see
what papers are those which are written in so faire a Character. The Host tooke them
out and gave them to him to read, being in number some eight sheetes with a title writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in text letters, which said, <hi>The Historie of the curious Impertinent.</hi> The Curate read
two or three lines softly to himselfe, and said after, Truly the title of this History doth
not mislike mee, and therefore I am about to reade it through. The Inn-keeper hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him said, Your reverence may very well doe it, for I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

which have read it here, as they travelled, dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ommend it exceedingly, and have beg'd
it of mee as earnestly, but I would never bestow it, hoping some day to restore it to the
owner of this Malet, who forgot it here behinde him with those bookes and papers, for
<pb facs="tcp:54746:91"/>
it may bee that hee will somtime return, and although I know that I shall have great
want of the bookes, yet will I make to him restitution, for although I am an In-keeper,
yet God be thanked I am a Christian therewithall. You have great reason my friend,
quoth the Curate, but yet notwithstanding if the taste like me, thou must give me leave
to take a copie thereof. With all my heart replyed the Host. And as they two talked,
<hi>Cardenio</hi> taking the booke, began to reade a little of it, and it pleasing him as much as
it had done the Curate, he requested him to reade it in such sort as they might all heare
him. That I would willingly doe said the Curate, if the time were not now more fit
for sleeping then reading. It were sufficient repose for me, said <hi>Dorotea,</hi> to passe away
the time listening to some tale or other, for my spirit is not yet so well quieted as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me licence to sleepe, even then when nature exacteth it. If that bee so, quoth the
Curate, I will reade it, if it were but for curiositie, perhaps it containeth some delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
matter. Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> intreated the same. The Curate seeing and
knowing that he should therein doe them all a pleasure, and hee himselfe likewise receive
as great, said, Seeing you will needes heare it, be all of you attentive, for the History be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth
in this manner.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Florence,</hi> a rich and famous Citie of <hi>Italie,</hi> in the Province called
<hi>Tuscane,</hi> there dwelled two rich and principall Gentlemen called
<hi>Anselmo</hi> and <hi>Lothario,</hi> which two were so great friends, as they
were named for excellency, and by <hi>Antonomasta,</hi> by all those that
knew them, the Two friends: They were both Batchelers, and
much of one age and manners; all which was of force to make
them answer one another with reciprocall amity. True it is that
<hi>Anselmo</hi> was somewhat more inclined to amorous dalliance
then <hi>Lothario,</hi> who was altogether addicted to hunting: But when occasion exacted
it <hi>Anselmo</hi> would omit his own pleasures, to satisfie his friends; and <hi>Lothario</hi> likewise
his, to please <hi>Anselmo:</hi> And by this means both their wills were so correspondent,
as no clock could be better ordered then were their desires. <hi>Anselmo</hi> being at last
deeply enamoured of a principall and beautifull young Ladie of the same Citie, called
<hi>Camila,</hi> being so worthily descended, and she her self of such merit therewithall, as he
resolved (by the consent of his friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> without whom he did nothing) to
demand her of her Parents for wife; and did put his purpose in execution; and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario</hi>
himself was the messenger, and concluded the matter so to his friends satisfaction,
as he was shortly after put in possession of his desires; and <hi>Camila</hi> so contented to
have gotten <hi>Anselmo,</hi> as she ceased not to render Heaven and <hi>Lothario</hi> thanks, by
whose means she had obtained so great a match. The first dayes, as all marriage dayes
are wont to be merry, <hi>Lothario</hi> frequented, according to the custome, his frind <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo's</hi>
house, endeavouring to honour, feast, and recreate him all the wayes he might
possible: But after the Nuptials were finished, and the concourse of Strangers, Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Congratulations somewhat ceased, <hi>Lothario,</hi> also began to be somewhat
more slack then he wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ted in going to <hi>Anselmo</hi> his house, deeming it (as it is reason
that all discreet men should) not so convenient to visit or haunt so often the house of
his friend after marriage as he would, had he still remained a Batcheler. For although
true amity neither should, nor ought to admit the least suspition: yet notwithstanding
a married mans honour is so delicate and tender a thing, as it seems it may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
impaired, even by very Bretheren; and how much more by Friends? <hi>Anselmo</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54746:91"/>
noted the remission of <hi>Lothario,</hi> and did grievously complain thereof, saying; That if
he had wist by marriage he should thus be deprived of his deered conversation, hee
would never have married; and that since through the uniform correspondencie of
them both being free, they had deserved the sweet title of <hi>the two friends,</hi> that he should
not now permit (be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ause he would be noted circumspect without any other occasion)
that so famous and pleasing a name should be lost: and therefore he requested him
(if it were lawfull to use such a terme between them two) to return and be Master of
his house, and come and goe as he had done before his marriage, assuring him that his
Spouse <hi>Camila</hi> had no other pleasure and will, then that which himself pleased shee
should have: and that she, after having known how great was both their frindships,
was not a little amazed to see him become so strange.</p>
                     <p>To all these and many other reasons alledged by <hi>Anselmo,</hi> to perswade <hi>Lothario</hi> to
frequent his house, he answered with so great prudence, discretion and warinesse, as
<hi>Anselmo</hi> remained satisfied of his friends good intention herein: and they made an
agreement between them two, that <hi>Lothario</hi> should dine at his house twice a week,
and the Holy-dayes besides: And although this agreement had passed between them,
yet <hi>Lothario</hi> purposed to doe that only which he should finde most expedient for his
friends honour, whose reputation he tendered much more deerly then he did his own;
and was wont to say very discreetly, that the married man, unto whom heaven had
given a beautifull wife, ought to have as much heede of the friends which he brought
to his house, as he should of the women friends that visited his wife; for that which
is not done nor agreed upon in the Church or Market, nor in publique Feasts or
Stations (being places that a man cannot lawfully hinder his wife from frequenting
sometimes at least) are oft-times facilitated and contrived in a friends or kins-womans
house, whom perhaps we never suspected. <hi>Anselmo</hi> on the other side affirmed, That
therefore married men ought every one of them to have some friend who might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
them of the faults escaped in their manner of proceeding; for it befalls many
times, that through the great love which the Husband bears to his Wife, either he doth
not take notice, or else he doth not advertise her, because he would not offend her to
doe or omit to doe certain things, the doing or omitting whereof might turn to his
honour or obloquie; to which things, being advertised by his friend, he might easily
apply some remedie: But where might a man finde a friend so discreet, loyall and trustie
as <hi>Anselmo</hi> demands? I know not truly, if not <hi>Lothario;</hi> for he it was that with all
sollicitude and care regarded the honour of his friend: and therefore endeavoured
to clip and diminish the number of the dayes promised, lest he should give occasion
to the idle vulgar, or to the eyes of vagabonds and malicious men to judge any sinister
thing, viewing so rich, comely, noble, and qualified a young man as he was, to have so
free accesse into the house of a woman so beautifull as <hi>Camila.</hi> For though his virtues
and modest carriage were sufficiently able to set a bridle to any malignant tongue, yet
notwithstanding he would not have his credit, nor that of his friends called into any
question; and therefore would spend most of the dayes that he had agreed to visit
his friend, in other places and exercises; yet feigning excuses so plausible, as his friend
admitted them for very reasonable. And thus the time passed on in challenges of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse
of the one side, and lawfull excuses of the other.</p>
                     <p>It so fell out, that as both the friends walked on a day together in a field without
the Citie, <hi>Anselmo</hi> said to <hi>Lothario</hi> these words ensuing, I know very well, friend
<hi>Lothario,</hi> that among all the favours which God of his bountie hath bestowed upon me
by making me the Sonne of such Parents, and giving to me with so liberall a hand, both
the goods of Nature and Fortune: yet as I cannot answer him with sufficient grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for the benefits already received, so doe I finde my self most highly bound unto
him above all others, for having given me such a friend as thou art, and so beautifull a
wife as <hi>Camila,</hi> being both of you such pawns, as if I esteem you not in the degree
which I ought, yet doe I hold you as deer as I may: And yet possessing all those things
which are wont to be the all and sum that are wont and may make a man happie, I live
notwithstanding the most sullen and discontented life of the World; being troubled, I
<pb facs="tcp:54746:92"/>
know not since when, and inwardly wrested with so strange a desire, and extravagant
from the common use of others, as I marvell at my self, and doe condemn and rebuke
my self when I am alone, and doe labour to conceale and cover mine own desires;
all which hath served me to as little effect, as if I had proclaimed mine own errours
purposely to the World: And seeing that it must finally break out, my will is, that
it be only communicated to the treasury of thy secret; hoping by it and mine own
industry, which (as my true friend) thou wilt use to help me, I shall bee quickly freed
from the anguish it causeth, and by thy means my joy and contentment shall arive to
the passe that my discontents have brought me through mine own folly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lothario</hi> stood suspended at <hi>Anselmo's</hi> Speech, as one that could not imagine to
what so prolixe a prevention and preamble tended: And although he revolved and
imagined sundry things in his minde which he deemed might afflict his friend, yet did
hee ever shoot wide from the mark which in truth it was: and that he might quickly
escape that agonie, wherein the suspention held him, he said, That his friend did notable
injurie to their amity, in searching out wreathings and ambages in the discovery of
his most hidden thoughts to him, seeing bee might assure himself certainly, either to
receive counsells of him how to entertain, or else remedy and means how to accomplish
them.</p>
                     <p>It is very true answered <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and with that confidence I let thee to understand,
friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> That the desire which vexeth me, is a longing, to know whether my
wife <hi>Camila</hi> be as good and perfect as I doe account her; and I cannot wholy rest
satisfied of this truth, but by making tryall of her, in such sort, as it may give manifest
argument of the degree of her goodnesse, as the fire doth shew the value of gold: For
I am of opinion (O friend) that a woman is of no more worth or virtue, then that
which is in her, after shee hath been solicited [<hi>Casta est quam nemo rogavit:</hi>] and that
she alone is strong who cannot be bowed by the Promises, Gifts, Tears, and continuall
importunities of importunate Lovers: For what thanks is it (quoth he) for a woman
to be good, if no body say or teach her ill? What wonder that she be retired and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
if no occasion be ministred to her of dissolution, and chiefly she that knows
she hath a husband ready to kill her for the least argument of lightnesse? So that she
which is only good for fear or want of occasion, will I never hold in that estimation,
that I would the other sollicited and pursued, who notwithstanding comes away
crowned with the victory: And therefore being moved as well by these reasons as by
many other which I could tell you, which accredit and fortifie mine opinion, I desire
that my wife <hi>Camila</hi> doe also passe thorow the pikes of those proofs and difficulties,
and purifie and refine her self in the fire of being requested, sollicited and pursued; and
that by one whose worths and valour may deserve acceptance in her opinion: and if
she bear away the Palme of the victory, as I believe shee will, I shall account my fortune
matchlesse, and may brag that my desires are in their height; and will say that a strong
woman hath faln to my lot, of whom the Wise man faith, <hi>who shall finde her?</hi> And
when it shall succeed contrary to mine expection, I shall, with the pleasure that I
will conceive to see how rightly it jumps with mine opinion, bear very indifferent the
grief which in all reason this so costly a tryall must stir in me: And presupposing that
nothing which thou shalt say to me shall be available to hinder my designe, or disswade
me from putting my purpose in execution; I would have thy selfe, deer friend <hi>Lothario,</hi>
to provide thee to be the instrument that shall labour this worke of my liking, and I
will give thee oportunitie enough to performe the same, without omitting any thing
that may further thee in the sollicitation of an Honest, Noble, Warie, Retired and
Passionlesse woman.</p>
                     <p>And I am chiefly moved to commit this so hard an enterprize to thy trust; because
I know that if <hi>Camila</hi> be vanquished by thee, yet shall not the victory arive to the last
push and upshot, but only to that of accounting a thing to bee done, which shall not
bee done for many good respects. So shall I remain nothing offended, and mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
concealed in the virtue of thy silence; for I know thy care to be such in matters
concerning me, as it shall bee eternall, like that of death. And therefore if thou desirest
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54746:92"/>
that I may lead a life deserving that name, thou must forthwith provide thy selfe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into this amorous conflict, and that not languishing or slothfully, but with that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and diligence which my desire expecteth, and the confidence I have in our amitie
assureth mee.</p>
                     <p>These were the reasons used by <hi>Anselmo</hi> to <hi>Lothario,</hi> to all which hee was so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as untill hee ended, hee did not once unfold his lips to speake a word save those
which wee have above related, and seeing that hee spoke no more; after hee had beheld
him a good while, as a thing that hee had never before, and did therefore strike him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
admiration and amazement hee said, Friend <hi>Anselmo,</hi> I cannot perswade my selfe,
that the words you have spoken be other then jests, for had I thought that thou wert in
earnest, I would not have suffered thee to passe on so far, and by lending thee no eare
would have excused this tedious Oration. I doe verily imagine that either thou dost not
know mee, or I thee: but not so, for I know thee to bee <hi>Anselmo;</hi> and thou that I
am <hi>Lothario;</hi> the dammage is, that I thinke thou art not the <hi>Anselma</hi> thou wast wont
to bee, and perhaps thou deemest mee not to bee the accustomed <hi>Lothario</hi> that I ought
to bee; for the things which thou hast spoken, are not of that <hi>Anselmo</hi> my friend, nor
those which thou seekest ought to bee demanded of that <hi>Lothario,</hi> of whom thou hast
notice; for true friends ought to prove and use their friends, as the <hi>Poet</hi> said, <hi>Vsque ad
Aras,</hi> that is, that they should in no sort imploy them or implore their assistance in
things offensive unto God, and if a Gentile was of this opinion in matters of friendship
how much greater reason is it that a Christian should have that feeling, specially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the celestiall amitie is not to bee lost for any humane friendship whatsoever.
And when the friend should throw the bars so wide, as to set heavenly respects apart, for
to complement with his friend, it must not bee done on light grounds, or for things of
small moment, but rather for those whereon his friends life and honour wholy depends.
Then tell mee now <hi>Anselmo,</hi> in which of these two things art thou in danger, that I
may adventure my Person to doe thee a pleasure, and attempt so dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lable a thing as
thou doest demand? None of them truly, but rather doest demand, as I may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that I doe industriously labour to deprive thee of thine honour and life together,
and in doing so, I likewise deprive my selfe of them both. For if I must labour to take
away thy credit, it is most evident that I dispoyle thee of life, for a man without repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
is worse then a dead man, and I being the instrument (as thou desirest that I
should be) of so great harme unto thee, doe not I become, likewise thereby dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and by the same consequence also without life? Heare mee friend <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and
have patience not to answere mee untill I have said all that I think, concerning that
which thy mind exacteth of thee; for we shall have after leisure enough, wherein thou
maist reply, and I have patience to listen unto thy reasons.</p>
                     <p>I am pleased quoth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> say what thou likest. And <hi>Lothario</hi> prosecuted his
speech in this manner; Mee thinks <hi>Anselmo,</hi> that thou art now of the <hi>Moores</hi> humors,
which can by no meanes bee made to understand the error of their sect; neither by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the holy Scripture, nor by reasons which consist in speculations of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
or that are founded in the Articles of the Faith, but must bee won by palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
examples, and those easie, intelligible, demonstrative and doubtlesse; by Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
demonstrations, which cannot bee denied. Even as when wee say, <hi>If from two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
parts wee take away two parts equall, the parts that remaine are also equall.</hi> And
when they cannot understand this, as in truth they doe not, wee must demonstrate it
to them with our hands, and lay it before their eyes, and yet for all this nought can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
to win them in the end to give credit to the verities of our Religion, which very
termes and manner of proceeding I must use with thee, by reason that the desire which
is sprung in thee, doth so wander and stray from all that which beares the shadow only
of Reason, as I doubt much that I shall spend my time in vaine which I shall bestow to
make thee understand thine owne simplicitie, for I will give it no other name at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and in good earnest I was almost perswaded to leave thee in thine humor, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of thine inordinate and unreasonable desire, but that the love which I beare
towards thee doth not consent, I use to thee such rigour, or leave thee in so manifest a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:93"/>
danger of thine owne perdition. And that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hast not thou said unto mee that I must sollicite one that stands upon her reputation,
perswade an honest woman, make proffers to one that is not passionate or engaged, and
serve a discreete woman? Yes, thou hast said all this. Well then, if thou knowest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
that thou hast a retyred, honest, unpassionate and prudent wife, what seekest
thou more? And if thou thinkest that shee will rest victorious after all mine assaults,
as doubtlesse she will, what better titles wouldest thou after bestow upon her then those
shee possesseth already? Either it proceedes because thou dost not thinke of her as
thou sayest, or else because thou knowest not what thou demandest. If thou dost not
account her such as thou praysest her; to what end wouldest thou prove her? But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as an evill person use her as thou likest best; but if shee bee as good as thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
it were an impertinent thing to make tryall of truth it selfe: For after it is made,
yet it will still rest only with the same reputation it had before. Wherefore it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
reason; that to attempt things, whence rather harm may after result unto us then
good, is the part of rash and discoursless braines, and principally when they deale with
those things whereunto they are not compelled or driven, and that they see even a far off,
how the attempting the like is manifest folly. Difficult things are undertaken for God,
or the world, or both. Those that are done for God, are the workes of the Saints, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoring
to leade Angels lives in fraile and mortall bodies. Those of the World, are
the travells and toyles of such as cross such immense seas, travell through so adverse Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and converse with so many Nations, to acquire that which wee call the goods of
Fortune. And the things acted for God and the world together, are the worthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
of resolute and valorous Martiall men, which scarce perceive so great a breach in
the adversatie wall, as the common bullet is wont to make, when leaving all fear apart,
without making any discourse, or taking notice of the manifest danger that threatens
them, born away by the wings of desire and honour to serve God, their Nation and
Prince, doe throw themselves boldly into the throat of a thousand menacing deaths
which expect them.</p>
                     <p>These are things wont to bee practised, and it is honour, glory and profit to attempt
them, bee they never so full of inconveniences and danger; but that which thou sayest
thou wilt trie and put in practise, shall never gaine thee Gods glorie, the goods of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or renoune among men; for suppose that thou bringest it to passe according to
thine owne fantasie, thou shalt remaine nothing more contented, rich, or honourable
then thou art already; and if thou dost not, then shalt thou see thy selfe in the greatest
misery of any wretch living: for it will little availe thee then, to thinke that no man
knowes the disgrace befaln thee, it being sufficient both to afflict and dissolve thee that
thou knowest it thy self; and for greater confirmation of this truth, I will repeat unto
thee a stanza of the famous Poet <hi>Lud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <l>Himself, because hee had offended so,</l>

So that thou canst not excuse thy griefe with secrecie, bee it never so great, but rather
shalt have continuall occasion to weepe, if not watry teares from thine eyes, at least
teares of blood from thy heart, such as that simple Doctor wept, of whom our Poet
makes mention, who made tryall of the Vessell, which the prudent <hi>Reynaldos</hi> upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer
discourse refused to deale withall: and although it bee but a Poeticall fixion, yet
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54746:93"/>
doth it containe many hidden morals worthy to bee noted, understood and imitated:
how much more, seeing that by what I mean to say now, I hope thou shalt begin to
conceive the great error which thou wouldest wittingly commit.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Anselmo,</hi> if Heaven or thy Fortunes had made thee Lord and lawfull
possessor of a most precious Diamond, of whose goodnesse and qualitie all the Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
that had viewed the same would rest satisfied, and that all of them would joyntly
and uniformly affirm that it arived in quality, goodnesse and finenesse to all that, to
which the nature of such a stone might extend it self; and that thou thy self didest
believe the same without witting any thing to the contrarie; would it be just that
thou shouldest take an humour to set that Diamond between an Anvile and a hammar
and to trie there by very force of blows whether it be so hard &amp; so fine as they say? And
farther; when thou didest put thy designe in execution, put the case that the stone
made resistance to thy foolish tryall, yet wouldest thou add thereby no new valour or
esteem to it: And if it did break, as it might befall; were not then all lost? Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
and that leaving the Owner, in all mens opinion, for a very poor ignorant
person. Then friend <hi>Anselmo,</hi> make account that <hi>Camila</hi> is a most precious Diamond
as well in thine as in other mens estimation; and it is no reason to put her in contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
danger of breaking, seeing that although shee remain in her integrity, she cannot
mount to more worth then she hath at the present; and if she faltred, or did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
consider even at this present, what state you would bee in then and how justly thou
mightest then complain of thy self, for being cause of her perdition and thine own. See
how there is no Jewell in the world comparable to the modest and chaste Woman;
and that all Womens honour consists in the good opinion that's had of them: and
seeing that of thy Spouse is so great, as it arrives to that sum of perfection which thou
knowest; why wouldest thou call this verity in question? Know, friend, that a Woman
is an imperfect Creature, and should therefore have nothing cast in her way to make her
stumble &amp; fall, but rather to cleer &amp; doe all incumbrances away out of it, to the end shee
may without impeachment run with a swift course to obtain the perfection shee wants,
which only consists in being virtuous.</p>
                     <p>The Naturalists recount, that the <hi>Ermine</hi> is a little Beast that hath a most white
skin; and that when the hunters would chase him, they use this art to take him: As
soon as they finde out his haunt, and places where he hath recourse, they thwart them
with mire and dirt, and after when they discrie the little Beast, they pursue him towards
those places which are defiled; and the <hi>Ermine</hi> espying the mire, stands still, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
himself to be taken and captived in exchange of not passing thorow the mire, or
staining of his whitenesse, which it esteems more then either liberty or life. The honest
and chaste Woman is an <hi>Ermine,</hi> and the virtue of chastity is whiter and purer then
Snow; and he that would not lose it, but rather desires to keep and preserve it, must
proceed with a different stile from that of the <hi>Ermine:</hi> For they must not propose
and lay before her the mire of the passions, flatteries and services of importunate
Lovers; for perhaps she shall not have the naturall impulse and force which commonly
through proper debility is wont to stumble, to passe over those incumbrances safely:
and therefore it is requisite to free the passage and take them away, and lay before her
the cleernesse of virtue, and the beauty comprized in good fame. The good woman
is also like unto a bright and cleer mirrour of Crystall; and therefore is subject to bee
stained and dimmed by every breath that toucheth it. The honest woman is to bee used
as reliques of Saints, to wit, shee must be honoured but not touched. The good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to be kept and prized like a fair Garden full of sweet Flowers and Roses, that
is held in estimation, whose owner permits no man to enter and trample or touch his
Flowers, but holds it to bee sufficient, that they standing a far off, without the rails,
may joy at the delightfull sight and fragrancie thereof. Finally I will repeat certain
Verses unto thee that have now come to my memorie, the which were repeated of late
in a new Play, and seem to me very fit for the purpose of which wee treat. A prudent
old man did give a neighbour of his that had a daughter counsell to keep and shut her
up; and among many other reasons he used these.

which may touch thy self: and it is now high time that somewhat bee heard concerning
me: And if by chance I shall be somewhat prolixe, I pray thee to pardon me; for the
Labyrinth wherein thou hast entred, and out of which thou wouldest have me to free
thee, requires no lesse. Thou holdest me to bee thy friend, and yet goest about to
dispoile me of mine honour, being a thing contrary to all amitie; and doest not only
pretend this, but doest likewise indeavour that I should rob thee of the same, that thou
wouldest deprive me of mine is evident; for when <hi>Camila</hi> shall perceive that I sollicite
her as thou demandest, it is certain that shee will esteem of me as of one quite devoid
of wit, and indiscreet, seeing I intend and doe a thing so repugnant to that, which the
being that him I am and thine amitie doe binde me unto; that thou wouldest have
me rob thee thereof is as manifest; for <hi>Camila</hi> seeing me thus to court her, must ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that I have noted some lightnesse in her which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent me boldnesse thus to discover
unto her my depraved desires, and she holding her self to bee thereby injured and
dishonoured, her disgrace must also concern thee as a principall part of her. And hence
springs that which is commonly said, That the Husband of the Adulterous Wife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee know nothing of her lewdnesse, nor hath given any occasion to her to doe
what shee ought not, nor was able any way to hinder by dilligence, care, or other
means, his disgrace, yet is intituled with a vituperious and vile name, and is in a manner
beheld by those that know his Wifes mallice with the eyes of contempt; whereas they
should indeed regard him rather with those of compassion, seeing that he falls into that
misfortune not so much through his own default, as through the light fantasie of his
wicked Consort. But I will shew thee the reason why a bad Womans Husband
is justly dishonoured and contemned, although hee bee ignorant and guiltlesse
thereof, and cannot prevent, nor hath given to it any occasion: And bee not
grieved to heare mee, seeing the benefit of the discourse shall redound unto thy
selfe.</p>
                     <p>When God created our first Parent in the terrestriall Paradise, the holy Scripture
saith, <hi>That God infused sleep into</hi> Adam, and that being asleep, hee took out a rib out of
his left side, of which he formed our Mother <hi>Eve;</hi> and as soon as <hi>Adam</hi> awaked and
beheld her, hee said, This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bones: And God said,
For this cause shall a man leave his Father and his Mother, and they shall bee two in
one flesh: And then was the Divine Ordinance of Matrimonie first instituted, with
such indissoluble knots, as only may bee by death dissolved: And this marvellous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
is of such efficacie and force, as it makes two different persons to bee one very
flesh; and yet operates farther in good married folk; For although they have two
Souls, yet it makes them to have but one Will. And hence it proceeds, that by reason
the Wifes flesh is one and the very same with her Husbands, the blemishes or defects
that taint it; doe also redound into the Husbands, although hee (as wee have said) have
ministred no occasion to receive that dammage. For as all the whol body feels any paine
of the foot, head, or any other member, because it is all one flesh, &amp; the head smarts at the
grief of the Ankle, although it hath not caused it: So is the Husband participant of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54746:94"/>
his Wifes dishonour, because he is one and the self-same with her. And by reason that
all the Honours and Dishonours of the world are, and spring from Flesh and Blood;
and those of the bad woman be of this kinde, it is forcible, that part of them fall to
the Husbands share, and that hee bee accounted dishonourable, although he wholly bee
ignorant of it. See then, <hi>Anselmo,</hi> to what perill thou doest thrust they self by seeking
to disturb the quietnesse and repose wherein thy Wife lives, and for how vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
curiositie thou wouldest stir up the humours which are now quiet in thy
chaste Spouses brest; note how the things thou doest adventure to gain are of small
moment; but that which thou shalt lose so great, that I must leave it in his poynt,
having no words sufficiently able to indeer it. But if all that I have said bee not
able to move thee from thy bad purpose; thou mayest well seek out for some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of thy dishonour and mis-haps; for I mean not to be one, although I should
therefore lose thine amitie, which is the greatest losse that might any way befall
mee.</p>
                     <p>Here the prudent <hi>Lothario</hi> held his peace, and <hi>Anselmo</hi> remayned so confounded and
Melancholy, as hee could not answere a word to him for a very great while. But in the
end hee said; I have listned friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> to all that which thou hast said unto mee,
with the attention which thou hast noted, and have perceived in thy reasons, examples,
and similitudes, the great discretion wherewithall thou art endowed, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of amitie that thou hast attained; and doe also confesse and see, that if I follow not
thine advice, but should leane unto mine owne, I doe but shun the good, and pursue
the evill. Yet oughtest thou likewise to consider, how herein I suffer the disease which
some women are wont to have, that long to eate earth, lime, coles, and other far worse
and lothsome things even to the very sight, and much more to the taste: So that it is
behoovefull to use some art by which I may bee cured, and this might bee easily done by
beginning only to sollic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>te <hi>Camila</hi> although you did it but weake and feignedly; for I
know shee will not bee so soft and pliable, as to dash her honestie about the ground, at
the first encounters, and I will rest satisfied with this commencement alone: and thou
shalt herein accomplish the obligation thou owest to our friendship, by not only resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
mee to life, but also by perswading me not to dispoyle my selfe of mine honour.
And thou art bound to doe this, for one reason that I shall alledge, to wit, that I being
resolved, as indeed I am, to make this experience, thou oughtest not to permit, being
my friend, that I should bewray my defect herein to a stranger, whereby I might very
much endanger my reputation, which thou labourest so much to preserve, and though
thy credit may lose some degrees in <hi>Camilaes</hi> opinion, whil'st thou dost sollicite her, it
matters not very much, or rather nothing; for very shortly, when we shall espie in her
the integritie that wee expect, thou maist open unto her sinceerly the drift of our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
by which thou shalt againe recover thine impayred reputation. Therefore seeing the
Adventure is little, &amp; the pleasure thou shalt doe me by the enterprizing thereof so, too
great, I pray thee doe it, though ever so many incumbrances represent themselves to
thee, for (as I have promised) with only thy begining, I will rest satisfied and account
the cause concluded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lothario</hi> perceiving the firme resolution of <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and nothing else occurring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
disswasive, nor knowing what other reasons to use that might hinder this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
resolution; and nothing withall, how hee threatned to breake the matter of this
his indiscreete desires to a stranger; hee determined to avoide greater inconveniences,
to give him satisfaction, and performe his demand, with purpose and resolution to
guide the matter so discreetly, as without troubling <hi>Camilaes</hi> thoughts, <hi>Anselmo</hi> should
rest contented, and therefore intreated him not to open his minde to any other, for he
himselfe would undertake that enterprize, and begin it whensoever hee pleased. <hi>Ansel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>
imbraced him very tender and lovingly, and gratified him as much for that promise,
as if hee had done him some very great favour, and there they accorded betweene them,
that hee should begin the work the very next day ensuing; for hee would give him place
and leisure to speake alone with <hi>Camila,</hi> and would likewise provide him of Money,
Jewels, and other things to present unto her. Hee did also admonish him to bring mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb facs="tcp:54746:95"/>
under her windowes by night, and write verses in her prayse, and if hee would not
take the paines to make them, hee himselfe would compose them for him. <hi>Lothario</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to performe all himselfe, yet with an intention far wide from <hi>Anselmoes;</hi> and
with this agreement they returned to <hi>Anselmoes</hi> house, where they found <hi>Camila</hi> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
sad and carefull, expecting her husbands returne, who had stayed longer abroad
that day then his custome. <hi>Lothario</hi> leaving him at his house returned to his owne, as
pensive as hee had left <hi>Anselmo</hi> contented, and knew not what plot to lay, to issue out
of that impertinent affaire with prosperous successe: But that night hee bethought
himselfe of a manner how to deceive <hi>Anselmo</hi> without offending <hi>Camila;</hi> and so the
next day ensuing hee came to his friends house to dinner, where <hi>Camila</hi> knowing the
great good will her husband bore towards him, did receive and entertayne him very
kindly with the like; dinner being ended, and the table taken up, <hi>Anselmo</hi> requested
<hi>Lothario</hi> to keepe <hi>Camila</hi> companie untill his returne, for hee must needs goe about an
affaire that concerned him greatly, but would returne againe within an houre and an
halfe. <hi>Camila</hi> intreated her husband to stay, and <hi>Lothario</hi> proffered to goe and
keepe him company, but nothing could prevaile with <hi>Anselmo,</hi> but rather hee impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
his friend <hi>Lothario</hi> to remayne and abide there till his returne, because hee must
goe to treat of a matter of much consequence. Hee also commanded <hi>Camila</hi> not to
leave <hi>Lothario</hi> alone untill hee came backe. And so hee departed, leaving <hi>Camila</hi> and
<hi>Lothario</hi> together at the Table, by reason that all the attendants and servants were gone
to dinner.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Lothario</hi> saw that hee was entred into the Lists which his friend so much desired,
with his Adversary before him, who was with her beautie able to overcome a whole
squadron of armed Knights; see then if <hi>Lothario</hi> had not reason to feare himselfe? but
that which hee did at the first onset, was to lay his elbow on the arme of his chair and
his hand on his cheek, and desiring <hi>Camila</hi> to bear with his respectlesnesse therein, he
said he would repose a little whilest he attended <hi>Anselmo's</hi> comming. <hi>Camila</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that shee thought hee might take his ease better on the Cushions of State; and
therefore prayed him hee would enter into the Parlour and lie on them: But hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
himself, and so remained asleep in the same place, untill <hi>Anselmo's</hi> return, who
comming in, and finding his Wife in her Chamber and <hi>Lothario</hi> asleep, made full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that by reason of his long stay, they had time enough both to talk and repose;
and therefore expected very greedily the houre wherein his friend should awake, to
goe out with him and learn what successe he had. All succeeded as hee wished; for
<hi>Lothario</hi> arose, and both of them went abroad; and then he demanded of him, what
hee desired: And <hi>Lothario</hi> answered that it seemed not to him so good to discover all
his meaning at the first; and therefore had done no other thing at that time, then speak
a little of her Beauty and Discretion; for it seemed to him that this was the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
hee could use to gain by little and little some interest and possession in her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
to dispose her thereby the better to give eare again to his words more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
imitating therein the Divells craft when hee means to deceive any one that is
vigilant and carefull; for then he translates himself into an Angell of light, being one
of darknesse, and laying before him apparent good, discovers what hee is in the end,
and brings his intention to passe, if his guiles bee not at the beginning detected. All this
did greatly like <hi>Anselmo,</hi> who said that hee would afford him every day as much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
although he did not goe abroad; for hee would spend the time so at home as <hi>Camila</hi>
should never bee able to suspect his drift.</p>
                     <p>It therefore befell that many dayes passed which <hi>Lothario</hi> did willingly overslip, and
said nothing to <hi>Camila;</hi> yet did hee ever sooth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and told him, that he had
spoken to her, but could never win her to give the least argument of flexibilitie, or
make way for the feeblest hope that might bee; but rather affirmed that shee threatned
him, that if hee did not repell his impertinent desires, shee would detect his indirect
proceedings to her husband. It is well, quoth <hi>Anselmo:</hi> Hitherto <hi>Camila</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
words; it is therefore requisite to trie what resistance shee will make against
works: I will give thee to morrow four thousand Crowns in gold, to the end thou
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54746:95"/>
mayest offer, and also bestow them on her; and thou shalt have as many more to buy
Jewells wherewithall to bait her; for Women are naturally inclined, and specially if
they bee fair (bee they ever so chaste) to goe brave and gorgeously attired; and if shee
can overcome this temptation, I will remain pleased, and put thee to no more trouble.
<hi>Lothario</hi> answered, That seeing hee had begun, hee would bear his enterprize on to an
end, although hee made full account that hee should depart from the conflict both
tyred and vanquished. Hee received the four thousand crowns the next day, and at
once with them four thousand perplexities, for hee knew not what to invent to lie
anew; but concluded finally to tell his friend, how <hi>Camila</hi> was as inflexible at
Gifts and Promises as at words; and therefore it would bee in vaine to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
any more in her pursuit, seeing hee should doe nothing else but spend the time
in vain.</p>
                     <p>But Forturne, which guided these affairs in another manner, so disposed, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi>
having left <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Camila</hi> alone, as hee was wont, entred secretly into a
chamber, and thorow the cranies and chinks did listen and see what they would doe;
where hee perceived that <hi>Lothario,</hi> in the space of half an hour, spoke not a word to
<hi>Camila,</hi> not yet would hee have spoken, though hee had remained there a whole age;
and thereupon surmised straight that all that which his friend had told him of <hi>Camila's</hi>
answers and his own speech, were but fictions and untruths; and that hee might the
more confirm himself and see whether it were so, hee came forth, and calling <hi>Lothario</hi>
apart, hee demanded of him what <hi>Camila</hi> had said, and in what humour shee was at
the present? <hi>Lothario</hi> answered, That hee meant not ever any more to found her in
that matter; for shee replyed unto him so untowardly and sharply, as hee durst not
attempt any more to speak unto her of such things.</p>
                     <p>Oh, quoth <hi>Anselmo, Lothario, Lothario!</hi> how evill doest thou answer to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thou owest me, or to the confidence I did repose in thee? I have stood beholding
thee all this while thorow the hole of that lock, and saw how thou never spokest one
word to her: Whereby I doe also collect, that thou hast not yet once accosted her;
and if it bee so, as doubtlesly it is, say, why doest thou deceive me? or why goest thou
about fraudulently to deprive me of those means whereby I may obtain my desires?
<hi>Anselmo</hi> said no more, yet what he said was sufficient to make <hi>Lothario</hi> confused
and ashamed, who taking it to bee a blemish to his reputation to bee found in a lye,
swore to <hi>Anselmo,</hi> That hee would from thence forward so indeavour to please his
minde and tell him no more leasings, as hee himself might perceive the successe thereof,
if hee did again curiously lye in watch for him; a thing which hee might well excuse,
because him most serious labour to satisfie his desire should remove all shadow of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.
<hi>Anselmo</hi> believed him, and that hee might give him the greater commoditie, and
lesse occasion of fear, hee resolved to absent himself from his house some eight
dayes, and goe to visit a friend of his that dwelled in a Village not far from the
Cittie; and therefore dealt with his friend that hee should send a Messenger to call
for him very earnestly, that under that pretext, hee might finde an excuse to <hi>Camila</hi> for
his departure.</p>
                     <p>O infortunate and inconsiderate <hi>Anselmo!</hi> what is that which thou doest? what
doest thou contrive? or what is that thou goest about? behold, thou workest thine
own ruine, laying plots of thine own dishonour, and giving order to thy proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Thy wife <hi>Camila</hi> is good; thou doest possesse her in quiet and peaceable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
no man surpriseth thy delights; her thoughts transgresse not the limits of her
house: Thou art her Heaven on earth, and the goale to which her desires aspire: Thou
art the accomplishment and summe of her delectation: Thou art the Square by which
shee measureth and directeth her will, adjusting wholy with thine and with that of
Heaven. Since then the Mines of her Honour, Beautie, Modestie and Recollection,
bountifully afford thee, without any toyle, all the treasures contained in them, or
thou canst desire, why wouldest thou dig the earth and seek out new vains and new
seen treasures, exposing thy self to the danger, that thy labours may turn to wrack,
seeing in fine, that they are only susteined by the weak supporters of her fraile nature?

                        <hi>Anselmo</hi> departed the next day following to the Village, telling <hi>Camila</hi> at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that whil'st hee were absent, his friend <hi>Lothario</hi> would come and see to the affaires
of his house, and to eate with her, and desired her therefore to make as much of him
as shee would doe of his owne person. <hi>Camila,</hi> like a discreet and modest woman,
was grieved at the order her husband did give to her, and requested him to render how
indecent it was that any one should possesse the chayre of his Table, hee being absent,
and if hee did it as doubting her sufficiency to manage his houshould affaires, that at
least hee should make tryall of her that one time, and should cleerly perceive how shee
was able to discharge matters of far greater consequence. <hi>Anselmo</hi> replyed, that what
hee commanded was his pleasure, and therefore shee had nothing else to doe but hold
downe her head and obey it. <hi>Camila</hi> answered that shee would doe so, although it
were very much against her will. In fine her husband departed, and <hi>Lothario</hi> came the
next day following to the house, where hee was entertayned by <hi>Camila</hi> very friendly,
but would never treate with <hi>Lothario</hi> alone, but evermore was compassed by her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and waiting Maidens, but chiefly by one called <hi>Leonela,</hi> whom shee loved deerly,
as one that had been brought up with her in her fathers house, even from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
and when shee did marry <hi>Anselmo,</hi> shee brought her from thence in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>The first three dayes <hi>Lothario</hi> spoke not a word, although hee might, when the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
were taken up, and that the folke of the house went hastily to dinner, for so <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
had commanded, and did give <hi>Leonela</hi> order besides to dine before her selfe, and that
shee should still keepe by her side; but the gyrle which had her fancie otherwise imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in things more pleasing her humor, and needed those houres and times for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
of them, did not alwaies accomplish so punctually her Ladies command, but
now and then would leave her alone, as if that were her Ladies behest. But the honest
presence of <hi>Camila,</hi> the gravitie of her face, and the modestie of her carriage was such,
that it served as a bridle to restraine <hi>Lotharioes</hi> tongue. But the benefit of <hi>Camilaes</hi>
many virtues, seting silence to <hi>Lotharioes</hi> speech, resulted afterward to both their
harmes; for though the tongue spoke not, yet did his thoughts discourse, and had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
afforded them to contemplate part by part, all the extremes of worth and beautie
that were cumulated in <hi>Camila,</hi> potent to enflame a statue of frozen Marble, how
much more a heart of flesh. <hi>Lothario</hi> did only behold her in the time and space hee
should speake unto her, and did then consider how worthy shee was to be loved, And
this consideration did by little and little give assaults to the respects which hee ought to
have borne towards his friend <hi>Anselmo;</hi> a thousand times did hee determine to absent
himselfe from the Citie, and goe where <hi>Anselmo</hi> should never see him, nor hee <hi>Camila;</hi>
but the delight hee tooke in beholding her, did again withhold and hinder his resolutions.
When hee was alone, hee would condemn himselfe of his madd designe, and term him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a bad friend and worse Christian, hee made discourses and comparisons betweene
himselfe and <hi>Anselmo,</hi> all which did finish in this point that <hi>Anselmoes</hi> foole-hardinesse,

forthe crime. Finally <hi>Camilaes</hi> beautie and worths, assisted by the occasion

stagger, and her honesty had enough to doe recurring to her eyes to containe them, lest
they should give any demonstration of the amorous compassion which <hi>Lotharioes</hi> words
and teares had stirred in her brest. <hi>Lothario</hi> noted all this, and it inflamed him the
more. Finally, hee thought that it was requisite the time and leisure which <hi>Ansel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

absence afforded him, to lay closer siege to that Fortresse; and so hee assaulted her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously,
with the prayses of her beautie, for there is nothing which with such faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
doth rend and raze to the ground the proudly-crested Turrets of womens vanitie,
then the same vanitie being dilated on by the tongue of adulation and flatterie, To bee
briefe, hee did with all diligence undermine the Rock of her integritie with so warlike
Engines, as although <hi>Camila</hi> were made of brasse, yet would shee bee overthrown, for
<hi>Lothario</hi> wept, intreated, promised, flattered, persisted and fained so feelingly, and
with such tokens of truth, as traversing <hi>Cameliaes</hi> care of her honour, hee came in the
end to triumph over that which was least suspected, and hee most desired; for she ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her selfe, even <hi>Camelia</hi> rendred her selfe. But what wonder if <hi>Lotharioes</hi> amitie
could not stand on foote? A cleere example, plainly demonstrating that the amorous
passion is only vanquished by shuning it, and that no body ought to adventure to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
with so strong an Adversarie; for heavenly forces are necessarie for him that would
confront the violence of that passion, although humane. None but <hi>Leonela</hi> knew the
weakenesse of her Ladie, for from her the two bad friends and new lovers could not
conceale the matter; nor yet would <hi>Lothario</hi> discover to <hi>Camila</hi> her husbands pretence,
or that he had given him wittingly the oportunity whereby he arived to that passe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she should not imagine that he had gotten her lightly, and by chance, and did not
purposely sollicite her.</p>
                     <p>A few dayes after <hi>Anselmo</hi> arrived to his house, and did not perceive what wanted
therein, to wit, that which it had lost, and he most esteemed. From thence he went
to see his friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> whom he found at home, and embracing one another, he
demanded of him the news of his life or of his death, The news which I can give thee,
friend <hi>Anselmo,</hi> quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> are, that thou hast a wife, who may deservedly be the
example and garland of all good women. The words that I spoke unto her, were
spent on the ayre, my proffers contemned, and my gifts repulsed, and besides, she hath
mock't mee notably for certain fained teares that I did shead. In resolution, even as
<hi>Camila</hi> is the pattern of all beauty, so is she a treasury wherein modesty resides,
courtesie and warinesse dwell, and all the other vertues that may beautifie an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
woman, or make her fortunate. Therefore friend, take back thy money, for
here it is ready, and I never had occasion to imploy it: for <hi>Camila's</hi> integrity cannot
bee subdued with so base things as are gifts and promises. And <hi>Anselmo</hi> content thy
selfe now with the proofes made already, without attempting to make any farther try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
And seeing thou hast past over the Sea of difficulties and suspicions with a drie foot,
which may and are wont to bee had of women; doe not eftsoones enter into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
depths of new inconveniences, nor take thou any other Pilot to make experience
of the goodnesse and strength of the Vessell that Heaven hath alotted to thee, to passe
therein thorow the Seas of this world; but make account that thou art harboured in a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54746:97"/>
safe Haven, and there hold thy selfe fast with the Anchor of good consideration, and
so rest thee untill death come to demand his debt, from the payment whereof no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
or priviledge whatsoever can exempt us. <hi>Anselmo</hi> rested singularly satisfied at
<hi>Lotharioes</hi> discourse, and did beleeve it as firmly as if it were delivered by an Oracle:
but did intreate him notwithstanding to prosecute his attempt, although it were only
done for curiositie, and to passe away the time; yet not to use so efficacious meanes as
hee thitherto practised; and that hee only desired him to write some verses in her praise
under the name of <hi>Clori,</hi> for hee would make <hi>Camila</hi> beleeve, that hee was enamoured
on a certaine Lady, to whom hee did appropriate that name, that hee might celebrate
her prayses with the respect due to her honour, and that if hee would not take the pains
to invent them, that hee himselfe would willingly compose them. That is not needfull
quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> for the <hi>Muses</hi> are not so alienated from mee, but that they visite mee
somtimes in the yeere. Tell you unto <hi>Camila</hi> what you have devised of my loves, and
as for the verses, I will make them my selfe; if not so well as the subject deserves, yet at
the least as artificially as I may devise them: <hi>The impertinent curious</hi> man and his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
friend having thus agreed, and <hi>Anselmo</hi> returned to his house, hee demanded
of <hi>Camila</hi> that which shee marvelled hee had not asked before, that shee should tell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him the occasion why shee sent unto him the Letter? <hi>Camila</hi> made answer,
Because it seemed unto her, that <hi>Lothario</hi> beheld her some what more immodest
then when he was at home; but that now she did againe disswade her selfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that it was but a light surmise, without any ground, because that shee perceived
<hi>Lothario</hi> to loath her presence, or be by any meanes alone with her. <hi>Anselmo</hi> told her
that she might very well live secure for him, for that he knew <hi>Lothario's</hi> affections were
bestowed else-where, and that upon one of the noblest Damzels of the Citie, whose
praises hee solemnized under the name of <hi>Clori,</hi> and that although hee were not,
yet was there no cause to doubt of <hi>Lothario's</hi> virtue, or the amitie that was between
them both. Here if <hi>Camila</hi> had not been premonished by <hi>Lothario,</hi> that the love of
<hi>Clori</hi> was but fained, and that hee himself had told it to <hi>Anselmo</hi> to blinde him, that hee
might with lesse difficultie celebrate her own praises under the name of <hi>Clori,</hi> shee had
without doubt faln into the desperate toyles of jealousie; but being already advertised
shee posted over that assault lightly. The day following they three sitting together
at dinner, <hi>Anselmo</hi> requested <hi>Lothario</hi> to repeat some one of the Verses that hee had
made to his beloved <hi>Clori;</hi> for seeing that <hi>Camila</hi> knew her not, hee might boldly say
what hee pleased. Although shee knew her quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> yet would I not therefore
suppresse any part of her praises. For when any Lover praiseth his Ladie for her
beauty, and doth withall taxe her of cruelty, her credit incurs no danger. But befall
what it list, I composed yesterday a Sonnet of the ingratitude of <hi>Clori,</hi> and is this
ensuing.

                        <hi>Camila</hi> liked the Sonnet very well, but <hi>Anselmo</hi> best of all; for hee praised it, and
said, that the Lady must bee very cruell that would not answer such perspicuous truths
with reciprocall affection. But then <hi>Camila</hi> answered, Why then (belike) all that
which enamoured Poets say is true? In as much as Poets, quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> they say not
truth; but as they are inamoured, they remain as short as they are true. That is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse,
quoth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> all to underprop and give <hi>Lothario</hi> more credit with <hi>Camila,</hi>
who was as carelesse of the cause (her Husband said so) as shee was inamoured of
<hi>Lothario;</hi> and therefore with the delight shee took in his compositions, but chiefly
knowing that his desires and labours were addrest to her self, who was the true <hi>Clori,</hi>
shee intreated him to repeat some other Sonnet or Dittie, if hee remembred any. Yes
that I doe, quoth <hi>Lothario;</hi> but I believe that it is not so good as the first, as you may
well judge; for it is this.

                        <hi>Anselmo</hi> commended also this second Sonnet as hee had done the first, and added
by that means one link to another in the chain, wherewith hee intangled himself, and
forged his own dishonour; seeing when <hi>Lothario</hi> dishonoured him most of all, hee
said unto him then that hee honoured him most. And herewithall <hi>Camila</hi> made all
the links, that verily served only to abase her down to the Center of contempt,
seem to mount her in her Husbands opinion up to the height of virtue and good
fame.</p>
                     <p>It befell soon after, that <hi>Camila</hi> finding her self alone with her Maiden, said to her,
I am ashamed, friend <hi>Leonela,</hi> to see how little I knew to value my self, seeing that I
made not <hi>Lothario</hi> spend some time at least in the purchasing the whole possession of
me, which I, with a prompt will, bestowed upon him so speedily: I fear me that hee will
impute my hastinesse to lightnesse, without considering the force hee used towards me,
which wholly hindred and disabled my resistance. Let not that afflict you Madam,
quoth <hi>Leonela;</hi> for it is no sufficient cause to diminish estimation, that that bee given
quickly which is to bee given, if that in effect be good that is given, and be in it self
worthy of estimation; for it is an old proverb, <hi>That hee that gives quickly, gives twice.</hi>
It is also said as well, quoth <hi>Camila, That that which costeth little, is lesse esteemed.</hi> That
reason hath no place in you, quoth <hi>Leonela,</hi> for as much as Love, according as some
have said of it, doth sometimes flie, other times it goes; it runs with this man, and
goes leisurely with the other; it makes some key-cold, and inflames others; some it
wounds, and some it kills; it begins the Career of his desires in an instant, and in the
very same concludes it likewise: It is wont to lay siedge to the Fortresse in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and at night it makes it to yield, for there's no force able to resist it: which being
so, what doe you wonder? or what is it that you fear, if the same hath befaln <hi>Lothario,</hi>
seeing that Love made of my Lords absence an instrument to vanquish us? And it was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54746:98"/>
forcible, that in it wee should conclude on it which Love had before determined, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving time it self any time to lead <hi>Anselmo</hi> that hee might return, and with his
presence leave the work imperfect: For Love hath none so officious or better a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to execute his desires then is occasion: It serves it self of occasion in all his act,
but most of all at the beginning: And all this that I have said I know rather by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
then hear-say, as I will some day let you to understand: for, Madam, I am
likewise made of flesh and lustie young blood: And as for you, Ladie <hi>Camila,</hi> you
did not give up and yeeld your self presently, but stayed untill you had first seen in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorio's</hi>
eyes, his sighs in his discourses, in his promises, and gifts all his soul, in which
and in his perfections, you might read how worthy hee is to bee loved. And seeing this
is so, let not these scruples and nice thoughts assault or further disturb your minde, but
perswade your self that <hi>Lothario</hi> esteems you as much as you doe him, and lives with
content and satisfaction, seeing that it was your Fortune to fall into the amorous
Snare, that it was his good luck to catch you with his valour and deserts; who not
only hath the four <hi>S. S.</hi> which they say every good Lover ought to have, but also the
whole A. A. C. which if you will not credit, doe but listen to me a while, and I will
repeat it to you by roate. He is, as it seems, and as far as I can judge, Amiable, Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
Courteous, Dutifull, Enamoured, Firm, Gallant, Honourable, Illustrious, Loyall,
Milde, Noble, Honest, Prudent, Quiet, Rich, and the S. S. which they say; and besides
True, Valourous: the X. doth not quader well with him, because it sounds harshly:
Y. hee is Young; and the Z. hee is Zealous of thine honour. <hi>Camila</hi> laughed at her
Maydens A. B. C. and accounted her to bee more practick in Love-matters then she
her self had confessed, as indeed shee was; for then shee revealed to her Mistrisse, how
she and a certain young man, well born, of the Citie, did treat of Love one with another.
Hereat her Mistrisse was not a little troubled in minde, fearing that her honour might
bee greatly indangered by that means; shee demanded whether her affection had passed
farther then words? And the Maid answered very shamelesly and freely, that they did:
for it is most certain, that this kinde of wretchlesse Mistrisses doe also make their
Maydens carelesse and impudent; who when they perceive their Ladies to faulter, are
commonly wont to hault likewise themselves, and care not that the World doe
know it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Camila</hi> seeing that errour past remedie, could doe no more but intreate <hi>Leonela,</hi> not
to reveale any thing of their affaires to him shee said was her sweet heart, and that shee
should handle her matters discreetly and secretly, lest they might come to <hi>Anselmo</hi> or
<hi>Lotharioes</hi> notice. <hi>Leonela</hi> promised to performe her will; but did accomplish her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in such sort, as shee did confirme <hi>Camilaes</hi> feares, that shee should lose her credit
by her meanes. For the dishonest and bold Gyrle, after shee had perceived that her
Mistrisses proceedings were not such as they were wont, grew so hardy, as shee gave
entrance and brought her Lover into her Masters house, presuming that although her
Ladie knew it, yet would shee not dare to discover it. For this among other harmes
follow the sinns of Mistrisses, that it makes them slaves to their own servants, and doth
oblige them to them to conceale their dishonest and base proceedings, as it fel out in
<hi>Camila,</hi> who, although she espied <hi>Leonela,</hi> not once only, but sundry times together
with her Lover in a certain chamber of the house, she not onely dared not to rebuke her
for it, but rather gave her opportunity to hide him, and would remoove all occasion out
of her husbands way, whereby he might suspect any such thing.</p>
                     <p>But all could not hinder <hi>Lothario</hi> from espying him once, as he departed out of the
house at the break of the day: who not knowing him, thought at the first it was a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but when he saw him post away, and cast his cloke over his face, lest he should be
known, he abandoning his simple surmise, fel into a new suspition which had overthrown
them all, were it not that <hi>Camila</hi> did remedie it. For <hi>Lothario</hi> though, that he whom
he had seen issue out of <hi>Anselmo's</hi> house at so unreasonable an hour, had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into it for <hi>Leonela's</hi> sake, nor did he remember then that there was such a one as
<hi>Leonela</hi> in the world, but onely thought, that as <hi>Camila</hi> was lightly gotten by him, so
belike she was wonn by some other. For the wickednesse of a bad woman bringeth
<pb facs="tcp:54746:99"/>
usually all these additions, that she loseth her reputation even with him, to whom pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and perswaded shee yeeldeth her self: and he beleeveth that shee will as easily, or
with more facility consent to others, and doth infallibly credit the least suspition
which thereof may be offered.</p>
                     <p>And it seems that <hi>Lothario</hi> in this instant was wholly deprived of all reasonable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and quite dispoyled of his understanding; for without pondering of the matter,
impatient and kindled by the jealous rage that inwardly gnawed his bowels, fretting
with desire to be revenged on <hi>Camila,</hi> who had never offended him, he came to <hi>Ansel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>
before he was up, and said to him, Know, <hi>Anselmo,</hi> that I have had these many dayes
a civill conflict within my self whether I should speak or no, and I have used as much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
as I might, to my selfe, not to discover a thing unto you, which now it is neither
just nor reasonable I should conceale. Know that <hi>Camila's</hi> fortresse is rendred, and
subject to all that I please to command, and if I have been somewhat slow to inform
the this of truth: it was because I would first see, whether it proceeded of some light
appetite in her: or whether she did it to trie me, and see whether that love was still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
continued, which I first began to make unto her by thy order and licence. I did
also beleeve, that if she had been such as she ought to be, and her that we both esteemed
her, she would have by this time acquainted you with my importunacy: but seeing
that she lingers therein, I presume that her promises made unto me are true, that when
you did again absent your self out of town, she would speak with me in the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe
(and it was true: for there <hi>Camila</hi> was accustomed to talke with him) yet would
not I have thee runne rashly to take revenge, seeing the sinne is not yet otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
then in thought, and perhaps between this and the oportunity shee might hope
to put it in execution, her minde would bee changed, and shee repent her self of her
folly: And therefore seeing thou hast ever followed mine advice partly or wholly,
follow and keep one counsell that I will give unto thee now, to the end that thou mayest
after, with carefull assurance, and without fraud, satisfie thine own will as thou likest
best; faine thy self to bee absent two or three dayes as thou art wont, and then convey
thy self cunningly into the Wardrobe, where thou mayest very well hide thy self behinde
the Tapestry, and then thou shalt see with thine own eyes, and I with mine, what
<hi>Camila</hi> will doe; and if it bee that wickednesse which rather ought to bee feared then
hoped for, thou mayest with wisedome, silence, and discretion, bee the proper executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of so injurious a wrong.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anselmo</hi> remained amazed, and almost besides himself, hearing his friend <hi>Lothario</hi>
so unexpectedly to acquaint him with those things in a time whereing hee least expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them; for now hee esteemed <hi>Camila</hi> to have escaped victresse from the forged
assaults of <hi>Lothario,</hi> and did himself triumph for glorie of her victorie. Suspended
thus and troubled, hee stood silent a great while looking on the earth, without once
removing his eye from it; and finally, turning towards his friend, hee said; <hi>Lothario,</hi> thou
hast done all that which I could expect from so intire amitie, and I doe therefore mean
to follow thine advice in all things precisely: Doe therefore what thou pleasest, and
keep that secret which is requisite in so weighty and unexpected an event. All that I
doe promise, quoth <hi>Lothario:</hi> and so departed wholly repented for that hee had told to
<hi>Anselmo,</hi> seeing how foolishly hee had proceeded, since hee might have revenged himself
on <hi>Camila</hi> very well, without taking a way so cruell and dishonourable. There did hee
curse his little wit, and abased his light resolution, and knew not what means to use to
destroy what hee had done, or give it some reasonable and contrary issue. In the end
hee resolved to acquaint <hi>Camila</hi> with the whole matter, and by reason that hee never
missed of oportunity to speake unto her, hee found her alone the very same day; and
shee seeing likewise that shee had fit time to speak unto him, said, Know, friend <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario,</hi>
that a certain thing doth pinch my heart in such manner, as it seems ready to burst
in my brest, as doublesly I fear me that in time it will, if wee cannot set a remedie to
it: For such is the immodesty of <hi>Leonela,</hi> as shee shuts up a Lover of hers every night
in this house and remains with him untill day-light, which so much concernes my credit,
as it leaves open a spacious field to him that sees the other goe out of my house at so
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54746:99"/>
unseasonable times, to judge of me what hee pleaseth; and that which most grieves me
is, that I dare not punish or rebuke her for it: For shee being privie to our proceedings,
sets a bridle on me, and constrains me to conceale hers; and hence I fear will bad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
befall us. <hi>Lothario</hi> at the first suspected that <hi>Camila</hi> did speak thus, to make him
believe that the man whom hee had espied was <hi>Leonelaes</hi> friend, and none of hers: but
seeing her to weep indeed, and bee greatly afflicted in minde, hee began at last to give
credit unto the truth, and believing it, was greatly confounded and grieved for that
hee had done: And yet notwithstand hee answered <hi>Camila,</hi> that shee should not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or vexe her self any more; for hee would take such order, as <hi>Leonelaes</hi> impudencies
should bee easily crost and suppressed: And then did recount unto her all that hee
had said to <hi>Anselmo,</hi> spur'd on by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> furious rage of jealous indignation, and how
her Husband had agreed to hide himself behinde the Tapestry of the Wardrobe, that
hee might from thence cleerly perceive the little Loyalty shee kept towards him,
and demanded pardon of her for that folly and counsell to redresse it, and come safely
out of the intricate Labyrinth whereinto his weake-eyed discourse had conducted
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Camila</hi> having heard <hi>Lothario's</hi> discourse, was afraid and amazed, and with great
anger and many and discrect reasons, did rebuke him, reviling the basenesse of his
thoughts, and the simple and little consideration that hee had. But as women have
naturally a suddain with for good or bad, much more prompt then men; although
when indeed they would make discourses, it proves defective: So <hi>Camila</hi> found in an
instant a remedy for an affair in appearance so irremediable and helplesse; and therefore
bade <hi>Lothario</hi> to induce his friend <hi>Anselmo</hi> to hide himself the next day ensuing, for
shee hoped to take commodity out of his being there for them both to enjoy one another
with more security then ever they had before: and without wholy manifesting her
proverb to him, shee only advertised him to have care, that after <hi>Anselmo</hi> were hidden
hee should presently come when <hi>Leonela</hi> called for him, and that hee should answer
her as directly to every question she proposed, as if <hi>Anselmo</hi> were not in place. <hi>Lothario</hi>
did urge her importunately to declare her designe unto him, to the end hee might with
more security and advice obscure all that was necessarie. I say, quoth <hi>Camila,</hi> there
is no other observance to bee had, then only to answer me directly to what I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
For shee would not give him account before-hand of her determination,
fearfull that hee would not conform himself to her opinion which shee took to bee so
good; or else lest hee would follow or seek any other, that would not prove after so
well. Thus departed <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Anselmo,</hi> under pretext that hee would visit his
friend, out of Town departed, and returned convertly back again to hide himself, which
hee could doe the more commodiously, because <hi>Camila</hi> and <hi>Leonela</hi> did purposely
afford him oportunity. <hi>Anselmo</hi> having hidden himself with the grief that may bee
imagined one would conceive, who did expect to see with his own eyes an Anatomie
made of the bowels of his honour, and was in danger to lose the highest felicitie that
hee accounted himself to possesse in his beloved <hi>Camila. Camila</hi> and <hi>Leonela</hi>
being certain that hee was hidden within the Wardrobe, entred into it, wherein scarce
had <hi>Camila</hi> set her foot, when breathing forth of a deep sigh, shee spoke in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>Ah friend <hi>Leonela!</hi> were it not better, that before I put in execution, that which I
would not have thee to know, lest thou shouldest indeavour to hinder it, that thou
takest <hi>Anselmo's</hi> Ponyard that I have sought of thee, and passe this infamous brest of
mine thorow and thorow? but doe it not, for it is no reason that I should suffer for
other mens faults: I will know first of all, what the bold and dishonest eyes of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario</hi>
noted in me, that should stir in him the presumption to discover unto me so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
a desire as that which hee hath revealed, so much in contempt of his friend,
and to my dishonour: Stand at that Window <hi>Leonela,</hi> and call him to me; for I
doe infallibly believe, that hee stands in the street awaiting to effect his wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
But first my cruell, yet honourable minde shall bee performed. Alas, dear
Madame (quoth the wise and craftie <hi>Leonela</hi>) what is it you mean to doe with that
<pb facs="tcp:54746:100"/>
Ponyard? Meane you perhaps to deprive either your owne or <hi>Lotherioes</hi> life therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?
for which soever of these things you doe, shall redound to the losse of your credit
and fame. It is much better that you dissemble your wrong, and give no occasion to the
bad man now to enter into this house, and finde us here in it alone: Consider good
Madame, how wee are but weake women, and hee is a Man, and one resolute, and by
reason that hee comes blinded by his bad and passionate intent, hee may peradventure
before you bee able to put yours in execution, doe somwhat that would bee worse for
you, then to deprive you of your life. Evill befall my master <hi>Anselmo,</hi> that ministers
so great occasion to impudencie, thus to discover her visage in our house; and if you
should kill him by chance Madam, as I suspect you meane to doe, what shall wee doe
after with the dead carcasse? What said <hi>Camila?</hi> Wee would leave him here that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi>
might bury him. For hee must in all equity esteeme that labour for ease, which he
shall passe, in the interring of his owne infamie. Make an end then and call him, for
mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thinkes that all the time which I spend untakeing due revenge of my
just Disdaine, turnes into the prejudice of the Loyaltie which I owe unto my
Spouse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anselmo</hi> listened very attentively all the while, and at every word that <hi>Camila</hi> said,
his thoughts changed. But when hee understood that shee was resolved to kill <hi>Lothario,</hi>
hee was about to come out and discover himselfe, to the end that such a thing should
not bee done; but the desire that hee had to see wherein so brave and honest a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would end, with-held him, determining then to sallie out, when his presence should
bee needfull to hinder it. <hi>Camila</hi> about this time began to bee very weake and dismai'd,
and casting her selfe, as if shee had faln into a trance upon a bed that was in the roome,
<hi>Leonela</hi> began to lament very bitterly and to say, Alas, wretch that I am, how unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
should I bee, if the flowre of the worlds honesty, the crown of good women,
and the patterne of chastitie should die here betweene my hands? Those and such other
things shee said so dolefully, as no one could heare her, that would not deeme her to
bee one of the most esteemed and loyall Damzels of the world; and take her Ladie for
another new and persecuted <hi>Penelope.</hi> Soone after <hi>Camila</hi> returned to her selfe, and
said presently. Why goest thou not <hi>Leonela,</hi> to call the most disloyall friend of a friend
that ever the Sun beheld, or the night concealed? Make an end, runne, make haste,
and let not the fire of my choller bee through thy stay consumed and spent, nor the just
revenge, which I hope to take, passe over in threats or maledictions. I goe to call him
Madam, quoth <hi>Leonela,</hi> but first of all you must give mee that Ponyard, lest you should
doe with it in mine absence somewhat, that would minister occasion to us your friends
to deplore you all the daies of our lives. Goe away boldly, friend <hi>Leonela,</hi> said <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela,</hi>
for I shall doe nothing in thine absence; for although I bee in thine opinion both
simple and bold enough to turne for mine honour, yet meane I not to bee so much
as the celebrated <hi>Lucretia,</hi> of whom it is recorded that shee slew her selfe, without
having committed any errour or slaine him first who was the principall cause of her
disgrace: I will die if I must needes die; but I will bee satisfied and revenged on him
that hath given mee occasion to come into this place to lament his boldnesse, sprung
without my default.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leonela</hi> could scarcely be intreated to goe and call <hi>Lothario,</hi> but at last she went out,
and in the mean time <hi>Camila</hi> remained, speaking to her self these words: Good God,
had not it been more discretion to have dissmised <hi>Lothario,</hi> as I did many time before,
then thus to possesse him as I have done, with an opinion that I am an evill and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
woman, at least all the while that passeth, untill mine acts shal undeceive him, and
teach him the contrary? It had been doubtlesly better: but then should not I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged,
nor my husbands honour satisfied, if hee were permitted to beare away so cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his malignitie, or escape out of the snare wherein his wicked thoughts involved him.
Let the Traytor pay with his lifes defrayment, that which hee attempted with so lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
a desire. Let the world know (if it by chance shall come to know it) that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila</hi>
did not only conserve the loyaltie due to her Lord, but also tooke revenge of the
intended spoyle thereof: But yet I beleeve that it were best to give <hi>Anselmo</hi> first notice
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54746:100"/>
thereof; but I did already touch it to him in the Letter which I wrote to him to the
Village; and I believe his not concurring to take order in this so manifest an abuse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
of his too sincere and good meaning, which would not, nor cannot beleive that
the like kinde of thought could ever finde entertainment in the brest of so firm a friend,
tending so much to his dishonour: and what marvell if I my self could not credit it
for a great many dayes together? nor would I ever have thought it if his insolencie had
not arived to that passe which the manifest Gifts, large Promises, and continuall tears
hee shed doe give testimony. But why doe I make now these discourses? Hath a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
resolution perhaps any need of advice? No verily; therefore avaunt treacherous
thoughts, here wee must use revenge: Let the false man come in; arive; die and end,
and let after befall what can befall. I entered pure and untouched to his possession
whom Heaven bestowd on me for mine, and I will depart from him purely: And if
the worst befall, I shall only be defiled by mine own chaste blood, and the impure gore
of the falsest friend that ever amitie saw in this World. And saying of this, shee pranced
up and down the Room with the Ponyard naked in her hand, with such long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
strides, and making withall such gestures, as shee rather seemed defective of
wit, and a desperate Russian then a delicate woman.</p>
                     <p>All this <hi>Anselmo</hi> perceived very well from behinde the Arras that covered him,
which did not a little admire him; and hee thought that what he had seen and heard
was a sufficient satisfaction of farre greater suspicions then he had, and could have
wished with all his heart that the triall of <hi>Lothario's</hi> comming might bee excused, fearing
greatly some suddain bad successe: and as hee was ready to manifest himself, and to
come out and imbrace and disswade his wife, hee withdrew himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee saw <hi>Leonela</hi> return, bringing <hi>Lothario</hi> in by the hand: And as soon as <hi>Camila</hi>
beheld him, shee drew a great stroke with the poynt of the Ponyard athwart the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe,
saying; <hi>Lothario,</hi> note well what I mean to say unto thee; for if by chance thou
beest so hardy as to passe over this line which thou seest, e're I come as farre as it, I will
in the very same instant stab my self into the heart with this Ponyard which I hold in
my hand: and before thou doest speak or answer me any word, I would first have
thee to listen to a few of mine; for after thou mayest say what thou pleasest.</p>
                     <p>First of all I would have thee, O <hi>Lothario!</hi> to say whether thou knowest my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Anselmo,</hi> and what opinion thou hast of him? And next I would have thee to
tell me if thou knowest my self? answer to this without delay, nor doe not stand long
thinking on what thou art to answer, seeing they are no deep questions which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
unto thee. <hi>Lothario</hi> was not so ignorant, but that from the very beginning when
<hi>Camila</hi> requested him to perswade her Husband to hide himself behinde the Tapistrey,
hee had not fallen on the drift of her invention; and therefore did answer her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so aptly and discreetly as they made that untruth passe between them for a more
then manifest verity: and so hee answered to <hi>Camila</hi> in this forme. I did never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
Beautifull <hi>Camila,</hi> that thou wouldest have called me here to demand of me
things so wide from the purpose for which I come: if thou doest it to defer yet the
promised favour, thou mightest have entertained it yet farther off, for the good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
afflicteth so much the more, by how much the hope to possesse it is neer. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou mayest not accuse me for not answering to thy demands, I say that I know
thy Husband <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and both of us know one another even from our tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
and I will not omit to say that which thou also knowest of our amity, to make
me thereby a witnesse against my self of the wrong which Love compells me to doe
unto him, yet Love is a sufficient excuse and excuse of greater errous then are mine.
Thee doe I likewise know and hold in the same possession that hee doth; for were it
not so, I should never have been won by lesse perfections then thine, to transgresse so
much that which I owe to my self and to the holy Laws of true Amity, now broken and
violated by the tyrannie of so powerfull an Adversary as Love hath proved. If thou
doest acknowledge that, replyed <hi>Camila,</hi> O mortall enemie of all that which justly
deserveth Love! with what face darest thou then appear before that which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to bee the Mirrour wherein hee looks, in whom thou also oughtest to behold thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:101"/>
to the end thou mightest perceive upon how little occasion thou dost wrong him?
But unfortunate that I am, I fall now in the reason which hath moved thee to make so
little account of thine owne duty, which was perhaps some negligent or light behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of mine, which I will not call dishonesty, seeing that as I presume, it hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from mee deliberately, but rather through the carelessnesse that women which
thinke they are not noted, doe sometimes unwittingly commit. If not, say Traytor,
when did I ever answere thy Prayers with any world or token that might awake in thee
the least shadow of hope to accomplish thine infamous desires? When were not thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
intreaties reprehended and dispersed by the roughnesse and rigour of mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres?
When were thy many promises and lager gifts ever beleeved or admitted?
But for as much as I am perswaded that no man can persevere long time in the amorous
contention, who hath not beene susteined by some hope, I will attribute the fault of
thine impertinence to my selfe; for doubtlesly some carelesnesse of mine hath hitherto
susteined thy care, and therefore I will chastise and give to my selfe the punishment
which thy fault deserveth. And because thou mightest see that I being so inhumane to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my selfe, could not possibly bee other then cruell to thee, I thought fit to call
thee to bee a witnesse of the Sacrifice which I meane to make to the offended honour of
my most honourable husband, tainted by thee, with the blackest note that thy malice
could devise, and by me, through the negligence that I used, to shun the occasion, if I
gave thee any, thus to nourish and canonize thy wicked intentions. I say againe, that
the suspicion I have, that my little regard hath ingendred in thee these distracted
thoughts, is that which afflicteth mee most, and that which I meane to chastise most
with mine owne hands; for if another executioner punished mee, then should my crime
become more notorious. but before I doe this, I dying, will kill, and carie him away
with mee, that shall end and satisfie the greedie desire of revenge which I hope
for, and I have; seeing before mine eyes wheresoever I shall goe, the punishment which
disingaged justice shall inflict, it still remayning unbowed or suborned by him, which
hath brought me to so desperate termes.</p>
                     <p>And having said these words, shee flew upon <hi>Lothario</hi> with incredible force and
lightnesse, and her Ponyard naked, giving such arguments and tokens that shee meant
to stab him, as hee himselfe was in doubt whether her demonstrations were false or true;
wherefore hee was driven to helpe himselfe by his wit and strength, for to hinder <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
from striking of him, who did so lively act her strange guile and fiction, as to give it
colour, shee would give it a blush of her owne blood: for perceiving, or else feighning
that shee could not hurt <hi>Lothario,</hi> shee said, Seeing that adverse fortune will not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
throughly my just desires, yet at least it shall not bee potent wholly to crosse my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes:
and then striving to free the dagger hand, which <hi>Lothario</hi> held fast, shee snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it away, and directing the point to some place of her body, which might hurt her,
but not very grievously, shee stab'd her selfe, and hid it in her apparell neere unto the
left shoulder, and fell forthwith to the ground, as if shee were in a trance, <hi>Lothario</hi>
and <hi>Leonela</hi> stood amazed at the unexpected event, and still rested doubtfull of the
truth of the matter, seeing <hi>Camila</hi> to lye on the ground bathed in her blood: <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>
ranne all wanne and pale, very hastily to her, to take out the Ponyard, and seeing
how little blood followed, hee lost the feare that hee had conceived of her greater hurt,
and began a new to admire the cunning wit and discretion of the beautifull <hi>Camila;</hi>
but yet that hee might play the part of a friend, hee began a long and dolefull lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
over <hi>Camila's</hi> body, even as she were dead, and began to breathe forth many cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and execrations not onely against himself, but also against him that had imployed
him in that unfortunate affaire. And knowing that his friend <hi>Anselmo</hi> did listen unto
him, he said such things as would move a man to take more compassion of him then of
<hi>Camila</hi> her selfe, although they accounted her dead. <hi>Leonela</hi> tooke her up betweene
her armes, and laid her on the Bed, and intreated <hi>Lothario</hi> to goe out, and finde some
one that would undertake to cure her secretly. Shee also demanded of him his advice,
touching the excuse they might make to <hi>Anselmo</hi> concerning her Mistresse her wound,
if hee came to towne before it were fully cured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:54746:101"/>Hee answered, that they might say what they pleased, for hee was not in an humour
of giving any counsell worth the following; and only said this, that shee should labour
to stanch her Ladies blood; for he meant to goe there whence they should hear no news
of him ever after: And so departed out of the house with very great tokens of grief and
feeling; and when hee was alone in place where no body perceived him, hee blest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a thousand times to think of <hi>Camilaes</hi> art, and the gestures so proper and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the purpose, used by her Maid <hi>Leonela.</hi> Hee considered how assured <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi>
would remain that hee had a second <hi>Portia</hi> to wife, and desired to meet him, that
they might celebrate together the fiction, and the best dissembled truth that could bee
ever imagined. <hi>Leonela,</hi> as is said, stanched her Ladies blood, which was just as much
as might serve to colour her invention and no more; and washing the would with
some Wine, shee tyed it up the best that shee could, saying such words whilest shee
cured her as were able, though nothing had been done before, to make <hi>Anselmo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that hee had an Image of honestly in <hi>Camila</hi> to the plants of <hi>Leonela: Camila</hi>
added others, terming her self a Coward of base Spirit since shee wanted time (being a
thing so necessary) to deprive her life which shee hated so mortally; shee demanded
counsell of her Maiden, whether shee would tell or conceal all that successe to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Spouse: And shee answered, That it was best to conceal it, lest shee should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
her Husband to bee revenged on <hi>Lothario,</hi> which would not bee done without
his very great perill, and that every good Wife was bound, not to give occasion to her
Husband of quarrelling, but rather to remove from him as many as was possible.
<hi>Camila</hi> answered, That shee allowed of her opinion, and would follow it; and that
in any sort they must studie some device to cloak the occasion of her hurt from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo,</hi>
who could not chuse but espye it. To this <hi>Leonela</hi> answered, That shee her self
knew not how to lye, no, not in very jest it self. Well friend, quoth <hi>Camila,</hi> and I,
what doe I know? for I dare not to forge or report an untruth if my life lay on it:
And if wee know not how to give it a better issue, it will bee better to report the naked
truth then to bee overtaken in a leasing. Doe not trouble your self Madame, quoth
<hi>Leonela;</hi> for I will bethink my self of somewhat between this and to morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and perhaps the wound may be concealed from him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> by reason that it is in the place
where it is; and Heaven perhaps may bee pleased to favour our so just and honourable
thoughts. Bee quiet, good Madam, and labour to appease your alteration of minde,
that my Lord at his return may not finde you perplexed; and leave all the rest to Gods
and my charge, who doth allwaies assist the just.</p>
                     <p>With highest attention stood <hi>Anselmo</hi> listening and beholding the Tragedy of his
dying honours, which the personages thereof had acted with so strange and forceable
effects, as it verily seemed that they were transformed into the opposite truth of their
well contrived fiction: Hee longed greatly for the night and leisure to get out of his
house, that hee might goe and congratulate with his good friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Jewell that hee had found in this last tryall of his Wife. The Mistrisse and Maiden
had as great care to give him the oportunity to depart; and hee fearing to lose it, issued
out in a trice, and went presently to finde <hi>Lothario,</hi> who being found, it is not possible
to recount the imbracements hee gave unto him, the secrets of his contentment that hee
revealed, or the attributes and praises that hee gave to <hi>Camila.</hi> All which <hi>Lothario</hi>
heard, without giving the least argument of Love; having represented to his minde
at that very time, how greatly deceived his friend lived, and how injustly hee himself
injuried him. And although that <hi>Anselmo</hi> noted that <hi>Lothario</hi> took no delight at his
relation, yet did hee believe that the cause of his sorrow proceeded from having left
<hi>Camila</hi> wounded, and hee himself given the occasion thereof: And therefore
among many other words, said unto him, That there was no occasion to grieve at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milaes</hi>
hurt, it doubtlesly being but light, seeing shee and her Maid had agreed to hide
it from him; and that according unto this there was no great cause of fear, but that
from thence forward hee should live merrily and contentedly with him, seeing that by
his industry and means, hee found himself raised to the highest felicitie that might bee
desired; and therefore would from thenceforth spend his idle times in writing of
<pb facs="tcp:54746:102"/>
Verses in <hi>Camila's</hi> praise, that hee might eternize her name, and make it famous in
insuing ages. <hi>Lothario</hi> commended his resolution therein, and said that hee for his part
would also help to raise up so noble an edefice; and herewithall <hi>Anselmo</hi> rested the
most soothingly and contentedly deceived that could be found in the World: And
then himself took by the hand to his house (believing that hee bore the instrument of
his glory) the utter perdition of his fame. <hi>Camila</hi> entertained him with a frowning
countenance, but a cheerfull minde: the fraud rested unknown a while, untill at the
end of certain moneths, Fortune turned the wheel, and the wickednesse that was so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
cloaked, issued to the publique notice of the World; and <hi>Anselmo</hi> his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent-curiosity
cost him his life.</p>

ranne out of the Chamber where his Lord reposed, crying
as loud as he could, Come, good Sirs, speedily, and assist my Lord,
who is ingaged in one of the most terrible battails that ever mine eyes
have seen: I swear that hee hath given such a blow to the Giant, my
Lady the Princesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> her enemie, as hee hath cut his
head quite off as round as a Turnep.</p>
                     <p>What sayest thou friend, quoth the Curate (leaving off at that word to prosecute
the reading of his novell) art thou in thy wits <hi>Sancho?</hi> What a Divill man, how can
that bee, seeing the Giant dwels at least two thousand leagues from hence? By this
they heard a marvellous great noyse within the Chamber, and that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> cried
out aloud, Stay false Thiefe, Robber, stay; for since thou art here, thy Semiter shall
but little availe thee: and therewithall it seemed that hee struck a number of mighty
blows on the walls. And <hi>Sancho</hi> said, There is no need tostand thus listening abroad,
but rather that you goe in and part the fray, or else assist my Lord; although I think it
bee not very necessary: for the Gyant is questionlesse dead by this, and giving account
for the ill life hee led: For I saw his blood runne all about the house, and his head cut
off, which is as great as a great Wine-bagge. I am content to bee hewn in pieces, quoth
the Inn-keeper, hearing of this, if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> or <hi>Don-Divell</hi> have not given some
blow to one of the Wine-baggs that stood filled at his Beds-head, and the shed Wine
must needs bee that which seems blood to this good man: And saying so, hee entred
into the Room, and all the rest followed him, where they found <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in the
strangest guise that may bee imagined: Hee was in his Shirt, the which was not long
enough before to cover his Thighs, and it was six fingers shorter behinde: His Leggs were
very long and lean, full of hair, and horrible dirty: Hee wore on his Head a little red,
but very greazie night Cap, which belonged to the Inn-keeper: Hee had wreathed
on his left Arme the Coverlet of his Bead; on which <hi>Sancho</hi> looked very often and
angerly, as one that knew well the cause of his own malice to it: and in his right hand
hee griped his naked Sword, wherewithall hee laid round about him many a thwack;
and withall spake as if hee were in battail with some Gyant: And the best of
all was, that hee held not his eyes open; for hee was indeed asleep and dreaming that
he was in fight with the Gyant: For the imagination of the Adventure which hee had
undertaken to finish, was so bent upon it, as it made him to dream that hee was already
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54746:102"/>
arived at the kingdom of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> and that he was then in combat with his enemy,
and he had given so many blowes on the wine bags, supposing them to be Giants, as all
the whol chamber flowed with wine: Which being perceived by the Host, all infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with rage, hee set upon <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with drie sists, and gave unto him so many
blowes, that if <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate had not taken him away, he would doubtlesly
have finished the war of the Gyant, and yet with all this did not the poor Knight awake
untill the Barber brought in a great kettle full of cold water from the Well, and threw
it all at a clap upon him, and therewithall <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> awaked, but not in such sort as
he perceived the manner wherein he was. <hi>Dorotea</hi> seeing how short and how thin her
Champion was arayed, would not goe in to see the conflict of her combatant and his
Adversarie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> went up and downe the floore searching for the Gyants head, and seeing
that hee could not finde it hee said, Now I doe see very well, that all the things of this
house are inchantments, for the last time that I was here, in this very same roome, I got
many blowes and buffets, and knew not who did strike mee, nor could I see any body;
and now the head appeares not, which I saw cut off with mine owne eyes, and yet the
blood ran as swiftly from the body, as water would from a Fountaine. What blood,
or what Fountaine doest thou tattle of here, thou enemy of God and his Saints?
quoth the In-keeper, thou Theefe, dost not thou see that the blood and the fountaine
is no other thing then these wine-bags which are slashed here, and the wine red that
swims up and down this Chamber (and I wish that I may see his Soule swimming in hell
which did bore them. I know nothing replyed <hi>Sancho</hi> but this, that if I cannot find the
Giants head, I shall become so unfortunate, as mine Earledome will dissolve like Salt
cast into water. And certes <hi>Sancho</hi> awake, was in worse case then his Master
sleeping, so much had his Lords promises distracted him. The In-keeper on the other
side was at his wits end, to see the humor of the Squire, and unhappinesse of his Lord,
and swore that it should not succeede with them now as it had done the other
time, when they went away without payment: and that now the priviledges of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie
should not any whit availe him, but hee should surely pay both the one and
the other, yea even for the very patches that were to bee set on the bored Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagges.</p>
                     <p>The Curate held fast <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> by the hands, who beleeving that hee had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Adventure, and was after it come into the Princesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> her presence,
hee laid himselfe on his knees before the Curate saying, <q>Well may your greatnesse
high and famous Ladie, live from henceforth secure from any danger, that this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
wretch may doe unto you; and I am also freed from this day forward from
the promise that I made unto you, seeing I have, by the assistance of the heavens,
and through her favour by whom I live and breathe, so happily accomplished it.</q>
Did not I say so quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> hearing of his Master? yea, I was not drunke; see if my
Master hath not powdred the Gyant by this? the matter is questionlesse, and the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is mine owne. Who would not laugh at these raving fits of the Master and man?
all of them laughed save the In-keeper, who gave himself for anger to the Devill more
then a hundred times. And the Barber, <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate got <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to
bed againe, not without much adoe, who presently fell a sleepe with tokens of marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
wearinesse, They left him sleeping and went out to comfort <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> for the
griefe hee had, because he could not finde the Giants head; but yet had more adoe to
pacifie the In-keeper, who was almost out of his wits for the unexpected and suddaine
death of his wine-bags.</p>
                     <p>The Oast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and an unlucky houre did this Knight errant enter into my house, alas; and I would
that mine eyes had never seene him seeing hee costs mee so deere. The last time that hee
was here, hee went away scot-free for his Supper, Bed, Straw and Barley, both for
himselfe and his man, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Horse and his Asse, saying that hee was a Knight Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
(and God give to him ill venture, and to all the other Adventurers of the world)
and was not therefore bound to pay any thing, for so it was written in the Statutes of
<pb facs="tcp:54746:103"/>
Chivalry. And now for his cause came the other Gentleman, and tooke away my
good tayle, and hath returned it mee backe, with two quarters of dammage, for all
the haire is falln off, and it cannot stand my husband any more in stead for the purpose
hee had it; and for an end and conclusion of all, to breake my wine-bags and shed my
wine; I wish I may see as much of his blood shed: And doe not thinke otherwise, for
by my fathers old bones, and the life of my mother, they shall pay mee every <hi>doit,</hi> one
quart upon another, or else I will never bee called as I am, nor bee mine owne fathers
daughter.</p>
                     <p>These and such like words spake the Inn-keepers Wife with very great furie, and was
seconded by her good Servant <hi>Maritornes.</hi> The Daughter held her peace, and would
now and then smile a little: But Master Parson did quiet and pacifie all, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to satisfie them for the dammages as well as hee might, as well for the Wine as for
the Baggs, but chiefly for her tail, the which was so much accounted of and valued so
highly. <hi>Dorotea</hi> did comfort <hi>Sancho,</hi> saying to him, that whensoever it should bee
verified that his Lord had slain the Gyant, and established her quietly in her Kingdome,
shee would bestow upon him the best Earldome thereof. With this hee took courage
and assured the Princesse, that hee himself had seen the Gyants head cut off; and for a
more certain token thereof, hee said, That hee had a beard that reached him down to
his girdle; and that if the Head could not now bee found, it was by reason that all the
Affairs of that house were guided by inchantment, as hee had made experience to his
cost the last time that hee was lodged therein. <hi>Dorotea</hi> replyed, That shee was of the
same opinion, and bade him to bee of good cheer, for all would bee well ended to his
hearts desire. All parties being quiet, the Curate resolved to finish the end of his
novell because hee perceived that there rested but a little unread thereof. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio,
Dorotea,</hi> and all the rest intreated him earnestly to finish it. And hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to delight them all herein and recreate himself, did prosecute the Tale in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>It after befell, That <hi>Anselmo</hi> grew so satisfied of his Wifes Honestie, as hee led a
most contented and secure life: And <hi>Camila</hi> did for the nonce look sowrely upon
<hi>Lothario,</hi> to the end <hi>Anselmo</hi> might construe her minde amisse: And for a greater
confirmation thereof <hi>Lothario</hi> requested <hi>Anselmo</hi> to excuse his comming any more to his
house, seeing that hee cleerly perceived how <hi>Camila</hi> could neither brook his company
nor presence. But the hood-wink'd <hi>Anselmo</hi> answered him, That hee would in no wise
consent thereunto; and in this manner did weave his own dishonour a thousand waies,
thinking to work his contentment. In this season such was the delight that <hi>Leonela</hi>
took also in her affections, as shee suffered her self to bee borne away by them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longly,
without any care or regard confident because her Lady did cover it, yea, and
sometimes instructed her how shee might put her desires in practice without any fear
or danger. But finally <hi>Anselmo</hi> heard on a night some body walk in <hi>Leonelaes</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and being desirous to know who it was, as hee thought to enter, hee felt the door
to bee held fast against him, which gave him a greater desire to open it; and therefore
hee strugled so long, and used such violence, as hee threw open the door and entred
just at the time that another leaped out at the Window; and therefore hee ran out
to overtake him, or see wherein hee might know him; but could neither compasse the
one or the other, by reason that <hi>Leonela</hi> embracing him hardly, with-held him and said,
Pacifie your self, good Sir, and bee not troubled, nor follow him that was here; for
hee is one that belongs to me, and that so much, as hee is my Spouse. <hi>Anselmo</hi> would
not believe her, but rather blinde with rage, hee drew out his Ponyard and would have
wounded her, saying, That shee should presently tell him the truth, or else hee would
kill her. Shee distracted with fear, said, without nothing her own words, Kill me not
Sir, and I will acquaint you with things which concern you more then you can imagine.
Say quickly then, quoth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> or else thou shalt die. It will bee impossible, replied
<hi>Leonela,</hi> for me to speak any thing now I am so affrighted; but give respit till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and I will recount unto you things that will marvellously astonish you; and in the
mean time rest secure, that hee which leaped out of the Window is a young man of this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54746:103"/>
Citie, betwixt whom and me hath passed a promise of marriage. <hi>Anselmo</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
satisfied by these words; and therefore resolved to expect the terme which shee
had demanded to open her minde; for hee did not suspect that hee should hear any
thing of <hi>Camila,</hi> by reason hee was already so assured of her Virtue: and so depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Chamber, and shutting up <hi>Leonela</hi> therein, threatning her withall, That
shee should never depart thence, untill shee had said all that shee promised to reveal
unto him. Hee went presently to <hi>Camila,</hi> to tell unto her all that which his Mayden
had said and the promise shee had passed, to disclose greater and more important things.
Whether <hi>Camila</hi> hearing this were perplexed or no, I leave to the discreet Readers
judgement: for such was the fear which shee conceived, believing certainly (as it was
to be doubted) that <hi>Leonela</hi> would tell to <hi>Anselmo</hi> all that shee knew of her disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
as shee had not the courage to expect and see whether her su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mise would become
false or no: But the very same night, as soon as shee perceived <hi>Anselmo</hi> to bee asleep,
gathering together her best Jewels and some Money, shee departed out of her House
unperceived of any, and went to <hi>Lothario's</hi> lodging, to whom shee recounted all that
had past, and requested him either to leave her in some safe place, or both of them to
depart to some place where they might live secure out of <hi>Anselmo's</hi> reach. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
that <hi>Cimila</hi> struck into <hi>Lothario,</hi> was such as he knew not what to say, and much
less how to resolve himself what he might do. But at last he determined to carry <hi>Camila</hi>
to a Monastery wherein his sister was Prioresse; to which shee easily coudescended;
and therefore <hi>Lothario</hi> departed and left her there with all the speed that the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and did also absent himself presently from the Citie, without acquainting any
body with his departure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anselmo,</hi> as soon as it was day, without heeding the absence of his Wife, arose and
went to the place where hee had shut up <hi>Leonela,</hi> with desire to know of her what shee
had promised to acquaint him withall: Hee opened the Chamber door and entred,
but could finde no body therein but some certain sheets knit together and tied to the
window as a certain signe how <hi>Leonela</hi> had made an escape by that way: Wherefore
hee returned very sad to tell to <hi>Camila</hi> the adventure; but when hee could neither finde
her at bed nor in the whole house, hee remained astonied, and demanded, for her of
his Servants, but none of them could tell him any thing. And as hee searched for her, hee
hapned to see her Coffers lye open and most of her Jewels wanting; and herewithall fell
into the true account of his disgrace, and that <hi>Leonela</hi> was not the cause of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and so departed out of his house sad and pensive, even as hee was, half ready and
unapparrelled, to his friend <hi>Lothario</hi> to recount unto him his disaster: but when
hee found him to bee likewise absented, and that the Servants told him how their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was departed the very same night and had borne away with him all his Money, hee
was ready to runne out of his wits. And to conclude, hee returned to his own house
again, wherein he found no ceature, man or woman, for all his folk were departed, and
had left the house alone and desart: Hee knew not what hee might think, say, or doe;
and then his judgement began to faile him. There hee did contemplate and behold
himself in an instant without a Wife, a Friend, and Servants; abandoned (to his seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
of Heaven that covered him, and chiefly without honour; for hee cleerly noted
his own perdition in <hi>Camilaes</hi> crime. In the end hee resolved, after hee had bethought
himself a great while, to goe to his friends Village wherein hee had been all the while
that hee afforded the leisure to contrive that disaster: And so shutting up his house
hee mounted a horseback, and rode away in languishing and dolefull wise: And scarce
had hee ridden the half way when hee was so fiercely assaulted by his thoughts, as hee
was constrained to alight, and tying his Horse to a Tree, hee leaned himself to the
trunck thereof and breathed out a thousand pittifull and dolorous sighs; and there hee
abode untill it was almost night, about which hour espyed a man to come from the
Citie a Horse-back by the same way, and having saluted him, hee demanded of him
what news hee brought from <hi>Florence?</hi> The Citizen replyed, The strangest that had
hapned there many a day: For it is there reported publiquely, That <hi>Lothario</hi> the great
friend of the rich man, hath carried away the said <hi>Anselmo's</hi> Wife <hi>Camila</hi> this night;
<pb facs="tcp:54746:104"/>
for shee is also missing: all which a Waiting-maid of <hi>Camilaes</hi> hath confest, whom the
Governour apprehended yesternight as shee slipt down at a window by a pair of sheets
out of the said <hi>Anselmo's</hi> house. I know not particularly the truth of the Affair, but
well I wot that all the Citie is amazed at the accident; for such a fact would not bee
as much as surmized from the great and familiar amitie of them two, which was so
much as they were called The two friends. Is it perhaps yet known, replyed <hi>Anselmo,</hi>
which way <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Camila</hi> have taken? In no wise, quoth the Citizen,
although the Governour hath used all possible diligence to finde them out.
Farewell then, good Sir, said <hi>Anselmo.</hi> And with you Sir, said the Traveller: And
so departed.</p>
                     <p>With these so unfortunate news poore <hi>Anselmo</hi> arived, not only to termes of losing
his wits, but also well nigh of losing his life; and therefore arising as well as hee might,
hee came to his friends house, who had heard nothing yet of his disgrace; but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to arive so wan, pined and dried up, hee presently conjectured that some grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
evill afflicted him. <hi>Anselmo</hi> requested him presently that hee might bee caried to
his Chamber, and provided of paper and inke to write withall: all was done, and hee
left in bed, and alone, for so hee desired them; and also that the dore should bee fast
locked: And being alone, the imagination of his misfortune gave him such a terrible
charge, as hee cleerely perceived that his life would shortly faile him, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to leave notice of the cause of his suddaine and unexpected death; and therefore
hee began to write it; but before hee could set an end to his discourse, his breath fayled,
and hee yeelded up his life into the hands of sorrow, which his impertinent curiositie
had stirred up in him. The Gentleman of the house seeing that it grew late, and that
<hi>Anselmo</hi> had not called, determined to enter, and know whether his indisposition pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
forward, and hee found him lying on his face, with halfe of his body in the bed, and
the other half leaning on the table whereon he lay, with a written paper unfolded, and
held the pen also yet in his hand. His Oast drew neere unto him, and first of all, having
called him he took him by the hand; and seeing that he answered not, and that it was
cold, he knew that he was dead; and greatly perplexed and grieved thereat, he called
in his people, that they might also be witnesses of the disastrous successe of <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and
after all he took the paper and read it, which he knew to be written with his own hand
the substance whereof was this:</p>

If the newes of my Death shall arrive to <hi>Camila,</hi> let
her also know that I doe pardon her, for shee was not
bound to worke Miracles; nor had I any neede to desire that she
should worke them. And seeing I was the builder and contriver of

                     <p>Hitherto did <hi>Anselmo</hi> write, by which it appeared that his life ended in that point,
ere he could set an end to the Reason he was to give. The next day ensuing, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
his friend acquainted <hi>Anselmoes</hi> kinsfolke with his death; the which had already
knowledge of his misfortune, and also of the Monastery wherein <hi>Camila</hi> had retyred
her self, being almost in terms to accompany her husband in that forcible voyage; not
for the newes of his death, but for grief of others which she had received of her absent
friend. It is said, that although she was a widow, yet would she neither depart out of
the Monastery, nor become a Religious woman, untill she had received within a few
daies after, news how <hi>Lothario</hi> was slaine in a battell given by <hi>Monsieur de Lau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be imagined that any husband would be so foolish, as to make so costly an experience

then were it possible; but being between Man and Wife, it containes somewhat that is

they will here alight, wee may sing <hi>Gaudeamus.</hi> What folke is it,
quoth <hi>Cardenio?</hi> Foure men on Horseback quoth the Hoast, and
ride Gennet-wise, with Lances and Targets, and Maskes on their

in a side-Saddle, and her face also masked, and two Lacquies that
run with them a foote. Are they neere quoth the Curate? So neere replyed the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
as they doe now arive. <hi>Dorotea</hi> hearing him say so, covered her face, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi>
entred into <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> chamber; and scarce had they leisure to doe it, when
the others of whom the Oast spake, entred into the Inne, and the foure Horsemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting,
which were all of very comely and gallant disposition; they went to helpe
downe the Lady that rode in the side-Saddle, and one of them taking her downe in his
armes did seat her in a chair that stood at the Chamber door, into which <hi>Cardenio</hi> had
entred: and all this while neither shee nor they took off their Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ks, or spake a word,
only the Gentlewoman at her sitting down in the chair breathed forth a very deep sigh,
and let fall her armes like a sick and dismayed person: The Lacquies carried away
their Horses to the Stable. Master Curate seeing and nothing all this, and curious to
know what they were that came to the Inn in so unwonted an attire, and kept such
profound silence therein, went to the Lacquies and demanded of one of them that
which hee desired to know, Who answered, In good faith Sir, I cannot tell you what folk
this is; only this I know, that they seem to bee very Noble, but chiefly hee that went
and took down the Lady in his armes that you see there; and this I say, because all the
others doe respect him very much, and nothing is done but what hee ordains and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
And the Lady, what is shee quoth the Curate? I can as hardly informe you, quoth
the Lacquie; for I have not once seen her face in all this Journey; yet I have heard
her often groan and breath out so profound sighs, as it seems shee would give up the
ghost at every one of them: And it is no marvell, that wee should know no more
then wee have said; for my Companion and my self have been in their companie but
two dayes; for they incountred us on the way, and prayed and perswaded us to goe
with them unto <hi>Andalusia,</hi> promising that they would recompence our pains largely.
And hast thou heard them name one another, said the Curate? No truely, answered
the Lacquie; for they all travail with such silence, as it is a wonder: for you shall not
hear a word among, but the sighs and throbs of the poor Ladie, which doe move in us
very great compassion: And we doe questionlesse perswade our selves that shee is forced
wheresoever shee goes: and as it may bee collected by her attire, shee is a Nunne, or,
as is most probable, goes to bee one; and perhaps shee goeth so sorrowfull as it seems,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:105"/>
because shee hath no desire to become Religious. It may very well bee so, quoth the
Curate: And so leaving them, hee returned to the place where hee had left <hi>Dorotea;</hi>
who hearing the disguised Lady to sigh so often moved by the native compassion of
that Sex, drew neer her and said, What ayles you, good Madame? I pray you think
if it bee any of those inconveniences to which Women bee subject, and whereof they
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y have use and experience to cure them: I doe offer unto you my Service, Assistance,
and good-Will to help you, as much as lyes in my power. To all those complements
the dolefull Ladie answered nothing; and although <hi>Dorotea</hi> made her again larger
offers of her Service, yet stood shee ever silent, untill the bemasked Gentleman (whom
the Lacquie said the rest did obey) came over and said to <hi>Dorotea;</hi> Ladie, doe not
trouble your self to offer any thing to that woman, for shee is of a most ingratefull
nature, and is never wont to gratifie any courtesie, nor doe you seek her to answer
unto your demands, if you would not heare some lie from her mouth. I never said any
(quoth the silent Ladie) but rather because I am so true and sincere without guiles;
I am now drowned here in those misfortunes; and of this I would have thy self bear
witnesse, seeing my pure truth makes thee to bee so false and disloyall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cardenio</hi> over-heard those words very cleere and distinctly, as one that stood so
neer unto her that said them, as only <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> chamber door stood between
them: And instantly when hee heard them, hee said with a very loud voyce; Good
God! what is this that I heare? What voyce is this that hath touched mine eare? The
Ladie moved with a sodain passion, turned her head at those out-cries, and seeing shee
could not perceive him that gave them, shee got up, and would have entred into the
Roome, which the Gentleman espying with-held her, and would not let her stir out
of the place: and with the alteration and sodain motion the Mask fell off her face, &amp; she
discovered an incomparable beautie, and an Angellicall countenance, although it was
somewhat wan and pale, and turned here and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>here with her eyes to every place so
earnestly as shee seemed to bee distracted: which motions without knowing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why they were made, struck <hi>Dorotea</hi> and the rest that beheld her into very great
compassion. The Gentleman holding her very strongly fast by the shoulders, the
Mask he wore on his own face was falling; and he being so busied could not hold it up,
but in the end fell wholy. <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who had likewise imbraced the Ladie, lifting up
her eyes by chance, saw that hee, which did also imbrace the Ladie, was her Spouse <hi>Don
Fernando:</hi> and scarce had shee known him, when breathing out a long and most
pittifull <hi>Alas</hi> from the bottome of her heart, shee fell backward in a Traunce: And
if the Barber had not been by good hap at hand, shee would have faln on the ground
with all the weight of her body. The Curate presently repaired to take off the vaile
of her face and cast water thereon: and as soon as hee did discover it, <hi>Don Fernando,</hi>
who was hee indeed that held fast the other, knew her, and looked like a dead man as
soon as hee viewed her; but did not all this while let goe <hi>Luscinda,</hi> who was the other
whom hee held so fast, and that laboured so much to escape out of his hands. <hi>Cardenio</hi>
likewise heard the <hi>Alas</hi> that <hi>Dorotea</hi> said when shee fell into a Trance, and believing
that it was his <hi>Luscinda,</hi> issued out of the chamber greatly altered, and the first hee
espied was <hi>Don Fernando</hi> which held <hi>Luscinda</hi> fast, who forthwith knew him. And all
the three, <hi>Luscinda, Cardenio,</hi> and <hi>Dorotea,</hi> stood dumbe and amazed, as folk that
knew not what had befaln unto them. All of them held their peace and beheld one
another: <hi>Dorotea</hi> looked on <hi>Don Fernando, Don Fernando</hi> on <hi>Cardenio, Cardenio</hi> on <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda,</hi>
and <hi>Luscinda</hi> again on <hi>Cardenio:</hi> but <hi>Luscinda</hi> was the first that broke silence,
speaking to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> in this manner; Leave me off, Lord <hi>Fernando,</hi> I conjure thee, by
that thou shouldest be, for that which thou art: and if thou wilt not doe it for any other
respect; Let me cleave to the wall whose Ivie I am; to the supporter, from whom, neither
thy importunitie nor threats, promises or gifts, could once deflect me. Note how Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by unusuall, unfrequented, and from us concealed waies, hath set my true Spouse
before mine eyes: and thou doest know well by a thousand costly experiences, that
only death is potent to blot forth his remembrance out of my memorie: Let then so
manifest truths bee of power (if thou must doe none other) to convert thine affliction
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54746:105"/>
into rage, and thy good will into despight, and therewithall end my life: for if I may
render up the Ghost in the presence of my deer Spouse, I shall account it fortunately
lost. Perhaps by my death hee will remain satisfied of the faith which I ever kept sincere
towards him, untill the last period of my life. By this time <hi>Dorotea</hi> was come to her self,
and listened to most of <hi>Luscindaes</hi> reasons, and by them came to the knowledge of her
self: But seeing <hi>Don Fernando</hi> did not yet let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spoke to him thus.</p>
                     <p>If it bee not so my Lord, that the beames of that Sunne which thou holdest eclyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
betweene thine armes, doe darken and deprive those of thine eyes, thou mightest
have by this perceived, how shee that is prostrated at thy feete, is the unfortunate (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
thou shalt please) and the disastrous <hi>Dorotea.</hi> I am that poore humble country-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom thou eyther through thy bountie, or for thy pleasure didst daigne to rayse
to that height that shee might call thee her owne. I am shee which sometime immured
within the limits of honestie, did lead a most contented life, untill it opened the gates
of her recollection and wearinesse to thine importunity, and seeming just, and amorous
requests, and rendred up to thee the keyes of her libertie; a griefe by thee so ill recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced,
as the finding my selfe in so remote a place as this wherein you have met with
mee, and I seene you, may cleerely testifie; but yet for all this, I would not have you
to imagine that I come here guided by dishonourable steps, being only hitherto condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the tracts of dolour and feeling, to see my selfe thus forgotten by thee. It was
thy will that I should bee thine owne, and thou didst desire it in such a manner, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
now thou wouldst not have it so, yet canst not thou possibly leave off to be mine.
Know my deere Lord, that the matchlesse affections that I doe beare towards thee, may
recompence and be equivalent to her beautie and nobilitie for whom thou dost aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

                     <p>Thou canst not bee the beautifull <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for as much as shee belongs to <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and it will bee more easie, if you will note it
well, to reduce thy will to love her that adores thee, then to addresse hers, that hates
thee, to beare thee affection: Thou diddest sollicite my wretchlessenesse, thou prayedst
to mine integritie, and wast not ignorant of my qualitie; thou knowest also very well
upon what termes I subjected my selfe to thy will, so as there remaines no place nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to term it a fraud or deceit; and all this being so, as in veritie it is, &amp; that thou beest
as Christian as thou art noble, why dost thou with these so many untoward wreathings
dilate the making of mine end happy, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencement thou didst illustrate so much?
and if thou wilt not have mee for what I am, who am thy true and lawfull Spouse; yet
at least take and admit mee for thy slave, for so that I may bee in thy possession, I will
account my selfe happy and fortunate. Doe not permit that by leaving and abandoning
mee, meetings may bee made to discourse of my dishonour. Doe not vexe thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
yeeres of my Parents, seeing that the loyall services which they ever have done
as Vassals to thine, deserve not so dishonest a recompence: And if thou esteemest that
thy blood by medling with mine shall bee stayned or embased, consider how few noble
houses, or rather none at all, are there in the world, which have not runne the same
way; and that the womans side is not essentially requisite for the illustrating of noble
discents: how much more, seeing that true Nobilitie consists in virtue, which if it
shall want in thee, by refusing that which thou owest mee so justly, I shall remain with
many more degrees of Nobilitie then thou shalt. And in conclusion, that which I will
lastly say is, that whether thou wilt or no, I am thy wife; the witnesses are thine owne
words, which neither should nor ought to lie, if thou dost pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Heaven, which thou didst invoke to beare witnesse of that which thou didst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
unto mee; and when all this shall faile, thy very Conscience shall never faile from
using clamors, being silent in thy myrth and turning, for this truth which I have said to
thee now, shall trouble thy greatest pleasure and delight.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:106"/>
These and many other like reasons did the sweetly grieved <hi>Dorotea</hi> use with such fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and abundance of teares, as all those that were present, as well such as accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Don Fernando,</hi> as all the others that did accompany her. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> listned unto
her without replying a word, untill shee had ended her speech, and given beginning to
so many sighs and sobs, as the heart that could indure to behold them without moving,
were harder then brasse. <hi>Luscinda</hi> did also regard her, no lesse compassionate of her
sorrow, then admired at her discretion and beautie, and although shee would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
to her, and used some consolatorie words, yet was shee hindred by <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandoes</hi>
armes, which held her still embraced; who full of confusion and marvell, after
hee had stood very attentively beholding <hi>Dorotea</hi> a good while, opening his armes, and
leaving <hi>Luscynda</hi> free said, Thou hast vanquished, O beautifull <hi>Dorotea,</hi> thou hast van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
me; for it is not possible to resist or denie so many united truths. <hi>Luscinda</hi>
through her former trance and weakenesse, as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> left her, was like to fall, if
<hi>Cardenio</hi> who stood behind <hi>Don Fernando</hi> all the while lest hee should bee known, shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off all feare and in indangering his person, had not started forward to stay her from
falling; and clasping her sweetly betweene his armes hee said. If pittifull Heaven bee
pleased, and would have thee now at last take some ease, my loyall, constant and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Ladie, I presume that thou canst not possesse it more securely then betweene these
armes which doe now receive thee, as whilom they did when fortune was pleased that
I might call thee mine owne. And then <hi>Luscinda</hi> first severing her eye lids beheld <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio,</hi>
and having first taken notice of him by his voyce, and confirmed it againe by her
sight, like one quite distracted, without farther regarding modest respects, shee cast
both her armes about his neck, and joyning her face to his said, Yea, thou indeede art
my Lord; thou the true owne of this poore Captive, howsoever adverse fortune shall
thwart it, or this life, which is only sustayned and lives by thine, bee ever so much threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
This was a marvelous spectacle to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and all the rest of the beholders,
which did universally admire at this so unexpected an event: and <hi>Dorotea</hi> perceiving
<hi>Don Fernando</hi> to change colour, as one resolving to take revenge on <hi>Cardenio,</hi> for hee
had set hand to his Sword, which shee conjecturing, did with marvelous expedition
kneele, and catching hold on his legs, kissing them, shee strained them with so loving
embracements, as hee could not stir out of the place, and then with her eyes overflown
with teeres, said unto him, What meanest thou to doe, my only refuge in this unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
trance? Thou hast here thine own Spouse at thy feete, and her whom thou wouldst
faine possesse is betweene her owne husbands armes: Judge then whether it become
thee, or is a thing possible to dissolve that which Heaven hath knit, or whether it bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wise laudable to endeavor to raise and equall to thy selfe her, who contemning all
dangers and inconveniences, and confirmed in faith and constancy, doth in thy presence
bathe her eyes with amorous liquor of her true Loves face and bosome. I desire thee
for Gods sake, and by thine owne worths; I request thee, that this so notorious a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
may not only asswage thy choller, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t also diminish it in such sort, as thou maiest
quietly and peaceably permit those two Lovers to enjoy their desires without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance,
all the time that Heaven shall grant it to them; and herein thou shalt shew
the generositie of thy magnanimous and noble brest, and give the world to understand
how reason prevaileth in thee, and domaniereth over passion. All the time that <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea</hi>
spoke thus to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> although <hi>Cardenio</hi> held <hi>Luscinda</hi> betweene his armes,
yet did hee never take his eye off <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> with resolution, that if hee did see him
once stir in his prejudice, hee would labor both to defend himself and offend his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
&amp; all those should joyn with him to do him any harm, as much as he could, although
it were with the rest of his life: but <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> friends, the Curat and Barber that
were present and saw all that was past, repayred in the meane season, without omitting
the good <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and all of them together compassed <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> intreating
him to have regard of the beautifull <hi>Doroteas</hi> teares, and it being true (as they beleeved
it was) that she had said, he should not permit her to remain defrauded of her so just
and lawfull hopes, assuring him that it was not by chance, but rather by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
providence and disposition of the Heavens, that they had all met together so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54746:106"/>
And that hee should remember, as Master Curate said very well, that
only death could sever <hi>Luscinda</hi> from her <hi>Cardenio:</hi> And that although the edge of a
Sword might divide and part them asunder, yet in that case they would account their
death most happy, and that in irremedilesse events, it was highest prudence, by strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and overcoming himself, to shew a generous minde, permitting that hee might
conquer his own will, they two should joy that good which Heaven had already grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, and that hee should convert his eyes to behold the beautie of <hi>Dorotea,</hi> and
hee should see that few or none could for feature paragon with her; and much lesse
excell her; and that hee should conferre her humilitie and extreame love which shee
bore to him with her other indowments; and principally that if hee gloried in the
titles of Nobility or Christianity, hee could not doe any other then accomplish the
promise that hee had past to her; and that by fulfilling it hee should please God and
satisfie discreet persons, which know very well how it is a speciall prerogative of beautie
though it bee in an humble and mean subject, if it bee consorted with Modestie and
Virtue, to exalt and equall it self to any dignitie, without disparagement of him which
doth help to raise or unite it to himself. And when the strong laws of delight are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
(so that there intercurre no sinne in the acting thereof) hee is not to bee
condemned which doth follow them. Finally, they added to these reasons others so
many and forcible, that the valorous brest of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> (as commonly all those that
are warmed and nourished by Noble Blood are wont) was mollified, and permitted it
self to bee vanquished by that truth which hee could not denye though hee would:
And the token that hee gave of his being overcome, was to stoop down and imbrace
<hi>Dorotea,</hi> saying unto her, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ise Ladie; for it is not just that shee bee prostrate at my
feet, whose image I have erected in my minde: And if I have not hitherto given de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of what I now averr, it hath perhaps befaln through the disposition of
Heaven, to the end I might by noting the constancie and faith wherewithall thou doest
affect me, know after how to value and esteeme thee according unto thy merits: and
that which in recompence thereof I doe intreat of thee is, that thou wilt excuse in mee
mine ill manner of proceeding and exceeding carelessenesse in repaying thy good
will: For the very occasion and violent passions that made me to accept thee as mine,
the very same did also impell me again not to be thine: &amp; for the more verifying of mine
assertion, doe but once behold the eyes of the now contented <hi>Luscinda</hi> and thou mayest
read in them a thousand excuses for mine errour: &amp; seeing shee hath found and obtained
her hearts desire, and I have in thee also gotten what is most convenient: for I wish shee
may live securely and joyfully many and happie yeers with her <hi>Cardenio;</hi> for I will
pray the same, that it will licence me to enjoy my beloved <hi>Dorotea:</hi> And saying
so, hee embraced her again, and joyned his face to hers with so lovely moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it constrained him to hold watch over his Teares, lest violently bursting
forth, they should give doubtlesse arguments of his servent Love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cardenio Luscinda</hi> and almost all the rest could not doe so, for the greater number
of them shed so many teares, some for their private contentment, and others for their
friends, as it seemed that some grievous and heavie misfortune had betided them all;
even very <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> wept, although hee excused it afterward, saying, That he wept
only because that hee saw that <hi>Dorotea</hi> was not the Queene <hi>Micomicona,</hi> as hee had
imagined, of whom hee hoped to have received so great gifts and favours. The admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and teares joyned, indured in them all for a pretty space, and presently after <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi>
and <hi>Luscinda</hi> went and kneeled to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> yeelding him thanks for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that hee had done to them, with so courteous complements, as hee knew not
what to answere, and therefore lifted them up, and embraced them with very great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and kindnesse, and presently after he demanded of <hi>Dorotea</hi> how she came to that
place, so far from her own dwelling? and shee recounted unto him all that shee had
told to <hi>Cardenio;</hi> wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and those which came with him took so great
delight, as they could have wished that her story had continued a longer time in the
telling then it did; so great was <hi>Doroteaes</hi> grace in setting out her misfortunes. And
<pb facs="tcp:54746:107"/>
as soon as shee had ended, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> told all that had befaln him in the Citie, after
that hee had found the scroule in <hi>Luscindaes</hi> bosome, wherein shee declared <hi>Cardenio</hi>
to bee her Husband; and that hee therefore could not marrie her; And also how hee
attempted to kill her, and would have done it, were it not that her Parents hindred
him; And that hee therefore departed out of the house full of shame and despight,
with resolution to revenge himself more commodiously: And how hee understood
the next day following, how <hi>Luscinda</hi> was secretly departed from her fathers
house, and gone no body knew where; but that hee finally learned within a few
moneths after, that shee had entred into a certain Monastery, with intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there all the daies of her life, if shee could not passe them with <hi>Cardenio:</hi> And
that as soon as hee had learned that, choosing those three Gentlemen for his Associates,
hee came to the place where shee was, but would not speake to her, fearing lest that
as soon as they knew of his being there, they would increase the guards of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;
and therefore expected untill he found on a day the gates of the Monastery
open, and leaving two of his fellows to keep the doore, hee with the other entred
into the Abby in <hi>Luscindaes</hi> search, whom they found talking with a Nunne in the
Cloyster; and snatching her away e're shee could retire her self, they brought her to
a certain Village, where they disguised themselves in that sort they were; for so it was
requisite for to bring her away: All which they did with the more facilitie, that the
Monastery was seated abroad in the Fields, a good way from any Village. Hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
told, That as soon as <hi>Luscinda</hi> saw her self in his power, shee fell into a Swone;
and that after shee had returned to her self, shee never did any other thing but weep
and sigh, without speaking a word; And that in that manner, accompanied with silence
and tears, they had arrived to that Inne, which was to him as gratefull as an arrivall to
Heaven, wherein all earthly mis-haps are concluded and finished.</p>

seeing that all the hopes of his Lordship vanished away like

<hi>Dorotea,</hi> and the Gyant into <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and that his Master
slept so souldly and carelesse of all that had hapned. <hi>Dorotea</hi>
could not yet assure her self whether the happinesse that shee
possest was a dream or no. <hi>Cardenio</hi> was in the very same taking,
and also <hi>Luscindaes</hi> thoughts run the same race.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Fernando</hi> yielded many thanks to Heaven for having dealt with him so propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
and unwinding him out of the intricate Labyrinth, wherein straying, hee was at
the poynt to have at once lost his soul and credit: and finally as many as were in the
Inne were very glad and joyfull of the successe of so thwart, intricate, and desperate
affairs. The Curate compounded and ordered all things through his discetion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
every one of the good hee obtained: But shee that kept greatest Jubilee
and Joy was the Hostesse, for the promise that <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate had made, to
pay her the damages and harms committed by <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> only <hi>Sancho,</hi> as wee
have said, was afflicted, unfortunate and sorrowfull. And thus hee entred with
melancholy semblance to his Lord, who did but then awake, and said unto
him;</p>
                     <p>Well and securely may you sleep, <hi>Sir Knight of the heavy countenance,</hi> as long as it shall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54746:107"/>
please your self, without troubling your self with any care of killing any Gyant, or of
restoring the Queen to her Kingdome; for all is concluded and done already. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
thee very easily, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for I have had the monstrousest and most
terrible battail with that Gyant that ever I think to have all the dayes of my life with
any; and yet with one thwart blow-thwack, I overthrew his head to the ground; and
there issued so much blood as the streams thereof ranne along the earth as if they were
of water. As if they were of red Wine you might better have said, replyed <hi>Sancho Panca:</hi>
for I would let you to understand, if you know it not already, That the dead Gyant is a
bored Wine-bagg; and the blood six &amp; thirty gallons of red Wine, which it contained in
it's belly: the head that was slash'd off so neatly, is the Whore my Mother; and let
the Devill take all away for me. And what is this thou sayest, mad man (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>)
Art thou in thy right wits? Get up Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and you your
self shall see the fair stuffe you have made, and what wee have to pay; and you shall
behold the Queen transformed into a particular Lady, called <hi>Dorotea,</hi> with other suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses;
which if you may once conceive them aright, will strike you into admiration.
I would marvell at nothing, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for if thou beest well remembred,
I told thee the other time that wee were here, how all that succeded in this place was
done by inchantment; And what wonder then if now the like should eftsoons befall?
I could easily bee induced to believe all, replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> if my canvassing in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlet
were of that nature: But indeed it was not, but most reall and certain: And I
saw well how the Inn-keeper that is here yet this very day alive, held one end of the
Coverlet, and did tosse me up towards Heaven with very good grace and strength,
no lesse merily then lightly: And where the notice of parties intercurs, I doe believe,
although I am a simple man and a sinner, that there is no kinde of inchantment, but
rather much trouble, brusing, and misfortune. Well, God will remedie all, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
and give me mine apparell; for I will get up and goe forth, and see those
successes and transformations which thou speakest of. <hi>Sancho</hi> gave him his clothes;
and whilest hee was a making of him ready, the Curate recounted to <hi>Don Fernando</hi>
and to the rest <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> mad pranks, and the guile hee had used to bring him away
out of the poor Rock, wherein hee imagined that hee lived exiled through the disdain
of his Lady. Hee told them moreover all the other Adventures which <hi>Sancho</hi> had
discovered, whereat they did not laugh a little and wonder withall, because it seemed
to them all to be one of the extravagantest kinds of madnesse that ever befell a distracted
brain. The Curate also added, That seeing the good successe of the Lady <hi>Dorotea</hi>
did impeach the farther prosecuting of their designe, that it was requisite to invent and
finde some other way, how to carrie him home to his own Village. <hi>Cardenio</hi> offered
himself to prosecute the Adventure, and <hi>Luscinda</hi> should represent <hi>Doroteaes</hi> person.
No, quoth <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> it shall not bee so; for I will have <hi>Dorotea</hi> to prosecute her
own invention: For so that the Village of this good Gentleman bee not very farre off
from hence, I will bee very glad to procure his remedy. It is no more then two dayes
journey from hence, said the Curate. Well though it were more, replyed <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
I would bee pleased to travail them, in exchange of doing so good a work.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sallied out at this time compleatly armed with <hi>Mambrino's</hi> Helmet
(although with a great hole in it) on his head, his Target on his arme, and leaned on his
Trunk or Javelin. His strange countenance and gate amazed <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and his
Companions very much, seeing his ill-favoured visage so withered and yellow, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie
and insutabilitie of his Armes, and his grave manner of proceeding; and
stood all silent to see what hee would; who casting his eyes on the Bautifull <hi>Dorotea,</hi>
with very great gravity and staidnesse said.</p>
                     <p>I am informed (beautifull Lady) by this my Squire, that your greatnesse is annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and your being destroyed: For of a Queen and mighty Princesse which you
were wont to bee, you are now become a particular Damzell: which if it hath been
done by particular orde of the Magicall King your Father, dreading that I would
not bee able to give you the necessarie and requisite help for your restitution; I say
that hee neither knew nor doth know the one half of the enterprize, and that hee was
<pb facs="tcp:54746:108"/>
very little acquainted with Histories of Chivalrie: For if hee had read them, or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them over with so great attention and leisure as I have done, and read them,
hee should have found at every other steppe, how other Knights of a great
deale lesse fame then my selfe, have ended more desperate Adventures; seeing
it is not so great a matter to kill a Gyant, bee hee ever so arrogant; for it is
not many houres since I my selfe fought with one, and what insued I will not
say, lest they should tell mee that I doe lye; but time the detector of all things will
disclose it, when we doe least think thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thou foughtest with two wine-bags and not with a Gyant quoth the Oast at this
season: But <hi>Don Fernando</hi> commanded him to bee silent and not interrupt <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi>
in any wise, who prosecuted his speech saying. In fine I say, high and disinherited
Lady, that if your Father hath made this <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

related, give him no credit; for there is no perill so great on earth but my Sword shall
open a way through it, wherewithall I overthrowing your enemies head to the ground
will set your Crowne on your owne head within a few dayes. Here <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> held
his peace, and awaited the Princesse her Answere, who knowing <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi>
determination and will, that shee should continue the commenced guile untill <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
were caried home againe, answered with a very good grace and countenance
in this manner: Whosoever informed you valorous Knight <hi>of the illfavoured face,</hi> that
I have altered and changed my being, hath not told you the truth; for I am the very
same to day that I was yesterday; true it is, that some unexpected, yet fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
have wrought some alteration in mee, by bestowing on mee better hap then I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for, or could wish my self; but yet for all that I have not left off to be that which
before, or to have the very same thoughts which I ever had, to helpe my selfe by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of your most valorous and invincible arme. And therfore I request you, good my
Lord, of your accustomed bountie, to return my father his honor again, and account of
him as of a very discreet and prudent man, seeing that he found by this skill, so easy and
so infallible a way to redresse my disgraces; for I doe certainly beleeve, that if it had
not been by your meanes, I should never have hapned to attain to the good fortune
which now I possesse, as all those Noblemen present may witnesse; what therefore rests
is, that to morrow morning we doe set forward, for to day is now already so overgone,
as we should not be able to travell very far from hence; as for the conclusion of the good
successe that I doe hourly expect, I refer that to God and the valour of your invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Arme.</p>
                     <p>Thus much the discreete <hi>Dorotea</hi> said, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> having heard her, he turned
him to <hi>Sancho</hi> with very manifest tokens of indignation and said, Now I say unto thee
little <hi>Sancho,</hi> that thou art the veriest Rascall that is in all Spayne: tell mee theefe and
vagabond, didst not thou but even very now say unto mee that this Princesse was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a Damzell, and that, called <hi>Dorotea?</hi> and that the head which I thought I had
slashed from a Gyants shoulders, was the whore that bore thee? with a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follies, which did plunge me into the greatest confusion that ever I was in in my life?
I vow (and then hee looked upon heaven, and did crash his teeth together) that I am
about to make such a wrack on thee, as shall beate wit into the pates of all the lying
Squires that shall ever hereafter serve Knights errant in this world. I pray you have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
good my Lord, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> for it may very well befall mee to bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that which toucheth the transmutation of the Lady and Princesse <hi>Micomicona;</hi>
but in that which concerneth the Gyants head, or at least the boring of the wine-bags,
and that the blood was but red-wine, I am not deceived I sweare; for the bags lie yet
wounded there within at your owne beds head; and the red-wine hath made a Lake in
the Chamber, and if it bee not so, it shall bee perceived at the frying of the Egges, I
meane that you shall see it when master In-keepers worship, who is here present, shall
demand the losse and dammage. I say then <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that thou art
a mad cap; pardon mee, and so it is enough. It is enough indeede quoth <hi>Don Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
and therefore let mee intreate you to say no more of this, and seeing my Lady the
Princesse sayes shee will goe away to morrow, seeing it is now too late to depart to day,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54746:108"/>
let it bee so agreed on, and wee will spend this night in pleasant discourses, until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the ensuing day, wherein wee will all accompany and attend on the worthy
Knight Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> because wee would bee eye-witnesses of the valorous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
feats of arms which he shal do in the pursuit of this weighty enterprize which
he hath taken upon him. I am he that will serve and accompany you, good my Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and I doe highly gratifie the honor that is done me, and the goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

opinion that is held of me, the which I will endeavor to verifie and approve, or it shall
cost me my life, or more, if more it might cost me.</p>
                     <p>Many other words of complement and gratification past between <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and
<hi>Don Fernando,</hi> but a certaine passenger imposed silence to them all, by his arivall to the
Inne in that very season, who by his attyre shewed that hee was a Christian newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from among the Moores, for hee was apparelled with a short skyrted Caslock
of blue cloth, sleeves reaching downe halfe the Arme, and without a coller; his breeches
were likewise of blue linnen, and hee wore a bonnet of the same colour, a payre of
Date coloured Buskins, and a Turkish Semiter hanging at his neck in a Scarfe, which
went athwart his brest; there entred after him, riding on an Asle, a woman clad like a
Moore, and her face covered with a peece of the Vaile of her head, shee wore on her
head a little cap of cloth of gold, and was covered with a little turkish Mantle from the
shoulders downe to the feete; the man was of strong and comely making of the age of
forty yeeres or thereabouts, his face was somewhat tanned, hee had long <hi>Mustachoes</hi>
and a very handsome Beard; to conclude, his making was such, as if hee were well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred,
men would take him to bee a person of qualitie and good byrth; hee demanded
a Chamber as soone as hee had entred, and being answered that there was no one va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
in the Inne, hee seemed to bee grieved, and comming to her which in her attyre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
her selfe to bee a Moore, hee tooke her downe from her Asle. <hi>Luscinda, Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea,</hi>
the Oastesse, her daughter and <hi>Maritornes,</hi> allured to behold the new and strange
attyre of the Moore, compassed her about; and <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who was alwaies most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
courteous and discreete, deeming that both shee and hee that had brought her,
were discontented for the want of a lodging shee said Ladie, bee not grieved for the
trouble you are here like to endure for want of meanes to refresh your selfe, seeing it is
an universall vice of all Innes to bee defective herein; yet notwithstanding if it shall
please you to passe away the time among us (pointing to <hi>Luscinda</hi>) perhaps you have
met in the discourse of your travells, other worse places of entertainment then this
shall prove. The disguised Lady made none answere, nor other thing then arising from
the place wherein shee sate, and setting both her armes a crosse on her bosome, shee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
her head and bowed her bodie, in signe that shee rendred them thanks; by her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
they doubtlesly conjectured her to bee a Moore, and that shee could not speake
the Castilian tongue. In this the captive arived, who was otherwise imployed untill
then, and seeing that they all had invironed her that came with him, and that she made
no answere to their speech hee said; Ladies, this Maiden scarce understands my tongue
yet, nor doth shee know any other then that of her owne Countrey, and therefore she
hath not, nor can make any answere to your demands. Wee demand nothing of her
quoth <hi>Luscinda,</hi> but only doe make her an offer of our companies for this night, and
part of the Roome where wee our selves are shall bee accomodated, where shee shall
bee cherished up as much as the commodity of this place, and the Obligation wherein
wee bee tyed to shew courtesies to strangers that may want it doe binde us; especially
shee being a woman to whom wee may doe this service. Sweet Lady, I kisse your
hands both for her and my selfe, replyed the captive, and I doe highly prize, as it deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
the favour you have proffered, which in such an occasion, and offered by such
Persons as you seeme to bee, doth very plainly shew how great it is. Tell mee good
Sir, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> whether is this Lady a Christian or a Moore? for by her attyre and
silence shee makes us suspect that shee is that wee would not wish shee were. A Moore
shee is in attyre and body, answered the captive; but in minde shee is a very fervent
Christian, for shee hath very expresly desired to become one. Then shee is not yet bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
said <hi>Luscinda?</hi> there hath beene no oportunitie offered to us, quoth the captive,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:109"/>
to christen her, since shee departed from <hi>Argell,</hi> which is her Town and Countrey;
and since that time shee was not in any so eminent a danger of death as might obliege
her to bee baptized, before shee were first instructed in all the Ceremonies which our
holy Mother the Church commandeth: but I hope shortly (if it shall please God)
to see her baptized with that decencie which her quality and calling deserves, which is
greater then her attire or mine makes shew of.</p>
                     <p>These words inflamed all the hearers with a great desire to know who the Moor and
and her Captive were; yet none of them would at that time intreat him to satisfie
their longing, because the season rather invited them to take some order how they
might rest after their travails, then to demand of them the discourse of their lives.
<hi>Dorotea</hi> then taking her by the hand, caused her to sit down by her self, and prayed
her to take off the veile from her face. She instantly beheld the Captive, as if shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him what they said; and hee in the Arabicall language told her, how they
desired her to discover her face, and bade her to doe it; which presently shee did, and
discovered so beautifull a visage, as <hi>Dorotea</hi> esteemed her to bee fairer then <hi>Luscinda,</hi>
and <hi>Luscinda</hi> prized her to excell <hi>Dorotea:</hi> and all the beholders perceived that if any
one could surpasse them both in Beautie, it was the Moor; and there were some that
thought shee excelled them both in some respects, And as Beautie hath evermore the
prerogative and grace to reconcile mens mindes and attract their wills to it; so all of
them forthwith dedicated their desires to serve and make much of the lovely Moor.
<hi>Don Fernando</hi> demanded of the Captive how shee was called; and hee answered that
her name was <hi>Lela Zoraida:</hi> and as soon as shee heard him, and understood what
they had demanded, shee suddainly answered with anguish, but yet with a very good
grace, No, not <hi>Zoraida,</hi> but <hi>Maria, Maria;</hi> giving them to understand that shee
was called <hi>Maria,</hi> and not <hi>Zoraida.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These words, and the great affect and vehemenci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wherewithall the Moor delivered
them, extorted more then one tear from the hearers, especially from the women who
are naturally tender-hearted and compassive. <hi>Luscinda</hi> embraced her then with great
love, and said, I, I, <hi>Maria, Maria.</hi> To which shee answered, I, I, <hi>Maria; Zoraida
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ancanga;</hi> that is and not <hi>Zoraida.</hi> By this it was grown some four of the clock in the
afternoon; and by order of those which were <hi>Don Fernando's</hi> Companions, the Inn-keeper
had provided for them as good a Beaver as the Inne could in any wise afford
unto them: Therefore it being the houre, they sate down all together at a long Table
(for there was never a square or round one in all the house) and they gave the first
and principall end (although hee refused it as much as hee could) to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
who commanded that the Ladie <hi>Micomicona</hi> should sit at his elbow, seeing hee was
her Champion: Presently were placed <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando,</hi>
and <hi>Cardenio</hi> right over against them, and after the Captive and other Gentlemen, and
on the other side the Curate and Barber: And thus they made their drinking with
very great recreation, which was the more augmented to see <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> leaving
of his meat, and moved by the like spirit of that which had made him once before
talk so much to the Goat-heards, beginne to offer them an occasion of Speech in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>Truely, good Sirs, if it bee well considered, those which professe the Order of
Knight-hood, doe see many great and unexpected things. If it bee not so, say, what
mortall man alive is there, that entring in at this Castle gate, and seeing of us all in the
manner wee bee now present here, can judge or believe that wee are those which wee
bee? Who is it that can say, that this Ladie which sits here at my sleeve, is the great
Queen that wee all know her to bee; and that I am that <hi>Knight of the Heavie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi>
that am so much blab'd of abroad by the mouth of Fame? therefore it cannot
bee now doubted, but that this Art and Exercise excelleth all the others which ever hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
wit, the underminer of Nature, invented; and it is the more to be prized, by how
much it exposeth it self, more then other Trades, to dangers and inconveniences. Away
with those that shall affirm learning to surpasse Armes; for I will say unto them, bee
they what they list, that they know not what they say: For the reason which such
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54746:109"/>
men doe most urge, and to which they doe most relye, is, That the travails of the Spirit
doe farre exceed those of the Body: And that the use of Armes are only Exercised
by the Body, as if it were an Office fit for Porters, for which nothing were requisite
but Bodily forces; or as if in that which wee that professe it doe call Armes, were
not included the acts of Fortitude which require deep understanding to execute them;
or as if the Warriours Minde did not labour as well as his Body, who had a great Army
to lead and command, or the defence of a besiged Citie: If not, see if hee can arrive
by his corporall strength to know or sound the intent of his Enemie, the Designes,
Stratagems, and Difficulties, how to prevent imminent Dangers, all these being opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the understanding, wherein the body hath no medling at all: It being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so, that the Exercise of Armes require Spirit as well as those of Learning; let us
now examine which of the two Spirits, that of the Scholler or Souldier, doe take most
pains: And this may bee best understood by the end, to which both of them are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed;
for that intention is most to bee esteemed, which hath for object the most noble
end. The end and conclusion of Learning is; I speak not now of Divinitie, whose
scope is to lead and addresse souls to Heaven; for to an end so much without end as
this, no other may bee compared; I mean of humane Sciences or Arts to maintaine
<hi>distributive justice</hi> in his perfection, and give to every one that which is is his own: to
indeavour and cause good Laws to bee religiously observed; an end most certainly
generous, high and worthy of great praise: but not of so much as that, to which the
Exercise of Armes is annext, which hath for his object and end Peace; which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
good men can desire in this life: and therefore the first good news that ever the
World had or Men received, were those which the Angels brought on that night which
was our day, when they sung in the skies, <hi>Glorie bee in the heights, and Peace on earth
to men of good mindes.</hi> And the Salvation which the best Master that ever was on Earth
or in Heaven taught to his Disciples and Favorites was, That when they entrd into
any house, they should say, <hi>Peace bee to this house:</hi> and many other times hee said,
<hi>I give unto you my Peace; I leave my Peace unto you: Peace bee amongst you.</hi> It is a
good, as precious as a Jewell, and a Gift given, and left by such a hand: a
Jewel, without which neither on Earth or in Heaven can there bee any perfect good.
This Peace is the true end of Warre; for Armes and Warre are one and the selfe same
things. This truth being therefore presupposed, that the end of Warre is Peace, and
that herein it doth excell the end of Learning: let us descend to the corporall labours
of the Scholler, and to those of him which professeth Armes, and consider which of
them are more toylsome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did prosecute his discourse in such sort, and with so pleasing terms,
as hee had almost induced his Audients to esteem him to hee at that time at least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from his frenzie: and thereforeby reason that the greater number of them were
Gentlemen, to whom the use of Armes is in a manner essentiall and proper, they did
willingly listen to him; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d therefore hee continued on with his discourse in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>I say then, that the pains of the Student are commonly these: Principally povertie
(not that I would maintain that all Students are poor, but that I may put the case in
greatest extreamitie it can have) and by saying that hee may bee poor, me thinks there
may bee no greater aggravation of his misery: For hee that is poor hath no perfection:
and this poverty is suffered by him sundrie waies; sometimes by hunger, other times
by cold or nakednesse, and many times by all of them together: Yet it is never so
extream but that hee doth eate, although it bee somewhat later then the custome, or
of the Scraps and Reversion of the rich man: and the greatest miserie of the Student
is that which they terme, to live by sops and pottage: and though they want fire of
their own, yet may they have recourse to their neighbours Chimney, which if it doe not
warm, yet will it weaken the cold: And finally, they sleep at night under a Roof.
I will not descend to other trifles, to wit, the want of Shirts and Shoes, the barenesse
of their clothes, or the over-loading of their stomacks with meat when good fortune
lends them as good a meale: For by this way which I have decyphered so rough and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:110"/>
difficult, stumbling here, falling there; getting up again on the other side, and refalling
on this; they attained the degree which they have desired so much; which many having
compassed as wee have seen, which having passed thorow these difficulties, and sailed
by <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi> (borne away flying in a manner by favourable fortune) they
command and govern all the World from a Chair, turning their hunger into sacietie,
their nakednesse into pompe, and their sleeping on a Matt into a sweet repose among
Hollands and Damask; a reward justly merited by their Virtue: But their labours
confronted and compared to those of the militant Souldier, remain very farre behinde
as I will presently declare.</p>

Student with Povertie and her parts, let us examine whether the
Souldier bee Richer? Certainly wee shall finde, that no man can
exceed the Souldier in Poverty it self: For hee is tyed to his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pay which comes either late or never: Or else to his own shifts
with notable danger of his life and conscience; And his nakednesse
is oft times so much, as many times a leather Jerkin gashed, serves
him at once for a shirt and ornament: And in the midest of Winter hee hath sundry
times no other defence or help to resist the inclemencies of the aire in the midest of the
open fields, then the breath of his mouth; which I verily believe doth against Nature
come out cold, by reason it sallies from an emptie place; expect there till the night
fall, that hee may repaire all these discommodities by the easinesse of his Bed, the
which, if it bee not through his own default, shall never offend in narrownesse; for
hee may measure out for it on the earth as many foot as hee pleaseth, and tumble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up and down it without indangering the wrinkling of his sheets. Let after all this
the day and hour arrive, wherein hee is to receive the degree of his profession. Let, I
say, a day of Battail arrive; for there they will set on his head the Cap of his dignitie,
made of lints to cure the wound of some bullet that hath past thorow and thorow his
Temples, or hath maimed an arme or a leg. And when this doth not befall, but that
Heaven doth piously keep and preserve him whole and sound, hee shall perhaps abide
still in the same povertie wherein hee was at the first; and that it bee requisite that
one and another Battail do succeed, and he come off ever a Victor, to the end that he
may prosper and bee at the last advanced. But such miracles are but few times wrought;
and say, good Sirs, if you have noted it, how few are those which the Warres reward,
in respect of the others that it hath destroyed? You must answer without question,
that there can bee no comparison made between them, nor can the dead bee reduced
to any number; but all the living, and such as are advanced, may bee counted easily
with three Arithmeticall figures; all which falls out contrary in Learned men, for all
of them have wherewithall to entertain and maintain themselves by skirts; I will say
nothing of sleeves: So that although the Souldiers labour is greater, yet is his reward
much lesse. But to this may bee answered, That it is easier to reward two hundred
thousand Learned men, then thirty thousand Souldiers; for they may bee advanced
by giving unto them Offices, which must of necessity bee bestowed on men of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
But Souldiers cannot bee recompenced otherwise then by the Lords substance
and wealth whom they serve: and yet this objection and impossibilitie doth fortifie
much more my assertion.</p>

                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:54746:110"/>
But leaving this apart which is a Labyrinth of very difficult issue, let us return to the
preeminencie of Armes over Learning, which is a matter hitherto depending; so many
are the reasons that every one alleageth for himself: and among those which I my self
have repeated, then Learning doth argue thus for it self, That Armes without it cannot
bee long maintained, for as much as the Warre hath also Laws, and is subject to them,
and that the Laws are contained under the Title of Learning, and belong to Learned
men.</p>
                     <p>To this objection Armes doe make answere; That the Lawes cannot bee sustained
without them, for Commonwealths are defended by Armes, and Kingdomes preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Cities fenced, High-waies made safe, the Seas freed from Pyrats; and to bee
briefe, if it were not for them, Commonwealths, Kingdomes, Monarchies, Cities, and
wayes by Sea and Land, would bee subject to the rigour and confusion which attendeth
on the warre all the time that it endureth, and is licensed to practise his Prerogatives
and violence; and it is a known truth, That it which cost most, is or ought to bee most
accounted of; that one may become eminent in Learning, it costs him time, watchings,
hunger, nakednesse, head-aches, rewnesse of Stomack, and other such inconveniences,
as I have partly mentioned already: But that one may arive by true termes to bee a
good Souldier, it costs him all that it costs the Student, in so exceeding a degree, as
admits no comparison, for hee is at every step in jeapordie to lose his life. And what
feare of necessitie or povertie may befall or molest a Student so fiercely as it doth a
Souldier, who seeing himselfe at the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whatsoever, or shun the danger which so neerly threatens him? but that which he onely
may doe, is to advise his Captain of that which passeth, to the end hee may remedy it by
some countermine, whilest he must stand still fearing and expecting when he shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

of two Gallies, the one with the other in the midst of the spacious Maine, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
or doe surpasse it, the which nailed and grapled fast the one to the other, the
Souldier hath no more room in them, then two footbroad of a planke on the battellings
and notwithstanding, although he clearly see laid before him so many ministers of
death, for all the Peaces of Artillery that are planted on the adverse side, doe threaten
him, and are not distant from his body the length of a Lance; and seeing that if he slipt
ever so little aside, he should fall into the deepes; doth yet neverthelesse with undaunted
heart, borne away on the wings of honour, which spurreth him onward, oppose himself
as a worke to all their shot, and strives to passe by that so narrow a way into the enemies
vessell: And what is most to bee admired, is to behold how scarce is one falne into
that place; from whence hee shall never after arise untill the worlds end, when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
takes possession of the same place: and if hee doe likewise tumble into the Sea,
which gapes like an enemy for him also, another and another will succeed unto him,
without giving any respite to the times of their death, valour, and boldnesse, which
is the greatest that may bee found among all the trances of war-fare. Those blessed
ages were fortunate, which wanted the dreadfull furie of the devillish and murdering
Peeces of Ordnance, to whose inventor I am verily perswaded that they render in hell
an eternal guerdon for his Diabolicall invention; by which hee hath given power to an
infamous, base, vile and dastardly arme, to bereave the most valorous Knight of life; and
that without knowing how or from whence, in the midst of the stomack and courage
that inflames and animates valorous mindes, there arives a wandring bullet (shot off per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by him that was afraid, and fled at the very blaze of the powder, as he discharged
the accursed Engine) and cuts off and finisheth in a moment the thoughts and life of
him who merited to enjoy it many ages,</p>
                     <p>And whilest I consider this, I am about to say, That it grieves mee to have ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken

wholly forgetting to taste one bit, although <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> did now and then put him
in remembrance of his Victuales, saying, That hee should have leisure enough after to
speak as much as he could desire. In those that heard was again renewed a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
to see a man of so good a wit as hee seemed to bee, and of so good discourse
in all the other matters which hee took in hand, to remain so cleerly devoid of it, when
any occasion of speech were offered, treating of his accursed Chivalrie. The Curate
applauded his discourse, affirming that hee produced very good reasons for all that
hee had spoken in the favour of Armes; and that hee himself (although hee was learned
and Graduated) was likewise of his opinion.</p>

as hee suspected that it must have been rare and delightfull, as he gathered by the tokens
hee gave, by coming into the lovely <hi>Zoraida's</hi> company. To which the Captive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
That hee would accomplish his desire with a very good will, and that only hee
feared that the discourse would not prove so savory as they expected: But yet for all
that hee would tell it, because hee would not disobey him. The Curate and all the rest
thanked him for his promise, and turned to request him again to beginne his discourse:
and hee perceiving so many to sollicite him, said, That prayers were not requisite when
commandements were of force: and therefore I desire you, quoth hee, to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and you shall hear a true discourse, to which perhaps no feigned invention may
bee compared for variety or delight. The rest animated by these his words did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
themselves with very great silence, and hee beholding their silence
and expectation of his Historie, with a modest and pleasing voyce, began in

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a certain Village of the Mountains of <hi>Lion</hi> my linage had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
wherewithall Nature dealt much more liberally then For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
although my Father had the opinion amid'st the penury and
poverty of that People, to bee a rich man, as indeed hee might
have been, had hee but used as much care to hoord up his wealth,
as prodigalitie to spend it. And this his liberall disposition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from his being a Souldier in his youthfull yeers; for
War is the School wherein the Miser is made Frank, and the
Frank man Prodigall: and if among Souldiers wee finde some Wretches and Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
they are accounted Monsters which are seldome seen. My Father passed the
bounds of Liberalitie, and touched very neerly the confines of Prodigalitie; a thing
nothing profitable for a married man, who had children that should succeed him in
his name and being. My Father had three Sonnes, all men, and of yeers sufficient to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54746:111"/>
make an election of the state of life they meaned to leade: wherefore hee perceiving as
hee himself was wont to say, that hee could not bridle his nature in that condition of
spending, he resolved to deprive himself of the instrument and cause which made him
such a spender and so liberall, to wit, of his Goods; without which <hi>Alexander the
great</hi> himself would bee accounted a Miser; and therefore calling us all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on a day into his Chamber, hee used these or such like reasons to us.</p>
                     <p>Sonnes, to affirm that I love you well, may bee presumed, seeing I terme you my
Sonnes: and yet it may bee suspected that I hate you seeing I doe not govern my self
so well as I might in the Husbanding and increasing of your stock. But to the end that
you may hence forth perceive that I affect you with a Fatherly love, and that I mean not
to overthrow you like a step-Father, I will doe one thing to you which I have pondered,
and with mature deliberation purposed these many dayes: You are all of age to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
an estate, or at least to make choice of some such exercise as may turn to your
honour and profit at riper yeers: and therefore that which I have thought upon, is to
divide my goods into four parts; the three I will bestow upon you, to every one that
which appertains to him, without exceeding a jot; and I my self will reserve the fourth
to live and maintain me with as long as it shall please Heaven to lend me breath. Yet
I doe greatly desire that after every one of you is possest of his portion, hee would take
one of the courses which I mean to propose. There is an old proverb in this our
<hi>Spain,</hi> in mine own opinion very true (as ordinarily all proverbs are, being certain
brief sentences collected out of long and discreet experiences) and it is this, <hi>The Church
the Sea, or the Court:</hi> the meaning is, That whosoever would become wealthy, or worthy,
must either follow the Church, haunt the Seas by exercising the Trade of Merchandizes,
or get him a place of Service and entertainment in the Kings house; for men say, that
<hi>A Kings Crumme is more worth then a Lords Loaf.</hi> This I say because I desire, and it
is my will, that one of you doe follow his Book, another Merchandize, and the third
the Warre, seeing that the service of his own house is a difficult thing to compasse.
And although the Warre is not wont to inrich a man, yet it adds unto him great worth
and renown. Within these eight dayes I doe mean to give you all your portions in
money without defrauding you of a mite, as you shall see in effect: Therefore tell me
now whether you mean to follow mine opinion and device in this which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed?
And then hee commanded me by reason that I was the eldest, to make him an
answer.</p>
                     <p>I, after I had intreated him not to make away his goods, but to spend and dispose of
them as hee listed, seeing wee were both young and able enough to gain more; at last
I concluded that I would accomplish his will, and that mine was to follow the Warres,
therein serving God and my King together. The second brother made the same offer,
and imploying his portion in Commodities would venture to the <hi>Indias.</hi> The youngest,
and as I deeme the discreetest, said, That either hee would follow the Church, or goe
at the least to <hi>Salamanca</hi> to finish his already commenced Studies. And as soon as wee
had ended the agreement and election of our vocations my Father embraced us all,
and afterwards performed unto us, in as short a time as hee had mentioned, all that
hee promised; giving unto each of us a portion, amounting, if I doe well remember,
to three thousand Duckets apeece in money; for an Uncle of ours bought all the goods
and paid ready money, because hee would not have them made away from our own
Family and Lineage. Wee all took our leaves of our good Father in one day, and in
that instant it seeming to mee a great inhumanity to leave my Father so old and with
so little means; I dealt so with him, as I constrained him to take back again two thousand
Duckets of the three hee had given me, for as much as the rest was sufficient to furnish
me in very good sort with all things requisite for a Souldier: My brothers, moved
by mine example, did each of them give him a thousand Crowns; so that my Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with four thousand Crowns in money, and three in Goods, as they were valued,
which Goods hee would not sell, but keep them still in Stock. Finally, wee bade him
(and our said Uncle) farewell, not without much feeling and many Tears on both
sides: and they charged us that wee would from time to time acquaint them with
<pb facs="tcp:54746:112"/>
our successes, whether prosperous or adverse. Wee promised to performe it: and

                     </p>
                     <p>I arrived prosperously at <hi>Genova,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Milaine,</hi> where I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate

from thence to settle my selfe in <hi>Piemonte,</hi> and being in my way towards the Citty of
<hi>Alexandria de la Paglia,</hi> I heard newes that the great Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> did passe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Flanders.</hi> Wherefore changing my purpose, I went with him, and served him
in all the expeditions hee made: I was present at the beheading of the Earles of

called <hi>Diego de Vrbina.</hi> Within a while after mine arrivall to <hi>Flanders,</hi> the news
were divulged of the league that <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> the Pope, of famous memory, had made
with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> against our common enemy the <hi>Turk,</hi> who
had gained by force the famous Island of <hi>Cypres,</hi> much about the same time, which
Island belonged to the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and was an unfortunate and lamentable losse.
It was also certainly known, that the most noble <hi>Don Iohn of Austria,</hi> our good King
<hi>Don Philips</hi> naturall Brother, did come downe for generall of this League, and the
great provision that was made for the war was published every where.</p>
                     <p>All this did incite and stir on my minde and desire to be present at the expedition so
much expected: and therefore although I had conjectures, and half promises to bee
made a Captaine in the first occasion that should bee offerred, yet I resolved to leave all
those hopes, &amp; to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> as in effect I did. And my good fortune so disposed, as the
Lord <hi>Don Iohn of Austria</hi> arrived just at the same time at <hi>Genova,</hi> and went towards <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
to joyn himself with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy, as he did after at <hi>Mess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

journey I was present, being by this made a Captain of Foot: to which honourable
charge, I was mounted rather by my good fortune, then by my deserts. And that very
day which was so fortunate to all <hi>Christendome;</hi> for therein the whole world was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived,

Stomack, and <hi>Ottomanicall</hi> pride was broken among so many happy men as were there
(for the <hi>Christians</hi> that were slaine were much more happy then those which they left
victorious alive) I alone was unfortunate, seeing that in exchange of some <hi>Naval
Crowne,</hi> which I might expect, had I lived in the times of the ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> I found
my selfe the night ensuing that so famous a day, with my legges chained, and my hands
manacled, which befell in this manner: <hi>Vchali</hi> King of <hi>Argiers,</hi> a bold and ventrous
Pirate, hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng invested and distressed the Admirall of <hi>Malta</hi> (for onely three Knights
remained alive, and those very sore wounded) <hi>Iohn Andrea's</hi> chiefe Gallie came to her
succour wherein I went with my company: and doing what was requisite in such an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
I leapt into the enemies vessel, the which falling off from that which had assaulted
her, hindred my souldiers from following me; by which means I saw my selfe alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
mine enemies, against whom I could make no long resistance, they were so many.
In fine, I was taken, full of wounds. Now as you may have heard, <hi>Vchali</hi> saved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and all his squadron, whereby I became captive in his power, and onely remained
sorrowfull among so many joyfull, and captive among so many freed: for that day
fifteen thousand <hi>Christians,</hi> which came slaves and inchained in the <hi>Turkish Gallies,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their desired liberty. I was carried to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the great <hi>Turk

was lost, of taking all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Navy within the haven: for all the <hi>Ienisaries</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
souldiers that were in it, made full account, that they should be set upon, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the very Port, and therefore trussed up all their baggage, and made ready their shoo's,
to flie away presently to the land, being in no wise minded to expect the assault, our
Navy did strike such terrour into them. But God disposed otherwise of the matter, not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54746:112"/>
through the fault or negligence of the Generall that governed our men, but for the
sinnes of Christendome, and because God permits and wills that wee have alwaies
some executioners to chastise us. In summe, <hi>Vchali</hi> got into <hi>Modon,</hi> which is an
Island neer to <hi>Navarino,</hi> and landing his Men there, hee fortified the mouth of the
Haven, and there remained untill <hi>Don Iohn</hi> departed. In this Voyage was taken the
Gally called <hi>Presa,</hi> whereof the famous Pirate <hi>Barbarossas</hi> his sonne was Captain;
it was surprized by the head Gally of <hi>Naples</hi> called the <hi>Shee-Wolfe,</hi> that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

was so cruell, and used his Slaves so ill, that as soon as they that were rowing
perceived the <hi>Shee-Wolfe</hi> to approach them, and that shee had overtaken them, they
cast away their Oares all at one time, and laying hands on their Captain that stood on

                        </gap>d scarce passed beyond the Mast, when his soul was already
wasted to Hell; such was the cruelty wherewithall hee intreated them, and so great
the hate they also bore towards him. Wee returned the next yeer after to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
being that of seventie three, and there wee learned how <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had gained
<hi>Tunez,</hi> and taking that Kingdome away from the Turks, had by installing <hi>Muley
Hamet</hi> therein, cut away all <hi>Muley Hameda's</hi> hopes to raign again there, who was
the most cruell and valiant Moor that ever lived.</p>
                     <p>The great Turk was very much grieved for this losse; and therefore using the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacitie
wherewithall all his race were indued, hee made Peace with the <hi>Venetians</hi> which
wished for it much more then hee did himself: And the yeer after of seventie and
four he assaulted the Fortresse of <hi>Goleta,</hi> and the other Fortresse that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had
raised neer unto <hi>Tunez:</hi> And in all these occasions I was present, tyed to the Oare,
without any hope of liberty; at least wise by ransome, being resolved never to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
by Letter my misfortunes to my Father. The <hi>Goleta</hi> was lost in fine, and also the
Fortresse, before which two places lay in siege seventy five thousand Turks, and more
then four hundred thousand Moors, and other Sarasins of all the other parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi>
being furnished with such aboundance of Munition and Warlike Engines, and so many
Pioneers as were able to cover <hi>Goleta</hi> and the Fortresse if every one did cast but his
handfull of earth upon them. Thus was <hi>Goleta</hi> accounted untill then impregnable,
first lost, the which did not happen through default of valour in the Defendants, who
in defence thereof did all they could or ought to have done; but because experience
shewed the facility wherewithall Trenches might bee raised in that desart sand; for
though water had been found in it within two spans depth, the Turks could
not finde it in the depth of two yards; and therefore filling many Sacks full of
Sand, they raised their Trenches so high as they did surmount the walls of the Sconce,
and did so gall the Defendants from them with their shot, as no one could stand to
make any defence: It was a common report, that our men would not immure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
within <hi>Goleta,</hi> but expect the enemie in the champain at their disembarquing:
but those that gave this out spake widely, as men very little acquainted with the like
Affairs: For if in <hi>Goleta</hi> and the Fortresse there were scarce seven thousand Souldiers,
how could so few a number, were they ever so resolute, make a sallie, and remain in
the Forts against so great a number of enemies? or how is it possible that the forces
which are not seconded and supplied should not bee overcome, specially being besieged
by many and obstinate enemies, and those in their own Countrey? But many others
esteemed, and so did I likewise among the rest, that almighty God did a particular
grace and favour unto <hi>Spain</hi> in that manner permitting to bee destroyed the stop and
cloak of all wickednesse, and the Spundge and Moth of innumerable summes of money
spent there unprofitably, without serving to any other end, then to preserve the memory
of being gained by the Emperour <hi>Charles the fift,</hi> as if it had been requisite for the
keeping of it eternall (as it is and shall be ever) that those stones should sustain it. The
<pb facs="tcp:54746:113"/>
Fortresse was also wonne; but the Turks were constrained to gain it span by span; for
the Souldiers which defended it fought so manfully and resolutely, as the number of
the enemies slain in two and twenty generall assaults which they gave unto it, did passe
five and twenty thousand. Never a one was taken Prisoner but three hundred which
survived their fellows; a certain and manifest token of their valour and strength, and
how well they had defended themselves and kept their Fortresses with great magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.
A little Fort or Turret that stood in the mid'st of the place, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Don Iohn Zonaguera</hi> a <hi>Valentian</hi> Gentleman, and famous Souldier, was yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon composition, and <hi>Don Pedro de Puerto carrero,</hi> Generall of <hi>Goleta,</hi> was taken
Prisoner who omitted no diligence possible to defend the place; but yet was so grieved
to have lost it as hee dyed for very grief on the way towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whither
they carried him Captive. The Generall likewise of the Fort, called <hi>Gabriel Cerbellon,</hi>
being a Gentleman of <hi>Milan,</hi> and a great Engineer, and most resolute Souldier, was
taken; and there dyed; in both the places many persons of worth, among which <hi>Pagan
de Oria</hi> was one, a Knight of the Order of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> of a most noble disposition, as the
exceeding liberality which hee used towards his brother the famous <hi>Iohn Andrea de
Oria</hi> cleerly demonstrates, and that which rendred his death more deplorable, was,
that hee was slain by certain Sarasins (which hee trusted, perceiving how the Fort was
lost) who had offered to convey him thence in the habit of a Moor to <hi>Tabarca,</hi> which is
a little Haven or Creek possest by the Genevoses that fish for Corrall in that coast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
These Sarasins cut off his head and brought it to the Generall of the Turkish Armie,
who did accomplish in them the Spanish Proverd, <hi>That although the Treason pleaseth,
yet is the Traytor hated:</hi> and so it is reported, that hee commanded those to bee hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that had brought him the present, because they had not brought it alive.</p>
                     <p>Among the Christians that were lost in the Fort, there was one called <hi>Don Pedro
de Aguilar</hi> born in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> in some Town whose name I have forgotten; hee had
been ancient in the Fortresse, and was a Souldier of great account, and of a rare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and specially had a particular grace in Poetrie: This I say, because his
fortune brought him to bee Slave to my Patron, even into the very same Gally and
and bench whereon I sate. This Gentleman made two Sonnets in form of Epitaphs,
the one for the <hi>Goleta,</hi> the other for the Fort; and I will repeat them because I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them very well, and doe believe that they will bee rather gratefull then any
thing disgustfull to the Audients. As soon as ever the Captive named <hi>Don Pedro de
Aguilar, Don Fernando</hi> beheld his <hi>Camarada's,</hi> and they all three did smile: And
when hee began to talk of the Sonnets, one of them said, Before you passe further, I
beseech you, good Sir, let me intreat you to tell me what became of that <hi>Don Pedro de
Auguilar</hi> whom you have named. That which I know of that Affair, answered the
Captive, is, That after hee had been two yeers in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hee fled away in the
attire of an Armenian with a Greek Spie, and I cannot tell whether hee recovered
his liberty or no; although I suppose hee did: for within a yeer after I saw the Greek
in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but I had not the oportunitie to demand of him the successe of that
Voyage. Hee came then into <hi>Spain,</hi> quoth the Gentleman; for that same <hi>Don Pedro</hi> is my brother, and dwells now at home in our own Town, very well, rich married, and
a Father of three Sonnes. God bee thanked, quoth the Captive, for the infinite favour
hee hath shewed unto him: for in mine opinion there is not on earth any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
able to bee compared to that of recovering a mans lost libertie. I doe moreover,
said the Gentleman, know the Sonnets which my brother composed. I pray you then,
good Sir, quoth the Captive, repeat them; for perhaps you can say them better then
I. With a very good will, answered the Gentleman, and that of the <hi>Goleta</hi> is thus.</p>

The Sonnets were not misliked: and the Captive was greatly recreated with the newes
which he received of his companion, and prosecuting his Historie, he said. The <hi>Goleta,</hi>
and the Fort being rendred, the <hi>Turkes</hi> gave order to dismantell <hi>Goleta:</hi> for the Fort
was left in such sort, as there remained nothing up that might be overthrowne: and to
doe it with more brevity and lesse labour, they undermined it in three places, but that
which seemed least strong, could not be blowne up by any of them, which was the
old walls; but all that which had remained a-foot of the new fortifications and workes
of <hi>Fratin,</hi> fell downe to the ground with great facility: and this being ended, the Navy
returned triumphant and victorious to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> where within a few moneths
afterward my Lord <hi>Vchali</hi> died whom they called <hi>Vchali Fertax,</hi> which signifies in
<pb facs="tcp:54746:114"/>
the Turkish language, the scald or scurvie runagate, for hee was such: and it is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
among the Turks to give one another nick-names either of the defects, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and virtues which they have; and the reason hereof is, that among them all
they have but four linages that have sur-names, and these doe contend with that of
<hi>Ottoman's,</hi> for Nobility of blood: And all the rest, as I have said, doe take denomination,
sometime from the blemishes of the bodie, and sometime from the virtues of the minde:
And this scurvie fellow did row fourteen yeers, being the great Turks Slave, and did
renounce his faith, being four and thirtie yeers old, for despight, and because hee might
bee revenged on a Turk that gave him a cuff on the face as hee rowed; and his valour
was so great, as without ascending by the dishonourable means and waies usually taken
by the greatest minions about the great Turk, he came first to be King of <hi>Argiers,</hi> and
after to bee Generall of the Sea, which is the third most noble charge and dignitie of
all the Turkish Empire: Hee was born in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and was a good morall man,
and used with great humanity his Slaves, whereof he had above three thousand, which
were after his death divided as hee had left in his Testament, between the great Turk
(who is ever an inheritour to every dead man, and hath a portion among the deceased
his children) and his Runagates. I fell to the lot of a Venetian Runagate, who being
a Ship-boy in a certain Vessell, was taken by <hi>Vchali,</hi> who loved him so tenderly, as
hee was one of the deerest youths hee had, and hee became after the most cruell Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate
that ever lived: Hee was called <hi>Azanaga,</hi> and came to bee very rich, and
King of <hi>Argiers:</hi> With him I came from <hi>Constantinople</hi> somewhat contented in
minde, because I should bee neerer unto <hi>Spain;</hi> not for that I meaned to write u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any one of my unfortunate successe, but only to see whether fortune would prove more
favorable to me in <hi>Argiers</hi> then at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where I had attempted a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
waies to escape, but none of them sorted to any good effect: and I thought to
search out in <hi>Argiers</hi> some other means to comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sse that which I so greedily desired;
for the hope of attaining libertie sometime had never abandoned me; and when in the
contriving I thought, or put my designes in practice, and that the successe did not
answer mine expectation, presently without forsaking me, it forged and sought
out for another hope that might sustain mee, although it were debile and
weake.</p>
                     <p>With this did I passe away my life, shut up in a Prison or House, which the Turks
call <hi>Bathes,</hi> wherein they doe inclose the Captive Christians, as well those that belong
to the King, as other particular mens, and those which they call of the <hi>Almazen,</hi>
which is as much to say, as Slaves of the Counsell, who are deputed to serve the Citie
in the publique works and other Affairs thereof; and these of all other Captives doe
with most difficultie attain to libertie; free by reason they belo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g to the Commonalty,
and have no particular Master; there is none with whom a man may treat of their
Redemption, although they should have the price of their Ransome. To these <hi>Bathes,</hi>
as I have said, some particular men carrie their Captives to bee kept, chiefly if they bee
to bee Ransomed; for there they have them at their ease and secure, untill they bee
redeemed. The Kings Captives of Ransome also, doe not goe forth to labour with
the other poor crue, if it bee not when the paying of their Ransome is deferred; for
then, to the end they may make them write for money more earnestly, they make them
labour and goe to fetch Wood with the rest, which is no small toyl and trouble. I then
was one of those of Ransome; for as soon as it was known how I was a Captain,
notwithstanding that I told them of my little possibilitie and want of means, all could
not prevaile to disswade them from consorting me with the multitude of Gentlemen,
and those of Ransome: they put on me then a chain, rather to bee a token that I was
there for my Ransome, then to keep me the better with it: And so I passed away my
time there with many other Gentlemen, and men of marke, held and kept in there for
their Ransome, And although both hunger and nakednesse did vexe us now and then,
or rather evermore, yet nothing did afflict us so much, as to hear and see every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the cruelties that my Master used towards Christians. Every day hee hanged up
one, he set this man on a stake, and would cut off the others eares, and that for so little
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54746:114"/>
occasion or wholy without it, as the very <hi>Turks</hi> themselves perceived, that hee did it not
for any other cause, but because he had a will to do it, and that it was his naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be a homicide of all humane kind. Onely one <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldier called such a one of
<hi>Saavedra,</hi> was in his good grace, who although he did sundrie things that will remaine
in the memory of that Nation for many yeeres, and all to the end to get his
liberties; yet hee never strucke him, nor commanded him to bee strucken, nor
said as much as an evill word unto him: and yet we all feared that he should
be broched on a stake for the least of many things which he did, and himselfe did also
dread it more then once; and if it were not that time denieth me leisure
to doe it, I would recount unto you things done by this souldier, which
might both entertain and astonish you much more then the relation of my life.</p>
                     <p>There were over the square court of our prison certain windowes that looked into it,
and belonged to a certain rich and principall <hi>Moor;</hi> the which windowes (as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
are all the <hi>Moors</hi> windowes) rather seemed to be holes then windows: and even
these were also very closely covered and shut fast with linnen coverings. It therefore
befell that standing one day upon the battlements of our prison with other three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
trying which of us could leap best in his shackles to passe away the time, and
being alone (for all the other Christians were gone abroad to labour) I lifted up by
chance mine eyes, and I saw thrust out at one of those so close-shut windows a cane, and
a linnen tied at the end thereof, and the cane was mooved and wagged up and down,
as if it had made signes, that wee should come and take it: wee looked upon it, and
one of my companions went under the cane, to see whether they would let it fall, or
what they would doe else but as soone as he approached it, the cane was lifted up,
and did stirre it to eyther side, as if they had said (with wagging of the head) No, the
Christian returned to us; and the cane being eftsoones let fall, and beginning to
moove as it had done before, another of my fellowes went, and the same succeeded
unto him, that did to the first. Finally, the third approached it, with no better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
then the former two, which I perceiving, would not omit to trie my fortitude:
and as soon as I came neere to stand under the cane, it was let slip and fell within the
Bathes just at my feet I forthwith went to untie the linnen which was knotted,
wherein I found tenn <hi>Zianiys,</hi> which are certaine pieces of base gold, used among the
<hi>Moors,</hi> and worth, each of them ten Rials of our money. I leave to your discretion to
think if I was not glad of my booty: certes my joy and admiration was much, to think
whence that good might come unto us, but specially to my selfe, since the signes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
to let it fall to the other, did confirme cleerly that the favour was only addrest to
my self. I took my welcome money, broke the cane, and returned to the Battlements,
and viewed the window earnestly, and perceived a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eautifull hand issue out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
which did open and shut it again very speedily. By which imagining and thinking
that some woman that dwelled in that house, had done us the charity and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
in token of our thankfull minds, we made our courtesies after the <hi>Moorish</hi> fashion,
by inclining of our heads, bending of the body, and pressing our hands to our brests.
Within a while after, there appeared out of the same window a little crosse made of
canes, which presently was taken in again: this signe did confirm us in the opinion, that
there was some <hi>Christian</hi> woman captive in that place, and that it was she which did to
us the courtesie: but the whitenesse of her hand, and her rich bracelets destroyed
this presumption: although we did notwithstanding conjecture that it was some run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate
<hi>Christian,</hi> whom their Masters there doe very ordinarily take to wives, yea and
account very good hap to light on one of them; for they are much more accounted of,
then the women of the Nation it selfe.</p>
                     <p>Yet in all these Discourses we strayed very farr from the truth of the accident; and so
from thence-forward, all our passing of the time was imployed in beholding that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
as our North, wherein had appeared the Starr of the cane: but fifteen daies past
over, or we could descrie either it, or the hand again, or any other signe. And although
in the meane time we endeavour all that we might to know who dwelled in that house,
or whether there were any Runagate Christian therein, yet never a one could tell us
<pb facs="tcp:54746:115"/>
any other things, but that it belonged to a very rich and noble Moor, called <hi>Agui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morato,</hi>
who had been Constable of the Pata, a dignity among them of very great
qualitie.</p>
                     <p>But when wee thought least that it would rain any more <hi>Zianiys,</hi> by that way wee
saw the Cain suddainly to appear, and another linnen hanging on it, whose bulk was
much greater: and this befell when the Bath was freed of concourse, and void, as
the other time before. Wee made the accustomed triall, every one approaching it before
me, but without effect untill I came; for presently as I approached it, it was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fall. I untied the knot, and found inwreathed in it fourty Duckets of Spanish
gold with a Letter written in the Arabian tongue, and at the end thereof was drawn
a very great crosse. I kissed the crosse, took up the money, and returned again to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements,
and wee altogether made our receivers: The hand also appeared: I made
signes that I would read the paper, and the window was shut incontinently. All of us
were marvellously astonished, yet joyfull at that which had befaln us, and by reason
that none of us understood the Arabian tongue, the desire that wee had to understand
the contents of the Letter was surpassing great, but greater the difficultie to finde out
some trustie person that might read it. In the end I resolved to trust in this affair a
Runnagate of <hi>Murcia,</hi> who did professe himself to bee my very great friend, and
having by my liberalitie and other good turns, done secretly, obliged him to bee secreet
in the affair wherein I would use him: for some runagates are accustomed when they
have an intention to return into the Christian Countries, to bring with the testimonies
of the most principall Captives, wherein they inform, and in the amplest manner they
may, how the Bearer is an honest man, and that hee hath ever done many good turns
to the Christians, and that hee hath himself a desire to escape by the first commoditie.
Some Runnagates there are which procure those testimonies sincerely, and with a good
intention: Others take the benefit of them either by chance or industrie; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to goe and rob into the Countries of Christians, if by chance they be astray or
taken, bring forth their testimonies, and say, that by those papers may bee collected
the purpose wherewithall they came, that is, to remain in Christian Countries; and
that therefore they came abroad a Pyrating with the other Turks: and by this means they
escape that first brunt, and are reconciled again to the Church, without receiving any
harme at all: and when they espie their time, doe return again into Barbarie, to bee such
as they were before. Others there are which procure those writings with a pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and doe after stay in Christian Countries. Well, this my friend was a Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of this last kinde; who had the testimonies of all my Companions, wherein wee
did commend him as amply as wee could devise: And certainly if the Moors had
found those Papers about him, they would have burnt him for it. I understand how
hee could speak the Arabian tongue very perfectly, and not only that alone, but also
write it withall: yet before I would wholly break my minde to him, I requested him
to reade mee that scrowle, which I had found by chance in a hole of my Cabine, hee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it, and stood a good while beholding and construing thereof, murmuring some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
betweene his Teeth. I demanded therefore of him, whether hee understood it?
And he answered that hee did very well, and that if I desired to have it translated <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi>
I should bring unto him Pen and Inke, to the end hee might doe it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely;
wee presently gave unto him that which hee asked, and hee did translate it by
little and little, and havi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>g finished it, hee said; All that is here in Spanish, is punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
without omitting a Letter, the contents of the Moorish paper: And
here you must note, that where it sayes <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> it meanes <hi>our Ladie the

Woman Captive, that taught me in mine own tongue
all the Christian Religion, and told me many things of
<hi>Lela Marien.</hi> The Christian dyed, and I know shee went not to the
fire, but to <hi>Ala;</hi> for shee appeared to me twice after her death, and
bade me goe to the Christian Countrey to see <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> who loved
me much: I know not how I may goe: I have seen many Christians
thorow this Window, and none of them hath seemed to me a Gentleman
but thy self: I am very beautifull and young, and I have a great deal
of Riches to carry with me. See thou whether thou canst contrive the
way how wee may depart, and thou shalt there bee my Husband, if thou
pleasest; and if thou wilt not, I doe not greatly care, for <hi>Lela Marien</hi>
will provide me of a Husband. I wrote my self this Billet; bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
warie whom thou trustest to read it: Doe not trust any Moor;
for they are all of them deceitfull Traytors. It is this that grieves me
most of all; for I would not have thee, if it were possible, to disclose the
matter to any living bodie: for if my Father did know it, hee would
throw me down into a Well and oppresse me in it with stones. I
will hang a thread to the end of the Cane, and therein thou mayst tye
thine Answer. And if thou canst not write the Arabian, tell me thy
minde by signes, for <hi>Lela Marien</hi> will make mee to understand it.
Who with <hi>Ala</hi> preserve thee, and this Crosse which I doe many times
kisse: for so the Captive commanded me to doe.</p>

                     <p>See, good Sir, if it was not great reason, that the reasons comprehended in this
Letter should recreate and astonish us. And certainly the one and the other was so
great, as the Runagate perceived well that the Paper was not found by chance, but was
really addressed unto some one of us; and therefore desired us earnestly, that if that
were true which hee suspected, that wee would trust and tell it unto him, and hee
would adventure his life to procure our Liberties: And saying this, hee took out of
his bosome a Crucifixe of mettle, and protested with very many teares by the God
which that Image represented, in whom hee, although a sinner and wicked man, did
most firmly believe, that hee would bee most loyall and secreet to us in all that which
wee would discover unto him; for it seemed to him, and hee almost divined, that
both himself and wee all should recover our liberties by her means that did write the
Letter; and hee should then also see himself in the State which hee most desired, to wit,
in the bosome of his Mother the holy Catholique Church; from which, through his
ignorance and sinne, hee was departed and divided as an unprofitable and corrupt
member. The Runnagate said this with so many teares, and such evident tokens of
repentance, as all of us consented to open our mindes unto him, and declare the truth
of the matter; and so we recounted unto him the whole discourse, without conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any circumstance, and shewed unto him the Window by which the Cane was wont
to appear; and hee marked the house from thence, and rested with speciall charge to
<pb facs="tcp:54746:116"/>
inform himself well of those that dwelled therein. Wee thought also that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to answer the Moorish Ladies Letter: and therefore having him present that
could so well perform that task, wee caused the Runnagate to draw out an answer
presently as I did dilate it to him, which was punctually such as I will recount: for of
all the most substantiall points that befell me in that Affair, no one is faln out of my
memorie, nor shall ever as long as I have breath. In effect that which I answered to
the Moor was this.</p>

will vouchsafe to instruct you how you may bring the matter to passe
which shee commandeth you to doe; for shee is so good as shee will
easily condiscend to doe it. As for my part I doe promise, as well for
my self as for these other Christians that are with me, to doe for you
all that wee are able to doe untill death. Doe not omit to write unto
me, and acquaint me with your purposes, and I will answer you every

that you may securely, and without any dread, advise us of all that you
shall think good. And as concerning that which you say, that you will
become my Wife after we arive to the Christian Countries, I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

                     <p>The Letter being written and inclosed, I expected two dayes, that the Bathes might
be free of concourse, as it was wont, which as soone as it befell, I went up to my accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
place of the battlements, to see whether the cane appeared; which was presently
after thrust out at the window. And as soon as I perceived it, although I could not
note who it was that set it, I shewed my paper, to give them warning to set on the
threed: but it was already hanging thereon. To the which I tied the Letter, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while after began to appear our Starr, with the white flagg of peace, and the
knotted linnen; which they let fall, and I tooke up, and I found therein in divers sorts
of money and gold more then fiftie Ducats, which redoubled our joyes more then fifty
times, and confirmed the hope wee conceived of attayning Libertie. The very same
night our Runnagate returned to us, and told, how hee had learned that the very same
Moor which we were informed of before called <hi>Aguimorata,</hi> dwelt there, and was exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
rich, and had one only daughter, the Heir of all his goods; of whom the common
opinion throughout the City was, that shee was the fairest woman of all Barbarie: and
that many of the Vice-Royes that came there, had demanded her to wife, but shee
would never condiscend to any motion of mariage; and that hee likewise had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that shee had sometimes a Christian captive, which now was deceased: all which
agreed with the contents of the Letter. We presently entred in Councell with the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate,
about the means wee were to use, to fetch away the <hi>Moor,</hi> and come all of us
to <hi>Christian</hi> Lands, and in the end we concluded to attend for that time, the second
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54746:116"/>
advice of <hi>Zoraida</hi> (for so was shee then called, who now means to name her selfe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>)
for as much as we cleerely perceived that it was shee, and none other, that could
minister to us the meanes to remove all these difficulties. After wee had rested on this
resolution, the Runagate bid us bee of good courage, for hee would ingage his life, or
set us at liberty. Foure dayes after the Bathes were troubled with People; which was
an occasion that the Cane appeared not all that while: But that impediment being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and the accustomed solitude returned, the Cane did againe appeare with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
hanging thereat so grosly impregned, as it promised to bee delivered of a most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
burthen. Both Cane and Linnen bent themselves to mee, and in them I found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paper and a hundred Ducats in Gold, besides other small money. The Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate
was present, and wee gave him the Letter to reade, the effect whereof
was this:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>I Know not good Sir, what order to give for our going into Spayne,
nor hath <hi>Lela Marien</hi> told mee any thing concerning it, although
I have demanded her counsaile. That which at present I conceive
may bee done is, that I will through this windowe give unto you
great store of money, wherewith you may redeeme your selfe and your
friends: and let one of you goe into the Christians Countrey and buy a
Barke, and after returne for his fellowes, and he shall finde mee in my
fathers Garden, which is at the gate of Babazon, neere to the Sea-coast,
where I meane to stay all the Summer, with my father aud my servants;
from whence you may take mee out boldly by night, and cary mee to the
Barke. And see well that thou wilt bee my Husband: For if thou wilt
not, I will demand of <hi>Marien</hi> to chastise thee; and if thou darest trust
no body to goe for the Vessell, Redeeme thy selfe and goe, for I know
thou wilt rather returne then another, seeing thou art a Gentleman and

where thou now art, I will make account that the Bath is emptie, and

                     <p>These were the contents of the seco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Letter, which being heard by us all, every one
offered to be himselfe the ransomed person, and promised to goe and returne with all
punctuality, and among the rest I also made a proffer of my selfe; to all which reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
the Runnagate opposed himselfe saying; That hee would consent in no wise
that any one of us should bee freed, untill wee were all together delivered; for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had taught him how evill Ransomed men were wont to keepe those promises
which they passed in the times of their thraldome; for many times certaine principall
captives had made that kinde of tryall, redeeming of some one or other that should goe
to Valentia or Mallorca, with money to freight a Barke or Friggot, and returne for
him that had ransomed them, and did never returne againe; for the recovered liberty,
and the feare of adventuring to lose it againe concurring, did blot out of their memory
all the other obligations of the world. And to confirme the truth which hee averred,
hee briefly recounted unto us an accident which befell much about the same time, to
certain Christian Gentlemen, the strangest as I suppose that ever hapned in those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
wherein doe succeed every other day events full of wonder and admiration; and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:117"/>
and therefore concluded, that what ought and might bee done, was, that they would
give unto him to buy a Bark, such money as they meant to imploy in the ransome of
a Captive, and hee would buy it there in <hi>Argiers,</hi> under pretext of becoming a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
and Sayler in <hi>Tetuan</hi> and that coast: and being once owner of a Bark, hee would
easily devise how to have them out of the Baths and imbarque them all: how much
more if the Moorish Ladie did as shee promised, give them money enough to ransome
them all was it a most easie thing, they being free, to imbarque themselves at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?
But the greatest difficultie in this Affair was, that the Moors use not to permit
any Runnagate to buy any Barke or other small Vessell, but only great Vessels of War;
for they suspect that hee that buyes a Barke, specially if hee bee a Spainiard, does it for
no other end but to runne away to Christian Countries. And yet hee knew how to
facilitate that inconvenience, by inducing a Tangerine Moor to become his Partner
of the Barke and the gains that should hee gotten by the commodities thereof, and with
this shadow he would become Lord of it himself, and therewithall accounted the matter
ended. And although that my self and my <hi>Camarada's</hi> held it the better course to send
unto <hi>Mallorca</hi> for one, as the Moorish Lady said, yet durst wee not contradict him,
fearfull that if wee did not what hee would have us to doe, hee would discover us and
indanger our lives, if hee did once detect <hi>Zoraida's</hi> practices, for the safe-guard of
whose life wee would all of us most willingly adventure our own: and therefore wee
determined to put our selves into Gods and the Runnagates hands: And so wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
at the same instant to <hi>Zoraida,</hi> telling her that wee would accomplish all that
shee had admonished us, because shee had advertised us as well as if <hi>Lela Marien</hi> had
told her what shee should say, and that the dilating or shortning of the Affair did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
onely in her self. I did offer my self a new to become her Husband; and with this
the day insuing, wherein the Bath was also free, shee sent me down at divers times by
the Cane two thousand Ducats and a Letter, wherein shee said that shee would goe
to her Fathers Garden the next <hi>Iumia,</hi> that is, the Friday following, and that before
shee: went away shee would give us more money; and that if it were not enough, wee
should advise her, and shee would give unto us as much as wee would demand; for
her Father had so much treasure as hee would never perceive it; how much more
seeing shee had and kept the keyes of all. Wee gave five hundred Crowns presently
to the Runnagate to buy a Barke, and with eight hundred I redeemed my self, giving
the money to a Valentian Merchant which was at that season in <hi>Argiers,</hi> who did
ransome me of the King, taking me forth on his word, which hee passed to pay my
ransome at the arrivall of the first Ship that should come from <hi>Valentia:</hi> For if hee
had delivered the money instantly, it would have given occasion to the King, to suspect
that my ransome was many dayes before in <hi>Argiers,</hi> and that the Merchant had kept it
silently to make his benefit thereof. Finally, my Master was so cavilous, as I durst not
in any wise pay him presently.</p>
                     <p>The Thursday before the Friday of the beautifull <hi>Zoraida's</hi> departure towards the
garden, she gave unto us other two thousand Ducats, and did likewise advise us of
her going away, intreating me, that as soon as I had ransomed my selfe, I should learn
the way to the garden, and take occasion howsoever to goe to it, and see her. I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her briefly, that I would doe so, and prayed her that she would carefully commend
our proceedings to <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> with those prayers which the captive had taught
her. This being done, order was also given for the ransoming of my three companions,
to facilitate our issue out of the Bathes, and also that they seeing me free, and them
selves undelivered, might not bee troubled or perswaded by the Devill, to doe any thing
in prejudice of <hi>Zoraida:</hi> For although that they, being the men of that quality
they were, might assure me from this feare, I would not, for all that, adventure the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and therefore I caused them to bee ransomed by the same meanes that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
my selfe, giving all the money to the Merchant, that hee might with the more
security passe his word for us: to whom yet we never did discover our practice and
secret, by reason of the eminent danger of the discovery thereof.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IFTEEN dayes were not fully expired, when the Runnagate had
bought him a very good Barke, able to hold thirty persons or more,
and for the better colour and assurance of his businesse, hee made a
Voyage to a place called Sargel, which is thirty leagues distant from
Argiers toward the side of Oran, and is a great place of traffique for
drie figs. Hee made this Voyage twice or thrice in company with the
<hi>Tagarine,</hi> of whom wee made mention; and the name of Tagarino
is in Barbary given to the Moores of Arragon, Granada and Mudesares. And in the
Kingdome of Fez those Mudesares are called Elehes, and are the Nation which that
King doth most imploy in warlike affaires. You shall therefore vnderstand, that every
time hee passed by with his Barke, hee did cast Anchor in a little Creeke, twice the shot
of a Cros-bow from the Garden wherein <hi>Zoraida</hi> attended; and there the Runnagate
would in very good earnest exercise himselfe with the Moores that rowed, either to flie,
or else to assault one another in jest, as hee meant to doe after in good earnest, and
would now and then goe to <hi>Zoraidaes</hi> Garden and demand fruits, which her father
would bestow upon him, without knowing what hee was; and although hee desired
to have spoken with <hi>Zoraida,</hi> as hee told mee afterward himselfe, and have informed her
how it was hee that was to carry her away by my direction into the land of Christians,
and that shee should therefore live cheerefull and secure, yet was it never possible, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the women of that Nation doe not suffer themselves to bee viewed by any
Moore or Turke, if hee bee not their Husband, or that their Parents command them,
yet doe they haunt and communicate themselves to Christian captives freely, and that
sometimes more then is convenient, and truly it would have grieved mee, that he should
have spoken to her, for perhaps it would have perplexed her extraordinarily, to see her
affaire committed to the trust of a Runnagate; but God who did otherwise dispose it,
did not concur with this good desire of our Runagate, who seeing how safely hee went
and returned from <hi>Sargel,</hi> and that hee sounded when and where hee pleased, and that
the <hi>Tagarino</hi> his Partner, did only what he liked, and that I was ransomed, and nothing
else wanting but to finde out some Christian that would rowe; he bad me bethink my
self, what men I would bring away with me, beside those that I had ransomed, and that
I should warn them to be ready against the next Friday, wherein hee was resolved that
we should depart.</p>
                     <p>Seeing this, I spake to twelve Spaniards very lusty rowers, and those that could with
most liberty get out of the Citty: and it was not a little matter to finde so many there
at that time, for there were twenty Gallies abroade a robbing, which had carried all
the other rowers with them, and these were left behinde, because their Master did keepe
at home that Summer to finish a Galley that was on the Stockes a making. To these I
said nothing else, but onely warned them that the Friday insuing in the evening, they
should closely steale out by one and one, and goe towards <hi>Aguimorates</hi> Garden, and
there expect mee untill I came unto them. I gave this advice to every one of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
with order also, that although they saw any other Christians there, they should
tell them nothing else, but that I had commanded them to expect mee in that
place.</p>
                     <p>This diligence being used, yet wanted there another, which was the most expedient
of all, to wit, to advise <hi>Zoraida</hi> of the termes wherein our affaires did stand, to the
end she might be likewise ready and prepared, and not afrighted, though we did assault
<pb facs="tcp:54746:118"/>
her before the time that she could imagine the Barke of the Christians to bee come to
fetch her, and therefore I resolved to goe my selfe into the Garden, and see whether I
might speake with her, and taking the occasion to goe and gather some Herbes; I went
unto it the day before our departure, and the first person with whom I encountred,
was her father, who demanded of mee in a language which in all Barbarie and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople
is usually spoken by the Moores to their Captives, and is neyther Arabian,
Spanish, nor of any other Nation, but rather a mixture of all languages, wherewith
all of us understand one another: Hee, I say, in that kinde of speech demanded of
mee, what I sought for in that his Garden, and to whom I did belong? I answered,
that I was one <hi>Arnaute Mami</hi> his slave (and this, because I was very certainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that hee was his entire friend) and that I came thither to gather of all sorts of
herbs to make a Sallad: hee consequently asked of mee whether I was a man of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
or no, and how much my Master demanded for mee? And being in those que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and demands, the beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> descended from the house into the Garden,
who had espied mee a good while before: And as the Moorish women doe not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
estrange themselves from the sight of Christians, nor are in their behaviour or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
with them, any thing squeamish, as wee have said already, shee did not
greatly feare to approach the place where her Father talked with me, but rather her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perceiving that shee came on slowly, did call, and commanded her to draw neer.</p>
                     <p>It were a thing impossible for mee to recount the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>at beauty and gallant dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the bravery and riches of attyre, wherein my beloved <hi>Zoraida</hi> then shewed her
self to mine eyes. I will only say this, that there hanged more Pearles at her eares, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
faire neck and haire, then shee hath hayres on her head; about the wrests of
her legs, which were naked, after the manner of her Countrey, shee wore two <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caxes</hi>
(for so the manicles or bracelets of the feete are called in the Morisco tongue) of
the finest Gold, wherein were inchaced so many Diamonds, that as shee told mee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
her father valued them at twenty thousand Crownes; and those about the wrests
of her hands, were of equall esteeme, Her Pearles were many, and those most orient:
for all the chief bravery and ornament of the Moorish Ladies consists in the adorning
of themselves with Pearles and Pearle-seed, by reason whereof there is more Pearles and
Pearle-seed to bee found among the Moores, then among all other Nations of the
World: And <hi>Zoraidaes</hi> father had the fame to have many, and those the very best
that were in <hi>Argiers;</hi> and also above two hundred thousand Ducats of Spanish gold:
of all which was shee the Lady who now is mine. And if with all this ornament shee
could then seeme faire, by the reliques that have remained unto her among so many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
may bee easily guessed, what shee would have beene in the time of prosperitie.
For all of us doe know, that the beauty of some women hath limited dayes and seasons,
and requireth certaine accidents either to diminish or increase it, and it is a thing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to the passions of the minde, eyther to rayse or abase it; but most commonly they
wholly destroy it. To bee briefe, I say, that shee arived to the place where wee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
at that time most richly attyred, and beautifull beyond measure, or I at least
deemed her the fairest that I had ever heheld untill then: and herewithall remembring
the Obligation wherein shee had tyed mee, thought that some Deitie had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it selfe to my view, being come from Heaven to the Earth, for my recreation
and Reliefe.</p>
                     <p>As soone as shee was arived, her father told her in her owne language, how I was
his friend <hi>Arnaute Mami</hi> his captive, and that I came there to gather a Sallad: than
shee taking the speech, demanded in that medley of tongues of which I have spoken,
whether I was a Gentleman, and what the reason was why I redeemed not my selfe?
I made answere that I was already ransomed, and by the Ransome might bee conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in how much my Master valued me, seeing hee had for my libertie a thousand and
five hundred <hi>Coltamis.</hi> To this shee answered. In good sooth, if thou wert my fathers,
I would cause him not to give thee for twice as much more; for you Christians are
great Lyers, and doe make every one of your selves poore men, to defraud the
Moores of their due Ransome. It may well bee so, Maddam, quoth I: But
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54746:118"/>
I have, for my part used all truth in this affayre with my Master, and doe,
and will use truth with as many persons as I shall ever have occasion to treat with in this
World.</p>
                     <p>And when doest thou goe away, quoth <hi>Zoraida?</hi> To morrow, as I beleeve, quoth I.
For there is a French Vessell here which sets forth to morrow, and I mean to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in her. Were it not better, replyed <hi>Zoraida,</hi> to expect untill Vessells come out
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and goe away with them, then with those of France which are not your
friends? No, quoth I, although if it were true as the news runne, that there comes
a Vessell from <hi>Spain,</hi> I would attend it; but yet it is more certain that I shall depart
to morrow: for the desire I have to see my self at home in my Countrey, and with
those persons whom I love, is so great, as it will not permit me to expect any other
commoditie that fore-slowes it self, bee it never so good. Thou art doubtlesly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in thy Countrie, said <hi>Zoraida;</hi> and therefore desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st to goe see thy Wife. I am
not married, quoth I; but I have passed my word to marry as soon as I am there safely
arrived. And is shee beautifull to whom thou hast past it, quoth <hi>Zoraida?</hi> So beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
said I, as to indeer it and tell you the truth, shee is very like unto your selfe.
Hereat her Father laughed very heartily, and said, In good earnest, Christian, shee
must bee very fair that may compare with my daughter, who is the most beautifull of
all this Kingdom; and if thou wilt not beleeve me, look on her well, and thou shalt
see that I tell thee but the truth. Hee himself, as most perfect in the tongue, did serve
for the interpreter of most of our speeches; for although shee could speak that ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
language which is there in use, yet did shee manifest her minde more by signes
then by words.</p>
                     <p>Whilst thus we reasoned of many matters, there came running towards us a certaine
Moor, and told his Master how four Turkes had leaped over the Garden walls, and
were gathering the fruits, although they were not yet ripe. The old man and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Zoraida</hi> started hereat; for it is an universall and Naturall defect in the Moors to
fear the Turks, but specially the Souldiers of that Nation, who are commonly so insolent,
and have such command over the Moors that are their subjects, as they doe use them
worse then if they were their slaves. Therefore <hi>Zoraida's</hi> father said unto her; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
retire thy self into the house, and keep thy self in whilest I goe speake to those
Doggs; and thou, Christian, goe and seek out thine Hearbs, and depart in a good hour,
and I pray <hi>Ala</hi> to conduct thee safely to thy Countrey. I inclined my self to him,
and hee departed to search out the Turks, leaving mee alone with <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who began
to make adoe as if shee went whither her father had commanded her. But scarce was
hee covered among the Trees of the Garden, when she returned to me with her eyes
full of teares, said <hi>Amexi Christiano, Amexi?</hi> that is, Goest thou away Christian,
goest thou away? I answered, yes Ladie, that I doe; but I will never depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thee: expect mee the next Friday, and bee not affrighted when thou shalt see us;
for wee will goe to the Christian Countrey then without all doubt. This I said to her
in such sort, as shee understood all my words very well; and casting her arme over my
neck, shee began to travell with languishing steps towards the house; and fortune
would (which might have been very ill, if Heaven had not rectified it) that as wee
walked together in that manner and forme, her Father (who did by this return, after
hee had caused the Turks to depart) espyed us; and wee saw also very well how hee had
perceived us; wherefore <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who is very discreet would not take away her arme
from my neck, but rather drew neerer unto me, and laid her head on my brest, and
bowed her knees a little, with evident token that shee swouned; and I likewise made
as though I did sustain her up by force. Her Father came running over towards us,
and seeing his Daughter in that state, demanded the cause of her; but seeing shee made
no answer, hee himself said, Shee doubtlesly is dismaid by the suddain affright shee
took at the entrance of those Doggs: And taking her away from me, hee bowed her
to his own brest; and shee breathing out a sigh, with her eyes yet full of teares, said
again, <hi>Amexi Christiano, Amexi:</hi> Goe away Christian, goe away. To which her
Father, replyed, There is no cause, Daughter, why the Christian should goe away, for
<pb facs="tcp:54746:119"/>
hee hath done thee no harme, and the Turks are already departed. Sir, they have
affrighted her (quoth I) as you have said; but yet since shee hath commanded me to
goe away, I will not offend her; therefore rest in peace; for I will return, if it please you
to give mee leave, for herbs to this garden when it is needfull; for my Master saies,
none better are to be found for Sallads in any garden then you have in this. Come as
oft as thou wilt said <hi>Aguimorato,</hi> for my daughter saies not this, in respect that thou or
any other Christian hath offended her, but that, meaning to say, that the Turkes should
goe away, she bad thee to depart, or else she spake it because it is time for thee to gather
thine Herbs.</p>
                     <p>With this I took leave of both, and shee seemed at the instant of my departure to have
had her heart torne away from her as shee departed with her Father; and I under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of seeking Herbs, went about all the Garden at my leisure, and viewed all the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and the entrances thereof, the strength of the house, and the commodities that
might bee offered to facilitate our enterprise. This being done, I came home and made
a relation to the Runnagate and my other fellowes of all that had passed, and did long
infinitely to see the houre wherein I might, without any af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>right or danger, possesse
that happinesse which fortune in the faire and lovely <hi>Zoraida</hi> offered unto me. In fine,
the time passed over, and the so much desired day and terme arived, and every one of
us following the order, which with mature consideration and long discourse wee had
agreed on, wee found the good successe wee desired: For the very Friday following
the day wherein I had spoken with <hi>Zoraida</hi> in the Garden, <hi>Morrenago</hi> (for so was
the Runnagate called) neer night cast Anchor almost right before the place wherein the
beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> remained. The Christians also that were to row were ready, and
hidden in sundry places thereabouts. All were suspended, and resolutly expected my
comming, desirous to set upon the Barke that was before their face; for they knew
not of the agreement that was betweene me and the Runnagate; but rather made full
account that they were to gain their liberty by force of Armes, and killing the Moors
that came in that Vessell.</p>
                     <p>It therefore befell, that as soon as I and my fellows appeared, all the rest that were
hidden, and espyed us, made forthwith over towards us. This was at an hour when
the Citie Gates were shut, and never a body abroad among all those Fields: And
when wee were all together, wee were in doubt whether it would bee best first to
goe and fetch <hi>Zoraida,</hi> or to imprison and stone the Tagerine Moors that rowed in
the Frigat. And being in this doubt, the Runnagate came to us, asking upon what wee
stayed, for it was now high time to bee going away, and all his Moors were wretchlesse
and the greater number of them asleep. Wee told him then the cause of our stay: And
hee answered, That it was of most importance first to subject the Vessell, which might
bee done with very great facility, and without any perill; and that wee might goe
after for <hi>Zoraida.</hi> His opinion liked us all very well; and therefore without lingring
any longer, hee leading the way, wee came to the Vessell, and hee himself leaping in
first of all, set hand to his Falchion, and said in Morisco, Let none of you that is here
stir himself if hee love his life. And saying so, all the rest of the Christians entred. The
Moors which were of little Spirit, hearing their Master say so, were marvellously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
and without daring any one of them to set hand to their Armes, which were
but a few at all, they suffered themselves very quietly to bee taken and bound by the
Christians, which did it very dexteriously, threatning them, that if they did let slip the
least out-cry, they should presently bee all put to the Sword. This being finished,
and the half of our people remaining in their Guard, wee that were left, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
also by the Runnagate, went towards <hi>Aquimoratus</hi> Garden; the doore
thereof did, by very good hap, open with as little noyse as if it had had no lock at all:
Whereupon wee went with great quietnesse and silence towards the house, unseen or
espied of any.</p>
                     <p>The beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> was the while expecting us at a window, and as soon as shee
saw people approach, demanded with a low voyce whether wee were Nizarans, as if
shee would say or ask whether wee were Christians? I answered that wee were, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54746:119"/>
willed her to come down. As soon as shee knew me shee stayed not a Minute, but
without answering any word came down in an instant; and opening the door shewed
her self to us all, more beautifull and richly attyred then I am able in any sort to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.
As soon as I saw her I took her by the hand and kissed it: the same did the
Runnagate, and my two <hi>Camarada's;</hi> and all the rest which knew not the matter, did
as they had seen us doe before them; for it seemed that wee did no more but give her
thanks, and acknowledge her the auctresse of all our liberties. The Runnagate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of her in her own language, whether her Father were in the Garden, or no?
Shee answered that hee was, and that hee slept. Then will it bee requisite, quoth the
Runnagate, to rouse him, and bear him and all the other things of worth in this Garden
away with us. That shall not bee so (quoth shee) for I will have no man to touch my
Father; and in this house there is nothing of value, but that which I mean to carrie
away with my self, which is so much as will bee sufficient to cheer and inrich you all;
as, if you will stay but a while, you shall perceive.</p>
                     <p>And saying so, shee entred again in into the house, promising to return to us spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and bade us stand still without making any noyse. I demanded of the Runnagate
what speech had passed betwen them? And hee told mee all shee had said. And I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him again, that I would not have <hi>Zoraida's</hi> will transgrest in any sort. By this
time she returned laden with a little Casket full of Gold, so that shee was scarceable to
bear it. And her Father in the mean season, by bad fortune, awaked, and heard the
noise that was beneath in his Garden, and looking out at a Window, hee perceived
that they were all Christians that were in it; and therefore cried out in a loud and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
manner, in the Arabian tongue, <hi>Christians, Christians, Theeves, Theeves;</hi>
by which cries wee were all of us structen into very great fear and confusion: but the
Runnagate seeing the perill wherein wee were, and how neerly it concerned him to
come off from that enterprize, before hee were discovered, ranne up very speedily to
the place where <hi>Aquimorato</hi> stood, and some of our fellowes accompanied him (for
I durst not abandon <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who had faln between mine armes all amazed:) and in
conclusion, those which had mounted behaved themselves so well, as they brought
<hi>Aquimorato</hi> down in a trice, having tyed his hands and set a gagg in his mouth which
hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed his speech, threatning him that if hee did speak but a word it should cost him
his life.</p>
                     <p>When his Daughter saw him shee covered her eyes, because shee would not behold
him: And hee marvelled, wholly ignoring with how good a will shee came away with
us: but then considering that nothing was so requisite as our leggs, wee did with all
velocitie and dilligence get into the Frigat; for our Companions did perplexedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
our return, half afraid that some disgrace had befaln us. Scarce were two hours
of the night overrunne, when wee were all imbarked: and then wee unmanacled
<hi>Zoraida's</hi> Fathers hands, and took the cloth out of his mouth: But the Runnagate
did again admonish him, that as hee tendred his life, hee should not speake one word.
Hee beholding his Daughter likewise there, began to sigh very feelingly, but chiefly
perceiving me to hold her so straightly embraced, and that shee made no resistance,
nor did complain or seem coy, but stood quiet: But yet for all that hee kept
silence, fearing lest they should put the Runnagates menaces in execution. <hi>Zoraida</hi>
seeing her self now safe within the Barke, and that wee were ready to row away, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on her Father and the other Moors that were tyed therein, shee intreated the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agate
to tell mee how shee desired me to doe her the favour to set those Moors and
her Father at liberty; for shee would rather cast her self into the Sea then see a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who had loved her so dearly carried away captive before her eyes, and that also
by her occasion. The Runnagate told me her minde, and I answered how I was very
well pleased it should bee so. But hee replyed, That it was in no sort expedient, by
reason that if they were landed there, they would presently raise the Countrey and put
the whole Citie into a tumult, and cause certaine light Frigots to bee maned and sent
out in our pursuit; and lay both Sea and Land for us, in such sort as it would be impossible
for us to escape; but what was at the present possible to bee done, was to give
<pb facs="tcp:54746:120"/>
them libertie at the first <hi>Christian</hi> Countrey whereat wee happened to arive.</p>
                     <p>All of us agreed to this opinion, and <hi>Zeraida</hi> also (to whom reason was given of
the motives wee had, not to free them forthwith, and accomplish her will therein) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
satisfied; and therefore presently with joyfull silence and cheerfull diligence
every one of our lustie Rowers seizing upon his Oare, wee began, after wee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
our selves unto Almighty God, to lanch forth, and addresse our course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sles of <hi>Mallorca,</hi> which is the neerest <hi>Christian</hi> Countrey, but by reason that
the winde blew somwhat from the Mountaines, and that the Sea began to be rough, it
was not possible to continue that course, and so wee were forced to approach the
shore, and goe by little and little towards <hi>Oran,</hi> not without great grief and anguish,
for feare to bee espied by the towne of <hi>Sargel,</hi> which is on that coast, and falls some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie
leagues beyond <hi>Argiers:</hi> and wee did likewise feare to meete in that passage
some Galliot, of those which come ordinarily with Merchandize from <hi>Tetuan,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
every one of us for himselfe, and for all together did presume, that if wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
a Galliot of Merchandize, so it were not a Pyrate, that not only wee would
not bee lost, but rather would take the Vessell, that therein wee might with more secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
finish our Voyage. <hi>Zoraida,</hi> whilest thus wee sailed, went with her head betweene
my hands, because shee would not looke on her Father; and I felt her, how shee was
still invoking of <hi>Lela Marien</hi> to assist us; and having sayled about some thirty leagues
the morning overtook us about some three Musquet shot from Land, in a place that
seemed to bee Desart, and free from all accesse of those that might discover us; and yet
for all that, wee got by might and maine, somwhat further into the Seas that now was
become a little calmer; and having entred some two leagues into the Maine, order
was given that they should row by turnes, whilest they did refresh themselves and take
a little sustenance; for the Barke was very well furnished with Victuals, although
those which did row refused the offer, saying, that then it was no time to repose, and
that they should set those that did not row to dinner; for they would not yet in any
sort let goe their Oares. It being done as they had said, the winde did rise so much
as it made us abandoning our Oares, to set sail, and direct our Boat towards <hi>Oran,</hi>
being unable to take any other course: All was done with very great speed; and so
wee made by the sail more then eight miles an hour, free from all other fear then that
of encountring some Vessell of warre. Wee gave the Moors our Prisoners their dinner,
and the Runnagate comforted them, saying, That they went not as Prisoners, for they
should receive their Libertie upon the first commodity that were proffered: The same
was likewise said of <hi>Zoraida's</hi> Father, who returned them this answer: I would easily
expect and believe any other thing, O Christians, of your liberalitie and honourable
manner of proceeding: but doe not think that I am so simple, as once to imagine
that you will give me my Libertie; for you did never expose your self to the danger
of despoyling me thereof with intention to return it me so prodigally again, especially
knowing, as you doe, who I am, and the profit you may reap by giving me it again,
to which profit if you will put a name, and tell me how much would you demand, I doe
even from hence offer unto you all that which you will seek for me, and for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Daughter of mine: or if you will not deliver me, I will give you it for her
alone, who is the greatest and the best part of my Soul. And saying so, hee began to
weep so bitterly, as hee moved us all to compassion and forced <hi>Zoraida</hi> to look upon
him, who seeing him weep was so strangely moved, as arising from my feet, shee went
and embraced her Father, and laying her face upon his they began together so tender
a lamentation as many of us that were in the Bark were forced to keep them companie;
but when her Father noted her to bee so richly adorned, and with so many Jewells on
hee asked her in his own language, How haps this, Daughter, that yesternight late,
before this terrible disaster befell us wherein wee are plunged, I saw thee attyred in
thine ordinarie houshold array, and that now, without having had any leisure to apparell
thy self, or having given thee any glad tidings, for whose solemnizing thou oughtest
to adorn and publish thy selfe, I doe view thee thus clad in the richest attire which
I could bestow upon thee when our fortune was most favourable? Answer me to this,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54746:120"/>
for thou hast suspended and astonished me more then the very disgrace it self wherein
I am.</p>
                     <p>All that the Moor said to his Daughter, the Runnagate declared unto us; and shee
did not answer a word to him: But when hee saw the little Coffers lie at one side of
the Barke wherein shee was wont to keep her Jewells, and that hee knew very well
shee had left at <hi>Argiers,</hi> and not brought to the Garden, hee was much more amazed,
and demanded of her how that Coffer was come into our possession, and what things
shee had there within it? To which the Runnagate, without attending that <hi>Zoraida</hi>
should answer him, said, Sir, doe not trouble your self by demanding so many things
of your Daughter <hi>Zoraida;</hi> for with one that I will say, I shall satisfie them all: and
therefore you shall understand that shee is a Christian, and hath been the file that cut
off our chains, and is the Libertie it self of our Captivity; and shee goeth along with
us of her own free will, as content (if mine imagination doe not wrong me) to see
her self in this State, as hee is that commeth out of darknesse to the light, from death
unto life, and out of pain into glorie. Is it true, Daughter, which this man saies, quoth
the Moor? (It is, answered <hi>Zoraida:</hi>) That thou in effect art a Christian, replyed the
old man, and shee that hath put her Father into his enemies hands? To which <hi>Zoraida</hi>
answered, I am shee that is a Christian, but not shee that hath brought thee to this
passe: for my desire did never so estrange it selfe from thee, as to abandon or harme
thee, but only endeavoured to doe my self good. And what good hast thou done thy
self, Daughter? Demand that, said shee, of <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> for shee can therein inform
thee better then I can.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had the Moor heard her say so, when with incredible haste hee threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
headlong into the Sea, wherein hee had been questionlesly drowned, if the long
apparell hee wore on had not kept him up a while above the water. <hi>Zoraida</hi> cryed out
to us to save him: and so wee all presently ran, and laying hold on a part of his Turkish
Robe, drew him up half drowned, and wholly devoid of feeling: Whereat <hi>Zoraida</hi>
was so grieved, that shee lamented him as dolefully as if hee had been dead. There
wee laid him with his mouth downward, and hee avoided a great quantity of water,
and after the space of two hours returned to himself again: and in the mean time the
winde also turning; it did drive us towards the Coast; so that wee were constrained
to keep our selves by very force of Armes from striking upon it; and our good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
directing us, wee arrived to a little Creek at the side of a certain Cape or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montorie,
called by the Moors, The Cape of the <hi>Cava Rumia,</hi> which in our Language
signifies <hi>The ill Christian Woman:</hi> and the Moors hold it for a tradition, that in the
very same place was the <hi>Cava</hi> buried, for whom <hi>Spain</hi> was lost, and conquered by the
Moors: For <hi>Cava</hi> in their language signifies <hi>an ill Woman,</hi> and <hi>Rumia</hi> a <hi>Christian:</hi>
yea, and they hold it for a signe of misfortune to arrive or cast Anchor there, when
meer necessity drives them thither; without which they never approach it: yet did it
not prove to us the shelter of an ill woman, but the secure Heaven of our safety. Wee
sent our Sentinels a shore, and never let the Oares slip out of our hands: Wee did
likewise eate of the Runnagates Provision, and heartily besought Almighty God and
our Ladie to assist and favour us with a happy end to so luckie a beginning: And wee
agreed upon <hi>Zoraida's</hi> intreatie, to set her Father and the other Moors that we had
tyed a land in that place; for shee was of so tender and compassionate a minde as shee
could in no wise brook to see her Father tyed in her presence, or her countrey-men
borne away Captives: wherefore wee made her a promise, that wee would at our
departure let them all goe away, seeing wee incur'd no danger by leaving them in that
inhabitable Desart: Our Prayers were not so vain but that they found gentle accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in Heaven which presently changed the Winde and appeased the Sea, inviting us
cheerfully to returne to it again, and prosecute our commenced Voyage.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that the weather was favourable wee loosed the Moors and set them all
a land one by one; and comming to dis-imbarque <hi>Zoraida's</hi> Father, who was by that
time wholly come to himself, hee said, For what doe you conjecture, Christians, that
this bad woman is glad that you give me liberty? Doe you think that shee doth it for
<pb facs="tcp:54746:121"/>
pittie that shee takes of me? No truely; but shee doth it only to remove the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
my presence gave her when shee would execute her unlawfull desires: Nor
ought you to believe that shee is moved to change Religion, by reason that shee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
yours to be better then her own; but only because she knows licentiousnesse to
bee more publiquely and freely practised in your Countrey then among us: And then
turning to <hi>Zoraida,</hi> whom I and another Christian held fast by both the armes lest shee
should doe some desperate act, hee said, O infamous Gyrle, and ill-advised Mayden!
where doest thou runne thus blinded and distracted, in the power of those Doggs our
naturall enemies? Cursed bee the hour wherein I ingendred thee, and cursed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and pleasures wherein thou wast nousled. I perceiving that hee was not like to
make an end of his execrations so soon as I could wish, had him set on shore, and thence
hee prosecuted his Maledictions and Plaints, praying unto <hi>Makomet</hi> that hee would
intercede with <hi>Ala,</hi> that wee might bee all destroyed, confounded and cast away.
And when wee could heare his words no longer, by reason that wee set sail, wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his works, that were, to pluck his Beard, teare his Haire, and cast himself on the
ground; but once hee did lift vp his voyce so high, as that wee heard him say, Returne
beloved Daughter, returne to the land, for I doe pardon thee all that thou hast done;
and deliver that money to those men, for it is now their own; and return thou to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thy sad and desolate Father, who will forsake his life on these desolate sands, if thou
do'st abandon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zoraida</hi> heard him say all this, and lamented thereat, but knew not how to speak, or
answer him any other thing but this: Father mine, I pray <hi>Ala,</hi> that <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> who
hath been the cause of my becomming a Christian, may likewise comfort thee in thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
<hi>Ala</hi> knows well, that I could doe none other then I did, and that these Christians
doe owe me nothing for my good will, seeing that though I had not come away with
them, but remained at my house, yet had it been impossible (such was the haste where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
my soule pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed mee) not to have executed this my purpose; which seemes
to mee to bee as good, as thou, O beloved Father, doest account it wicked. Shee
said this in a time that neither her Father could heare her, nor wee behold him: and
therefore, after I had comforted <hi>Zoraida,</hi> wee did thenceforth onely attend our
Voyage, which was so much holpen by the favourable winde, as wee made full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to bee the next day on the Coast of Spaine: but, as good very seldome, or
rather never betides a man thorowly and wholly, without being accompanied or
followed by some evill which troubles and assaults it, our fortune would, or rather
the maledictions of the Moore, powred on his Daughter: (for the Curses of any
Father whatsoever are to bee feared) that being ingulfed three houres within night,
and going before the winde with a full Sayle, and our Oares set up, because the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
winde had rid us of the labour of rowing, wee saw neere unto us by the
light of the Moone that shined very cleerely, a round vessell which with all her Sailes
spread, did crosse before us into the Sea, and that so neerely, as wee were faine to
strike downe her Saile, that wee might avoide the shog shee was like to give us;
and those that were in her, had on the other side laboured also what they might, to
turne her out of our way, standing all of them on the hatches to demand of us what
wee were, from whence wee came, and whether wee did Saile? But by reason that
they spake French, the Runnagate bade us not to speake a word, saying, Let none an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
for these are French Pirates which make their booty of every body. For this
cause none of us answered: and being passed a little forward, and that the Ship
remained in the Lee of us, they suddenly shot off two Peeces of Artillery, and as I
thinke, both of them had chaine Bullets, for with the one they cut our Mast asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and overthrew it and the Saile into the sea, and instantly after they discharged
another, the Bullet alighting in our Barke, did pierce it thorow and thorow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any other hurt: but wee, seeing that our vessell began to sinke, began all
to crie out, and request them to succour us, and prayed them that they would take
us into their vessell, for wee were a drowning. Then they came amaine, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
out their Cock-boate, there entred into it as good as a doozen Frenchmen,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54746:121"/>
well appointed with their Harcabuzes and Matches lighted, and so approached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; and perceiving how few wee were, and that the Barke did sinke, they received
us into their boate, saying, that because wee had used the discourtesie of not mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them answer, that mis-fortune had befalne us. Our Runnagate about this time
tooke the coffer wherein <hi>Zoraida's</hi> treasures were kept, and threw it into the Sea
unperceived of any.</p>
                     <p>In conclusion, wee went all of us into the great vessell with the Frenchmen who
after they had informed themselves of all that which they desired to know, as if they
were our Capitall Enemies; they afterward dispoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed us of all that ever wee had
about us, and of <hi>Zoraida</hi> they tooke all, even unto her very bracelets, that shee
wore on the wrests of her feete. But the wrong they did to <hi>Zoraida</hi> did not afflict
me so much as the feare I conceived, that after they had taken away from her, her
most rich and precious Jewels, they would also deprive her of the Jewell of most
prize, and which shee valued most. But the desires of that nation extend themselves
no farther, then to the gaine of money: and their avarice in this is never thorowly
satisfied; and at that time was so great, as they would have taken from us the very
habits of slaves, that wee brough from Barbarie, if they had found them to have
beene worth any thing: and some there were of opinion among them, that we should
bee all inwreathed in a Saile, and throwne into the Sea, because they had intention
to traffique into some havens of Spaine, under the name of <hi>Britaines,</hi> and that if they
carried us alive, they should bee punished, their robbery being detected: but the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
who was hee that had pilled my beloved <hi>Zoraida,</hi> said, that hee was so conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his bootie, as he meaned not to touch any part of Spaine, but would pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> by night, or as hee might, and so returne againe to <hi>Rochel,</hi>
from whence hee was come: and thereupon they all agreed to give us their Cock-boate,
and all that was neces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ary for our short voyage, as indeede they performed
the day ensuing when wee were in the view of Spaine, with the sight whereof all our
griefes and poverties were as quite forgotten, as if wee never had felt any; so great
is the delight a man takes to recover his Liberty. It was about mid-day when they
put us into the Cocke, giving unto us two Barrells of water and some Bisket; and
the Captaine moved with some compassion, as the beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> embarked
her selfe, bestowed on her about forty Crownes in gold; nor would hee permit his
Souldiers to dispoyle her of these very Garments, which then and now shee doth
weare.</p>
                     <p>Wee entred into the Cock-boate, and giving them thanks for the good they did,
and shewing at our departure more tokens of thankfullnesse then of discontent, they
sayled presently away from us towards the Straights, and wee without looking on any
other North or Starre, then the land it selfe which appeared before us, did row towards
it so lustily, that at Sun-set wee were so neere, as wee made full account to arive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the night were far spent. But by reason that the Moone did not shine, and the
night was very darke, and that wee knew not where wee were, wee did not hold it the
best course to approach the shoare too neere; yet others there were that thought it
convenient and good, desiring that wee should make to it, although wee ranne the
boate on the Rocks, and far from any dwelling; for by doing so, wee should free our
selves from the feare which wee ought of reason to have, lest there should bee up and
downe on that coast any Friggots of the Pyrates of <hi>Tituan,</hi> which are wont to leave
<hi>Barbarie</hi> over-night, and bee on the coast of <hi>Spayne</hi> ere morning, and ordinarily make
their bootie, and turne to their supper againe to <hi>Barbarie</hi> the night following; but of
the contrary opinions, that which was followed was, that wee should draw neere the
land by little and little, and that if the quietness of the Sea would permit it we should
take land where we might best and most commodiously do it. This was done, and a little
before midnight wee arived to the foote of a high and monstrous Mountaine, which
was not altogether so neer to the Sea, but that it did grant a little patch of ground,
whereon wee might commodiously disimbarke. Wherefore wee ranne our selves on
the Sands, and came all a-Land and kissed the Earth, and with teeres of most joyfull
<pb facs="tcp:54746:122"/>
content and delight, gave thanks unto our Lord God, for the incomparable
favours which hee had done us in our Voyage: Then tooke wee out our Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
from the Boate, and drew it selfe up on the Shore, and ascended a great part
of the Mountaine: for although wee were in that place, yet durst wee not assure
our selves, nor did throughly beleeve that it was a Christian Countrey whereon wee
did tread.</p>
                     <p>The day breaking some what slower then I could have wished it; wee ascended
the mountaine wholly, to see whether wee might discover any dwelling, or sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds
from thence; but although wee extended our sight unto every quarter, yet
could wee neither descry dwelling, person, path, nor high-way: yet did wee resolve
notwithstanding to enter into the land, seeing that wee could not choose but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
ere long some body who might give us notice of the place where wee were:
and that which afflicted mee most of all, was, to see <hi>Zoraida</hi> goe afoot thorow
those rugged places; for although I did somtimes carry her on my shoulders, yet did the
toyle I tooke more weary her, then the repose shee got could ease her; and therefore
would never after the first time suffer mee to take that paines againe, and so shee went
ever after a foote with great patience and tokens of joy, I holding her still by the hand,
and having travelled little lesse then a quarter of a league, we heard the noyse of a little
bell, an infallible argument that neere at hand there was some cattle; whereupon all of
us looking very wistly, to see whether any body appeared, wee might perceive under a
Corke-tree a young Sheepheard, who very quietly and carelesly was carving of a stick
with a knife: Wee called to him, and hee leaped up lightly on foote, and (as we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
learned) the first that hee got sight of, were the Runnagate and <hi>Zoraida;</hi> whom
hee seeing apparelled in the <hi>Morisco</hi> habit, thought that all the people of <hi>Barbarie</hi> had
beene at his heeles; and therefore running very swiftly into the Wood, hee cried all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with marvelous lowdnesse, Moores, Moores are in the Land! Moores, Moores,
arme, arme! These outcries strooke us anew into a great perplexitie, and scarce did
wee know what wee should doe: but considering how the Sheepheards alarme would
cause all the Countrey to rise up, and that the horsemen that kept the coast would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
come to see what it was; wee all agreed that the Runnagate should put off his
<hi>Turkish</hi> attyre, and put on a captives cassocke, which one of the company gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him forthwith, although the giver remained after in his shirt: and thus commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the affaire unto almighty God, wee followed on by the same way, which wee
saw the sheepheard had taken, alwaies expecting when the horsemen of the coast
would fall upon us: and wee were not deceived in our expectation, for within two
houres after, having issued out of those woods into a plane, wee discovered about
some fifty horsemen which came running towards us as swiftly as their horses could
drive, and having perceived them, wee stood still, and stayed untill they came to us,
and saw in stead of the Moors they sought for, so many poore Christians, and remained
somwhat ashamed thereat: and one of them demanded whether wee were the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that a Sheapheard had given the alarme? Yes, quoth I, and as I was about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
what I was, and of all our Adventure, and from whence wee came, one of the
Christians that came with us, did take notice of the horseman who had spoken unto us,
and so interrupting my speech hee said, Sirs, let God bee praysed which hath brought
us to so good a place as this is; for if I bee not deceived, the earth which wee tread, is
of <hi>Veley Malaga;</hi> and if the yeeres of my captivity have not confounded my memorie,
you likewise Sir, that demand what wee bee, are <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Bustamonte,</hi> mine Uncle. As
soone as ever the Christian captive had spoken those words, the horseman leaping off his
horse, ran and embraced him saying, O Nephew! as deere to mee as my soule and life
now I doe know thee very well, and many a day since have I wept for thee, thinking
thou wast dead, and so hath my sister thy Mother, and all the rest of thy friends
which doe live yet, and God hath beene pleased to preserve their Lives, that they may
enjoy the pleasure to behold thee once againe. Wee knew very well that thou wert
in <hi>Argieres,</hi> and by the signes and tokens of thy clothes, and that of all the rest here
of thy Companions; I surmise that your escape hath beene miraculous. Indeede it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54746:122"/>
was so replyed the Captive, and wee shall have time I hope to recount unto you the
manner.</p>
                     <p>As soone as the horsemen had understood that wee were Christian Captives, they
alighted off their horses, and every one of them invited us to mount upon his owne, to
carry us to the City of <hi>Veley Malaga,</hi> which was yet a league and a halfe from that place
and some of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hem went to the place where wee had left the Boate, to bring it to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
whom we informed first of the place where it lay; others did mount us up on
horseback behind themselves, and <hi>Zoraida</hi> rode behinde the captives uncle: all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
issued to receive us, being premonished of our arivall by some one that had ridden
before. They did not wonder to see captives freed, nor Moors captived there, being an
ordinary thing in those parts, but that whereat they wondred was the surpassing beauty
of <hi>Zoraida,</hi> which at that season and instant was in her prime, as well through the
warmth she had gotten by her travell, as also through the joy shee conceived to see her
selfe in Christian lands, secure from all feare of being surprised or lost, and these things
called out to her face such colours, as if it be not that affection might then have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me, I durst aver, that a more beautifull then she was, the world could not afford,
at least amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g those which I had ever beheld.</p>
                     <p>Wee went directly to the Church to give thanks unto Almighty God for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
received: And as soon as <hi>Zoraida</hi> entred into it, shee said there were faces in
it that resembled very much that of <hi>Lela Marien.</hi> Wee told her that they were her
images: And the Runnagate as well as the brevitie of the time permitted, instructed
her what they signified, to the end shee should doe them reverence, as if every one of
them were truely that same <hi>Lela Marien</hi> which had spoken unto her. Shee who had
a very good understanding, and an easie and cleer conceit, comprehended presently
all that was told unto her concerning Images. From thence they carried us and divided
us among different houses of the Citie: But the Christian that came with us carried
the Runnagate, <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and me to the house of his Parents, which were indifferently
accommodated and stored with the goods of Fortune, and did entertain me with as
great love and kindenesse as if I were their own sonne. We remained six dayes in <hi>Veley,</hi>
in which time the Runnagate having made an information of all that which might
concern him, hee went to the City of <hi>Granado</hi> to bee reconciled by the holy Inquisitions
means, to the bosome of our holy Mother the Church: The rest of the freed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
took every one the way that hee pleased; and <hi>Zoraida</hi> and I remained behinde
with those Ducats only which the Frenchmans courtesie was pleased to bestow on
<hi>Zoraida:</hi> and with part of that summe I bought her this beast whereon shee rides; I
my selfe serving her hitherto as her Father and her Squire, and not as her Spouse, wee
travail with intention to see if my Father bee yet living, or any of my Brothers have had
more prosperous hap then my self, although seeing Heaven hath made me <hi>Zoraida's</hi>
Consort, me thinks no other good Fortune could arrive, were it never so great, that
I would hold in so high estimation. The patience wherewithall shee bears the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
usually annext unto Povertie, and the desires shee shews to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is such and so great, as it strikes me into an admiration, and doth move me to
serve her all the dayes of my life; although that the delight which I take to see my
self hers, and shee mine, is oft times interrupted, and almost dissolved by the fear which
I have, that I shall not finde in mine own Countrey some little Corner wherein I may
entertain her; and that Time and Death have wrought such alteration in the Goods
and Lives of my Father and Brothers, as I shall scarce finde any one at home that knows
me. I have no more, good Sirs, to tell you of my lives Historie, then which, whether
it bee pleasing and rare, or no, your cleer conceits are to judge: As for my self I
dare say, that if it had been possible, I would have told it with more brevity; fearing
it might bee tedious unto you, I purposely omitted many delightfull circumstances
thereof.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Captive having said this, held his peace; and <hi>Don Fernando</hi>
replyed to him thus; Truely Captain, the manner wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
you have recounted this marvellous successe, hath been such,
as it may bee parragon'd to the noveltie and strangenesse of the
event it self: And so great is the delight wee have taken in
the hearing thereof, as I doe beleeve, that although wee had
spent the time from hence till to morrow, in listening to it,
yet should wee bee glad to hear it told over once again. And
saying so, <hi>Cardenio</hi> and all the rest did offer themselves and
their means to his service, as much as lay in them with so cordiall and friendly words
as the Captive remained throughly satisfied with their good wits: but specially <hi>Don
Fernando</hi> offered, that if hee would return with him, hee would cause the Marquesse
his Brother to bee <hi>Zoraida</hi> her Godfather in Baptisme; and that hee for his part,
would so accommodate him with all things necessary, as hee might enter into the Town
with the decencie and authoritie due to his person. The Captive did gatifie his large
offers very courteously, but would not accept any of them at that time. By this the
night drew on, and about the fall thereof there arived at the Inne a Coach with some
men a Horse-back and asked for lodging; to whom the Hostesse answered, that in all
the Inne there was not a span free; the number of her Guests was already so many.
Well, although that be so, quoth one of the Horse-men that had entred, yet must there
bee a place found for Master Justice who comes in this Coach. At this name the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesse
was afraid, and said, Sir, the misfortune, is, that I have no beds: but if Master
Justice brings one with him, as it is probable hee doth, let him enter in boldly, and I and
my Husband will leave our own Chamber to accommodate his Worship. So bee it,
quoth the Squire; and by this time alighted out of the Coach a man whose attire did
presently denote his Dignity and Office; for his long Gown and his great and large
Sleeves did shew that hee was a Judge, as the Servingmen affirmed. Hee led a young
Mayden by the hand of about some sixteen yeers old, apparelled in riding attire; but
shee was therewithall of so disposed, beautifull, and cheerfull a countenance, as her
presence did strike them all into admiration; so as if they had not seen <hi>Dorotea, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>da</hi>
and <hi>Zoraida</hi> which were then in the Inne, they would hardly have believed that
this Damzels beauty might any where have been matched.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was present at the Judges and the Gentlewomans entry: and so,
as soon as hee had seen him, hee said, Sir, you may boldly enter and take your ease in
this Castle, which although it bee but little and ill accommodated, yet there is no nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rownesse
nor discommodity in the world but makes place for Armes and Learning,
and specially if the Armes and Letters bring Beauty for their guide and leader as your
Learning doth, conducted by this lovely Damzell, to whom ought not only Castles to
open and manifest themselves, but also Rocks to part and divide their Cliffs and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to bow their ambitious crests to give and make her a lodging: Enter therefore,
I say, Worshipfull Sir, into this Paradise, wherein you shall finde Starrs and Sunns
to accompanie this Skie which you bring along with you: Here shall you finde
Armes in their height, and beauty in her prime. The Judge marvailed greatly at
<hi>Don Quixotes</hi> speech, whom hee began to behold very earnestly, and wondred no lesse
at his shape then at his words, and knowing not what answer hee might return him,
hee was diverted on the other side, by the suddain approach of the three Ladies <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda,
Dorotea</hi> and <hi>Zoraida</hi> which stood before him: for having heard of the arrivall
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54746:123"/>
of new Ghests, and also being informed, by the Oastesse, of the young Ladies
beautie, they were come forth to see and entertaine her. But <hi>Don Fernando, Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>
and the Curate, did give him more compleate and courtly Entertainement then
the rustie Knight. In effect, the Judge was marveilously amazed at that which hee
saw and heard in that Inne: And the fayre Guests thereof bade the beautifull May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
welcome. The Judge perceived very well, that the Guests of the Inne were all
men of account: but <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> feature, visage and behaviour, did set him out of
all byas, being not able to conjecture what hee might bee; and after some courtlike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourses
pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, and the commodities of the Inne examined, they all agreed againe,
as they had done before, that all the women should enter into <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Roome,
and the men remaine without in their Guard. And so the Judge was content that the
Damzell, who was his Daughter, should also goe with those Ladies, which shee did
with a very good will: and with a part of the In-keepers narrow bed, and halfe of that
which the Judge had brought with him, they made shift to passe over that night the best
they could.</p>
                     <p>The Captive, who from the instant that hee had first seene the Judge, did greatly
suspect that hee was his Brother, and demanded of one of his servants how hee was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and where hee was borne? The other answered how hee was called the <hi>Licentia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
Iohn Perez of Viedma,</hi> and as hee had heard, hee was borne in a Village of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of <hi>Leon.</hi> With this relation and the rest that hee had noted, hee finally confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his opinion that it was the brother, who following his Father advice, had dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe to his Studies; and full of joy and contentment, calling aside <hi>Don Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
Cardenio</hi> and the Curate, hee certified them of all that passed, and that the Judge
was his Brother. The Servingman told him likewise how hee went towards the Indies,
where hee had his place and office in the Courts of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and also that the young
Gentlewoman was his Daughter, of whose byrth her Mother had died, and hee ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
remained a widower, and very rich, by her Dowrie and Portion that shee had left
to her Daughter: Hee demanded of them advice how hee might discover himselfe to
his Brother, or first know, whether after hee had detected himselfe, hee would receive
him with a good countenance and affection, and not bee ashamed to acknowledge him
for his Brother, seeing him in so poore an estate. Leave the tryall of that experience to
mee, quoth the Curate, and the rather, because there is no occasion why you, Sir Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
should not bee kindly entertained by him: for the Prudence, Worths and
good countenance of your Brother, give manifest tokens that hee is nothing arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.
For all that, said the Captaine, I would not make my selfe knowne on the
suddaine, but would use some pretty ambages to bring him acquainted with mee. I say
unto you, quoth the Curate, that I will trace the matter in such sort, as wee all will
rest satisfied.</p>
                     <p>Supper was by this made ready, and all of them sate downe to the table, the captive
excepted and Ladies, which supped together within the roome; and about the midst
of supper the Curate said, Master Justice, I have had in times past a comrade of your
very surname in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where I was sometime captive, who was one of the most
valiant Souldiers and Captaines that might bee found among all the Spanish foote; but
hee was as unfortunate as hee was valorous and resolute. And how was that Captaine
called, good Sir quoth the Judge? His name was replyed Master Curate, <hi>Ruy Perez
Viedma,</hi> and hee was borne in a Village of the Mountaines of Leon; and hee recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto mee an occurrence hapned betweene his Father, him, and his other Brethren;
which if I had not beene told by a man of such credit and reputation as hee was, I would
have esteemed for one of these fables which old Wives are wont to rehearse by the fire
side in Winter; for hee said to mee, that his Father had divided his goods among his
three sonnes, and gave them withall certaine Precepts, better then those of <hi>Cato;</hi> and I
know well, that the choice which hee made to follow the Warre had such happy success,
as within a few yeeres, through his forwardnesse and valour, without the helpe of any
other arme, hee was advanced to a company of Foote, and made a Captaine, and was
in the way and course of becomming one day a Colonell; but Fortune was contrary to
<pb facs="tcp:54746:124"/>
him, for even there where he was most to expect her favour, hee lost it, with the losse
of his Liberty in that most happy journey wherein so many recovered it, to wit, in the
Battell of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> I lost mine in <hi>Goleta,</hi> and after by different successe wee became
companions in <hi>Constantinople;</hi> from whence wee went to <hi>Argiers,</hi> where did befall
him one of the most notable Adventures that ever hapned in the World; and there
the Curate with succinct brevitie recounted all that had hapned between the Captain
and <hi>Zoraida:</hi> to all which the Judge was so attentive, as in all his life hee never listened
to any cause so attentively as then: And the Curate only arived to the point wherein
the French-men spoyled the Christians that came in the Barke, and the necessitie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Companion and the beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> remained; of whom hee had not learned
any thing after, nor knew not what became of them, or whether they came into <hi>Spain,</hi>
or were carried away by the French-men into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Captain stood listening somewhat aloof off to all the Curates words, and noted
the while the motions and gestures of his brother; who seeing that the Curate had
now made an end of his Speech, breathing forth a great sigh, and his eyes being filled
with teares, hee said, O Sir, if you had known the news which you have told me, and
how neerly they touch me in some points, whereby I am constrained to manifest these
teares, which violently break forth in despight of my discretion and calling, you would
hold me excused for this excesse. That Captaine of whom you spoke is my eldest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who, as one stronger and of more noble thoughts then I or my younger Brother,
made election of the honourable military calling, one of the three estates which our
Father proposed to us, even as your <hi>Comrade</hi> informed, when as you thought hee
related a Fable: I followed my Book, by which God and my dilligence raised
me to the State you see: My younger Brother is in <hi>Peru,</hi> and with that which hee hath
sent to my Father and my self, hath bountifully recompenced the portion hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and given to him sufficient to satisfie his liberall disposition, and to me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
to continue my Studies with the decencie and authority needfull to advance
me to the rank which now I possesse. My Father lives yet, but dying through desire to
learne somewhat of his eldest Sonne, and doth dayly importune God with inces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ant
prayers, that death may not shut his eyes untill hee may once again see him alive. I
only marvell not a little, considering his discreetion, that among all his labours, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
or prosperous successes hee hath been so carelesse in giving his Father notice of
his Proceedings: for if either hee, or any one of us had known of his Captivity, hee
should not have needed to expect the miracle of the Cane for his Ransome. But that
which troubles me most of all, is, to think whether these French-men have restored him
again to libertie or else slain him, that they might conceale their robberie the better; all
which will bee an occasion to me to prosecute my Voyage, not with the joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
I began it, but rather with Melancholy and Sorrow. O dear Brother, I would
I might know now where thou art, that I my self might goe and search thee out, and free
thee from thy pains, although it were with the hazard of mine own. O who is hee
that could carrie news to our old Father, that thou wert but alive, although thou were
hidden in the most abstruse Dungeons of <hi>Barbarie?</hi> for his Riches, my Brothers, and
mine would fetch thee from thence. O beautifull and bountifull <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who might
bee able to recompence thee for the good thou hast done to my Brother? How happie
were hee that might bee present at thy Spirituall Birth and Baptisme, and at thy nuptials
which would bee so gratefull to us all? These and many other such words did the
Judge deliver, so full of compassion for the news that hee had received of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as all that heard him kept him companie in shewing signes of compassion for his
sorrow.</p>
                     <p>The Curate therefore perceiving the happie successe whereto his designe and the
Captains desire had sorted, would hold the company sad no longer; and therefore
arising from the Table, and entring into the Room wherein <hi>Zoraida</hi> was, hee took her
by the hand, and after her followed <hi>Luscinda, Dorotea,</hi> and the Judge his Daughter:
the Captain stood still to see what the Curate would doe, who taking him fast by the
other hand, martched over with them both towards the Judge and the other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54746:124"/>
and said, Suppresse your teares, Master Justice, and glut your desire with all
that good which it may desire, seeing you have here before you your good brother,
and your loving sister in law: this man whom you view here, is the Captaine
<hi>Viedma,</hi> and this the beautifull Moore, which hath done so much for him.</p>
                     <p>The Frenchmen which I told you of, have reduced them to the povertie you see, to
the end that you may shew the liberalitie of your noble brest. Then did the Captaine
draw neere, to embrace his brother: but hee held him off a while with his armes to
note whether it was hee or no; but when hee once knew him, hee embraced him so
lovingly, and with such abundance of teares, as did attract the like from all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
The words that the brothers spoke one to another, or the feeling affection which
they shewed, can hardly bee conceived, and therefore much lesse written by any one
whatsoever. There they did briefly recount the one to the other their successes: there
did they shew the true love and affection of brothers in his prime: there did the Judge
embrace <hi>Zoraida:</hi> there hee made her an of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er of all that was his: there did hee also
cause his Daughter to embrace her: there the beautifull Christian, and the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Moore renewed the teares of them all: There <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was attentive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking a word, pondering of these rare occurrences, and attributing them to the
<hi>Chimeraes</hi> which hee imagined to bee incident to Chivalrie: and there they agreed that
the Captaine and <hi>Zoraida</hi> should returne with their brother to Sivill, and thence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
their Father of his finding and libertie, that he, as well as hee might, should come
to Sivill to the Baptisme and Marriage of <hi>Zoraida,</hi> because the Judge could not possibly
returne, or discontinue his journey, in respect that the Indian Fleete was to depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Moneth from Sivill towards new Spaine.</p>
                     <p>Every one in conclusion was joyfull and glad at the captives good successe: and
two parts of the night being wel nigh spent, they all agreed to repose themselves
a while. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> offered himselfe to watch and gaurd the Castle whilst they
slept, lest they should bee assaulted by some Giant or other miscreant, desirous to
rob the great Treasure of beautie that was therein immured and kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Those that
knew him rendred unto him infinite thankes: and withall informed the Judge of his
extravagant humor, whereat hee was not a little recreated: onely <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
did fret, because they went so slowly to sleepe, and hee alone was best accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of them all, by lying downe on his beasts furniture which cost him deerely, as
shall bee after recounted. The Ladies being withdrawne into their Chamber, and
every one laying himselfe downe where best hee might, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sallied out
of the Inne, to bee Centinell of the Castle as hee had promised. And a little before
day it happened, that so sweet and tuneable a voyce touched the Ladies eares, as it
obliged them all to listen unto it very attentively, but chiefly <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked,
and by whose side the young Gentlewoman <hi>Donna Clara</hi> of <hi>Viedma</hi> (for
so the Judges Daughter was called) slept. None of them could imagine who it
was that sung so well without the help of any instrument: sometimes it seemed
that hee sung in the yard, others that it was in the Stable: and being thus in suspence,
<hi>Cardenio</hi> came to the Chamber-dore, and said, Whosoever is not asleepe, let them
give eare, and they shall heare the voice of a Lackey that so chants, as it likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.
Sir, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> wee heare him very well. With this <hi>Cardenio</hi> departed,
and <hi>Dorotea</hi> using all the attention possible, heard that his song was this following.</p>

                     <p>The Singer arriving to this point of his song, <hi>Dorotea</hi> imagined that it would
not bee amisse to let <hi>Donna Clara</hi> heare so excellent a voyce, and therefore shee jogged
her a little on the one and other side, untill shee had awaked her, and then said, Pardon
me, child, for thus interrupting your sweet repose, seeing I doe it to the end you may
joy, by hearing one of the best voyces that perhaps you ever heard in your life. <hi>Clara</hi>
awaked at the first drowsily, and did not well understand what <hi>Dorotea</hi> said, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
demanding of her what shee said, shee told it her again; whereupon <hi>Donna Clara</hi>
was also attentive: but scarce had shee heard two verses repeated by the early Musician
when a marvellous trembling invaded her, even as if shee had then suffered the grievous
fit of a Quartane Ague: Wherefore embracing <hi>Dorotea</hi> very straightly, shee said,
Alas, deer Lady, why did you awake me, seeing the greatest happ that Fortune
could in this instant have given me, was, to have mine eyes and eares so shut, as I might
neither see nor hear that unfortunate Musician? What is that you say childe, quoth
<hi>Dorotea?</hi> did you not heare one say that the Musician is but a Horse-Boy? Hee is no
Horse-Boy, quoth <hi>Clara,</hi> but a Lord of many Towns, and hee that hath such firm
possession of my Soul, as if hee himself will not reject it, hee shall never bee deprived
of the dominion thereof. <hi>Dorotea</hi> greatly wondred at the passionate words of
the young Gyrle, whereby it seemed to her that shee farre surpassed the discretion
which so tender yeers did promise: And therefore shee replyed to her, saying, You
speak so obscurely, Lady <hi>Clara,</hi> as I cannot understand you; expound your selfe more
cleerly, and tell me what is that you say of Souls and Towns, and of this Musician
whose voyce hath altred you so much: but doe not say any thing to me now; for I would
not lose by listening to your disgusts, the pleasure I take to hear him sing; for me thinks
hee resumes his musick with new Verses, and in another tune: In a good hour, quoth <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Clara;</hi> and then because she her self would not hear him, she stopt her eares with her
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54746:125"/>
fingers; whereat <hi>Dorotea</hi> did also marvell: but being attentive to the Musick, shee
heard the Lacquie prosecute his Song in this manner.

                           <l>Nothing is worth esteem that cost not dear.</l>
                           <l>An Amorous persistance</l>
                           <l>Obtaineth oft-times things impossible:</l>

                           <l>I hope time shall bee given,</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here the voyce ended, and <hi>Donna Clara's</hi> sighs began; all which inflamed <hi>Dorotea's</hi>
desire to know the cause of so sweet a Song and so sad a Plaint: And therefore shee
eftsoons required her to tell her now what shee was about to have said before. Then
<hi>Clara</hi> timorous lest <hi>Luscinda</hi> should over-hear her, imbracing <hi>Dorotea</hi> very neerly,
laid her mouth so closely to <hi>Dorotea's</hi> eare, as shee might speak securely without being
understood by any other, and said; Hee that sings, is, dear Ladie, a Gentlemans Sonne
of the Kingdome of <hi>Aragon</hi> whose Father is Lord of two Towns, and dwelled right
before my Fathers house at the Court, and although the Windows of our house were
in Winter covered with Sear-cloth, and in Summer with Lattice, I know not how
it happened, but this Gentleman, who went to the School, espied me; and whether it
was at the Church, or else-where, I am not certain. Finally, hee fell in Love with me,
and did acquite me with his affection from his own Windows that were opposite to
mine, with so many tokens and such abundance of teares, as I most forceably believed,
and also affected him, without knowing how much hee loved me. Among the signes
that hee would make me, one was, to joyn the one hand to the other, giving me thereby
to understand that hee would marry me: and although I would be very glad that it
might bee so; yet as one alone, and without a Mother, I knew not to whom I might
communicate the affair, and did therefore let it rest without affording him any other
favour, unlesse it were when my Father and his were gone abroad, by lifting up the
Lattice or Sear-cloth only a little and permitting him to behold me; for which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
hee would shew such signes of joy, as a man would deem him to bee reft of his
wits.</p>
                     <p>The time of my fathers departure ariving, and hee hearing of it, but not from mee
(for I could never tell it to him) hee fell sick, as far as I could understand, for griefe;
and therefore I could never see him all the day of our departure, to bid him farewell at
least with mine eyes; but after wee had travelled two dayes, just as wee entred into an
Inne in a Village, a dayes journey from hence, I saw him at the lodging dore, appare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:54746:126"/>
so properly like a Lackey, as if I had not borne about mee his Portraiture in my
Soule, it had beene impossible to know him, I knew him, and wondred, and was
glad withall; and hee beheld mee unwitting my father, from whose presence hee still
hides himselfe when hee crosses the waies before mee as I travell, or after wee arive at
any Inne. And because that I know what hee is, and doe consider the paines hee takes
by coming thus a foote for my sake, and that with so great toyle, I die for sorrow, and
where hee puts his feete, I also put mine eyes, I know not with what intention hee
comes, nor how hee could possibly thus escape from his Father, who loves him beyond
measure, both because hee hath none other Heir, and because the young Gentleman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
deserves it, as you will perceive when you see him; and I dare affirme besides, that
all that which hee saies, hee composes <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and without any study; for I have
heard that hee is a fine Student, and a great Poet; and every time that I see him, or doe
heare him sing, I start and tremble like an Aspen-leafe, for feare that my father should
know him, and thereby come to have notice of our mutuall affections. I have never
spoken one word to him in my life, and yet I doe neverthelesse love him so much, as
without him I shall not bee able to live. And this is all deer Ladie, that I am able to say
unto you of the Musician whose voice hath pleased you so well, as by it alone you might
conjecture that he is not a horse-boy as you said, but rather a Lord of Soules, and
townes as I affirmed.</p>
                     <p>Speake no more Lady <hi>Clara</hi> (quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> at that season, kissing her a thousand
times) speake no more I say? but have patience untill it bee day light; for I hope in
God so to direct your affaires, as that they shall have the fortunate successe that so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
beginning deserves. Alas Madam, quoth <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> what end may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
seeing his father is so noble and rich as hee would scarce deeme mee worthy to bee
his sonnes servant, how much lesse his spouse? and for mee to marry my selfe unknown
to my Father, I would not doe it for all the world; I desire no other thing, but that
the young Gentleman would returne home againe and leave mee alone; perhaps by not
seeing him, and the great distance of the way which wee are to travell, my paine which
now so much presseth mee, will bee somwhat allayed, although I dare say, that this
remedy which now I have imagined, would availe mee but little; for I know not
whence with the vengeance, or by what way this affection, which I beare him, got into
mee, seeing both I and hee are so young as wee bee, for I beleeve wee are much of an
age, and I am not yet full sixteene, nor shall bee, as my father sayes, untill <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
next. <hi>Dorotea</hi> could not contain her laughter, hearing how childishly <hi>Donna Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
spoke: to whom shee said, Lady let us repose againe, and sleepe that little part of
the night which remaines, and when God sends day light, wee will prosper, or my
hands shall faile mee. With this they held their peace, and all the Inn was drowned
in profound silence; only the Inne-keepers Daughter and <hi>Maritorners</hi> were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe,
but knowing very well <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> peccant humor, and that hee was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and on Horse-back without the Inne, keeping Guard, both of them consorted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and agreed to bee some way merry with him, or at least to passe over some time,
in hearing him speake ravingly.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore to bee understood, that there was not in all the Inne any window
which looked out into the field, but one hole in a Barne, out of which they were wont
to cast their straw; to this hole came the two demy-Demzells, and saw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
mounted and leaning on his Javelin, and breathing forth ever and anon, so dolefull
and deepe sighes, as it seemed his Soule was plucked away by every one of them; and
they noted besides, how hee said with a soft and amorous voice, <hi>O my Lady Dulcinea of
Toboso,</hi> the Sunne of all beauty, the end and quintessence of discretion, the treasurie of
sweete countenance and carriage, the store-house of honestie; and finally, the <hi>Idea</hi> of
all that which is profitable, modest, or delightfull in the World! and what might thy
Ladyship bee doing at this present? Hast thou perhaps thy minde now upon thy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Knight, that most wittingly exposeth himselfe to so many dangers for thy sake?
Give unto mee tidings of her, O thou Luminary of the three faces: peradventure
how dost now with envie enough behold her, eyther walking through some Gallerie of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54746:126"/>
her sumptuous Palaces, or leaning on some Bay-window and thinking how (saving her
honour and greatnesse) shee shall mittigate and asswage the torture which this mine
oppressed heart indures for her Love; what glory shee shall give for my pains; what
quiet to my cares; what life to my death; and what guerdon to my services. And
thou Sun which art, as I believe, by this time sadling of thy Horses to get away early
and goe out to see my Mistrisse, I request thee, as soon as thou shalt see her, to salute
her in my behalf; but beware that when thou lookest on her &amp; doest greet her, that thou
doe not kisse her on the face; for if thou doest, I become more jealous of thee, then ever
thou wast of the swift ingrate which made thee runn and sweat so much thorow the
Plains of <hi>Thessalia</hi> or the brinks of <hi>Peneo;</hi> for I have forgotten through which of them
thou rannest so jealous and inamoured.</p>
                     <p>To this point arrived <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> when the Inne-keepers Daughter began to
call him softly unto her and say, Sir Knight, approach a little hitherward, if you please:
At which voyce <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turned his head, and saw by the light of the Moon which
shined then very cleerly, that hee was called too from the hole, which hee accounted
to bee a fair window full of iron bars, and those costly gilded with gold, well befitting
so rich a Castle, as hee imagined that Inne to bee; and presently in a moment hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to his own fancie, that once again, as hee had done before, the beautifull Damzell,
daughter to the Ladie of that Castle, overcome by his Love, did returne to sollicite
him: and with this thought, because hee would not shew himself discourteous and
ungratefull, hee turned <hi>Rozinante</hi> about and came over to the hole; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beheld the two Wenches hee said, I take pittie on you, beautifull Ladie, that you
have placed your amorous thoughts in a place whence it is not possible to have any
correspondence answerable to the desert of your high worth and beauty, whereof you
are in no sort to condemn this miserable Knight Errant, whom Love hath wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to surrender his will to be any other then to her, whom at the first sight hee made
absolute Mistrisse of his soul: Pardon me therefore, good Ladie, and retire your self
to your Chamber, and make me not, by any further insinuation of your desires, more
unthankfull and discourteous then I would bee: and if through the love that you
bear me, you finde in me any other thing wherewithall I may serve and pleasure you,
so that it bee not love it self, demand it boldly; for I doe sweare unto you by mine
absence yet, sweetest enemie, to bestow it upon you incontinently, yea though it bee a
lock of <hi>Medusas</hi> haires, which are all of Snakes, or the very Sunne-beams inclosed in a
Viall of glasse.</p>
                     <p>My Lady needs none of those things, Sir Knight, answered <hi>Maritornes.</hi> What
doth shee then want, discreet Matron, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Only one of your faire
hands, said <hi>Maritornes,</hi> that therewithall shee may disburden her selfe of some part
of those violent desires, which compelled her to come to this window, with so great
danger of her honour: for if her Lord and Father knew of her comming, the least
slice he would take off her should bee at the least an eare. I would faine once see that,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> but I am sure he will beware how he doe it, if he have no list to
make the most disastrous end that ever father made in this world, for having laied vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands on the delicate limbs of his amorous daughter. <hi>Maritornes</hi> verily perswaded
her self, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would give up his hand as he was requested; &amp; having already
contrived in her minde what she would do, descended with all haste from the hole, and
going into the Stable, fetched out <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his Asses halter, and returned again
with very great speed, just as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (standing up on <hi>Rozinantes</hi> saddle, that
he might the better reach the barred windowes, whereat hee imagined the wounded
Damzell remained) did, stretching up his hand, say unto her, Hold, Lady, the hand,
or as I may better say, the executioner of earthly miscreants: hold, I say, that hand,
which no other woman ever touched before, not even shee her self that hath intyre
possession of my whole body, nor doe I give it to you, to the end you should kisse it;
but that you may behold the contexture of the sinnews, the knitting of the muscles,
and the spaciositie and hredth of the veins, whereby you may collect how great ought
the force of that Arme to bee whereunto such a hand is knit. Wee shall see that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:127"/>
quoth <hi>Maritornes:</hi> and then making a running knot on the halter, shee cast
it on the wrist of his hand, and then descending from the hole, shee tyed the other end of
the halter very fast to the lock of the Barn door. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> feeling the roughnesse of
the halter about his wrists, said, It rather seems that you grate my hand, then that you che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
it; but yet I pray you not to handle it so roughly, seeing it is in no fault of the
evill which my will doth unto you; nor is it comely that you should revenge or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden
the whole bulk of your indignation on so small a part: remember that those
which love well doe not take so cruell revenge. But no body gave eare to these words
of <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for as soon as <hi>Maritornes</hi> had tyed him, shee and the other, almost
burst for laughter, ran away, and left him tyed in such manner, as it was impossible for
him to loose himself.</p>
                     <p>Hee stood, as wee have recounted, on <hi>Rozinante</hi> his saddle, having all his arme thrust
in at the hole, and fastened by the wrist to the lock, and was in very great doubt and
fear, that if <hi>Rozinante</hi> budged never so little on any side hee should fall and hang by
the arme; and therefore hee durst not once use the least motion of the world, although
hee might well have expected from <hi>Rozinantes</hi> patience and milde spirit, that if hee
were suffered, hee would stand still a whole age without stirring himself. In fine <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
seeing himself tyed, and that the Ladies were departed, began straight to
imagine that all that had been done by way of inchantment, as the last time, when in
the very same Castle the inchanted Moor (the Carrier) had so fairly belaboured him:
and then to himself did he execrate his own want of discretion and discourse, seeing that
having escaped out of that Castle so evill dight the first time, he would after adventure
to enter into it the second: for it was generally observed by Knights Errant, that when
they had once tried an Adventure, and could not finish it, it was a token that it was
not reserved for them, but for some other; and therefore would never prove it again.
Yet for all this hee drew forward his Arme to see if hee might deliver himself; but hee
was so well bound, as all his indeavours proved vain: It is true that hee drew it very
warily, lest <hi>Rozinante</hi> should stir; and although hee would fain have set and setled
himself in the saddle, yet could hee doe no other but stand, or leave the Arme behinde:
There was many a wish for <hi>Amadis</hi> his Sword, against which no inchantment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
could prevail: there succeeded the malediction of his fates: there the exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
of the want that the world should have of his presence, all the while hee
abode inchanted (as hee infallibly believed hee was) in that place: There hee anew
remembred his beloved Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso:</hi> There did hee call oft enough on his
good Squire <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who intombed in the bowels of sleep and stretched along
on the Pannell of his Asse, did dream at that instant, but little of the mother that bore
him: There hee invoked the Wise men <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> and <hi>Aquife</hi> to help him: And
finally, the morning did also there overtake him so full of despair and confusion, as
hee roared like a Bull; for hee had no hope that by day-light any cure could bee found
for his care, which hee deemed would bee everlasting, because hee fully accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
inchanted; and was the more induced to think so, because hee saw that <hi>Rozinante</hi>
did not move little nor much; and therefore hee supposed that both hee and his horse
should abide in that state without eating, drinking, or sleeping, untill that either the
malignant influence of the Stars were passed, or some greater Inchanter had dis-inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
                     <p>But hee deceived himselfe much in his beleefe, for scarce did the day begin to peepe,
when there arived foure Horsemen to the Inn doore, very well appointed, and having
snap-hances hanging at the pommell of their saddles, they called at the Inn door (which
yet stood shut) and knocked very hard which being perceived by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> from
the place where hee stood Centinell, hee said with a very loud and arrogant voice,
Knights, or Squires, or whatsoever else ye bee, you are not to knock any more at the
gates of that Castle, seeing it is evident, that at such houres as this, eyther they which
are within doe repose them, or else are not wont to open Fortresses, untill <hi>Phoebus</hi>
hath spread his Beames over the Earth: therefore stand back, and expect till it be cleere
day, and then wee will see whether it bee just or no, that they open their gates unto
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54746:127"/>
you. What a Divell, what Castle or Fortresse is this, quoth one of them, that it should
binde us to use all those circumstances? If thou beest the In-keeper, command that the
doore bee opened, for wee are travellers, that will tarry no longer then to baite our
Horses and away, for wee ride in poste haste. Doth it seeme to you Gentlemen, quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I looke like an In-keeper? I know not what thou lookest like, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the other, but well I know that thou speakest madly, in calling this Inne a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
It is a Castle, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> yea, vnd that one of the best in this Province
and it hath People within it which have had a Scepter in hand, and a crowne on their
head. It were better said quite contrary, replyed the Traveller, the Scepter on the
head, and the Crowne in the hand, But perhaps (and so it may well bee) there is some
company of Players within, who doe very usually hold the Scepters, and weare those
crownes whereof thou talkest; for in such a paultry Inne as this is, and where I heare so
little<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>noyse, I cannot beleeve any one to bee lodged, worthy to weare a crowne, or
beare a Stepter. Thou knowest but little of the World, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> seeing
thou dost so much ignore the chances that are wont to befall in Chivalry. The fellowes
of him that entertained this prolixe Dialogue with <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> waxed weary to heare
them speake idlely so long together, and therefore turned againe to knock with great
fury at the dore, and that in such sort, as they not only waked the Inne-keeper, but also
all the Guests, and so he arose to demand their pleasure.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while it hapned, that one of the Horses whereon they rode, drew neere
to smell <hi>Rozinante,</hi> that Melancholy, and sadly, with his eares cast downe, did sustain
without moving his out-stretched Lord; and hee beeing indeede of flesh and blood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee resembled a block of wood, could not choose but feele it, and turne to smel
him againe, who had thus come to cherish and entertaine him; and scarce had hee stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
but a thought from thence, when <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> feete, that were joyned, slipt asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and tumbling from the Saddle, had doubtlesly faln to the ground, had hee not
remained hanging by the Arme; a thing that caused him to indure so much pain, as hee
verily believed that either his wrist was a cutting, or his Arme a tearing off from his
body; and hee hung so neer to the ground as hee touched it with the tops of his toes,
all which turned to his prejudice; for having felt the little which hee wanted to the
setting of his feet wholly on the earth, hee laboured and drew all that he might to
reach it; much like unto those that get the Strappado, with the condition to touch or
not to touch, who are themselves a cause to increase their own tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

opened the door very hastily and affrighted, to see who it
was that so roared; and those that stood without did also the
same: <hi>Maritornes</hi> whom the cries had also awaked, imagining
straight what it might bee, went into the Barne, and unperceived
of any, loosed the halter that susteined <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hee fell to the ground in the presence of the Inn-keeper
and the Travellers, who comming towards him, demanded the
occassion why hee did so unmeasurably roar? Hee, without making any answer, took
off the halter from his wrist, and getting up, hee leaped upon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> imbraced his
Target, set his Launce into the Rest, and wheeling about a good part of the Field, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb facs="tcp:54746:128"/>
with a half gallop, saying, Whosoever shall dare to affirm that I have not been
with just title inchanted, if my Lady the Princesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> will give mee leave to
doe it, I say that hee lies, and I doe presently challenge him to Combat. The new
Travellers were amazed at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> words; but the Host removed that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by informing them what hee was, and that they should make no account of his
words, for the man was bereft of his wits. Then they demanded of the Inn-keeper,
if there had arived to his Inne a young Stripling of some fifteen yeers old or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
apparelled like a Horse-Boy, and having such and such marks and tokens; and
then gave the very signes of <hi>Donna Clara's</hi> Lover. The Host made answer, That there
were so many People in his Inn, as hee had taken no notice of him for whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
But one of them having seen the Coach wherein the Judge came, said,
Questionlesly hee must bee here; for this is the Coach that they say he hath followed:
let therefore one of us remain at the door, and the rest enter to seek him out: Yea, and it
will not bee from the purpose, if one of us ride about without the Inn, lest hee should
make an escape from us by the walls of the ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And thus two of them entred into the house, one staid at the door, and the other did
compasse the Inne about. The Inn-keeper beheld all, but could never judge a right the
reason why they used all this diligence, although hee easily believed that they sought
for the Youth whose markes they had told unto him.</p>
                     <p>By this the day was grown clear, and as well by reason thereof, as through the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> all the Strangers were awake and did get up, especially both
the Ladies, <hi>Clara</hi> and <hi>Dorotea:</hi> for the one through fear to have her Lover so neer,
&amp; the other with desire to see him, could sleep but very little all that night. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
perceiving that none of the four Travellers made any account of him, or answered his
challenge, was ready to burst with wrath and despight: and if hee could any wise have
found that it was tollerated by the Statutes of Chiva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gre their teeth to have answered him: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it seemed to him not so expedient nor honourable, to began any new Adventure
untill hee had installed <hi>Micomicona</hi> in her Kingdome, hee was forced to bee quiet,
expecting to see whereunto the indeavours and diligence of those four Travellers
tended: the one whereof found out the Youth, that hee searched, asleep by another
Lacquie, little dreaming that any body did look for him; and much lesse, would finde
him out thus. The man drew him by the arme, and said, Truely <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> the habit
that you weare, answers very well your calling; and the Bed whereon you lie, the
care and tendernesse wherewith your Mother did nurse you. The Youth hereat rub'd
his drowsie eyes, and beheld very leisurely him that did hold him fast, and knew him
forthwith to bee one of his Fathers Servants, whereat hee was so amazed as hee could
not speake a word for a great while: And the Serving-man continuing his speech,
said, Here is nothing else to bee done, Lord <hi>Lewis,</hi> but that you bee patient and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
again with us towards home, if you be not pleased to have your Father &amp; my Lord
depart out of this World to the other; for no lesse may bee expected from the Woe
wherein hee rests for your absence. Why, how did my Father know, said <hi>Don Lewis,</hi>
that I came this way, and in this habit? A Student answered, The other to whom you
bewrayed your intention did discover it, moved through the compassion hee took to
heare your Fathers lamentations when he found you missing: and so hee dispatcht
four of his men in your search; and wee are all at your service more joyfull then may
bee imagined, for the good dispatch wherewithall wee shall return, and carrie you to
his sight which doth love you so much. That shall bee as I please or Heaven will
dispose, said <hi>Don Lewis.</hi> What would you please, or what should Heaven dispose of,
other then that you agree to return? For certainly you shall not doe the contrarie,
nor is it possible you should. All these reasons that passed between them both, did the
Lackey that lay by <hi>Don Lewis</hi> heare; and arising from thence, hee went and told all
that passed to <hi>Don Fernando, Cardenio,</hi> and all the rest that were gotten up: To whom
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54746:128"/>
hee told how the man gave the title of <hi>Don</hi> to the boy, and recounted the speech he used,
and how he would have him return to his fathers house, which the youth refused to doe.
Whereupon, aud knowing already what a good voice the heavens had given him, they
greatly desired to be more particularly informed what he was, and intended also to help
him, if any violence were offered unto him, and therefore went unto the place where he
was, and stood contending with his servant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorotea</hi> issued by this out of her chamber, and in her companie <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> all

                        </gap>xed; <hi>Dorotea</hi> calling <hi>Cardenio</hi> aside, told unto him succinctly all the History of
the Musician, and <hi>Donna Clara:</hi> and he rehearsed to her againe all that passed of the
Serving-mens arrivall that came in his pursuit, which he did not speak so low, but that
<hi>Donna Clara</hi> over-heard him, whereat she indured such alteration, as she had faln to the
ground, if <hi>Dorotea</hi> running towards her, had not held her up. <hi>Cardenio</hi> intreated <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotea</hi>
to returne with the other to her chamber, and he would endevour to bring the
matter to some good passe, which they presently performed. The four that were come
in <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his search, were by this all of them entred into the Inn, and had compassed
him about, perswading him that he would, cutting off all delayes, returne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
his father. He answered that he could not doe it in any sort, untill he had finished
an adventure, which imported him no lesse then his life, his honour, and his soule. The
servants urged him then, saying, that they would in no sort goe backe without him, and
therefore would carry him home, whether he would or no. That shall not you doe,
quoth <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> if it be not that you carry me home dead. And in this season all the
other Gentlemen were come into the contention, but chiefly <hi>Cardenio, Don Fernando</hi>
and his <hi>Comarada's,</hi> the Judge the Curate, and the Barber, and <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for
now it seemed to him needlesse to guard the Castle any more. <hi>Cardenio,</hi> who
knew already the History of the Youth, demanded of those that would carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
what reason did move them to seeke to take that Lad away against his will? Wee
are moved unto it, answered one of them, by this reason, that wee shall thereby save his
fathers life, who for his absence is like to lose it. To this said <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> it is to no end
to make relation of mine affaires here. I am free, and will returne if I please, and if not
no one shall constrain mee to doe it perforce. Reason shall constrain you, good Sir,
to doe it, quoth the man, and when that cannot prevaile with you, it shall with us, to
put that in execution for which we be come and are bound to doe. Let us know this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire
from the begining, said the Judge to those men. Sir, quoth one of them, who
knew him very well, as his Masters next neighbour: Master Justice, doth not your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
know this Gentleman who is your Neighbours sonne, and hath absented himselfe
from his fathers house, in an habit so undecent and discrepant from his calling, as you
may perceive? The Judge beheld him then somewhat more attentively, knew him,
and imbracing of him said. What toyes are these <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> or what cause hath beene
of efficacie sufficient to move you to come away in this manner and attyre, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
your calling so ill? The teares stuck then in the young Gentlemans eyes,
and hee could not answere a word to the Judge, who bad the foure servingmen

takeing <hi>Don Lewis</hi> apart, hee intreated him to tell him the occasion of that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
                     <p>And whilest hee made this and other demands to the Gentleman, they heard a great
noyse at the In doore; the cause whereof was, that two Guests which had lien there that
night, seeing all the People busied to learne the cause of the foure Horse-mens coming,
had thought to have made an escape scot-free, without defraying their expences; but
the In-keeper who attended his owne affaires with more diligence then other mens, did
stay them at their going forth, and demanded his money, upbrayding their dishonest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
with such words as moved them to returne him an answere with their fists,
which they did so roundly, as the poore Oast was compelled to raise the crie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
succour. The Oastesse and her daughter could see no man so free from occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> to whom the daughter said, I request you Sir Knight, by the virtue
that God hath given you, to succour my poore Father, whom two bad men are grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:54746:129"/>
like corne. To this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered very leisurely, and with great gravity;
Beautifull Damzell, your Petition cannot prevaile at this time, for as much as I am hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from undertaking any other Adventure, untill I have finished one wherein my
promise hath ingaged mee, and all that I can now doe in your service is, that which I
shall say now unto you; Run unto your Father, and bid him continue and maintaine
his conflict manfully, the best that hee may, untill I demand license of the Princesse <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comicona,</hi>
to help him out of his distresse; for if shee will give it unto mee, you may
make full account that hee is delivered. Sinner that I am (quoth <hi>Maritornes,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by and heard what hee said) before you shall bee able to obteyne that License, of which
you speake, my Master will bee departed to the other World. Worke you so Lady,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I may have the License; for so that I may have it, it will make
no great matter, whether hee bee in the other world or no, for even from thence would
I bring him back againe, in despight of the other World it selfe, if it durst contradict
mee, or at least wise I will take such a revenge of those that doe send him to the other
World, as you shall remaine more then meanely contented; and so without replying
any more, hee went and fell on his knees before <hi>Dorotea,</hi> demanding of her in Knightly
and Errant phrases, that shee would daigne to license him to goe and succour the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
of that Castle, who was then plunged in a deepe distresse. The Princesse did
grant him leave very willingly, and hee presently, buckling on his Target, and laying
hold on his Sword, ranne to the Inne doore, where yet the two Guests stood hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
tuging the Innkeeper: But as soone as hee arived, hee stopt and stood still, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Maritornes</hi> and the Oastesse demanded of him twice or thrice the cause of his
restiffenesse: in not assisting her Lord and Husband. I stay quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
according to the Lawes of Armes, it is not permitted to mee to lay hand to my
Sword against Squire-like men that are not dubbed Knights: But call to mee here my
Squire <hi>Sancho,</hi> for this defence and revenge concernes him as his duty. This passed at
the Inne doore, where fists und blowes were interchangeably given, and taken in the best
sort, although to the Innkeepers cost, and to the rage and griefe of <hi>Maritornes,</hi> the
Oastesse, and her daughter, who were like to runne wood, beholding <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
cowardise, and the mischiefe their Master, Husband and Father endured, But here let
us leave them; for there shall not want one to succour him, or if not, let him suffer,
and all those that wittingly undertake things beyond their power and force; and let us
turne backward to heare that which <hi>Don Lewis</hi> answered the Judge, whom wee left
somewhat apart with him, demanding the cause of his comming a foote, and in so base

some extraordinary griefe pinched his heart, and sheding many teares, answered in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>I know not what else I may tell you, deere Sir, but that from the instant that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
made us Neighbours, and that I saw <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> your Daughter and my Lady, I
made her Commandresse of my Will; and if yours, my true Lord and Father, doe not
hinder it, shee shall bee my Spouse this very day. For her sake have I abandoned my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, and for her I did on this attyre, to follow her wheresoever shee went<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> as
the Arrow doth the Marke, or the Mariner the North-starre: Shee is as yet, no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acquainted with my desires, then as much as shee might understand somtimes, by
the teares which shee saw mine eyes distill a farre off: Now Sir, you know the Riches
and Nobility of my discent, and how I am my Fathers sole Heire, and if it seeme unto
you that these bee conditions whereupon you may venter to make mee throughly happy,
accept of mee presently for your sonne in Law; for if my Father, borne away by other
his Designes, shall not like so well of this good which I have sought out for my selfe,
yet time hath more force to undoe and change the affaires, then mens Will. Here the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Gentleman held his peace, and the Judge remayned astonied as well at the
grace and discretion wherewith <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had discovered his affections unto him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to see himselfe in such a passe, that as hee knew not what course hee might best take
in so suddaine and unexpected a matter; and therefore hee answered no other thing at
that time, but only bad him to settle his minde, and entertayne the time with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54746:129"/>
and deale with them to expect that day, because hee might have leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what might bee most convenient for all. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> did kisse his hands perforce,
and did bathe them with tears, a thing able to move a heart of Marble, and much more
the Judges, who (as a wise man) did presently perceive how beneficiall and honourable
was that preferment for his Daughter; although hee could have wished, if it had been
possible, to effect it with the consent of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his Father, who hee knew did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to have his Sonne made a Noble man of Title.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Inn-keeper and his Ghests had agreed, having paid him all that
they ought, more by <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> perswasion and good reasons, then by any mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his Servants expected the end of the Judge his discourse and his
resolution: When the Devill (who never sleeps) would have it, at that very time
entred into the Inne the Barber from whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took away the Helmet of
<hi>Mambrino,</hi> and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> the furniture of the Asse, whereof hee made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for his own: which Barber, leading his Beast to the Stable, saw <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi>
who was mending some part of the Pannell; and as soon as hee had eyed him, he knew
him, and presently set upon <hi>Sancho,</hi> saying. A Sir Thief, have I found you here with all
the Furniture whereof you rob'd me? <hi>Sancho</hi> that saw himself thus assaulted unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly,
and had heard the disgracefull termes which the other used, laying fast hold
on the Pannell with the one hand, gave the Barber such a buffet with the other, as hee
bathed all his teeth in blood: but yet for all that the Barber held fast his gripe of the
Pannell, and therewithall cryed out so loud, as all those that were in the house came
to the noyse and conflict: and hee said, I call for the King and Justice; for this Thief
and Robber by the High-wayes goeth about to kill me, because I seek to recover mine
own goods. Thou lyest, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I am not a Robber by the High waies; for
my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> wonne those spoyles in a good Warre. By this time <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
himsel was come thither, not a little proud to see how well his Squire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himself, and offended his Adversarie; and therefore hee accounted him from
thenceforth to bee a man of valour, and purposed in his minde to dub him Knight on
the first occasion that should bee offered, because he thought that the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
would bee well imployed by him.</p>
                     <p>Among oeher things that the Barber said in the discourse of his contention, this was
one: Sirs, this Pannell is as certainly mine, as the death which I owe unto God, and
I know it as well as if I had bred it, and there is my Asse in the Stable who will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to tell a lye; or otherwise doe but trye the Pannell on him, and if it fit him
not justly I am content to remain infamous: And I can say more, that the very day
wherein they took my Pannell from me, they robbed me likewise of a new brazen
Bason which was never used, and cost me a crown. Here <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
contain himself from speaking; and so thrusting himself between them two, and
putting them asunder, and causing the Pannell to bee laid publiquely on the ground
until the truth were decided, he said; To the end that you may perceive the cleer and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
error wherein this good Squire lives; see how hee calls that a Bason which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
was, and shall bee the Helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> which I took away perfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e from him
in fair War, and made my self Lord thereof in a Lawfull and Warlike manner: About
the Pannell I will not contend; for that which I can say therein is, that my Squire
<hi>Sancho</hi> demanded leave of me to take away the Furniture of this vanquished Cowards
Horse that hee might adorn his own withall: I gave him author tie to doe it,
and hee took them: And for his converting thereof from a Horses Furniture into a
Pannell, I can give none other reason then the ordinarie one, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
are usually seen in the successes of Chivalrie; for confirmation whereof
friend <hi>Sancho</hi> runne speedily and bring me out the Helmet which this good man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth
to bee a Bason. By my faith Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if wee have no better proof
of our intention then that which you say, I say that the Helmet of <hi>Mambrino</hi> is as
arrant a Bason, as this good mans Furniture is a Pannell. Doe what I command, said
<hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> I cannot believe that all the things in this Castle will bee guided by
inchantment. <hi>Sancho</hi> went for the Bason, and brought it: and as soon as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:130"/>
saw it, hee took it in his hands and said, See Sirs, with what face can this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Squire affirm that this is a Bason, and not the Helmet that I have mentioned?
and I swear to you all by the Order of Knight-hood which I professe, that this is the
very same Helmet which I wonne from him, without having added or taken any thing
from it. That it is questionlesse, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for since the time that my Lord wonne
it untill now, hee never fought but one Battell with it, when hee delivered the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie
chained men; and, but for this Bason-Helmet, hee had not escaped so free as
hee did, so thick a showre of stones rained all the time of that conflict.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Sirs, quoth the Barber, what do you think of that which is affirmed
by these Gentlemen who yet contend that this is not a Bason, but a
Helmet? He that denies it, quoth <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I will make him know
that hee lyes, if he be a Knight; and if hee bee but a Squire, that
hee lyes and lyes again a thousand times. Our Barber who was also
present, as one that knew <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> humour very well, would
fortifie his folly and make the Jest passe yet a little farther, to the
end that they all might laugh: and therefore speaking to the other Barber, hee said
Sir Barber, or what else you please, know that I am also of your occupation, and have
had my writ of examination and approbation in that Trade more then these thirtie
yeers, and am one that knows very well all the instruments of Barberie whatsoever;
and have been besides in my youthfull dayes a Souldier; and doe therefore likewise
know what is a Helmet, and what a Morrion, and what a close Castle, and other things
touching Warfare; I mean all the kinde of Armes that a Souldier ought to have: and
therefore I say (still submitting my self to the better opinion) that this peece which is
laid here before us, and which this good Knight holds in his hand, not only is not a
Barbers Bason, but also is so farre from being one as is white from black, or veritie
from untruth; yet doe I withall affirm, that although it is an Helmet, yet it is not a
compleat Helmet. No truely, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for it wants the half, to wit, the
nether part and the Bever. It is very true, quoth the Curate, who very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
his friend the Barber his intention; and the same did <hi>Cardenio, Don Fernando,</hi>
and the rest of his fellows confirm; yea, and even the Judge himself, had not <hi>Don Lewis</hi>
his affair perplexed his thoughts, would for his part have holpen the Jest well forward:
But the earnestnesse of that affair held his minde so busied, as hee little or nothing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the pastime. Lord have mercy upon me, quoth the other Barber, then half
beside himself, and is it possible that so many honourable men should say that this is
no Bason, but a Helmet? This is a thing able to strike admiration into a whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie,
how discreet soever it were: it is enough if this Bason must needs bee a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
the Pannell must also bee a Horses Furniture, as this Gentleman sayes. To mee it
seems a Pannell, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but as I have said, I will not meddle with it,
nor determine whether it bee a Pannell or the Capparison of a Horse.</p>
                     <p>Therein is nothing else to bee done said the Curate, but that Sir <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> say it
once; for in these matters of Chivalrie, all these Noblemen, and my selfe, doe give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him the prick and the prize; I sweate unto you by my <hi>Iove</hi> good Sirs, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
that so many and so strange are the things which have befaln mee in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54746:130"/>
these two times that I have lodged therein, as I dare avouch nothing affirmatively
of any thing that shall bee demanded of mee concerning the things contained in it; for
I doe infallibly imagine, that all the Adventures which passe in it, are guided by inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the first time, I was very much vexed by an inchanted Moore that was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
and <hi>Sancho</hi> himselfe sped not very well with the Moores followers; and yesternight I
stood hanging almost two houres space by this arme, without knowing how, or how
that disgrace befell mee; so that for me to meddle now in so confused and difficult a
matter, as to deliver mine opinion, were to passe a rash judgement: So that they which
say that this is a Bason and no Helmet, I have already made answere; but whether this
bee a Pannell or furniture, I dare pronounce no difinitive Sentence, but only remit it
to your discreet opinions: perhaps because you are not dubbed Knights as I am, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of this place will have no power over you, and your understandings shall
be free and able to judge of the things in this Castle really and truly, and not as they
seeme unto me. Doubtlesse quoth <hi>Don Fernando, Don-Quixote</hi> sayes very well, that
the definition of this case belongs unto us; and therefore, and because wee may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in it upon the the better and more solid grounds, I will secretly take the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of all those Gentlemen, and afterwards make a cleere and full Relation of what
shall come of them.</p>
                     <p>To those that knew <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his humour, this was a matter of marvailous
laughter, &amp; sport; but to such as were not acquainted therewithall, it seemed the greatest
folly of the world, especially to <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and his four servants, and with other three
Passengers that had arrived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y chance to the Inne, and seemed to bee Troupers of the
holy Brother-hood, as indeed they were: but hee that was most of all beside himself for
wrath, was the Barber, whose Bason they had transformed before his owne, face
into the Helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> and whose Pannell hee made full account should
likewise be turned into the rich Furniture, and Equipage of a great, Horse. All of them
laughed heartily, to see <hi>Don Fernando</hi> goe up and downe, taking the Suffrages of this
man and that, and rounding every one of them in the eare that they might declare in
secret whether that was a pannell or a furniture, for which such deadly contention had
passed. After that he had taken the suffrages of so many as knew <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he said
very lowdly, The truth is, good fellow, that I grow weary of demanding so many opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
for I can no sooner demand of any man what I desire to know, but they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
answer mee, how it is meere madnesse to affirme, that this is the pannell of an
Asse, but rather the furniture of a Horse, yea and of a chiefe Horse of service; and
therefore you must have patience for in despite both of you and of your Asse, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
your weak allegations and worse prooves it is, and will continue the
furniture of a great Horse, Let me never injoy a place in Heaven (quoth the Barber) if
you all be not deceived; and so may my soul appear before God, as it appears to me,
to be a pannell, and no horse furniture: but the law carries it away, and so farewell
it: and yet surely I am not drunk; for unlesse it be by sinning, my fast hath not been
broken this day.</p>
                     <p>The follies which the Barber uttered, stirred no lesse laughter among them, then did
the rorings of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who then spoke in this manner: Here is now no more
to be done, but that every man take up his owne goods, and to whom God hath given
them, let <hi>S. Peter</hi> give his blessing. Then said one of the four Servingmen, If this were
not a jest premeditated, and made of purpose, I could not perswade my self, that men
of so good understanding as all these are, or seem to be, should dare to say, and affirm,
that this is not a Bason, nor that a Pannell: but seeing that they averr it so constantly, I
have cause to suspect that it cannot bee without a great deale of Mysterie, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
a thing so contrary to that which very truth it selfe, and experience demonstrates
unto us: for I doe vow (and saying so he rapt out a round oath or two) that as many
as are in the world, should never make me beleeve that this is no bason, nor that no pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
of a he-Asse. It might as well be of a she-Asse, quoth the Curate. That comes all
but to one, replied the other; for the question consists not therein, but whether it be a
pannell or not, as you doe avouch? Then one of the Troupers of the holy Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb facs="tcp:54746:131"/>
(who had listned to their disputation, and was grown full of choler to hear such
an errour maintained, said, It is as very a pannell, as my father is my father; and hee
that hath said, or shall say the contrary, is, I beleeve, turned into a grape. Thou lyest
like a clownish knave (qd. <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) and lifting up his Javelin, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
held in his hand, hee discharged such a blow at the Troupers pate, as if he had
not avoyded, it would have thrown him to the ground. The Javelin was broken by
the force of the fall into splinters; and the other Troupers, seeing their fellow misused,
cried out for help, and assistance for that holy Brotherhood. The Inkeeper, who also
was one of the same Fraternitie, ranne in for his rod of Justice, and his sword, and
then stood by his fellowes. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his foure Servants compassed him about
lest hee should attempt to escape whilest the tumult indured. The Barbar seeing
all the house turned upside downe, laid hand againe upon his Pannell, and the same did
<hi>Sancho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> set hand to his Sword and assaulted the Troopers. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> cryed to
his serving men that they should leave him, and goe to helpe <hi>Don-Quixote, Cardenio</hi>
and <hi>Don Fernando;</hi> for all of them tooke <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> part. The Curate cried out,
the Oastesse shrieked, her Daughter squeaked, <hi>Maritornos</hi> houled, <hi>Dorotea</hi> stood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
<hi>Luscinda</hi> amazed, and <hi>Donna Clara</hi> dismayed; the Barbar battered <hi>Sancho,</hi> and
<hi>Sancho</hi> pounded him againe. <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> on whom one of his Serving men had presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to lay hands, and hold him by the arme, gave him such a pash on the mouth, as hee
broke his Teeth, and then the Judge tooke him into his owne protection. <hi>Don Fernando</hi>
had gotten one of the Troopers under his feet, where he stood belabouring him at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
The Innekeeper renewed his out-cry, and reinforced his voyce, demanding ayde
for the holy. Brotherhood: So that all the Inn seemed nothing else but Plaints, Cryes,
Screetches, Confusions, Feares, Dreads, Disgraces, Slashes, Buffets, Blows, Spurnings,
and effusion of Blood.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of this Chaos and Labyrinth of things, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> began to imagine
and fancie to himselfe, that hee was at that very time plunged up to the eares in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and conflict of King <hi>Agramante</hi> his Campe; and therefore hee said with a voice
that made all the Inne to tremble: All of you, hold your hands all of you, put up your
Swords, all of you bee quiet and listen to mee, if any of you desire to continue alive.
That great and monstrous voice made them all stand still; thereupon hee thus procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Did not I tell you Sirs, that this Castle was inchanted, and that some Legion of
Devills did inhabit it? In confirmation whereof, I would have you but to note with
your owne eyes, how the very discord of King <hi>Agramants</hi> Campe is transferred
hither, and passed ever among us. Looke how there they fight for the Sword, here
for the Horse, yonder for the Eagle, beyond for the Helmet; and all of us fight, and
none of us know for what. Come therefore, you Master Justice, and you Master Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and let the one represent King <hi>Agramant,</hi> and the other King <hi>Sobrino,</hi>
and make Peace and Atonement among us: for I sweare by Almighty <hi>Iove,</hi> that it is
great wrong and pittie, that so many Noblemen, as wee are here, should be slaine for so
sleight causes.</p>
                     <p>The Troopers, which did not understand <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> manner of speech, and saw
themselves very ill handled by <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and <hi>Cardenio,</hi> would in no wise bee pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
But the Barber was content, by reason that in the conflict both his beard and his
Pannell had beene torne in peeces. <hi>Sancho</hi> to his Masters voice was quickly obedient, as
became a dutifull Servant. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his foure serving men stood also quiet, seeing how
little was gained in being other; only the Innekeeper persisted as before, affirming that
punishment was due unto the insolencies of that mad man, who every foote confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and disquieted his Inne. Finally, the rumor was pacified for that time; the Pannell
remained for a Horse furniture untill the day of judgement; the Bason for a Helmet,
and the Inn for a Castle in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> imagination. All the broyles being now appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and all men accorded by the Judges and Curates perswasions; then began <hi>Don Lewis</hi>
his servants again to urge him to depart with them, and whilest hee and they debated the
matter, the Judge communicated the whole to <hi>Don Fernando, Cardenio,</hi> and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54746:131"/>
the Curate, desiring to know their opinions concerning that affair, and telling them all
that <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had said unto him; whereupon they agreed that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> should
tell the Serving-men what hee himself was, and how it was his pleasure that <hi>Don Lewis</hi>
should goe with him to <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> where hee should bee cherished and accounted
of by the Marquesse his Brother, according unto his calling and deserts; for hee knew
well <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his resolution to bee such, as he would not return into his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
at that time, although they core him into peeces. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> his quality, and
<hi>Don Lewis</hi> his intention being understood by the four, they agreed among themselves,
that three of them should goe back to beare the tidings of all that had passed, to
his Father, and the other should abide there to attend on him and never to leave
him untill they returned to fetch him home, or knew what else his Father would
command: And in this sort was that monstrous bulk of division and contention
reduced to some forme by the authority of <hi>Agramant</hi> and the wisdome of King
<hi>Sobrino.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Enemie of Concord, and the Adversarie of Peace, finding his projects to
bee thus illuded and condemned, and seeing the little fruit hee had gotten by setting
them all by the eares, resolved once again to trye his wits, and stir up new discords and
troubles, which befell in this manner: The Troupers were quieted, having understood
the calling of those with whom they had contended, and retired themselves from the
brawl, knowing that howsoever the cause succeeded they themselves should have still
the worst end of the staffe: But one of them, who was the very same whom <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi>
had buffetted so well, remembred how among many other Warrants that hee
had to apprehend Malefactors, hee had one for <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whom the <hi>Holy-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi>
had commanded to bee apprehended for freeing of the Gally-Slaves, a disaster
which <hi>Sancho</hi> had before-hand with very great reason feared:) As soon as he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
it, hee would needs trye whether the signes that were given him of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
did agree with his person; and so taking out of his bosome a scorll of Parchment
wherein they were written, hee presently found out that which hee looked for; and
reading it a while very leisurely, as one that was himself no great Clerke, at every other
word hee looked on <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and confronted the marks of his warrant with those
of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> face, and found that he was infallibly the man that was therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
And scarce was hee perswaded that it was hee, when folding up his Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and holding the Warrant in his left hand, hee laid hold on <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> coller
with the right so strongly as hee could hardly breath, and cryed out aloud, saying, Aid
for the <hi>Holy-Brotherhood:</hi> and that you may perceive how I am in good earnest, read
that Warrant, wherein you shall finde that this Robber by the High-way side is to bee
apprehended. The Curate took the Warrant and perceived very well that the Trouper
said true, and that the marks agreed very neer with <hi>Don-Quixotes;</hi> who seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so abused by that base Rascall, as hee accounted him, his choler being mounted to
her height, and all the bones of his body crashing for wrath, hee seized as well as hee
could with both his hands on the Troupers throat, and that in such sort, as if hee had
not been speedily succoured by his fellows, hee had there left his life are <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
would have abandoned his gripe.</p>
                     <p>The Inne-keeper, who of force was to assist his fellow in Office, forthwith repaired
unto his aide. The Hostesse seeing her Husband re-enter into contentions and brables,
raised a new crie, whose burden was borne by her Daughter and <hi>Maritornes,</hi> asking
succour of Heaven and those that were present. <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing all that passed, said, By
the Lord all that my Master hath said of the Inchantments of this Castle is true; for it
is not possible for a man to live quietly in it one hour together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Fernando</hi> parted the Trouper and <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and with the good will of both
unfastened their holds: but yet the Troupers for all this desisted not to require their
Prisoner, and withall, that they should help to get him tyed and absolutely rendred
unto their wills; for so it was requisite for the King and the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> in whose
name they did again demand their help and assistance for the Arresting of that publique
Robber and Spoyler of People in common Paths and High-wayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:132"/>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laughed to heare them speake so idlely, as hee imagined, and said with
very great gravitie; Come hither, you filthie base extractions of the dunghill, dare you
terme the losing of the inchayned, the freeing of Prisoners, the assisting of the wretched,
the raysing of such as are falne, and the supplying of those that are in want? Dare you
(I say) terme these things robbing on the High-way? O infamous brood, worthy for
your base and vile conceit, that Heav'n should never communicate with you the valour
included in the exercise of Chivalrie, wee give you to understand the sinne and errour
wherein you are, by not adoring the very shadow, how much more the assistance of a
Knight Errant? Come hither, O you that bee no Troopers, but Theeves in troope, and
Robbers of high-wayes by permission of the <hi>Holy Brotherhood:</hi> Come hither I say, and
tell mee, who was that jolt-head that did subscribe or ratifie a Warrant for the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such a Knight as I am? Who was hee that knowes not how Knights errant are
exempted from all Tribunals? and how that their Sword is the Law, their Valour the
Bench, and their Wills the Statutes of their Courts? I say againe, what mad man was
hee that knowes not how that no priviledge of Gentry injoyes so many preemiencies,
immunities, and exemptions, as that which a Knight errant acquires the day wherein he
is dubbed, and undertakes the rigorous exercise of Armes? What Knight Errant did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pay tribute, subsidie, tallage, carriage, or passage over water? What Taylor
ever had money for making his clothes? What Constable ever lodged him in Castle,
that made him after to pay for the shot? What King hath not placed him at his owne
Table? What Damzell hath not faln in love with him, and permitted him to use her as
hee liked? And finally, what Knight errant was there ever, is, or ever shall bee in
the World, which hath not the courage himselfe alone to give foure hundred blowes
with a cudgell to foure hundred Troopers that shall presume to stand before him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HILEST <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said this, the Curate laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Troopers, how the Knight was distracted, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
might collect by his works and words, &amp; therefore it would
bee to no end to prosecute their Designe any farther, seeing that
although they did apprehend and carry him away, hee would bee
presently delivered againe as a mad-man. To this, hee that had
the Warrant made answere, that it concerned him not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether hee was mad or no, but only to obey and execute his
superiours command; and that being once Prisoner, they might deliver him three
hundred times and if it were their good pleasure. For all that (quoth the Curate) you
may not carrie him with you at this time, nor (as I suppose) will hee suffer himself to
bee taken. To bee brief, the Curate said so much, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> plaid so many
mad pranks, as the Troupers themselves would have proved greater fools then hee, if
they had not manifestly discerned his defect of judgement: and therefore they held
it to bee the best course to let him alone, yea and bee compounders of Peace and Amity
between <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> and the Barber, which still continued their most rancorous and
deadly contention. Finally, they, as the Officers of Justice, did mediate the cause, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54746:132"/>
were Arbiters thereof in such sort, as both the parties remained, though not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
yet in some sort satisfied; for they only made them exchange their Pannells, but
not their Gyrts or Head-stalls.</p>
                     <p>As touching <hi>Mambrino's</hi> Helmet, the Curate did unawares to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> give
to the Barber eight ryals by it, and the Barber gave back unto him an acquittance of
the receit thereof, and an everlasting release of all actions concerning it. These two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
which were the most principall, and of most consequence, being thus accorded,
it onely rested, that three of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his Servingmen would be content to return
home, and leave the fourth to accompanie his Master whither <hi>Don Fernando</hi> pleased to
carry him. And as good hap and better fortune had already begun to break Lances,
and facilitate difficulties, in the favour of the Lovers, and worthy persons of the Inn,
so did it resolve to proceed forward, and give a prosperous successe unto all: for the
Servingmen were content to doe whatsoever their master would have them: whereat
<hi>Donna Clara</hi> was so cheerfull, as no one beheld her face in that season, but might read
therein the inward contentment of her mind. <hi>Zoraida,</hi> although she did not very well
understand all the seccesses of the things she had seen, yet was she interchangably griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and cheered according to the shews made by the rest, but chiefly by her Spaniard,
on whom her eyes were alwaies fixed, and all the affects of her mind depended. The
Inkeeper, who did not forget the recompence made by the Curate to the Barber, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> expences, and satisfaction for the damage he had done
to his Wine-baggs, and the losse of his Wine, swearing that neither <hi>Rozinante,</hi> nor <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
his Asse should depart out of the Inne, untill he were payed the very last far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
All was quietly ended by the Curate, and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> paid the whole sum
although the Judge had also most liberally offered to doe it; and all of them remained
afterwards in such quietnesse and peace, as the Inn did no longer resemble the discorded
Camp of <hi>Agramante</hi> (as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> termed it) but rather enjoyed the very peace and
tranquilitie of the Emperour <hi>Octavians</hi> time; for all which the common opinion was,
that thanks were justly due to the sincere proceeding and great eloquence of Master
Curate, and to the incomparable liberalitie and goodnesse of <hi>Don Fernando. Don-Quixote,</hi>
perceiving himself free and delivered from so many difficulties and brabbles
(wherewithall as well hee as his Esquire had been perplexed) held it high time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
his commenced voyage, and bring to an end the great Adventure unto which
hee was called and chosen: Therefore with resolute determination to depart, hee
went and cast himself on his knees before <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who not permitting him to speak
untill he arose, he to obey her stood up &amp; said, It is a common Proverb, beautifull Ladie,
<hi>That Diligence is the mother of Good-hap;</hi> and in many and grave Affairs experience hath
shewed, that the sollicitude and sore of the suiter oft brings a doubtfull matter to a
certain and happie end: But this truth appears in nothing more cleerly, then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Warre; wherein celeritie and expedition prevent the Enemies Designes, and
obtain the Victory before an Adversary can put himself in defence: All this I say, high
and worthie Ladie, because it seems to mee, that our abode in this Castle is nothing
profitable, and many therewithall turn so farre to our hindrance, as wee may palpably
feel it one day: For who knows but that your enemie the Gyant, hath learned by
Spies or other secret intelligence and means how I mean to come and destroy him,
and (oportunitie favouring his designes) that hee may have fortified himself in some
inexpugnable Castle or Fortresse, against the strength whereof neither mine industrie
nor the force of mine invincible Arme can much prevail: wherefore, deer Ladie, let
us prevent (as I have said) by our dilligence, and let us presently depart unto the place
whereunto wee are called by our good Fortune, which shall bee deferred no longer
then I am absent from your Highnesse foe. Here hee held his peace, and did expect,
with great gravitie, the beautifull Princesse's answer; who with debonair countenance,
and a stile accommodated unto <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> returned him this answer: I doe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
and thank, Sir Knight, the desire you shew to assist me in this my great need, which
denotes very cleerly the great care you have to favour Orphans and distressed Wights;
and I beseech God, that your good desires and mine may bee accomplished, to the end
<pb facs="tcp:54746:133"/>
that you may see how there are some thankfull women on earth; as touching my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
let it bee forthwith; for I have none other will then that which is yours:
therefore you may dispose of me at your own pleasure; for she that hath once committed
the defence of her person unto you, and hath put into your hands the restitution of her
estate, ought not to seek to doe any other thing then that which your wisedome shall
ordain. In the name of God (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) seeing that your Highnesse doth
so humble your self unto me, I will not lose the occasion of exalting it, and installing
it again in the throne of your inheritance. Let our departure bee incontinent; for my
desires, and the way, and that which they call the danger that is in delay, doe spur me
on: And seeing that Heaven never created, nor Hell ever beheld any man that could
affright me or make a Coward of me, goe therefore <hi>Sancho</hi> and saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi>
and empannell thine Asse, and make ready the Queens Palfrey, and let us take
leave of the Constable and those other Lords and depart away from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Sancho</hi> (who was present at all this) waging of his head said, O my Lord, my
Lord, how much more knaverie (be it spoken with the pardon of all honest kerchiefs)
is there in the little Village then is talked of? What ill can there bee in any Village, or
in all the Cities of the World, able to impaire my credit, thou Villaine? If thou be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I will hold my tongue, and omit to say that which by the dutie of a
good Squire and of an honest servant I am bound to tell you. Say what thou wilt,
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> so thy words bee not addrest to make mee afraid; for if thou beest
trighted, thou doest only like thy selfe; and if I bee devoyd of terror, I also doe that
which I ought. It is not that which I meane, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but that I doe hold for
most sure and certaine, that this Ladie which calls her selfe Queene of the great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> is no more a Queene then my Mother; for if shee were what
shee saies, shee would not at every corner and at every turning of a hand bee billing as
shee is, with one that is in this good company. <hi>Dorotea</hi> blushed at <hi>Sancho</hi>'s words; for
it was true indeede, that her Spouse <hi>Don Fernando</hi> would now and then privately
steale from her lips some part of the reward which his desires did merit (which <hi>Sancho</hi>
espying, it seemed to him, that that kinde of wanton familiarity was more proper to
Curtezans, then becomming the Queene of so great a Kingdome) and yet shee neither
could nor would reply unto him, but let him continue his speech, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
This I doe say good my Lord, quoth hee, to this end; That if after wee have
run many waies and courses, and indured bad nights and worse daies, hee that is in this
Inn, sporting himselfe, shall come to gather the fruit of our labours; there is no reason
to hasten me thus to saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> or empannell the Asse, or make ready the Palfrey
seeing it would be better that we stayed still, and that every whore spun, and wee sell to
our victuals.</p>
                     <p>O God, how great was the fury that inflamed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> when he heard his
Squire speake so respectlesly! I say it was so great, that with a shaking voice, a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
tongue, and the fire sparkling out of his eyes, he said, O villanous peasant, rash,
unmanerly, ignorant, rude, blasphemous, bold murmurer, and detractor, hast thou
presumed to speake such words in my presence, and in that of these noble Ladies? and
hast thou dared to entertaine such rash and dishonest surmises into thy confused
imagination? Depart out of my sight, thou monster of nature, store-house of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes,
armorie of falshood, sinke of rogerie, inventour of Villainie, publisher of
ravings, and the enemy of that decencie which is to be used towards royall persons.
Away villaine, and never appear before me, under paine of mine indignation. And
saying so he bended his browes, fild up his cheekes, looked about him on every side,
and struck a great blow with his right foot on the ground; all manifest tokens of
the rage which inwardly fretted him. At which words and furious gestures poor
<hi>Sancho</hi> remained so greatly affrighted, as he could have wished in that instant, that
the earth opening under his feet, would swallow him up, and knew not what to doe,
but turne his back, and get him out of his Lords most furious presence. But the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<hi>Dorotea</hi> (who was now so well schooled in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> humour) to mitigate
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54746:133"/>
his yre, said unto him; Be not offended, good <hi>Sir Knight of the sad face,</hi> at the idle
words which your good Squire hath spoken: for perhaps he hath not said them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some ground, nor of his good understanding and Christian minde can it be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
that he would wittingly slander or accuse any body falsely: And therefore
we must beleeve, without all doubt, that as in this Castle, as you your selfe have said,
Sir Knight, all things are represented, and succeed by manner of inchantment; I say,
it might befall, that <hi>Sancho</hi> may have seene by Diabolicall illusion, that which he saies,
he beheld so much to the prejudice of my reputation.</p>
                     <p>I vow by the omnipotent <hi>Iove,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that your Highnesse hath hit
the very prick, and that some wicked Vision appeared to this sinner my man <hi>Sancho,</hi>
that made him to see that which otherwise were impossible to bee seen by any other
way then that of inchantment; for I know very well the great goodnesse and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of that poor wretch is such, as hee knows not how to invent a lye on any bodie
living. It is even so, and so it shall bee, quoth <hi>Don Fernando:</hi> and therefore, good
Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> you must pardon him, and reduce him again to the bosome of your
good grace: <hi>Sicut erat in Principio,</hi> and before the like Visions did distract his sense.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, that hee did willingly pardon him: And therefore the Curate
went for <hi>Sancho,</hi> who returned very humbly; and kneeling down on his knees, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Lords hand, which hee gave unto him; and after that hee had permited him
to kisse it, hee gave him his blissing, saying; Now thou shalt finally know, <hi>Sancho,</hi>
that which I have told thee divers times, how that all the things of this Castle are made
by way of inchantment. So doe I verily believe, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> except that of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassing
in the Blanket, which really succeeded by an ordinary and naturall way. Doe
not believe that, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for if it were so, I would both then, and also now
have taken a dire revenge: but neither then, nor now could I ever see any, on whom I
might revenge that thine injurie. All of them desired greatly to know what that accident
of the Blanket was: And then the Inn-keeper recounted it point by point, the flights
that <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> made; whereat they all did laugh not a little; and <hi>Sancho</hi> would
have been ashamed no lesse, if his Lord had not anew perswaded him that it was a meer
inchantment: And yet <hi>Sancho's</hi> madnesse was never so great, as to beleeve that it was
not a reall truth verily befaln him, without any colour or mixture of fraud or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion;
but that hee was tossed by persons of Flesh, Blood, and Bone, and not
by dreamed and imagined shadows or Spirits, as his Lord beleeved, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirmed.</p>
                     <p>Two dayes were now expired when all that Noble companie had sojourned in the
Inn, and then it seeming unto them high time to depart: They devised how (without
putting <hi>Dorotea</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> to the pains to turn back with <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to his
Village, under pretence of restoring the Queen <hi>Micomicona</hi>) the Curate and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
might carry him back as they desired, and indevour to have him cured of his
folly in his own house. And their invention was this: They agreed with one, who
by chance passed by that way with a Teame of Oxen, to carry him in this order follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
They made a thing like a Cage of Timber, so big as that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might sit
or lie in it at his ease: and presently after <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and his fellows, with <hi>Don
Lewis</hi> his Servants, the Troupers, and the Inn-keeper, did all of them, by Master Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
direction, cover their faces and disguise themselves, every one as hee might best,
so that they might seem to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> other people then such as hee had seen in the
Castle. And this being done, they entred with very great silence into the place where
hee slept and took his rest after the related conflicts: And approaching him who slept
securely, not fearing any such accident; and laying hold on him very strongly, they
tyed his hands and his feet very strongly, so that when hee started out of his sleep, hee
could not stir himself, nor doe any other thing then admire and wonder at those strange
shapes that he saw standing before him; and presently hee fell into the conceit which
his continuall and distracted imagination had already suggested unto him, beleeving
that all those strange figures were the Spirits and shadows of that inchanted Castle, and
that hee himself was now without doubt inchanted, seeing hee could neither move nor
<pb facs="tcp:54746:134"/>
defend himself. All this succeeded just as the Curate (who plotted the jest) made full
account it would: Only <hi>Sancho,</hi> among all those that were present, was in his right
sense and shape; and although hee wanted but little to bee sick of his Lords disease,
yet for all that hee knew all those counterfeit Ghosts; but hee would not once unfold
his lips, untill hee might see the end of that surprizall and imprisonment of his Master;
who likewise spoke never a word, but only looked to see what would bee the period
of his disgrace: Which was, that bringing him to the Cage, they shut him within, and
afterwards nailed the Barrs thereof so well as they could not bee easily broken: They
presently mounted him upon their shoulders; and as hee issued out at the chamber
door, they heard as dreadfull a voyce as the Barber could devise (not hee of the Pannell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
but the other) which said, <hi>O Knight of the sad-Countenance! bee not grieved at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
whereinto thou art led; for so it must bee, that thereby the Adventure, into
which thy great Force and Valour have thrust thee, may bee the more spedily ended; and
ended it will bee, when the furious</hi> Manchegall-Lyon, <hi>and the white</hi> Tobosian-Dove
<hi>shall bee united in one; and after they have humbled their lofty Crest unto the soft Yoake
of Wedlock, from whose wonderfull consort shall issue to the light of the Orbe, fierce Whelps
which shall imitate the raunching paws of their valourous Father: And this shall bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the pursuer of the fugitive Nymph doe with his swift and naturall course make two
turns in visitation of the glistring Images: And thou, O the most noble and obedient
Squire that ever had Sword at a Gyrdle, Beard on a Face, or Dent in a Nose, let it not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may
or discontent thee, to see carried away before thy eyes the flowre of all Chivalrie Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
For very speedily, if it please the framer of the World, thou shalt see thy self so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
and ennobled, as thou shalt scarce know thy self: Nor shalt thou bee defrauded of the
promises made unto thee by thy noble Lord: And I doe assure thee from the wise</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tironiana,
<hi>that thy wages shall bee payed thee, as thou shalt quickly see in effect: And
therefore follow the steps of the valorous and inchanted Knight; for it is necessary that thou
goe to the place where you both shall stay: And because I am not permitted to say more,
farewell; for I doe return I well know whither.</hi> Towards the end of this Prophecie hee
lifted up his voyce, and afterwards lessened it, with so slender an accent, that even those
which were acquainted with the jest almost believed what they had heard.</p>
                     <p>Don-Quixote <hi>was very much comforted by the Prophecie; for hee presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the whole sense thereof, and perceived how hee was promised in marriage his
beloved</hi> Dulcinea <hi>of</hi> Toboso, <hi>from whose happy womb should salley the whelps (which
were his Sonnes) to the eternall glory of the</hi> Mancha. <hi>And believing all this most
firmly, hee elevated his voyce, and breathing forth a great sigh, thus said:</hi> O thou, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou beest, which hast prognosticated so great good to me, I desire thee to request
in my name the Wise man who hath charge to record mine acts, that hee permit me not to
perish in this Prison (to which they now doe carrie me) before the accomplishment of so joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and incomparable promises, as now have been made unto me: For, so that this may
befall, I will account the pains of my Prison a Glory, and the Chains that inviron me, an
ease; and will not esteem this Bed whereon I am laid a hard Field of Battell, but a soft
Tick and a most fortunate Lodging. And as concerning the consolation of my Squire <hi>Sancho
Pança,</hi> I trust in his goodnesse and honest proceeding, that hee will not abandon me in good
or bad fortune: for though it should fall out through his or my hard hap, that I shall not bee
able to be slow on him an Island, or other equivalent thing, as I have promised, his Wages
at least cannot bee lost; for in my Testament, which is made already, I have set down
what hee is to have, though not conformably to his many good Services, yet according to my
possibility. Sancho Panca <hi>bowed his head with great reverence, and kissed both his hands
(for one alone hee could not, by reason they were bound together) and presently those
Visions did lift up the Cage and accommodate it on the Team of Oxen.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw himselfe to be incaged after that manner,
and placed in the Cart, he said, I have read many and very grave
Histories of Knights Errant, but I never read, saw, nor heard,
that they were wont to carry Knights Errant inchanted after this
manner, and with the leisure that those slothfull and heavy beasts
doe threaten: for they were ever accustomed to be carried in the
ayr with wonderfull speed, shut in some duskie and obscure cloud;
or in some fiery chariot; or on some <hi>Hippogriphus,</hi> or some other such like beast:
but that they carry me now on a Teame of Oxen, I protest it drives me into a great
amazment, but perhaps both Chivalry, and the inchantments of these our times, doe
follow a course different from those of former ages: and peradventure it may also
bee, that as I am a new Knight in the world, and the first that hath againe revived
the now-neglected, and forgotten exercise of armes, so have they also newly inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
other kinds of inchantments, and other manners of carrying away inchanted
Knights. What doest thou think of this, sonne <hi>Sancho?</hi> I know not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
what to think, because I am not so well seen in Scriptures Errant as you are; but
for all this I durst affirm and swear, that these visions which goe up aud down in this
place, are not altogether Catholike. Catholikes, my father, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
how can they be Catholikes, when they be all Devils, which have assumed phantasticall
bodies to come and put me into this state? And if thou wilt prove the truth hereof,
doe but touch and feel them, and thou shalt finde them to have no bodies, but of ayre,
and that they consist of nothing but an outward appearance. Now by my faith, Sir,
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have already touched them, and finde this Devill that goeth there so
busily up and done, both plump and soft-fleshed; and that he hath besides another
property very different from that which I have heard say Devils have: for it is said
that they smell all of brimstone and other filthy things; but one may feel at least
halfe a league off, the Amber that this Devill smells off. <hi>Sancho</hi> spoke this of <hi>Don
Fernando,</hi> who belike (as Lords of his ranke are wont) had his attyre perfumed
with Amber.</p>
                     <p>Marvell not thereat, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for the Devils are very
crafty; and although they bring smels or perfumes about them, yet they themselves
smell nothing (because they are spirits) or if they doe smell ought, it is not good,
but evill and stinking savors: the reason is, for that as they doe alwayes bear where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they be, their hell about them, and can receive no kind of ease of their torments,
and good smels be things that delight and please; it is not possible that they can
smell any good thing, and if it seeme to thee that that Devill whom thou dost mention
smells of Amber, eyther thou art deceived, or hee would deceive thee, by making thee
to thinke that hee is no Devill. All these Discourses passed betweene the Master and
the man, the whilest <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and <hi>Cardenio</hi> (fearing lest <hi>Sancho</hi> should finde
out the deceite whereto hee was already come very heere) resolved to hasten the
Knights departure; and therefore calling the Inne-keeper aside, they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and empannell <hi>Sanchoes</hi> beast; which hee did with all
expedition: And the Curate agreed with the Troopers for so much a day to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie
him unto his Village. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hanged at the pummell of <hi>Rozinantes</hi>
Saddle, the Target on the one side, and on the other the Bason, and by signes hee
commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to get up on his Asse, and to leade <hi>Rozinante</hi> along by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
<pb facs="tcp:54746:135"/>
and afterwards placed on either side of the Cart two Troopers with their
fire-locks.</p>
                     <p>But before the Cart departed, the Oastesse, her Daughter, and <hi>Maritornes</hi> came
out to bid <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> farewell, fayning that they wept for sorrow of his disaster; to
whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, My good Ladies doe not weepe: for all these mischances are
incident to those as professe that which I doe, and if these calamities had not befaln mee,
I would never have accounted my selfe for a famous Knight Errant; for the like chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
never happen to Knights of little name or renowne, because there are none in the
world that makes any mention of them. But they often befall to the valorous, who
have emulators of their Virtue and Valour, both many Princes and many other Knights
that strive by indirect meanes to destroy them. But for all that, Virtue is so potent as
by her selfe alone (in despight of all the Negromancy that ever the first inventor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Zoroastes</hi> knew) shee will come off victorious from every danger, and will shine in
the world as the Sunne doth in Heaven. Pardon mee faire Ladies, if by any careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
I have done you any displeasure, for with my will and knowledge I never wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any. And pray unto God for mee, that hee will please to deliver mee out of this
prison, whereinto some ill meaning Inchanter hath thrust mee; for if I once may
see my selfe at liberty againe, I will never forget the favours which you have done
mee in this Castle, but greatly acknowledge and recompence them as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
Whilest the Ladies of the Castle were thus intertayned by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the
Curate and Barber tooke leave of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and his Companions; of the Captaine
and his Brother, and of all the contented Ladies, specially of <hi>Dorotea</hi> and <hi>Luscynda;</hi>
all of them imbraced and promised to acquaint one another with their succeeding
fortunes; <hi>Don Fernando</hi> intreating the Curate to write unto him what became of
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> assuring him that no affaire hee could informe him of should please
him better then that, and that hee would in lieu thereof acquaint him with all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
which hee thought would delight him, eyther concerning his owne Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
or <hi>Zoraidaes</hi> Baptisme, or the successe of <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Luscyndaes</hi> returne into
her House.</p>
                     <p>The Curate offered willingly to accomplish to a hair all that he had commanded
him: and so they returned once again to embrace one another, and to renew their
mutuall and complementall offers: The Inkeeper came also to the Curate, and gave
him certaine papers, saying, that he had found them within one of the linings of the
wallet, wherein the Tale of the curious impertinent was had; and that since the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
did not return to fetch it, he bade him take them all with him; for feeing he could
not read, he would keep them no longer. Master Curate yeelded him many thanks;
and then opening them, found in the beginning thereof these words: <hi>The Tale of
Riconnette and Cortadillo;</hi> by which he understood that it was some History, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
that it must be a good one, seeing that of the curious Impertinent, contrived
perhaps by the same Author, had proved so well, and therefore he laid it up, with
an intention to read it as soon as he had oportunity. Then he mounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with his friend the Barber; and both of them putting on their maskes, that
they might not quickly be known by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they travelled after the Team,
which held on in this order; first went the Cart, guided by the Carter: on both sides
thereof the Troupers rode with their fire-locks: then followed <hi>Sancho</hi> upon his Asse,
leading <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the Bridle; and last of all came the Curate and Barbar upon their
mighty Mules, and with their faces covered; all in a grave posture, and with an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
like pace, and travelling no faster then the slow steps of the heavie Oxen permitted
them. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> sate with his hands tyed, his legs stretched out, and leaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the barre of the Cage, with such a silence, and patience, as hee rather seemed a
Statue then a Man. In this quiet and leisurely manner, they travelled for the space of
two leagues, when ariving to a Valley, it seemed to their Conductor a fit place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and baite his Oxen. And acquainting the Curate with his purpose, the Barber was
of opinion that they should yet goe on a little further, because hee knew that there lay
behinde a little Mountaine, which was within their view, a certaine Vale, much better
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54746:135"/>
furnished with grasse then that wherein hee meant to abide. The Barbers opinion was
allowed; and therefore they continued on their Travell, when the Curate looking by
chance behinde him, saw comming after them six or seven men on horse-back, and very
well appointed, who quickly got ground of them; for they came not the lazie and
flegmatick pace of Oxen, but as men that were mounted on Canons Mules, and pricked
forward with a desire to passe over the heat of the day in their Inne, which was not
much more then a league from thence. Finally, those dilligent Travellers over-took
our slothfull ones, and saluted them courteously, and one of them that was a Canon of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> and Master of the rest, noting the orderly procession of the Cart, Troupers,
<hi>Sancho, Rozinante,</hi> the Curate and Barber, but chiefly the incaged <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hee
could not forbeare to demand what meaned the carriage of that man in so strange a
manner, although hee did already conjecture, by observation of the Troupers, that
hee was some notable Robber or other Delinquent, the punishment of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the <hi>Holy-Brotherhood.</hi> One of the Troupers, to whom the demand was
made, did answer in this manner: Sir, wee know not wherefore this Knight is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in this forme; and therefore let hee himself, who best may, tell you the reason
thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had over heard their discourse, and said, If, Gentlemen, you bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
and skillfull in matters of Chivalry, I will communicate my misfortunes with
you: but if you bee not, I have no reason to trouble my self to recount them. The
Curate and Barber seeing the Travellers in talk with <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> drew neer to make
answer for him in such sort, that their invention might not bee discovered; the whilest
the Canon replyed to the Knight, and said; Truely brother I am better acquainted
with Books of Knight-hood, then with <hi>Villapanda's</hi> Logick: and therefore if all the
difficultie rest only in that, you may safely communicate whatsoever you will with me.
A Gods name bee it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> You shall therefore nnderstand, Sir Knight,
that I am carried away inchanted in this Cage, through the envie and fraud of wicked
Magicians; <hi>For virtue is much more persecuted of the wicked then honoured of the good.</hi>
I am a Knight Errant, but none of those whose names are not recorded in the Books
of fame; but one of those who in despite of envie it self, and of all the Magicians of
<hi>Persia,</hi> the Bracmanes of <hi>India,</hi> or of the Gymnosophists of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> shall hang his
name in the Temple of Eternitie, that it may serve as a Modell and Pattern to ensuing
ages; wherein Knights Errant may view the steps which they are to follow, if they
mean to aspire to the top and honourable height of Armes. The Knight, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
saith true, quoth the Curate, speaking to the Travellers, that hee is carried
away in this Chariot inchanted, not through his own default or sinnes, but through
the malignant Treacherie of those to whom Virtue is loathsome and Valour odious:
This is, good Sir, the <hi>Knight of the sad-Countenance</hi> (if you have at any time heard
speak of him) whose valorous Acts shall remain insculped in stubborn Brasse, and
time-surviving Marble, though Envie and Mallice doe labour never so much to obscure
them.</p>
                     <p>When the Canon heard the imprisoned man and the three speak thus in one tenour,
hee was about to blesse himself for wonder, and could not conjecture what had befaln
him; and into no lesse admiration were they brought that came with him. But <hi>Sancho
Panca</hi> having in the mean time approached to hear their speech, to plaister up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
added; Now, Sirs, whether you will love me well or ill for what I shall say, the
very truth of the matter is, that my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is as much inchanted as my
mother, and no more; for his judgement is yet whole and sound; hee eates and drinks,
and doth his necessities as other men doe, and as hee himself did yesterday and other
dayes before they incaged him; all which being so, how can you make me beleeve that
hee goeth inchanted? for I have heard many persons avouch, that inchanted persons
neither eat, nor drink, nor speak: and yet my Lord, if hee bee not thwarted, will talk
more then twenty Barresters: And then turning towards the Curate, hee said, O Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Curate, Master Curate, doe you think that I doe not know you? And think you
that I doe not suppose, yea, and presage whereto these new inchantments are addressed?
<pb facs="tcp:54746:136"/>
Well, know then that I know you well, although you cover your face never so much,
and that I understand your meaning, how deeply soever you smother your drifts: But
in fine, where Emulation and Envie raigns, Virtue cannot live; where pinching swayes,
liberalitie goes by. A pox take the Devill; for, but for your Reverence, my Lord had
e're this time been wedded to the Princesse <hi>Micomicona,</hi> and I my self had been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
an Earl at least; for no lesse might bee expected either from the bountie of my
Lord or the greatnesse of my deserts: but now I perceive that to bee true which is
commonly said, <hi>That the wheel of Fortune turns about more swiftly then that of a Mill;
and that they which were yesterday on the top thereof, lie to day all along on the ground.</hi>
I am chiefly grieved for my Wife and Children; for whereas they ought and might
hope to see their Father come in at his gates made a Governour or Vice-Roy of some
Isle or Kingdome, they shall now see him return unto them no better then a poor
Horse-Boy: All which I have urged so much, Master Curate, only to intimate to your
paternitie, how you ought to have remorse and make a scruple of conscience, of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my dear Lord as you doe; and look to it well, that God doe not one day demand
at your hands, in the other life, amends for the prison whereinto you carrie him, and
that you bee not answerable for all the succours and good deeds which hee would have
afforded the World in this time of his Captivitie.</p>
                     <p>Snuffe me those candles, quoth the Barber, hearing him speak so. What <hi>Sancho,</hi>
art thou also of thy Masters confraternity? I swear by the Lord, I begin to see that
thou art very like to keep him company in the Cage, and that thou shalt be as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inchanted as he, for the portion which thou hast of humour, and Chivalry. Thou
wast in an ill hour begotten with child by his promises, and in a worse did the Isle, which
thou so greatly longest for sink into thy pate. I am not with child by any body, said <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
nor am I a man of humour to let any body get me with child, no, though it
were the King himself: and although I be poor, yet am I a Christian, and owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to any one; and if I desire Islands, others there are that desire worse things,
<hi>and every one is the sonne of his own workes:</hi> and under the name of a man, I may
become Pope, how much more the Governour of an Island; and chiefly seeing
my Lord may gaine so many, as he may want men to bestow them on? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Master Barber you should take heed how you speak; for all consists not in
trimming of beards: and there is some difference between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> I say it,
because all of us know one another, and no man shall unperceived put a false Die
upon me. As concerning my Lords inchantment, God knowes the truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let it rest as it is, seeing it is the worse for the stirring in. The Barber would
not reply unto <hi>Sancho,</hi> lest that with his simplicities, he should discover what the
Curate and himselfe did labour so much to conceale: and the Curate doubting the
same, had intreated the Canon to prick on a little forward, and he would unfold to
him the mistery of the encaged Knight, with other matters of delight. The Canon
did so, and taking his men along with them, was very attentive to all that he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
of the condition, life, madnesse, and fashion of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> There did he
briefly acquaint him with the originall cause of his distraction, and all the progresse
of his adventures, untill his shutting up in that Cage: and their own designe in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
him home to his Country, to try whether they might by any means finde out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for his frenzy. The Canon and his men again admired to hear so strange a History
as that of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and as soon as the Curate had ended his relation, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
said:</p>
                     <p>Verily Master Curate, I doe find by experience, that those Books which are institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Chivalry, or Knighthood, are very prejudicicall to wel-governed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths:
and although borne away by an idle and curious desire) I have read the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of almost as many as are imprinted, of that subject, yet could I never
indure my selfe to finish and read any one of them thorow: for me thinkes that
somewhat more or lesse, they all import one thing, and this hath no more then that,
nor the other more then his fellow. And in mine opinion this kinde of writing and
invention falls within the compasse of the Fables called <hi>Milesid,</hi> which are wandring
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54746:136"/>
and idle Tales, whose only scope is delight and not instruction; quite contrarie to the
project of those called <hi>Fabulae Apologae,</hi> which delight and instruct together: And
though that the principall end of such Books bee recreation, yet cannot I perceive how
they can yeeld it, seeing they bee forced with so many and so proportionlesse untruths:
For the delight that the minde conceives, must proceed from the beautie and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
which it sees or contemplates in such things as the sight or imagination represents
unto it; and all things that are deformed and discordant, must produce the contrary
effect. Now then, what beautie can there be; or what proportion between the parts and
the whole, or the whole and the parts, in a Book or Fable, wherein a Youth of sixteen
yeers of age gives a blow to a Gyant as great as a Jewes, and with that blow divides him
in two as easily as if hee were a pellet of Sugar? And when they describe a Battell,
after that they have told us how there were at least a million of men on the adverse
side, yet if the Knight of the Book bee against them, wee must of force, and whether
wee will or no, understand that the said Knight obtained the Victory through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
strength of his Arme. what then shall wee say of the facilitie wherewithall the
Inheritrix of a Kingdome or Empire falls between the armes of those Errant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Knights? What understanding, if it bee not altogether barren or barbarous,
can delight it self, reading how a great Tower full of Knights doth passe thorow the
Sea, as fast as a Ship with the most prosperous winde? And that going to Bed a man
is in Lombardie, and the next morning findes himself in <hi>Prester Iohn's</hi> Countrey, among
the Indians, or in some other Region which never was discovered by <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> nor
seen by <hi>Marcus Polus?</hi> And if I should bee answered, that the inventers of such
Books doe write them as Fables: and therefore are not bound unto any respect of
circumstances or observation of truth, I would reply, that an untruth is so much the
more pleasing, by how much the neerer it resembles a truth; and so much the more
gratefull, by how much the more it is doubtfull and possible: For lying Fables must
bee suited unto the Readers understanding; and so written, as that facilitating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
things, levelling untrue things, and holding the minde in suspence, they may
ravish a more delight, and entertain such manners, as pleasure and wonder may step by
step walk together; all which things hee that writes not likelihoods shall never bee able
to perform. And as touching imitation (wherein consists the perfection of that which
is written) I have not seen in any Books of Knight-hood an intire bulk of a Fable, so
proportioned in all the members thereof, as that the middle may answer the beginning,
and the end the beginning and middle: But rather they have composed them of so
many members, as it more probably seems, that the Authours intended to frame <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraes</hi>
or Monsters then to deliver proportionate figures, most harsh in their stile, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
in exploits, impudent in love matters, absurd in complements, prolixe in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
fond in discourses, uncertain and senselesse in voyages; and finally, devoid of all
discretion, art, and ingenious disposition: And therefore they deserve (as most idle
and frivolous things) to bee banished out of all Christian Common-wealths.</p>
                     <p>Master Curate did listen to the Canon with very great attention; and hee seemed
unto him to bee a man of good understanding, and that hee had great reason for what
hee had alledged: and therefore said, that in respect they did concur in opinions, and
that hee had an old grudge to the vanity of such Books, hee had likewise fired all <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
Library, consisting of many Books of that subject: And then hee recounted
to him the search and inquisition hee had made of them; and which hee had condemned,
and which reserved: Whereat the Canon laughed heartily, and said, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the evill hee had spoken of such Books, yet did hee finde one good in them,
to wit, the subject they offered a good wit to work upon and shew it self in them;
for they displayed a large and open plaine, thorow which the Pen might run without
let or incumbrances, describing of Ship-wracks, Tempests, Incounters, and Battells;
delineating a valorous Captain with all the properties required in him; as wisedome to
frustrate the designes of his enemie; eloquence to perswade or disswade his Souldiers;
ripenesse in advice; promptnesse in execution; as much valour in attending, as in
assaulting of an enemie; deciphering now a lamentable and tragicall successe, then a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:137"/>
joyfull and unexpected event; there a most beautifull, honest, and discreet Ladie, here
a valiant courteous and Christian Knight; there an unmeasurable barbarous Braggard,
here a gentle, valourous, and wise Prince: Representing the goodnesse and loyaltie of
Subjects, the magnificence and bountie of Lords: Sometimes hee may shew himself
an Astrologian, sometimes a Cosmographer, sometimes a Musician, sometimes a Statist,
and sometimes, if hee please, hee may have occasion to shew himself a Nigromancer:
There may hee demonstrate the subtiltie of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> the pietie of <hi>Encas,</hi> the valour of
<hi>Achilles,</hi> the misfortune of <hi>Hector,</hi> the treachery of <hi>Sinon,</hi> the amitie of <hi>Eurialus,</hi> the
liberallitie of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the resolution of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the clemency and truth of <hi>Trajanus,</hi>
the fidelitie of <hi>Zopirus,</hi> the prudence of <hi>Cato;</hi> and finally, all those parts that make a
worthy man perfect: one whiles by placing them all in one subject; another by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing
them among many; and this being done, and set out in a pleasing stile and a
wittie fashion that approacheth as neer as is possible unto the truth, will questionlesse
remain a work of many fair draughts, which being accomplished, will represent such
beauty and perfection, as shall fully attain to the best end aimed at in all writing, that
is, as I have said, joyntly to instruct and delight: for the irregularity and liberality of
those Books given to the Authour, the means to shew himself an Epick, Lyrick, Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and Comedian; with all other things which the most gracefull and pleasant Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Poetry and Oratorie include in themselves: for Epicks may bee as well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Prose as in Verse.</p>

to write a Book of Chivalrie, observing therein all the
points by me mentioned: and in truth I have written above a hundred sheets thereof;
and to the end that I might trie whether they were correspondent to my estimation,
I did communicate them both with certain skillfull and wise men that are marvellously
affected to that subject, and with some ignorant persons that only delight to hear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natic?<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nventions; and I have found in them all a great approbation of my labours;
yet would I not for all that prosecute the work, as well because it seemed unfit for my
Profession, as also because I finde the number of the ignorant to excede that of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious:
And though more good come to a man by the praise of a few wise men, then
hurt by the scoffs of a number of fools, yet would I not willingly subject my self to the
confused judgement of the senselesse vulgar, who commonly give themselves most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the reading of such Books. But that which most of all rid my hands, yea, and my
memorie, of all desire to end it, was this argument, drawn from our modern Comedies,
and thus made to my self: If those (as well the Fictions, as Historicall ones) are all or
the most part of them notorious Fopperies, and things without either head or foot,
and yet are by the vulgar heard with such delight, and held and approved for good:
and both the Authours that compose them, and Actors that represent them say, that
they must bee such as they bee for to please the Peoples humors, and not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54746:137"/>
to reason or truth, and that, because those wherein <hi>Decorum</hi> is observed,
and the fable followed according to the rules of Art, serve onely for three or four
discreete men (<hi>If so many may be found at a Play</hi>) which doe attend unto them, and
all the rest of the Auditors remaine fasting, by reason they cannot conceive the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
contexture thereof; therefore is it better for them to gaine good money
and meanes by many, then bare opinion or applause by a few. The very same
would bee the end of my Booke, after I had used all possible industrie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the aforesaid precept; and I should remaine only for a neede, and as the Taylour
that dwels in a corner, without trade or estimation.</p>
                     <p>And although I have sundry times indeavoured to perswade the Players, that their
opinion was erronious herein, and that they would attract more people, and acquire
greater fame by acting artificiall Comedies, then those irregular, and methodicall
Playes then used: yet are they so wedded to their opinion, as no reason can woo, nor
demonstration winn them from it. I remember, how dealing upon a day with one
of those obstinate fellowes, I said unto him, Doe not you remember, how a few yeers
agoe were represented in Spaine three Tragedies, written by a famous Poet of our
Kingdome, which were such as delighted, yea and amazed all the auditors, as well
the learned as the simple, the exact as the slight ones; and that the Players got more
by those three alone, then by thirtie of the best that were penned, or acted since that
time? You mean, without question, quoth the Actor answering me, <hi>Issabella, Filis,</hi>
and <hi>Alexandra.</hi> The very same, quoth I; and note whether in them were not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observed all the rules and precepts of Art: and yet thereby they neither wanted
any part of their dignitie, nor the approbation of all the world. So that I inferr the
fault not to be in the vulgar that covets idle toyes, but rather in those which know
not how to penn or act any other thing: for no such fond stuffe was in the Comedie
of <hi>Ingratitude revenged,</hi> nor found in <hi>Numantia,</hi> nor perceived in that of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Merchant,</hi> and much lesse in the <hi>Favourable enemy,</hi> nor in some others made by
judicious Poets, which both redounded to their infinite fame and renowne, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto these Actors aboundant gain. To these I added other reasons, wherewith
I left him, in mine opinion, somewhat perplexed, but not satisfied, or desirous to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
his erronious opinion.</p>
                     <p>Truely, Master Canon, quoth the Curate, you have touched a matter that hath
rowsed an ancient rancour and heart-burning of mine against the Comedies now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
the which is equall to the grudge that I beare to Bookes of Knight-hood. For
seeing the Comedie, as <hi>Tully</hi> affirms, ought to be a mirrour of mans life, a pattern of
manners, and an Image of truth: Those that are now exhibited, are mirrours of vanity,
patterns of folly, and Images of voluptuousnesse. For what greater absurditie can be
in such a subject; then to see a Child come out, in the first <hi>Scene,</hi> of the first Act, in his
swadling Clouts, and issue in the second already grown a man, yea, a bearded man?
And what greater vanity, then to present before us a valiant old man, and a yong co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
A Lay man become a Divine? a Page a Councellor? a King a Scoundrell?
and a Princesse a Scowre-kettle? What should I say, of the little care had of the due
observation of time, for the succeeding of that they represent, other then that I my
selfe have seene Comedies, whose first Act began in Europe, the second in Asia,
and the third ended in Africa: and truely if there had beene a fourth, it would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse
have finished in America, and by consequence wee should have seene a
round walk about the four parts of the World. And fayning an exployt performed
in the time of King <hi>Pepin,</hi> or of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> they make the principall Actours
thereof, eyther <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour that entred into Hierusalem bearing of the
holy Crosse; or <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloin</hi> that recovered the Holy-land; Many yeeres, yea and
ages having occurred between the times of the one and the other: yea and the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
being grounded on a fiction, to attribute unto it the verities of a History, and
mingle it and patch it up, with peeces of others, having relation to different persons
and times; and this with no plausible invention, or draught resembling the truth, but
rather with palpable, grosse, and inexcusable errours. And which is worse, some guls
<pb facs="tcp:54746:138"/>
are found to affirme, that all perfection consists herein, and that they are too dainty
that look for any other.</p>
                     <p>Now, if we would passe further, to examine the divine Comedies that treat of
God, or the lives of Saints, what a multitude of false miracles do the composers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise?
what a bulke of matters Apocryphall, and ill-understood? attributing to one
Saint the miracles done by another? yea and in humane Comedies they presume to
doe miracles (without farther respect, or consideration, but that such a miracle or
shew, as they term it, would doe well in such a place) to the end that the ignorant
folk may admire them, and come the more willingly to them: all which doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
truth, discredit histories, and turn to the disgrace of our Spanish wits: for stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which doe with much punctualitie observe the method of Comedies, hold us to
be rude and ignorant, when they see such follies, and absurdities escape us: and it will
be no sufficient excuse for this errour, to say, that the principall end of well-governed
Commonwealths, in the permitting of comedies, is onely to entertaine the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie
with some honest pastime, and thereby divert the exorbitant and vicious humors
which idlenesse is wont to ingender: and seeing that this end is attained to by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Comedies good or bad, it were to no purpose to appoint any Laws or limits
unto them, or to tye the Composers to frame, or Actors to play them, as they should
doe: For hereunto I answer, that this end would without all comparison bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
better by good Comedies then by evill ones: for the Auditour having heard
an artificall and well-ordered Comedie, would come away delighted with the Jests
and instructed by the truths thereof, wondring at the successes, grow discreeter by the
reasons, warned by the deceits, become wise by others example, incensed against vice,
and enamoured of virtue; all which affects a good Comedie should stirr up in the
hearers minde, were hee never so grosse or clownish: And it is of all impossibilities
the most impossible, that a Comedie consisting of all these parts should not entertain
delight, satisfie and content the minde much more then another that should bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in any of them, as most of our now-a-day Comedies bee. Nor are the Poets
that Pen them chiefly to bee blamed for this abuse; for some of them know very well
where the errour lurks, and know also as well how to redresse it. But because that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are become a vendible Merchandize, they affirm, and therein tell the plain truth,
that the Players would not buy them if they were of any other then the accustomed
kinde; and therefore the Poet indeavors to accommodate himself to the humour of
the Player, who is to pay him for his labour: And that this is the truth, may bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by an infinite number of Comedies, which a most happie wit of this Kingdome
hath composed with such delicacie, so many good Jests, so elegant a Verse, so excellent
Reasons, so grave Sentences; and finally, with so much eloquence and such a loftinesse
of stile, as hee hath filled the World with his fame; and yet by reason that hee was
forced to accommodate himself to the Actors, all of them have not arrived to the height:
of perfection which Art requires. Others there are, that write without any judgement,
and with so little heed of what they doe, as after their works have been once acted, the
Players are constrained to run away and hide themselves, fearing to bee punished, as
often they have been for acting things obnoxious to the Prince, or scandalous to some
Families.</p>
                     <p>All which inconveniences might bee redressed if there were some understanding and
discreet person ordained at the Court to examine all Comedies before they were Acted,
and that not only such as were played at the Court it self, but also all others that were
to bee Acted throughout <hi>Spain,</hi> without whose allowance, under his hand and seal, the
Magistrate of no Town should permit any Comedie to bee played: By which means
the Players would diligently send their Playes to the Court, and might boldly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Act them, and the composers would with more care and studie examine their
Labours, knowing that they should passe the strict censure of him that could understand
them: And by this means would good Comedies bee written, and the thing intended
by them most easily attained to, <hi>viz.</hi> entertainment of the People, the good opinion
of Spanish wits, the profit and security of the Players, and the saving of the care that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54746:138"/>
is now imployed in chastising their rashnesse. And if the same charge were given to this
man, or to some other, to examine the Books of Knight-hood which should bee made
hereafter, some of them doubtlesse would bee put forth, adorned with that perfection
whereof you spoke but now, inriching our language with the pleasing and precious
treasure of eloquence, and being an occasion that the old Books would become obscure
in the bright presence of those new ones published, for the honest recreation, not only
of the idler sort, but also of those that have more serious occupations: For it is not
possible for the bow to continue still bent; nor can our humane and fraile nature su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
it self long without some help of lawfull recreation.</p>
                     <p>The Canon and Curate had arrived to this point of their discourse, when the
Barber spurring on and overtaking them, said to the Curate, This is the place I lately
told you was fit to passe over the heat of the day in, while the Oxen baited amidest
the fresh and aboundant Pastures. It likes me very well, quoth the Curate: and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Canon what hee meant to doe, hee also was pleased to remain with them, as
well invited by the prospect of a beautifull Valley which offered it self to their view,
as also to injoy the Curates conversation, towards whom hee began to bear a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
affection: And lastly, with the desires hee had to bee thorowly acquainted with
<hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Adventures, therefore hee gave order to some of his men, that they
should ride to the Inne, which was hard by, and bring from thence what meat they
could finde, sufficient to satisfie them all, because hee meant likewise to passe the hot
time of the day in that place. To which one of his men did answer, that their sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Mule was by that time, as hee thought, in the Inne, so copiously furnished with
provision of meat, that, as hee supposed, they needed not buy any thing there but barley
for their Mules. If it be so, quoth the Canon, let our Mules be carried thither, and the
sumpture one returned hither.</p>
                     <p>Whilest this passed, <hi>Sancho</hi> being free from the continuall presence of the Curate
and Barber, whom hee held as suspected persons, thought it a fit time to speak with
his Lord; and therefore drew neer to the Cage wherein he sate, and said to him in
this manner: Sir, that I may discharge my conscience, I will reveal unto you all that
hath past in this affair of your inchantment; which briefly is, that those two which ride
with their faces covered are the Curate of our Village and the Barber, and as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they both are the Plotters of this your kinde of carrying away, for meer emulation
that they see you surpasse them both in atchieving of famous Acts: This truth being
presupposed, it follows that you are not Inchanted, but beguiled and made a fool:
For the proof whereof I will but demand of you one question; and if you doe answer
me according to my expectation, as I beleeve you will, you shall feel the deceit with your
own hands and perceive how you are not inchanted, but rather have your wits turned
upside-down.</p>
                     <p>Sonne <hi>Sancho</hi> demand what thou wilt, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and I will satisfie thee, and
answer directly to thy desire: But as touching thy averment, that those which goe
along with us, be the Curate and Barber, our Gossips, and old acquaintance; it may
well befall that they seem to be such; but that they are so really, and in effect, I would
not have thee beleeve in any manner: For that which thou art to believe and shouldest
understand in this matter is, that if they bee like those our friends, as thou sayest, it must
needs bee that those which have inchanted me, have assumed their semblance and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
(for it is an easie thing for Magicians to put on any shape they please) thereby to
give thee occasion to think that which thou doest, to drive thee into such a Labyrinth
of imaginations as thou shalt not afterwards know how to sally out, although thou
hadst the assistance of <hi>Theseus</hi> clew; and withall to make me waver in mine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to the end I may not conjecture from whence this charme is derived unto
me: for if thou on the one side doest affirm, that the Barber and Curate of our Village
doe accompanie me; and I on the other side finde my self incaged, and am so assured
of mine own force, that no humane strength, bee it not supernaturall, is able thus to
incage me; what wouldest thou have me to say or think, but that the manner of mine
inchantment exceeds as many as ever I read throughout all the Histories intreating of
<pb facs="tcp:54746:139"/>
Knights Errant, which have beene inchanted? Wherefore thou maiest very well
appease, and quiet thy selfe in that point of beleeving them to be those thou sayest,
for they are those, as much as I am a Turke: and as touching thy desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
somewhat of me, speake, for I will answer thee, although, thou puttest mee
questions untill to morrow morning.</p>
                     <p>Our Lady assist me, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> (as loud as he could) and is it possible that you
are so brain-sicke, and hard-headed, as you cannot perceive that I affirme the very
pure truth, and that malice hath a greater stroke in this your disgrace and imployment
then any inchantments? But seeing it is so, I will proove evidently that you are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted:
if not, tell me, as God shall deliver you out of this tempest, and as you shall
see your self, when you least think of it, in my Lady <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> armes. Make an end of
conjuring me, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and aske me what question thou wilt; for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told thee, that I will answer with all punctuality. That is it I demand, quoth
<hi>Sancho;</hi> and the thing I would know, is, that you tell me without adding or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought, but with all truth used or looked for of all those which professe the exercise
of armes as you doe, under the title of Knights Errants. I say, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
that I will not lie a jot: make therefore a beginning, or an end of these demands, for
in good sooth thou dost weary me with so many salutations, petitions and preventions.
<hi>Sancho</hi> replyed, I say that I am secure of the bounty aud truth of my Lord: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because it makes to the purpose in our affaire, I doe with all respect demand,
whether your Worship, since your incagement, and as you imagine, inchantment
in that coope, have not had a desire to make greater or lesse water, as men are wont
to say? I doe not understand, good <hi>Sancho,</hi> that phrase of making water: and therefore
explicate thy selfe, if thou wouldest have me to answer thee directly. And is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
replied he, that your Worship understands not what it is to make great or little
waters? then goe to some schoole, and learn it of the boyes, and know that I would
say, Have you had a desire to doe that which cannot be undone? O now, now, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
thee, <hi>Sancho.</hi> Yes, very many times<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I pray thee, deliver me from the extremity thereof; for I promise thee, I am not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>A, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> have I caught you at last? this is that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know, as much as my soule or life, come now, Sir and tell
me, can you deny that which is wont to be said, when a body is ill
disposed, I know not what ayles such a one; for he neither eates
nor drinks, nor sleepes, nor answers directly to that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, so as it seemes that he is inchanted? By which may
be collected, that such as neither eat, drink, sleepe, nor doe the other
naturall things you wote of, are inchanted: but not those which have a desire as you
have, and eate meate, when they get it, and drink drink when it is given them, and
answer to all is propounded unto them. Thou sayest true, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>
but I have told the already, that there are divers sorts of inchantments, and perhaps
they change with the times from one kinde into another; and that now the inchanted
use to doe all that which I do, although they did not so in times past; and therefore there
is no disputting, or drawing of conclusions against the customes of the time. I know,
and doe verily perswade my self, that I am inchanted, and that is sufficient for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54746:139"/>
of my conscience, which would bee gratly burdened if I thought that I were
not inchanted, and yet permitted my self to bee borne away in this Cage idly; and like
a Coward with-holding the succour I might give to many distressed and needy persons,
which even at this hour bee like enough to have extream want of mine aide and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Yet say I, notwithstanding, replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> that for more aboundant satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
your Worship might doe well to attempt the getting out of this prison, the
which I doe obliege my self with all my power to facilitate, yea and to get out, and
then you may recount eftsoons on the good <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who also seems inchanted, so
sad and melancholy hee goes: And this being done, wee may again assay the fortune
of seeking Adventures, which if it have no good successe wee have time enough to return
to our Cage; wherein I promise, by the faith of a good and loyall Squire, to shut up
my self together with you, if you shall prove so unfortunate, or I so foolish, as
not to bring our Designes to a good issue. I am content to doe what thou
sayest, brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and when thou seest oportunitie
offered to free me, I will bee ruled by thee in every thing; but yet thou shalt see
how far thou art over-wrought in the knowledge thou wilt seem to have of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
                     <p>The Knight Errant and the ill errant Squire beguiled the time in these discourses,
untill they arrived to the place where the Canon, Curate, and Barber expected them:
And then <hi>Sancho</hi> alighting, and helping to take down the Cage, the Wayn-man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoked
his Oxen, permitting them to take the benefit of pasture in that green and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Valley, whose Verdure invited not such to enjoy it as were inchanted like <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
but rather such heedfull and discreeet persons as was his man, who intreated
the Curate to licence his Lord to come out but a little while; for otherwise the Prison
would not bee so cleanly as the presence of so Worthie a Knight as his Lord was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
The Curate understood his meaning, and answered that he would satisfie his
requests very willingly, but that hee feared when hee saw himself at libertie, hee would
play then some prank or other, and goe whither no body should ever set eye on him
after. I will bee his surety that hee shall not flie away, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> And I also, quoth
the Canon, if hee will but promise me, as hee is a Knight, that hee will not depart from
us without our consent. I give my word that I will not, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (who
heard all that they had said) and the rather, because that inchanted bodies have not
free will to dispose of themselves as they list; for hee that inchanted them, may make
them unable to stir from one place in three dayes; and if they make an escape, hee can
compell them to return flying: and therefore, since it was so, they might securely set
him at libertie, especially seeing it would redound so much to all their benefits; for if
they did not free him, or get further off, hee protested that hee could not forbear to
offend their noses. The Canon took his hand (although it were bound) and by his
faith and word that hee would not depart, and then they gave him liberty; whereat
hee infinitely rejoyced, especially seeing himself out of the Cage. The first thing that
hee did after, was to stretch all his bodie, and then hee went towards <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and
striking him twice or thrice on the buttocks, hee said; I hope yet in God and his blessed
Mother, O flower and Mirror of Horses, that wee two shall see our selves very soon
in that state which our hearts desire; thou with thy Lord on thy back, and I mounted
on thee and exercising the function for which God sent me into this World: And
saying so, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> retired himself somewhat from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
and came back soon after a little more lightned, but greatly desiring to execute
his Squires Designes.</p>
                     <p>The Canon beheld him very earnestly, and with admiration wondring to see the
strangenesse of his fond humour, and how that hee shewed, in whatsoever hee uttered,
a very good understanding, and only left the stirrops (as is said before) when any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made of Chivalrie; and therefore moved to compassion, after they were all
laid down along upon the grasse, expecting their dinner, hee said unto him, Gentleman,
is it possible that the idle and unsavourie Lecture of Books of Knight-hood hath so
much distracted your wit, as thus to beleeve that you are carried away inchanted, with
<pb facs="tcp:54746:140"/>
other things of that kinde, as much wide from truth, as untruths can be from verity it
self? or how is it possible that any humane understanding can frame it self to beleeve,
that in this world there have been such an infinite of <hi>Amadises,</hi> such a crue of famous
Knights, so many Emperours of <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> such a number of <hi>Felixmartes</hi> of <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi>
so many Palfrayes, Damzels Errant, Serpents, Robbers, Giants, Battailes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of adventures, sundry kinds of inchantments, such unmeasureable incounters,
such braverie of apparell, such a multitude of enamoured and valiant Princesses, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Squires, Earles, witty Dwarfes, Viragoes, love-Letters, amorous dalliances; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
so many, so unreasonable, and impossible Adventures as are contayned in the
bookes of Knighthood.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I dare avouch of my selfe, that when I reade them, as long as I doe not
thinke that they are all but toyes and untruths, they delight mee; but when I ponder
seriously what they are, I throw the very best of them against the walls, yea, and would
throw them into the fire if they were neere mee, or in my hands, having well deserved
that severitie, as false Impostors and Seducers of common sense, as brochers of new
Sects and of uncouth courses of life, as those that give occasion to the ignorant vulgar,
to beleeve in such exorbitant untruths as are contained in them: Yea, and are withall
so presumptuous, as to dare to confound the wits of the most discreete and best descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Gentlemen; as wee may cleerely perceive by that they have done to your selfe,
whom they have brought to such termes, as it is necessarie to shut you up in a Cage and
carry you on a Team of Oxen, even as one carries a Lyon or Tygre from place to place,
to gayne a living by the shewing of him. Therefore good Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion

that hee was come to an end of them, after hee had looked upon him a good
while he said; Me thinks Gentleman, that the scope of your discourse hath been addrest
to perswade me, that there never were any Knights Errant in the world, and that all
the bookes of Chivalry are false, lying, hurtfull, and unprofitable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and that I have done ill to reade them, worse to beleeve in them, and worst
of all to follow them, by having thus taken on mee the most austere profession of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Knighthood, whereof they intreate; denying moreover that there were ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Amadises,</hi> eyther of <hi>Gaule</hi> or <hi>Greece;</hi> or any of all the other Knights, wherewith
such bookes are stuffed: All is just as you have said, quoth the Cannon; whereto <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
replyed thus; You also added, that such bookes had done mee much hurt,
seeing they had turned my judgement, and immured mee up in this Cage, and that it
were better for mee to make some amendment, and alter my Studie, reading other
that are more Authenticall, and delight and instruct much better. It is very true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered

                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:54746:140"/>Why then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I finde by mine accounts, that the inchanted and

against a thing so true, so currant, and of such request in the world, as hee that
should deny it, as you doe, merits the same punishment, which as you say you give to
those bookes, when the reading thereof offends you; for to goe about to make men
beleeve that <hi>Amadis</hi> never lived, nor any other of those Knights wherewith Histories
are fully replenished, would bee none other then to perswade them that the Sunne
lightens not, the Earth sustaines not, nor the Ice makes any thing cold. See what wit
is there in the world so profound, that can induce another to beleeve that the History of
<hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> and the Princes <hi>Floripes</hi> was not true? Nor that of <hi>Fierabras,</hi> with
the Bridg of <hi>Mantible,</hi> which befell in <hi>Charlemaines</hi> time, and is I swear, as true, as that it
is day at this instant? And if it be a Lie, so must it be also that ever there was an <hi>Hector,

                     <p>Full of admiration remained the good Canon, to heare the composition and medley
that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made of truths and fictions together; and at the great notice hee had
of all things that might any way cocerne his Knighthood Errant; and therefore he sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
him this answere; I cannot denie, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but that some part of that
which you have said is true, specially touching those Spanish Adventurers of whom
you have spoken, and will likewise grant you, that there were twelve Peeres of <hi>France,</hi>
but I will not beleeve that they have accomplished all that which the Archbishop <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
<pb facs="tcp:54746:141"/>
pine</hi> hath left written of them; for the bare truth of the affair is, that they were certain
Noble men chosen out by the Kings of France, whom they called Peers, because they
were all equall in Valour, Qualitie and Worth; or if they were not, it was at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that they were; and they were not much unlike the Militarie orders of Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> or <hi>Calatrava,</hi> were in request, wherein is presupposed that such as are of the
Profession are, or ought to bee valorous and well descended Gentlemen: and as
now they say a Knight of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Alcantara,</hi> so in those times they said a Knight
of the twelve Peers, because they were twelve equalls chosen to bee of that Military
Order. That there was a <hi>Cid</hi> and a <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Carpio</hi> is also doubtlesse; that they
have done the Acts recounted of them, I beleeve there is very great cause to doubt.
As touching the pin of the good Earl <hi>Pierres,</hi> and that it is by <hi>Babieca</hi> his saddle in the
Kings Armorie, I confesse that my sin hath made me so ignorant or blinde, that although
I have viewed the Saddle very well, yet could I never get a sight of that Pin how great
soever you affirm it to be.</p>
                     <p>Well, it is there without question, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and for the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
thereof, they say it is laid up in a case of Neats leather to keep it from rusting.
That may very well so bee, said the Canon: yet by the orders that I have received, I
doe not remember that ever I saw it: and although I should grant it to bee there, yet
doe I not therefore oblige my self to believe the Histories of all the <hi>Amadises,</hi> nor
those of the other rabblement of Knights which Books doe mention unto us; nor is it
reason that so honourable a man, adorn'd with so many good parts and indowed with
such a wit, as you are, should beleeve that so many and so strange follies as are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

universall delight and acceptance, and celebrated by great and
little, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, Plebeyans and
Gentlemen; and finally, by all kinde of persons of what state

seeing they have such probability of truth; seeing they
describe unto us the Father, Mother, Countrey, Kinsfolk, Age,
Town, and Acts of such a Knight or Knights, and that so exactly, point by point, and
day by day. Hold your peace, and never speak again such a blasphemie, and beleeve me;
for I doe sincerely councell you, what you, as a discreet man, ought to doe herein; and
if not, read them but once, and you shall see what delight you shall receive thereby:
if not, tell me; what greater pleasure can there bee then to behold (as one would say)
even here and before our eyes a great Lake of Pitch boyling-hot, and many Serpents,
Snakes, Lizarts, and other kindes of cruell and dreadfull Beasts swimming a thwart it
and in every part of it; and that there issues out of the Lake a most lamentable voyce,
saying: <hi>O thou Knight, whatsoever thou art, which doest behold the fearfull Lake; if
thou desirest to obtain the good concealed under these horrid and black waters, show the
valour of thy strong brest, and throw thy self into the midest of this sable, and inflamed
liquor: for if thou doest not so, thou shall not be worthy to discover the great wonders hidden
in the seven Castles of the seven Fates, which are seated under these gloomie waves:</hi> And
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54746:141"/>
that scarce hath the Knight heard the fearfull voyce, when without entring into any
new discourses, or once considering the danger whereinto hee thrusts himself, yea or
easing himself of the weight of his ponderous Armour, but only commending himself
unto God, and his Ladie Mistrisse, hee plunges into the midest of that burning puddle,
and when hee neither cares nor knows what may befall him, hee findes himself in the
midest of flourishing Fields, with which the very <hi>Elisean</hi> Plains can in no sort bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;
There it seems to him that the element is more transparent, and that the Sun
shines with a cleerer light then in our Orbe: There offers it self to his greedie and
curious eye, a most pleasing Forrest replenished with so green and well-spread. Trees,
as the verdure thereof both joyes and quickens the sight; whilest the eares are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the harmonious, though artlesse Songs of infinite and enamelled. Birds, which
traverse the intricate boughs of that shadie habitation: Here hee discovers a small
stream whose fresh waters, resembling liquid Cristall, slides over the small Sands and
white little stones, resembling sifted Gold wherein Orientall Pearls are inchaced: There
hee discerns an artificiall Fountain wrought of motly Jasper and smooth Marble; and
hard by it another rudely and negligently framed, wherein the sundry Cockle-shels
with the wreathed white and yellow houses of the Perwinkle and Snail intermingled,
and placed after a disorderly manner (having now and then peeces of cleer Cristall and
counterfeit Emeralds mingled among them) doe make a work of so gracefull varietie,
as Art imitating Nature, doth herein seem to surpasse her.</p>
                     <p>Suddainly he discovers a strong Castle or goodly Palace, whose walles are of
beaten gold, the pinacles of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> the gates of <hi>Iacinths;</hi> finally, it is of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Workemanship, as although the materials whereof it is built, are no worse
then <hi>Diamonds, Carbuncles, Rubies, Emeralds, Pearles,</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> yet is the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
thereof of more estimation and value then they, and is there any more to be
seen, after the seeing hereof, then to see sallie out at the Castle gates, a goodly troup
of lovely Damzels, whose brave and costly attyre, if I should attempt to describe, as
it is laid down in Histories, we should never make an end? and she that seems the
chiefest of all, to take presently our bold Knight, that threw himself into the boyling
Lake, by the hand, and carry him into the rich Castle or Palace without speaking a
word, and cause him to strip himself, as naked, as he was when his Mother bore him,
and bathe him in very temperate waters, and afterwards anoint him all over with
precious oyntments, and put on him a shirt of most fine, odoriferous, and perfumed
Sendall, and then another Damzell to come suddainly, and cast on his back a rich
mantle, which they say is wont to be worth, at the very least a rich Citty, yea and more.
Then what a sport it is, when they tell us after, that after this he is carried into another
Hall, where he finds the tables covered so orderly as he rests amazed? what, to see
cast on his hands water distilled all of Amber, and most fragrant flowers? what, to
see him seated in a chaire of Ivory? what, to see him served by all the Damzels with
marvellous silence? what the setting before him such variety of accares, and those
so excellently dressed, as his appetite knowes not to which of them it shall first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
his hand? what to hear the Musicke which sounds whilst he is at dinner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing who makes it, or whence it comes? and after that dinner is ended, and
the tables taken away, the Knight to remaine leaning on a chaire, and perhaps picking
of his teeth, as the custome is, and on a suddaine to enter at the Hall-door another
much more beautifull Damzell then any of the former, and to sit by his side, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to recount unto him what Castle that is, and how she is inchanted therein, with
many other things that amazed the Knight and amazed the Readers. I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my self any more in this matter, seeing that you may collect out of that which I
have said, that any part that is read of any book of a Knight Errant, will delight, and
astonish him, that shall peruse it with attention: and therefore I pray you beleeve me,
and as I have said already, reade those kinde of books, and you shall finde, that they
will exile all the Melancholy that shall trouble you, and rectifie your disposition, if by
fortune it be depraved: for I dare affirme of my self, that since I am become a Knight
Errant, I am valiant, courteous, liberall, well-manner'd, generous, gentle, bold,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:142"/>
mild, patient, and indurer of labours, imprisonments, and inchantments: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be but so little a while since I was shut up in a Cage like a mad man, yet
doe I hope by the valour of mine arme (heaven concurring, and fortune not crossing
me) to see my self within a few daies, the King of some Kingdoms, wherein I may
shew the bounty and liberality included within my brest. For in good truth, Sir, a
poor man is made unable to manifest the virtue of liberality toward any other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he virtually possesse it himself in a most eminent degree: and the will to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
which onely consists of will, is a dead thing, as Faith without Works. For which
cause I doe wish, that fortune would quickly present me some occasion whereby I
might make my self an Emperour; that I may discover the desire I have to doe good
unto my friends, but especially to this my poor Squire, <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who is one of
the honestest men in the world, on whom I would faine bestow the Earledome
which I promised him many daies past, but that I fear me he will not be able to
governe his estate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> overhearing those last words of his Masters, said Labour you, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
to get me that Earledome as often promised by you, as much longed for by
me, and I promise you that I will not want sufficiency to governe it; and though I
should, yet have I heard say, that there are men in the world, who take Lordships
to farme paying the Lord so much by the yeer, and undertaking the care of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
thereof, whilst the Lord himself with outstretched legs doth live at his ease;
enjoying the rents they bring him, and caring for nothing else: and so will I do, and
will not stand wracking it to the utmost, but presently desist from all administration
and live merily upon my Rent, like a young Duke; and so let the World wag and goe
how it will. That, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> is to bee understood, quoth the Canon, of enjoying
the Revenues; but as concerning the administration of Justice, the Lord of the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory
is bound to look to it; in that is required a sufficiencie and abilitie to govern,
and above all, a good intention to deal justly, and determine rightly; for if this bee
wanting when wee begin, our means and ends will alwaies bee subject to errour:
And therefore is God wont as well to further the good Designes of the simple, as to
disfavour the bad ones of those that be wittily wicked.</p>
                     <p>I understand not those Philosophies, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> but this I know well,
that I would I had as speedily the Earldome, as I could tell how to govern it; for I
have as much Soul as another, and as much Body as hee that hath most; and I would
bee as absolute a King in my estate, as any one would bee in his; and being such, I
would doe what I liked; and doing what I liked, I would take my pleasure; and
taking my pleasure, I would bee content; and when one is content, hee hath no more
to desire; and having no more to desire, the matter were ended: and then come the
state when it will, or farewell it, and let us behold our selves, as one blinde man said
to another. They are no bad Philosophies which thou comest out with, kinde <hi>Sancho,</hi>
quoth the Canon; but yet for all that there is much to bee said concerning this matter
of Earldomes. To that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replyed, I know not what more may bee said,
only I govern my self by the example of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> who made his Squire Earl
of the firm Island; and therefore I may without scruple of conscience make <hi>Sancho
Panca</hi> an Earl; for hee is one of the best Squires that ever Knight Errant had. The
Canon abode amazed at the well compacted and orderly ravings of <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
at the manner wherewith hee had deciphred the Adventure of the Knight of the Lake;
at the impression which his lying Books had made into him: and finally hee wondred
at the simplicity of <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who so earnestly desired to bee made Earl of the
County his Lord had promised him.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Canons Serving-men, which had gone to the Inne for the sumpture
Mule, were returned, and making their Table of a Carpet and of the green grasse of
that Meddow, they sate down under the shadow of the Trees and did eate there, to the
end that the Wain-man might not lose the commoditie of the Pasture, as wee have said
before; And as they sate at dinner, they suddainly heard the sound of a little Bell issuing
from among the Bryers and Brambles that were at hand; and instantly after they saw
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54746:142"/>
come out of the Thicket a very fair shee-Goate, whose hide was powdred all over with
black, white &amp; brown spots: after her followed a Goat-heard crying unto her, and in his
language, bidding her stay or return to the Fold; but the fugitive Goat, all affrighted
and fearfull, ran towards the companie, and as it were seeking in her dumbe manner to
bee protected, strayed neer unto them: Then did the Goat-heard arive; and laying
hold of her hornes (as if shee had been capable of his reprehension) said unto her; O yee
wanton Ape, yee spotted Elfe; how come yee to halt with me of late dayes? What
Wolves doe skarre your daughter? Will you not tell me, fair, what the matter is?
But what can it be other then that you are a female, and therefore can never bee quiet?
A foul evill take your conditions, and all theirs whom you so much resemble: Turn
back, love, turn back, and though you bee not so content withall, yet shall you at
least bee more safe in your own Fold, and among the rest of your fellows: for if you
that should guide and direct them, goe thus distracted and wandring, what then must
they doe? what will become of them?</p>
                     <p>The Goat-heards words did not a little delight the hearers, but principally the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
who said unto him, I pray thee, good fellow, take thy rest heere a while, and doe not
hasten that Goat so much to her Fold for seeing she is a female, as thou sayest, she
will follow her naturall instinct, how much soever thou opposest thy selfe unto it: take
therefore that bit, and drink a draught wherewithall thou maiest temper thy choller,
and the Goate will rest her the whilst: and saying so, he gave him the hinder quarter
of a cold Rabbet: which he receiving, rendered him many thanks and drinking a
draught of wine, did pacifie himself, and said presently after, I would not have you,
my Masters, account me simple, although I spoke to this beast in so earnest a fashion;
for in truth the words which I used unto her, were not without some mistery, I am
indeed rustick, and yet not so much, but that I know how to converse with men, and
with beasts. I beleeve that easily, quoth the Curate, for I know already by experience,
that the woods breed learned men, and sheep-coats containe Philosophers. At the
least, Sir, replyed the Goat-heard, they have among them experienced men: and that
you may give the more credit to this truth, and as it were, touch it with your owne
hands, (although till I be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idden, I may seeme to invite my self) I will, if you please
to hear me but a while, relate unto you a very true accident, which shall make good what
this Gentleman (pointing to the Curate) and my self have affirmed. To this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
answered, Because the case doth seem to have in it some shadow of Knightly
adventures, I will for my part listen unto thee with a very good will, and I presume
that all these Gentlemen will doe the like, so great is their discretion, and desire
to know curious novelty which amaze, delight, and entertain the senses, as I doe
certainly beleeve thy history will. Therefore begin it, friend, and all of us will
lend our eares unto it. I except mine, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I will goe with this
Pastie unto that little streame, where I mean to fill my self for three daies;
for I have heard my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> say, that a Knight Errants Squire must
eate when he can, and alwaies as much as he can, because that oftentimes they enter by
chance into some, wood so intricate, as they cannot get out of it again in five or six
daies: and if a mans panch be not then well stuffed, or his wallet well stored, he may
there remaine, and be turned, as many times it happens, into mummy. Thou art in
the right of it, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> goe therefore where thou wilt, and eate
what thou maiest; for I am already satisfied, and only want refection for my minde,
which now I will give it by listening to this good fellow. The same will we also give
unto ours, quoth the Canon, who therewithall intreated the Goat-heard to keepe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and begin his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ale. Then he stroking once or twice his pretty Goat, (which he
yet held fast by the horns) said thus, Lie down, pide fool, by me, for we shall have
time enough to return home againe. It seemed that the Goat understood him; for
as soone as her Master sate, downe, shee quietly stretched her self along by him,
and looking him in the face, did give to understand, that shee was attentive to what
he was saying; And then he began his history in this manner.</p>

of miracles? Her father did carefully keep her, and shee likewise heeded her self; for
their is neither Guard, Lock nor Bolt able to keep a Mayden better then is her own
warinesse and care: The Wealth of the Father and Worth of the Daughter moved
divers, as well of his own Village as Strangers, to demand her to wife; but hee (as one
whom the disposall of so rich a Jewell most neerly concerned) was much perplexed,
and unable to determine on whom, among such an infinite number of importunate
Wooers, hee might bestow her: Among others that bore this good will towards her,
I my self was one to whom they gave many and very great hopes of good successe, the
knowledg that her Father had of me, my birth in the same village, my descent honest, and
blood untainted, flourishing in years, very rich in goods, and no lesse in gifts of the
minde. Another of the same Village and Qualities was also a Suiter unto her; which
was an occasion to hold her in suspence, and put his will in the ballance, deeming, as
hee did, that shee might be bestowed on either of us two: and that hee might bee rid
of that doubt, hee resolved to tell it to <hi>Leandra</hi> (for so doe they call the rich Maid
which hath brought me to extream misery) noting discreetly, that seeing wee both
were equall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and found that he had but three suits of apparell of different colours, with garters and
stockings answerable to them; but hee used so many disguisements, varieties, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
and inventions, which they, as if they had not counted them all, some one
would have sworn that hee had made shew of more then ten suits of apparell, and
more then twentie plumes of feathers: and let not that which I tell you of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
bee counted impertinent, or from the matter; for it makes a principall part in the
History. Hee would sit on a bench that stood under a great Poplar Tree in the midst
of the Market place, and there would hold us all with gaping mouthes, listening to
the gallant Adventures and resolute Acts he recounted unto us: There was no Land
in all the World whose soile hee had not trodden on, no Battell wherein hee had not
been present; hee had slain more Moors then the Kingdomes of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Tuney</hi>
contained, and undertaken more single Combats, as hee said, then ever did either <hi>Gant,
Luna,</hi> or <hi>Diego Garcia de Paredes,</hi> and a thousand others whom hee named; and yet
he still came away with the victory, without having ever left one drop of blood. On the
other side hee would shew us signes of wounds, which although they could not be
discerned, yet would hee perswade us that they were the marks of bullets which hee
received in divers Skermishes and Warrs. Finally, hee would thou his equalls, and
those which knew him very well, with marvellous arrogancie; and said that his Arme
was his Father, his works his Linage, and that beside his being a Souldier hee ought not
a whit to the King: To these his arrogancies was annext some superficiall skill in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
for hee could scratch a little on a Gyttern, and some would say that hee made it
speak: but his many graces made not a stop there; for hee had likewise some sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of Poetry, and so would make a Ballad of a league and a half long upon every
toy that hapned in the Village.</p>
                     <p>This Souldier therefore whom I have deciphred, this <hi>Vincente of the Rose,</hi> this Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
this Musician, this Poet, eyed and beheld many times by <hi>Leandra</hi> from a certain
window of her house that looked into the Market-place; and the golden shew of his
Attire enamoured her, and his Ditties inchanted her; for hee would give twenty
Copies of every one hee composed: The report of his worthy acts, beautified by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
came also unto her eares; and finally (for so it is likely the Divill had ordered the
matter) shee became in Love with him before hee presumed to think once of solliciting
her. And, as in Love adventures, no one is accomplished with more facilitie then that
which is favoured by the womans desire; <hi>Leandra</hi> and <hi>Vincente</hi> made a short and easie
agreement: and e're any one of her Suiters could once suspect her desires, shee had
fully satisfied them, abandoned her deer and loving Fathers house (for her Mother
lives not) and running away from the Village with the Souldier, who departed with
more Triumph from that Enterprise then from all the others which hee had arrogated
to himself. The accident amazed all the Town; yea, and all those to whom the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
thereof arrived were astonished, <hi>Anselmo</hi> amazed, her Father sorrowfull, her
Kinsfolk ashamed. The ministers of Justice carefull, and the Troupers ready to make
pursuit; all the wayes were laid, and the Woods, and every other place neerly search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and at the end of three dayes they found the lustfull <hi>Leandra</hi> hidden in a Cave
within a Wood, naked in her smock, and despoyled of a great summe of Money, and
many precious Jewels which shee had brought away with her: They returned her
to her dolefull Fathers presence, where asking how shee became so dispoyled, she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
confessed, that <hi>Vincent of the Rose</hi> had deceived her: for having passed his word
to make her his Wife, hee perswaded her to leave her Fathers house, and made her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that hee would carrie her to the richest and most delightfull Citie of the World,
which was <hi>Naples:</hi> And that shee through indiscretion and his fraud, had given credit
to his words, and robbing her Father, stole away with him the very same night that shee
was missed; and that hee carried her to a very rough Thicket, and shut her up in that
Cave wherein they found her: She also recounted how the Souldier, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:54746:144"/>
her honour, had rob'd her of all that shee carried, and leaving her in that Cave, was
fled away; which successe strook us into greater admiration then all the rest; for wee
could hardly bee induced to beleeve the young gallants continencie; but shee did so
earnestly protest it, as it did not a little comfort her comfortlesse Father, who made no
reckoning of the Riches hee had lost, seeing his Daughter had yet reserved that Jewell,
which being once gone, could never again bee recovered. The same day that <hi>Leandra</hi>
appeared, shee also vanished out of our sights, being conveighed away by her Father,
and shut up in a Nunnerie at a certain Town not farre off, hoping that time would
obliterate some part of the bad opinion already conceived of his Daughters facilitie.
<hi>Leandra</hi> her youth served to excuse her errour, at least with those which gained nothing
by her beeing good or ill; but such as knew her discretion and great wit, did not
attribute her sinne to ignorance, but rather to her too much lightnesse, and the naturall
infirmitie of that Sexe, which for the most part is inconsiderate and slipperie. <hi>Leandra</hi>
being shut up, <hi>Anselmo's</hi> eyes lost their light, or at least beheld not any thing that
could delight them: and mine remained in darknesse without light that could addresse
them to any pleasing object in <hi>Leandra's</hi> absence. Our griefs increased; our patience
diminished; wee cursed the Souldiers Ornaments; and abhord her Fathers want of
looking to her: To bee brief, <hi>Anselmo</hi> and my self resolved to abandon the Village
and come to this Valley, where hee feeding a great flock of Sheep of his own, and I as
copious a Heard of Goats of mine, wee passe our lives among these Trees, giving vent
to our passions, either by singing together the beautifull <hi>Leandra's</hi> praises or dispraises;
or by sighing alone, and alone communicating our quarrelsome complaints with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Many others of <hi>Leandra's</hi> Suitors have since, by our example, come to these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
Woods, where they use our very exercise; and they are so many, as it seems that
this place is converted into the Pastorall <hi>Arcadia;</hi> it is full of Sheepheards and Sheep-Folds;
and there is no one part thereof wherein the name of the beautifull <hi>Leandra</hi>
resoundeth not: There one doth curse her, and termeth her humours, inconstant and
dishonest: another condemns her of being so facile and light: some one absolves and
pardons her: another condemns and despises her, and celebrates her beautie: another
execrates her disposition: and finally, all blame, but yet adore her; and the raving
distraction of them all doth so farre extend it self, as some one complains of disdain
that never spoke word unto her: and some one laments and feels the inraged fits of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
though shee never ministred any occasion thereof; for, as I have said, her sinne
was known before her desires: There is no Clift of a Rock, no Bank of a Stream, nor
Shadow of a Tree without some Sheepheard or other, that breaths out his misfortunes
to the silent air. The Eccho repeats <hi>Leandra's</hi> name, wheresoever it can be formed: The
Woods resound <hi>Leandra:</hi> The Brooks doe murmur <hi>Leandra:</hi> and <hi>Leandra</hi> holds us
all perplexed and inchanted, hoping without hope, and fearing without knowledge
what wee fear.</p>
                     <p>And among all this Flock of frantick men, none shews more or lesse judgement then
my companion <hi>Anselmo,</hi> who having so many other Titles under which hee might
plain him, only complains of absence, and doth to the sound of a Rebeck (which hee
handles admirably well) sing certain dolefull Verses, which fully discover the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of his conceit. I follow a more easie, and (in mine opinion) a more certain way,
to wit, I rayle on the lightnesse of Women, on their inconstancie, double dealing, dead
promises, crack'd trust, and the small discretion they shew in placing of their affections;
and this, Sir, was the occasion of the words and reasons I lately used to this Goat,
whom I doe esteem but little, because shee is a female, although shee bee otherwise the
best of all my Heard. And this is the Historie which I promised to tell you, wherein
if I have been prolixe, I will bee altogether as large in doing you any service; for I have
here at hand my Cabine, and therein store of fresh Milk, and savory Cheese, with
many sorts of excellent Fruit, no lesse agreeable to the sight then pleasing to the
taste.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the falling out of Don-Quixote and the Goat-heard: with
the adventure of the disciplinants, to which the Knight gave
end to his cost.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Goat-heards tale bred a generall delight in all the hearers,
but specially in the Canon, who did very exactly note the
manner wherewithall he delivered it, as different from the
stile or discourse of a rude Goat-heard, as approaching to
the discretion of a perfect Courtier; and therefore he said,
that the Curate had spoken very judiciously, in affirming
that the woods bred Learned men: all of them made boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
tenders of their friendship and service to <hi>Engenio,</hi> but
he that enlarged himself more then the rest, was <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi>
who said unto him, Certes, friend Goat-heard, if I were at this time able to
undertake any adventure, I would presently set forward, and fall in hand with it to
doe you a good turn, and I would take <hi>Leandra</hi> out of the Monastery (wherein
without doubt she is restrained against her will) in despight of the Lady Abbesse, and
all those that should take her part; and would put her into your hands, to the end
you might dispose of her at your pleasure, yet still observing the Lawes of Knight-hood
which command, that no man doe any wrong, and offer violence unto a Damzell:
yet I hope in our Lord God, that the skill of a malicious inchanter shall not be of such
force, but that the science of a better meaning wizard shall prevaile against him; and
whensoever that shall befall, I doe promise you my helpe and favour, as I am bound
by my profession, which cheifly consists in asisting the weak and distressed.</p>
                     <p>The Goat-heard beheld him, and seeing the Knight so ill arrayed, and of so evil-favoured
a countenance, he wondred, and questioned the Barber, who sate neere to
him, thus: I pray you, Sir, who is this man, of so strange a figure, and that speaks so
odly? Who else should he be, answered ehe Barber, but the famous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of
the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the righter of wrongs, the redresser of injuries, the protector of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels,
the affrighter of Giants, and the overcommer of battels? That which you say
of this man, answered the Goat-heard, is very like that which in Books of Chivalry is
written of Knights Errant; who did all those things which you apply to this man:
and yet I beleeve that either you jest, or else that this Gentlemans head is voyde of
braines.</p>
                     <p>Thou art a great villaine, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and thou art he whose pate wants
braines; for mine is fuller then the very, very whores that bore thee; and saying so,
and snatching up a loaf of bread that stood by him, he raught the Goat-heard so
furious a blow withall, as it beat his nose flat to his face: but the other, who was not
acquainted with such jests, and saw how ill he was handled, without having respect
to the Carpet, Napkins, or those that were eating, he leaped upon <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and
taking hold of his coller with both the hands, would certainly have strangled him, if
<hi>Sancho Panca</hi> had not arrived at that very instant, and taking him fast behind, had
not thrown him backe on the Table, crushing dishes, breaking glasses, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and overthrowing all that did lie upon it. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing himself free,
returned to get upon the Goat-heard, who all besmeared with blood, and trampled
to peeces under <hi>Sancho's</hi> feet, groped here and there groveling as he was for some
knif or other, to take a bloody revenge withall, but the Canon and Curate prevented
his purpose; and yet, by the Barbers assistance, he got under him <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> on
whom he rained such a showre of buffets, as he powred as much blood from the poor
<pb facs="tcp:54746:145"/>
Knights face, as had done from his owne. The Canon and Curate were ready to
burst for laughter: the Troupers danced for sport; every one hissed, as men use to
doe when Dogs fall out, and quarrell together: onely <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> was wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he could not get from one of the Canons Serving-men, who withheld him from
going to helpe his Master. In conclusion, all being very merry, save the two Buffetants,
that tugged one another extremely, they heard the sound of a Trumpet, so dolefull, as
it made them turne their faces towards that part from whence it seemed to come. But
hee that was most troubled at the noyse thereof, was <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who although hee
was under the Goatheard full sore against his Will, and by him exceedingly bruised and
battered, yet said unto him; Brother Devill (for it is impossible that thou canst bee
any other, seeing that thou hast had valour and strength to subject my forces) I pray
the let us make truce for one only houre; for the dolorous sound of that Trumpet
which toucheth our Eares, doth (mee thinks) invite mee to some new Adventure.
The Goateheard, who was weary of buffeting, and being beaten, left him off inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood up, and turned himselfe towards the place from
whence he imagined the noyse to proceede, and presently hee espyed descending from
a certaine height many men apparelled in white like disciplinants. The matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was, that the clowds had that yeer denied to bestow their deaw on the Earth, and
therefore they did institute Rogations, Processions, and Disciplines, throughout all
that Countrey, to desire Almighty God to open the hands of his Mercy, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
some Rain upon them. And to this effect, the People of a Village, neere unto that
place, came in Procession to a devout Eremitage, builded upon one of the Hills that
invironed that Valley.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> noting the strange attyre of the Disciplinants, without any calling to
memorie how hee had often seen the like before, did forthwith imagine that it was some
new Adventure, and that the tryall thereof only appertayned to him, as to a Knight
Errant; and this his presumption was fortified the more, by beleeving that an Image
which they carried all covered over with black, was some principall Lady whom those
miscreants and discourteous Knights did beare away perforce. And assoone as this fell
into his braine, hee leaped lightly towards <hi>Rozinante,</hi> that went feeding up and downe
the Plaines, and dismounting from his pummell the bridle, and his Target that hanged
thereat, hee bridled him in a trice; and taking his Sword from <hi>Sancho,</hi> got instantly
upon his horse, and then imbracing his Target, said in a loud voice to all those that
were present: You shall now see, O valorous company; how important a thing it
is, to have in the world such Knights as professe the order of Chivalrie errant. Now I
say, you shall discerne by the freeing of that good Ladie, who is there caryed Captive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
whether Knights Adventurous are to bee held in prize; and saying so, hee struck
<hi>Rozinante</hi> with his heeles (for spurres hee had none) and making him to gallop (for it
is not read in any part of this true Historie, that <hi>Rozinante</hi> did ever passe one formall or
full careere) hee posted to encounter the Disciplinants, although the Curate, Canon
and Barber did what they might to withhold him, but all was not possible, and much
lesse could hee bee deteined by these outcryes of <hi>Sancho,</hi> saying whither doe you goe,
Sir <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> What Devills doe you beare in your Breast, that incite you to run
thus against the Catholique Faith? See Sir, unfortunate that I am, how that is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Disciplinants, and that the Lady whom they beare, is the blessed Image of the
immaculate Virgin: Looke Sir what you doe, for at this time it may well bee said, that
you are not you know what. But <hi>Sancho</hi> laboured in vaine; for his Lord rode with so
greedie a desire to encounter the white men, and deliver the moorning Lady, as he heard
not a word, and although hee had, yet would hee not then have returned back at the
Kings commandement. Being come at last, neere to the Procession, and stopping <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi>
(who had already a great desire to rest himselfe a while) hee said with a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and hoarse voice; O you that cover your faces, perhaps because you are not good
men, give eare and listen to what I shall say. The first that stood at this alarm, were
those which carried the Image; and one of the foure Priests which sung the Letanies,
beholding the strange shape of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the leanenesse of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and other
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54746:145"/>
circumstances worthy of laughter, which hee noted in our Knight, returned him quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this answere; Good Sir, if you would say any thing to us, say it instantly, for these
honest men, as you see, are toyled extremely, and therefore wee cannot, nor is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
wee should stand lingring to heare any thing, if it bee not so briefe as it may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in two words; I will say it in one, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and it is this; That you
doe forthwith give liberty to that beautifull Lady, whose teeres and pittifull semblanco
cleerely denote that you carry her away against her. Will, and have done her some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
injury; and I, who was born to right such wrongs, will not permit her to passe one
step forward, untill she be wholly possessed of the freedom she doth so much desire and
deserve. All those that overheard <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> gathered by his words that he was some
distracted man, and therefore began to laugh very heartily, which laughing seemed to
add gun-powder to his choler; for laying his hand on his Sword, without any more
words, he presently assaulted the Image-carriers; one whereof, leaving the charge of
the burthen to his fellowes, came out to encounter the Knight with a wooden forke
(whereon he supported the Beere whensoever they made a stand) and receiving upon it
a great blow which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> discharged at him, it parted the Forke in two; and
yet hee with the peece that remained in his hand, returned the Knight such a thwack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shoulder, on the Sword side, as his Target not being able to make resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that rusticall Force, poore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was overthrowne to the ground, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
bruised.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> (who had followed him puffing and blowing as fast as hee could)
seeing him overthrown, cried to his adversarie that hee should strike no more; for hee
was a poor inchanted Knight that had never all the dayes of his life done any man
harme; but that which detained the Swain was not <hi>Sancho's</hi> out-cries, but to see that
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stirred neither hand nor foot; and therefore beleeving that hee had slain
him, hee tucked up his Coat to his girdle as soon as hee could, and fled away thorow
the Fields like a Deer. In the mean while <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Companions did hasten to the
place where hee lay, when those of the Procession seeing them (but principally the
Troopers of the Holy-Brotherhood with their Cross-hows) runne towards them, did
fear some disastrous successe; and therefore they gathered together in a troop about
the Image, and lifting up their hoods, and laying fast hold on their Whips, and the
Priests on their Tapers, they attended the assault, with resolution both to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and offend the assaylants if they might: But Fortune disposed the matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then they expected; for <hi>Sancho</hi> did nothing else then throw himself on his Lords
Body, making over him the most dolorous and ridiculous lamentation of the world,
and beleeving that hee was dead. The Curate was known by the other Curate that
came in the procession; and their acquaintance appeased the conceived fear of the
two squadrons: The first Curate, in two words, told the other what <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
was; and therefore hee, and all the crue of the Disciplinants went over to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the poor Knight were dead or alive; and then might heare <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> with
the tears in his eyes, bewayling him in this manner: O flowre of Chivalrie who hast
with one blow alone ended the Career of thy so well bestowed Peers! O renown of
this linage, the honour and glorie of all the <hi>Mancha!</hi> yea, and of all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side!
which seeing it wanteth thee, shall remain full of miscreants, secure from being
punished for their misdeeds! O liberall beyond all <hi>Alexanders,</hi> seeing thou hast
given me only for eight moneths service, the best Island that the Sea doth compasse
or ingyrt! O humble to the proud, and stately to humbled, undertaker of perills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durer
of affronts, enamoured without cause, imitater of good men, whip of the evill,
enemie of the wicked, and in conclusion Knight Errant, then which no greater thing
may be said!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was called again to himself by <hi>Sancho</hi> his out-cries, and then the first
word that ever hee spake was: Hee that lives absented from thee, most sweet <hi>Dulcinea,</hi>
is subject to greater miseries then this: Help me, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> to get up into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
Chariot again; for I am not in plight to oppresse <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Saddle, having this
shoulder broken all into peeces. That I will doe with a very good will, my deer Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:146"/>
replyed the Squire; and let us return to my Village, with those Gentlemen, which desire
your welfare so much; and there wee will take order for some other voyage, which
may bee more profitable and famous then this hath been. Thou speakest reasonable
<hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and it will be a great wisdome to let over passe the crosse
aspect of those Planets that raig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e at this present. The Canon, Curate and Barber
commended his resolution: and so having taken delight enough in <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi>
simplicitie, they planed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as before, in the Team, The Processioners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
into their former order, did prosecute their way: The Goat-heard took leave
of them all: The Troopers would not ride any farther; and therefore the Curate
satisfied them for the pains they had taken. The Canon intreated the Curate to let him
understand all that succeeded of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to wit, whether hee amended of his
frenzie or grew more distracted; and then hee took leave to continue his Journey.
Lastly, all of them departed, the Curate, Barber, <hi>Don-Quixote, Sancho Panca;</hi> and the
good <hi>Rozinante</hi> only remaining behinde: Then the Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

accommodated the Knight on a Bottle of Hay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and afterwards followed on in his
wonted slow manner, that way which the Curate directed. At the end of two dayes
they arrived to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Village, into which they entred about noon: this befell
on a Sunday, when all the People were in the Market stead, thorow the middle whereof
<hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Cart did passe: all of them drew neer to see what came in it, and when
they knew their Countrey man they were marvellously astonished: the whilest a little
Boy ran home before, to tell the old Wife and the Knights Niece, that their Lord and
Uncle was returned very lean, pale, disfigured, and stretcht all along on a bundle of
Hay.</p>
                     <p>It would have moved one to compassion, to have heard the lamentations and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
then rais'd by the two good Women, the blows they gave themselves, and the
curses and exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rations which they powred out against all Books of Knighthood; all
which was again renewed, when they saw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himself entred in at their doors.
At the news of this his arrivall <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi> Wife repaired also to get some tydings
of her goodman; for she had learned that he was gone away with the Knight, to
serve him as his Squire, and as soon as ever she saw her Husband, the question she asked
him was, whether the Asse were in health or no? <hi>Sancho,</hi> answered that he was come
in better health then his Master. God be thanked, quoth she, who hath done me so
great a favour: but tell me now, friend, What profit hast thou reaped by this thy
Squireship? What Peticoat hast thou brought me home? What Shoos for thy little
Boyes? I bring none of these things, good wife, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> although I bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of more moment and estimation. I am very glad of that, quoth his Wife,
shew me those things of more moment and estimation, good friend: for I would
sayne see them, to the end that this heart of mine may be cheered, which hath been
so swolne and sorrowfull, all the time of thine absence. Thou shalt see them at home,
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and therefore rest satisfied for this time; for and it please God, that

of one of the best in the World. I pray God, Husband, it may be so, (replyed she)
for we have very great need of it. But what means that Island? for I understand not the
word. Honey is not made for the Asses mouth, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> Wife thou shalt know
it in good time, yea, and shalt wonder, to hear the title of Ladyship given thee by all
thy Vassals. What is that thou speakest, <hi>Sancho,</hi> of Lordships, Islands, and Vassalls?
Answered <hi>Ioane Panca</hi> (for so was she called, although her Husband and she were not
Knisfolk; but by reason that in the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the Wives are usually called after their
Husbands Sirname) Doe not busie thy self, <hi>Ioane,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to know these things
on such a sudden; let it suffice that I tell thee the truth, and therewithall sow up thy
mouth. I will onely say thus much unto thee, as it were by the way, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World so pleasant, as for an honest man to be the Squire of a Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that seeks Adventures. It is very true, that the greatest number of Adventures
found out succeeded not to a mans satisfaction so much as he would desire: for of a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54746:146"/>
hundred that are incountred, the ninety and nine are wont to be crosse and untoward
ones; I know it by experience, for I have come away my self out of some of them well
canvassed, and out of others well beaten. But yet for all that, it is a fine thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
events, traverse Groves, search Woods, tread on Rocks, visit Castles, and lodge
in Innes at a mans pleasure, without paying the Devill a crosse.</p>
                     <p>All these Discourses passed between <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and his wife <hi>Ioane Panca,</hi> whilst
the old woman and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Niece did receive him, put off his clothes, and lay
him down in his ancient bed: he looked upon them very earnestly, and could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
where he was. The Curate charged the Niece to cherish her Uncle very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and that they should look well that he made not the third escape; relating at
large all the adoe that they had to bring him home. Here both the women renewed
their exclamations: their execreations of all Books of Knighthood here came to be rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated:
here they besought Heaven to throw down into the very Center of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
Pit, the out-cryes of so many lies and ravings: Finally, they remained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
and timorous, that they should lose again their Master and Uncle, as soon as
he was any thing recovered; and it befell just as they suspected: but the Authour of
this History, although he have with all diligence and curiosity inquired after the Acts
atcheived by <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in his third sally to seek Adventures, yet could he never
attaine (at least by authenticall Writings) to any notice of them: Only Fame hath
left in the memories of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> after his third escape, was at
<hi>Saragosa;</hi> and present at certain famous Justs made in that Citty; and that therein
befell him events most worthy of his valour and good wit: But of his end he could finde
nothing, nor ever should have known ought, if good fortune had not offered to his view
an old Phisician, who had in his custodie a leaden Box, which as hee affirmed, was
found in the ruines of an old Eremitage, as it was a repayring; in which Box were
certaine scroles of Parchment written with <hi>Gothicall</hi> Characters, but contayning <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
verses, which comprehended many of his Acts, and specified <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso</hi>
her beautie; decyphered <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and intreated of <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi> fidelitie; as also
of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Sepulchre, with sundry Epitaphs and Elogies of his Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and those that could bee read and copied out throughly, were those that are here
set downe by the faithfull Authour of this new and unmatched Relation: Which
Authour demands of the Readers no other guerdon, in regard of his huge travaile
spent in the search of all the old Records of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> for the bringing thereof
unto light, but that they will daigne to afford it as much credit as discreete men
are wont to give unto Bookes of Knighthood, which are of so great Reputation
now a dayes in the World; for herewith hee will rest most fully contented, and
satisfied; and withall encouraged to publish and seeke out for other Discourses,
if not altogether so true as this, at least of as great, both Invention and Recreation.
The first words written in the Scrole of Parchment, that was found in the leaden Box,
were these.

means to publish them; and also gives hope of a third Sallie made by <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow God defend, Reader, Noble or Plebeyan, what e're
thou art: how earnestly must thou needs by this
time expect this Prologue, supposing that thou must
finde in it nothing but Revenge, Brawling, and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Authour of the second <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> of
whom I only say as others say, that hee was begot
in <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> and borne in <hi>Tarragona?</hi> the truth is,
herein I mean not to give thee content. Let it bee never so generall a
Rule, that injuries awaken and rouze up choler in humble brests, yet in
mine must this Rule admit an exception: Thou, it may bee, wouldst
have me be-Asse him, be-Madman him, and be-Fool him; but no such
matter can enter into my thought; no, let his own Rod whip him; as
hee hath brewed, so let him bake; elsewhere hee shall have it: and yet
there is somewhat which I cannot but resent, and that is, that he expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
unto me my age and my mayme <hi>[He lost one of his hands]</hi> as if it had
been in my power to hold Time back, that so it should not passe upon
me, or if my mayme had befaln me in a Tavern, and not upon the most
famous occasion which either the ages past or present have seen, <hi>[At the
Battell of</hi> Lepanto] nor may the times to come look for the like: If my
Wounds shine not in the eyes of such as behold them; yet shall they be
esteemed at least in the judgement of such as know how they were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
A Souldier had rather bee dead in the Battell, then free by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away: And so is it with me, that should men set before me and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
an impossibilitie, I should rather have desired to have been in that
prodigious action, then now to bee in a whole skinne free from my skars
for not having been in it. The skars which a Souldier shews in his face
and brest, are starrs which lead others to the Haven of Honour, and to
the desire of just Praise: and besides it may bee noted, that it is not so
much mens Pens which write as their Judgements; and these use to be
better'd with yeers. Nor am I insensible of his calling me Envious,
and describing me as an ignorant. What Envie may be, I vow seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
that of those two sorts that are, I skill not; but of that Holy, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ingenious Envie, which being so, as it is, I have no meaning to
abuse any Priest; especially if he hath annexed unto him the title of <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAR</hi>
of the Inquisition: and if he said so, as it seems by this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Authour that hee did, he is utterly deceived; For I adore his Wit,
admire his Works, and his continuall virtuous imployment; and yet in
effect I cannot but thank this sweet Senior Authour, for saying that my
Novells are more Satyrick then Exemplar; and that yet they are good,
which they could not be, were they not so quite thorow. It seems thou
<pb facs="tcp:54746:150"/>
tellest me that I write somewhat limited and obscurely, and contain my
self within the bounds of my modestie, as knowing that a man ought not
add misery to him that is afflicted, which doubtlesse must needs bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great in this Senior, since he dares not appear in open Field in the
light, but conceals his Name, fains his Countey, as if hee had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
some Treason against his King. Well, if thou chance to light
upon him and know him, tell him from me, that I hold for my self no
whit agrieved at him; for I well know what the temptations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
are; and one of the greatest is, when hee puts into a mans head, that
he is able to compose and print a Book, whereby hee shall gain as much
Fame as Money, and as much Money as Fame: For confirmation
hereof, I intreat thee, when thou art disposed to be merry &amp; pleasant, to
tell him this Tale.</p>
                  <p>There was a Mad-man in <hi>Sevill</hi> which hit upon one of the prettiest
absurd tricks that ever Mad-man in this world lighted on; which was:
He made him a Cane sharp at one end, and then catching a Dogge in the
street, or elsewhere, he held fast one of the Doggs Leggs under his Foot,
and the other he held up with his hand. Then fitting his Cane as well
as he could behinde, he fell a blowing till he made the Dogge as round
as a Ball: and then, holding him still in the same manner, he gave him
two claps with his hand on the Belly, and so let him goe, saying to those
which stood by (which alwaies were many) How think you, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
Is it a small matter to blow up a Dogge like a Bladder? And
how think you is it a small matter to make a Book? If this Tale should
not fit him; then, good Reader, tell him this other; for this also is of a
Mad-man and a Dogge. In <hi>Cordova</hi> was another Mad-man, which was
wont to carry on his head a huge peece of Marble, not of the lightest,
who meeting a Masterlesse Dogge, would stalk up close to him; and on
a suddain down with his burden upon him: the Dogge would presently
yearn, and barking and yelling run away; three streets could not hold
him. It fell out afterwards among other Doggs (upon whom hee let
fall his load) there was a Cappers Dogge, which his Master made great
account of, upon whom he let down his great stone and took him full on
the head: the poor batter'd Curre cries pittifully: his Master spies it;
and affected with it, gets a meat-yard, assaults the Mad-man, and leaves
him not a whole bone in his skinne; and at every blow that he gave him
he cries out, Thou Dogge, Thou Thief, my Spaniell! Saw'st thou not,
thou cruell Villain, that my Dogge was a Spaniell? And ever and anon
repeating still his Spaniell, he sent away the Mad-man all black
and blue. The Mad-man was terribly skared herewith, but got
away, and for more then a moneth after never came abroad: At last
out he comes with his invention again, and a bigger load then before;
and comming where the Dogge stood, viewing him over and over again
very heedily, he had no minde, he durst not let goe the stone, but only
said, Take heed, this is a Spaniel. In fine whatsoever Doggs he met,
though they were Mastives or Fysting-Hounds, he still said they were
Spaniels. So that after that, he never durst throw his great stone any
<pb facs="tcp:54746:151"/>
more. And who knows but the same may befall this our Historian,
that he will no more let fall the prize of his wit in Books? for in being
naught, they are harder then Rocks: Tell him too, that for his mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
that with his Book he will take away all my gain, I care not a straw
for him; but betaking my self to the famous Interlude of <hi>Perendenga,</hi> I
answer him, Let the old man my Master live, and Christ be with us all.
Long live the great <hi>Conde de Lemos</hi> (whose Christianity and well
known Liberallitie against all the blows of my short Fortune keepes me
on foot) And long live that eminent Charitie of the Cardinall of <hi>Toledo,
Don Bernardo de Sandovaly Rojas.</hi> Were there no printing in the World,
or were there as many Books printed against me, as there are letters in
the Rimes of <hi>Mingo Revulgo,</hi> those two Princes without any solicitation
of flatterie, or any other kinde of applause, of their sole bounty have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon them to doe me good, and to favour me; wherein I account my
self more happy and rich, then if Fortune, by some other ordinary way,
had raised me to her highest Honour: a Poor man may have it, but a
Vicious man cannot: Povertie may cast a mist upon Noblenesse, but
cannot altogether obscure it; but, as the glimmering of any light of it
self, though but thorow narrow chinks and cranies, comes to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by high and Noble Spirits, and consequently favoured. Say no more
to him; nor will I say any more to thee; but only advertise that thou
consider that this second part of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> which I offer thee, is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the same Art, and cut out of the same Cloth that the first was:
in it I present thee with <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> enlarged, and at last dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that so no man presume to raise any farther reports of him; those that
are past are enow: and let it suffice that an honest man may have given
notice of these discreet follies, with purpose not to enter into them any
more. For plenty of any thing, though never so good, makes it lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed;
and scarcity (though of evill things) make them somewhat
accounted of, I forgot to tell thee that thou mayest expect <hi>Persiles,</hi>
which I am now about to finish; as also the second part of <hi>Galatea.</hi>

touching his infirmity.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ID Hamet Benengeli</hi> tels us in the second part of this History,
and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his third sally, that the Vicar and Barber
were almost a whole moneth without seeing him, because they
would not renew and bring to his remembrance things done
and past. Notwithstanding, they forbore not to visit his Neece
and the old woman, charging them they should be carefull to
cherish him, and to give him comforting meats to eat, good
for his heart and braine, from whence in likeli-hood all his ill
proceeded. They answered, that they did so, and would doe
it with all possible love and care: For they perceived that their Master continually
gave signes of being in his entire judgment; at which the two received great joy, and
thought they took the right course, when they brought him inchanted in the <hi>Oxe-Waine</hi>
(as hath been declared in the first part of this so famous, as punctuall History.)
So they determined to visit him, and make some triall of his amendment, which they
thought was impossible; and agreed not to touch upon any point of Knight Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
because they would not endanger the ripping up of a sore, whose stitches made
it yet tender.</p>
                     <p>At length they visited him, whom they found set up in his bed, clad in a Waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat
of green bayes, on his head a red <hi>Toledo</hi> bonet, so dried and withered up, as if
his flesh had been mommied. He welcommed them, and they asked him touching
his health: of it and himself he gave them good account, with much judgement and
elegant phrase, and in processe of discourse, they fell into State-matters, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Government, correcting this abuse, and condemning that; reforming one
custome, and rejecting another; each of the three making himself a new Law-maker,
a modern <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and a spick and span new <hi>Salon;</hi> and they so refined the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as if they had clapped it into a forge, and drawn it out in another fashion then
<pb facs="tcp:54746:154"/>
they had put it in. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in all was so discreet, that the two Examiners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
beleeved, he was quite well, and in his right minde. The Neece and the old
woman were present at this discourse, and could never give God thanks enough, when
they saw their Master with so good understanding: But the Vicar changing his first
intent, which was, not to meddle in matters of <hi>Cavallery,</hi> would now make a thorow
triall of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> perfect recovery; and so now and then tels him newes from
Court, and amongst others, that it was given out for certain, that the <hi>Turke</hi> was come
down with a powerfull Army, that his designe was not known, nor where such
a clowd would discharge it self: and that all <hi>Christendome</hi> was affrighted with this
terrour he puts us in with his yeerly <hi>Alarme:</hi> Likewise, that his Majesty had made
strong the coasts of <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Malta.</hi> To this (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
hath done like a most politique Warrior, in looking to his Dominions in time,
lest the enemy might take him at unawares: but if my counsaile might prevaile, I
would advise him to use a prevention, which he is farr from thinking on at present.
The Vicar scarse heard this, when he thought with himself; God defend thee, poor
<hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> for me thinkes thou fallest headlong from the high top of thy mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
into the profound bottome of thy simplicity. But the Barber presently being
of the Vicars minde, askes <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> what advice it was he would give? for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
(said he) it is such an one as may be put in the roll of those many idle ones
that are usually given to Princes. Mine, Good-man, Shaver (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
is no such. I spoke not to that intent (replyed the Barber) but that it is commonly
seen, that all or the most of your projects that are given to his Majesty, are either impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or frivolous, either in detriment of the King or Kingdome. Well, mine (quoth
<hi>Don-Qiuxote</hi>) is neither impossible, nor frivolous; but the plainest, the justest, the
most manageable and compendious, that may be contained in the thought of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectour.
Your are long a telling us it, Master <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> said the Vicar, I
would not (replyed he) tell it you heere now, that it should be earely to morrow
in the eares of some privy Councellour, and that another should reap the praise and
reward of my labour. For me (quoth the Barber) I passe my word, heer and before
God, to tell neither King nor Keisar, nor any earthly man what you say: an oath I
learnt out of the Ballad of the Vicar, in the Preface whereof he told the King of the
theef that robbed him of his two hundred double pistolets, and his gadding mule.
I know not your histories (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but I presume the oath is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Master Barber is an honest man. If he were not (said the Vicar) I would make it
good, and undertake for him upon paine of excommunication. And who shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for you. Master Vicar, (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?)</hi> My profession (answered he) which
is to keep counsaile. Body of me (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> is there any more to be done then,
but that the King cause proclamation to be made, that at a prefixed day, all the Knights
Errant that rove up and down <hi>Spaine,</hi> repaire to the Court? and if there came but
half a dozen, yet such an one there might be amongst them, as would destroy all the
<hi>Turkes</hi> power. Harken to me, Hoe, and let me take you with me: doe you think
it is strange, that one Knight Errant should conquer an army of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fighting men, as if all together had but one throat, or were made of sugar pellets?
But tell me, how many stories are full of those marvels? You should have brave
<hi>Don Belianis</hi> alive now, with a pox to me, for Ile curse no other; or some one of
that invincible linage of <hi>Amadis de Gaul:</hi> for if any of these were living at this day,
and should affront the <hi>Turke,</hi> I faith I would not be in his coat: but God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for his people, and send some one, if not so brave a Knight Errant as those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
yet at least that shall not be inferiour in courage; and God knowes my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and I say no more Alasse (quoth the Neece at this instant) hang me, if my master
have not a desire to turne Knight Errant againe. Then cryed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I must
die so, march the <hi>Turke</hi> up and down when he will, and as powerfully as he can, I say
again, God knowes my meaning. Then said the Barber, Good Sirs, give me leave to
tell you a brief tale of an accident in <hi>Sevill,</hi> which because it fals out so pat, I must tell it.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was willing, the Vicar and the rest gave their attention, and thus he began.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:54746:154"/>In the house of the mad-men at <hi>Sevil,</hi> there was one put in there by his kindred, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him of his lost wits, he was a Bachelour of Law, graduated in the Canons at <hi>Osuna,</hi>
and though hee had beene graduated at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> yet (as many are of opinon) hee
would have beene mad there too; this Bachelour after some yeeres imprisonment,
made it appeare that hee was well and in his right wits, and to this purpose writes
to the Arch-Bishop, desiring him earnestly, and with forcible reasons, to deliver him
from that misery in which hee lived, since by Gods mercy, hee had now recovered his
lost understanding: and that his kindred, onely to get his wealth, had kept him there,
&amp; so meant to hold him still wrongfully till his death. The Arch-Bishop, induced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sensible and discreet lines of his, commanded one of his Chaplaines to informe
himself from the Rector of the house, of the truth; and to speak also with the mad man,
that if hee perceived hee was in his wits, hee should give him his liberty. The
Chaplain did this; and the Rector said that the party was still mad, that although he had
sometimes fair intermissions, yet in the end hee would grow to such a raving, as might
equall his former discretion (as he told him) hee might perceive by discoursing with
him. The Chaplain would needs make tryall; and coming to him, talked with him an
hour or more; and in all that time the Mad-man never gave him a cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e nor wilde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but rather spoke advisedly, that the Chaplain was forced to beleeve him to bee
sensible enough: and amongst the rest hee told him, the Rector had an inkling against
him, because hee would not lose his Kindreds Presents, that hee might say he was Mad
by fits: Withall hee said, that his Wealth was the greatest wrong to him in his evill
Fortune, since to enjoy that, his enemies defrauded him, and would doubt of Gods
mercie to him that had turned him from a Beast to a Man. Lastly, hee spoke so well
that hee made the Rector to bee suspected, and his Kindred thought covetous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
persons, and himself so discreet, that the Chaplain determined to have him with
him, that the Arch-Bishop might see him and bee satisfied of the truth of the businesse.
With this good belief the Chaplain required the Rector to give the Bachelor the clothes
he brought with him thither. Who replyed, desiring him to consider what he did, for
that the partie was still mad. But the Rectors advice prevailed nothing with the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
to make him leave him; so hee was forced to give way to the Arch-Bishops Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and to give him his apparell, which was new and handsome. And when the Mad man
saw himself civilly clad, and his Mad-mans weeds off; hee requested the Chaplain
that in charity hee would let him take his leave of the Mad-men his Companions. The
Chaplain told him that hee would likewise accompanie him, and see the Mad-men that
were in the house. So up they went, and with them some others there present; and
the Bachelor being come to a kinde of Cage, where an outragious Mad-man lay
(although as then still and quiet) hee said, Brother, if you will command me ought, I
am going to my house; for now it hath pleased God of his infinite goodnesse and
mercy, without my desert to bring me to my right minde: I am now well and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
for unto Gods power nothing is impossible: Bee of good comfort; trust in
him, that since hee hath turned me to my former estate, hee will doe the like to you, if
you trust in him. I will bee carefull to send you some dainty to eat, and by any means
eat it; for let me tell you what I know by experience, that all our madnesse proceeds
from the emptinesse of our Stomacks, that fills our Brains with aire. Take heart, take
heart; for this dejecting in misery lessens the health, and hastens death. Another Mad man
in a Cage over against, heard all the Bachelors discourse, and raysing himself upon
an old Matresse, upon which hee lay stark naked, asked aloud, who it was that was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away sound and in his wits. The Bachelor replied; It is I, brother, that am going:
for I have no need to stay here any longer; for which I render infinite thanks to God
that hath done me so great a favour. Take heed what you say, Bachelor, replyed the
Mad-man; let not the Devill deceive you; keep still your foot, and bee quiet here at
home, and so you may save a bringing back. I know (quoth the Bachelor) I am well; and
shal need to walk no more stations hither. You are well, said the Mad-man: the event will
try: God be with you; but I swear to thee by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whose Majesty I represent on earth,
that for this dayes offence I will eat up all <hi>Sevill</hi> for delivering thee from hence, and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:155"/>
saving thou art in thy wits, I will take such a punishment on this City as shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Knowest not thou, poor Rascall Bachelor, that I
can doe it, since (as I say) I am thundring <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that carry in my hands the scorching
bolts, with which I can, and use to threaten and destroy the World? But in one thing
only will I chastise this ignorant Town; which is, That for three yeers together there
shall fall no rain about it, nor the Liberties thereof, counting from this time and instant
hence forward, that this threat hath been made. Thou free? thou sound? thou wise?
and I mad, I sick, I bound? as sure will I rain as I mean to hang my self. The stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by gave attention to the Mad-man: but our Bachelor turning to the Chaplain,
and taking him by the hand, said, Bee not afraid Sir, nor take any heed to this Mad mans
words: for if hee bee <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and will not rain; I that am <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Father
and God of the Waters, will rain as oft as I list, and need shall require. To which
(quoth the Chaplain) Nay, Master <hi>Neptune,</hi> it were not good angring Master <hi>Iupiter:</hi>
I pray stay you here still, and some other time, at more leisure and oportunity wee
will return for you again. The Rector and standers by began to laugh, and the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
grew to be half abashed: the Bachelor was unclothed, there remained; and there
the Tale ends.</p>
                     <p>Well; is this the Tale, Master Barber (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> that because it fell out
so pat you could not but relate it? Ah, goodman Shavester, goodman Shavester! I am
not <hi>Neptune</hi> God of the Waters, neither care I who thinks me a wise man (I being
none) only I am troubled to let the world understand the errour it is in, in not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that most happy Age, in which the Order of <hi>Knight Erranty</hi> did flourish: But
our depraved times deserve not to enjoy so great a happinesse as former Ages, when
Knights Errant undertook the defence of Kingdomes, the protection of Damzels, the
succouring of Orphanes, the chastising the Proud, the reward of the humble. Most of
your Knights now-a-daies are such as russle in their silks, their cloth of gold and silver,
and such rich stuffs as these they weare rather then Maile, with which they should arme
themselves: You have no Knight now that will lye upon the bare ground subject to the
rigour of the aire armed <hi>Cap a pie:</hi> None now that upright on his styrrops, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his Launce, strives to behead-sleep (as they say your Knights Errant did:) You
have none now, that comming out of this Wood, enters into that Mountain, and from
thence tramples over a barren and desart shoare of the Sea, most commonly stormy and
unquiet; and finding at the brink of it some little Cock-boat, without Oares, Sail,
Mast, or any kinde of Tackling, casts himself into it with undaunted courage, yeelds
himself to the implacable waves of the deep Main that now tosse him as high as heaven,
and then cast him as low as Hell, and hee exposed to the inevitable tempest when hee
least dreams of it, findes himself at least three thousand leagues distant from the place
where hee embarqued himself; and leaping on a remote and unknown shoare, lights
upon successes worthy to bee written in brasse, and not parchment: But now sloth
triumphs upon industrie, idlenesse on labour, vice on virtue, persumption on valour,
the Theorie on the Practice of Armes, which only lived and shined in those golden
Ages and in those Knights Errant: If not, tell me, who was more virtuous, more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
then the renowned <hi>Amadis de Gaule?</hi> more discreet then <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England?</hi>
more affable and free then <hi>Tirante</hi> the <hi>White?</hi> more gallant then <hi>Lisuart</hi> of <hi>Greece?</hi>
a greater hackster, or more hacked then <hi>Don Belianis?</hi> more undaunted then <hi>Perian</hi> of
<hi>Gaule?</hi> who a greater undertaker of dangers then <hi>Felismarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania?</hi> who more
sincere then <hi>Esplandian?</hi> who more courteous then <hi>Don Cierongilio</hi> of <hi>Thracia?</hi> who
more fierce then <hi>Rodomant?</hi> who wiser then King <hi>Sobrinus?</hi> who more couragious
then <hi>Renaldo?</hi> who more invincible then <hi>Roldan?</hi> who more comely or more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
then <hi>Rogero?</hi> from whom the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> at this day are descended (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Turpin</hi> in his Cosmographie.) All these Knights and many more (Master
Vicar) that I could tell you, were Knights Errant, the very light and glorie of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
These, or such as these, are they I wish for, which if it could bee, his Majestie
would bee well served, and might save a great deal of expence, and the Turk might goe
shake his eares: And therefore let me tell you, I scorn to keep my house, since the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54746:155"/>
Chaplaine delivers me not, and his <hi>Iupiter</hi> (as goodman Barber talkes) raines not;
here am I that will raigne when I list: this I speak that goodman Bason may know I
understand him.</p>
                     <p>Truly Mr. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (said the Barber) I spoke it not to that end, and so helpe
me God, as I meane well, and you ought not to resent any thing. I know well enough
whether I ought or no Sir, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Then (quoth the Vicar) well, goe
to; I have not spoken a word hitherto, I would not willingly remaine with one scruple
which doth grate and gnaw upon my Conscience, sprung from what Master <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi>
hath here told us. For this and much more you have full liberty, good Master Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
(said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and therefore tell your scruple, for sure it is no pleasure to
continue with a scrupulous conscience. Under correction (quoth the Vicar) this it is,
I can by no meanes be perswaded that all that Troop of Knights Errant which you na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
were ever true and really persons of flesh and bone in this world: I rather ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
all is fiction, tales and lies, or dreames set downe by men waking, or to say
trulyer, by men halfe and lies, or dreames set downe by men waking, or to say
trulyer, by men halfe a sleepe: There's another error (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> into
which many have falln, who beleeve not that there have beene such Knights in the
world: and I my selfe many times in divers companies, and upon severall occasions,
have laboured to shew this common mistake, but somtimes have fayled in my purpose,
at others not; supporting it upon the shoulders of Truth, which is so infallible, that I
may say, that with these very eyes I have beheld <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> who was a goodly
tall man, well complexioned, had a broad Beard, and black, an equall countenance
betwixt milde and sterne, a man of small discourse, slow to anger, and soone appeased;
and just as I have delineated <hi>Amadis,</hi> I might in my judgement paint and decipher out
as many Knights Errant, as are in all the Histories of the World; for by apprehending,
they were such as their Histories report them, by their exploits they did, and their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
their features, colours and Statures, may in good Philosophy be guessed at.
How big deere Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (quoth the Barber) might Gyant <hi>Morgante</hi> be?
Touching Gyants (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> there bee different opinions whether there
have beene any or no in the world: but the holy Scripture, which cannot erre a jot in
the truth, doth shew us plainly that there were, telling us the story of that huge Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
<hi>Golias,</hi> that was seven cubits and a halfe high, which is an unmeasurable greatnesse.
Besides, in the Isle of <hi>Sicillia,</hi> there have beene found shanke-bones and shoulder-bones
so great, that their bignesse shewed their owners to have beene Gyants, and as huge as
high Towers, which Geometry will make good. But for all this, I cannot easily tell
you how big <hi>Morgante</hi> was, though I suppose he was not very tall; to which opinion
I incline, because I finde in his History, where there is particular mention made of his
Acts, that many times hee lay under a Roofe; and therefore, since hee found an House
that would hold him, 'tis plaine hee could not bee of extraordinary bignesse. Tis true
(quoth the Vicar) who delighting to heare him talke so wildly, asked him what hee
thought of the faces of <hi>Renaldo</hi> of <hi>Mont-alban, Don Roldan</hi> and the rest of the twelve
Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> who were all Knights Errant. For <hi>Renaldo</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
I dare boldly say, hee was broad faced, his complexion high, quick and full eyed, very
exceptious and extremely cholerick, a lover of theeves and debaucht company. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Rolando,</hi> or <hi>Rotolando,</hi> or <hi>Orlando,</hi> for Histories afford him all these names, I am of
opinion, and affirme that hee was of a meane stature, broad-shouldred, somewhat bow
legged, abourne Bearded, his body hayrie, and his lookes threatning, dull of discourse,
but affable and well behaved. If <hi>Orlando</hi> (said the Vicar) was so sweet a youth as you
describe him, no marvell though the faire <hi>Angelica</hi> disdained him, and left him, for
the handsome, briske and conceited beard-budding <hi>Medor,</hi> and that she had rather
have his softnesse then tothers roughnesse. That <hi>Angelica</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> was a
light houswife, a gadder and a wanton, and left the world as full of her fopperies, as
the reports of her beauty: shee despised a thousand Knights, a thousand both vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and discreet, and contented her selfe with a poore beardlesse Page, without more
wealth or honour, then what her famous Singer <hi>Ariosto</hi> could give her, in token of
his thankfullnesse to his friends love, either because hee durst not in this respect, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:54746:156"/>
hee would not chaunt what befell this Lady, after her base prostitution, for sure
her carriage was not very honest: So he left her when he said,
<q>
                           <l>And how <hi>Catayaes</hi> Scepter shee had at will,</l>
                           <l>Perhaps some one will write with better quill.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And undoubtedly this was a kinde of Prophesie, for Poets are called <hi>Vates,</hi> that is,
Sooth-sayers: and this truth hath been cleerely seene, for since that time, a famous
<hi>Andaluzian</hi> Poet wept, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and sung her teares: and another famous and rare Poet of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile</hi>
her beautie. But tell mee Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (quoth the Barber) was there ever
any Poet that wrote a Satyre against this faire Lady, amongst those many that have
written in her praise? I am well perswaded (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> that if <hi>Sacripant</hi> or
<hi>Orlando</hi> had beene Poets, they had trounced the Damozell: for it is an ordinary thing
amongst Poets once disdayned, or not admitted by their fayned Mistrisses (fayned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
because they fayne they love them) to revenge themselves with Satyres and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells;
a revenge truly unworthy noble Spirits: But hitherto I have not heard of any
infamatory verse against the Lady <hi>Angelica,</hi> that hath made any hurly burly in the
world. Strange quoth the Vicar! With that they might heare the Neece and the Old
woman (who were before gone from them) keep a noyse without in the Court: so
they went to see what was the matter.</p>

the Barber heard, was of the Neece and the old woman, that were
rating <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that strove with them for entrance to see <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
who kept dore against him. What will this blood-hound
have here? said they, Get you home to your own house, for you
are he and none else, that doth distract and ring-lead our Master,
and carry him astray. To which (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> Woman of Satan, I am hee that is
distracted, ring-led, and carried astray, and not your Master: t'was he that led me
up and downe the world, and you deceive your selves and understand by halves: hee
drew me from my house with his cony-catching, promising mee an Island, which I
yet hope for. A plague of your Islands (replied the Neece) cursed <hi>Sancho:</hi> and what
be your Islands? is it any thing to eat, good-man glutton, you cormorant, as you
are? 'Tis not to eat (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> but to rule and governe, better then foure
Citties, or foure of the Kings Judges. For all that (said the old woman) you come
not in heer, you bundle of mischiefe and sacke of wickednesse, get you home and
governe there, and sow your graine, and leave seeking after Islands or Dilands. The
Vicar and the Barber tooke great delight to heare this Dialogue betweene the three:
But <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> fearing lest <hi>Sancho</hi> should out with all, and should blunder out a
company of mallcious fooleries, or should touch upon poynts that might not be for
his reputation, he called him to him, and commanded the women to be silent, and to
let him in. <hi>Sancho</hi> entred, and the Vicar and Barber tooke leave of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> of
whose recovery they dispaired, seeing how much he was bent upon his wilde thoughts,
and how much he was besotted with his damned Knights Errant. So (quoth the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
to the Barber) you shall quickly, Gossip, perceive, when we least think of it, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54746:156"/>
our Gallant takes his flight againe by the river. No doubt (said the Barber) but I
wonder not so much at the Knights madnesse, as the Squires simplicity, that beleeves
so in the Islands, and I think all the Art in the world will not drive that out of his
noddle. God mend them (said the Vicar) and let us expect what issue the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of this Knight and Squires absurdities will have: for it seemes they were both
framed out of one forge, as it were, for the Masters madnes without the Servants folly,
is not worth a chip. 'Tis true (said the Barber) and I should bee glad to know
their present discourse. I warrant (said the Vicar) the Neece and old woman will
tell us all when they have done, for they are not so mannerly as not to harken. In the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,
Don-Quixote</hi> locked in <hi>Sancho,</hi> and thus discoursed with him: I am very sorry,
<hi>Sancho,</hi> you should affirme and make good, that I was hee that drew you from your
dog-hole cottage, knowing that I willingly left mine, a Palace in comparison; we
went out joyntly, so we marched on, and so we held our whole peregrination; both of
us having undergone the same lot, the same fortune; and if once thou wast tossed in
a Blanket, I have been hanged an hundred times, and herein have I the advantage of
thee. Why, it was very fit (answered <hi>Sancho)</hi> for (as you hold) misfortunes are
more annexed to Knights Errant then to their Squires. Thou art deceived, <hi>Sancho,</hi>
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> for according to the saying, <hi>Quando caput dolet,</hi> &amp;c. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
no other language but mine owne, said <hi>Sancho.</hi> Why I mean (replied <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
that when the head akes, all the body is out of tune: so that I being thy
Lord and Master, am thy head, and thou a part of me, since thou art my servant, in
which respect, the ill that toucheth me, must concerne and grieve thee, and so thine
me. Indeed (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> it ought to be so: but when I was tossed in the Blanket,
my head stood aloof, like a part, beholding me fly in the aire, without any feeling my
grief, and since the members are bound to suffer for the head, the head in requitall
should also suffer for them. You mean, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> that I had no
feeling of your being tossed? And if you mean so, doe not, neither imagine any such
thing: for at that time, I was more vext in spirit, then thou couldst be in body: but
leave we this for the present: for we shall have leisure to consider and rectifie it: and
tell me, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> what say the common people of me? In what estimation doe
the Gentlemen hold me? In what the Knights and Gallants? What say they of my
valour? What of my exployts? What of my affability? What discourse they touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my plot in raising and restoring to the world, the long forgotten order of Knight
Errantry? To conclude, I would have thee tell me all that thou hast heard: and you
must tell me, without adding to my praise, or diminishing my dispraise, for it is the
part of loyall servants, to tell the naked truth to their Masters, in its native colour,
without increasing it by flattery, or diminishing it for any other vain respect; And I
would have thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> learne by the way, that if the naked truth should come to
the eares of Princes, without the apparrell of flattery, we should have another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of world, and other ages would be called iron, and not ours, and this would be the
golden age. And let me advise thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that well and discreetly thou tell me the
truth of what thou knowest, concerning my demand. I shall with a very good will,
Sir, (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> upon condition that you shall not be angry at what I shall tell
you, since you will have the naked truth, without any other clothing then what I have
seen her with. By no means will I be angry (answered <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> thou mayst
speake freely, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and without any disguise. Why then, first of all I must tell
you, the common people hold you for a notable mad-man, and that I am no lesse

but three or foure acres of land, and a rag before, and another behinde. The
Knights say, they would not have your poor Squires be ranked with them, that clout
their owne shooes, and take up a stitch in their owne blacke stockings with green silke.
That concerns not me (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> for thou seest that I goe alwaies well
clad, and never patcht: indeed a little torne sometimes, but more with my armour,
then by long wearing.</p>

Concerning your valour (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> your affability, your exploits, and your
plot, there bee different opinions: Some say you are a mad man but a merry one; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that you are valiant but, withall, unfortunate; a third sort, that you are affable
but impertinent: and thus they descant upon us, that they leave neither you nor mee a
sound bone. Why looke thou <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> wheresoever virtue is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
it is persecuted; few or none of those brave <hi>Hero's</hi> that have lived, have scaped
malicious calumniation. <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that most couragious, most wise, most valiant
Captaine, was noted to bee ambitious, and to bee somwhat slovenly in his apparell
and his conditions. <hi>Alexander,</hi> who for his exploits obtayned the title of <hi>Great,</hi> is
said to have beene given to drunkennesse: <hi>Hercules,</hi> hee with his many labours, was
said to have beene lascivious and a Striker. <hi>Don Galaor,</hi> brother to <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi>
was grudged at for being offensive; and his brother for a Sheep-biter. So that <hi>Sancho,</hi>
since so many worthy men have beene calumniated, I may well suffer mine, if it have
beene no more then thou tellest mee. Why, there's the quiddity of the matter; Body
of my Father, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Was there any more said then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>
There's more behinde yet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to this: But if you will know all concerning these calumnies, I'le bring you one
hither by and by that shall tel um you all without missing a scrap; for last night <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew
Carrascoes</hi> sonne arived, that comes from studie from <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
Batchelour, and as I went to bid him welcome home, hee told mee that your
Historie was in print, under the Title of the most ingenious Gentleman <hi>Don-Quixote
de la Mancha;</hi> and hee tells mee that I am mentioned too, by mine owne name of
<hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> is in too, and other matters that passed betwixt
us, at which I was amazed, and blessed my selfe how the Historian that wrote them
could come to the knowledge of them. Assute thee <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> the
Authour of our Historie is some sage Enchanter: for such are not ignorant of all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
they write, Well (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> if hee were wise and an Enchanter, I will tell
you according as <hi>Samstn Carrasco</hi> told mee, for that's the mans name that spoke
with mee, that the Authors name of this Historie is <hi>Cid Hamete Beregena [it should bee</hi>
Benengeli, <hi>but</hi> Sancho <hi>simply mistakes, as followeth in the next note.]</hi> That is the name
of a Moore, (said <hi>Don-Quixotes.)</hi> It is very like (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> for your Moors
are great lovers of <hi>Berengens,</hi> [Berengena <hi>is a fruit in</hi> Spayne <hi>which they boyle with sod
meate, as wee doe Carrats, and here was</hi> Sanchoes <hi>simplicitie in mistaking, and to thinke
that name was given to the Author for loving the fruit.] Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
you are out in the Moores Sirname; which is <hi>Cid Hamete Benengeli:</hi> And <hi>Cid</hi> in the
Arabicke signifieth <hi>Lord.</hi> It may bee so (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> but if you will have the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelour

shalt doe mee a speciall pleasure, for I am in suspence with what thou hast told mee,
and will not eate a bit till I am informed of all. Well, I goe for him (said <hi>Sancho)</hi>
And leaving his Master in that his suspence, went for the Batchelour, with whom
in a very short time after hee returned, and the three had a passing pleasant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>

                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ON-QVIXOTE</hi> was monstrous pensative, expecting the Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
<hi>Carrasco,</hi> from whom hee hoped to heare the news of himselfe in
print (as <hi>Sancho</hi> had told him) and hee could not bee perswaded
that there was such a Historie, since yet the blood of Enemies, killed
by him, was scarce dry upon his Sword-blade, and would they have
his noble Acts of Chivalry already in the Presse? Notwithstanding,
hee thought that some wise man, or friend, or enemy, by way of
Enchantment, had committed them to the Presse: If a friend, then to extoll him for
the most remarkable of any Knight Errant: If an Enemy, to annihilate them, and clap
um beneath the basest and meanest that ever were mentioned of any inferiour Squire,
although (thought hee to himselfe) no Acts of Squire were ever divulged: but if
there were any History, being of a Knight Errant, it must needes bee lofty and stately,
famous, magnificent and true. With this hee comforted himselfe somewhat, but began
to bee discomforted, to thinke that his Author must bee a Moore, by reason of that
name of <hi>Cid:</hi> and from Moores there could be no truth expected; for all of them are
Cheaters Impostors and Chymists.</p>
                     <p>Hee feared likewise that he might treat of his Love with some indecencie, that might
redound to the lessening and prejudice of his Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso's</hi> honesty, hee
desired that hee might declare his constancie and the decorum that hee had ever kept
toward her, contemning Queens and Empresses, and Damsels of all sorts, keeping
distance with violencies of naturall motions. <hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Carrasco</hi> found him thus tossed
and turmoyled in these and many such like imaginations, whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> received
with much courtesie.</p>
                     <p>This Bachelor, though his name was <hi>Samson,</hi> was not very tall, but a notable Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halter,
lean-faced, but of a good understanding: hee was about four and twenty yeers
of age, round-faced, flat-nosed, and wide-mouthed, all signes of a malicious disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a friend to conceits and merriment, as hee shewed it when hee saw <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
for hee fell upon his knees before him, saying, Good Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
give me your Greatnesse his hand; for by the habit of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which I weare, you
are, Sir, one of the most compleat Knights Errant, that hath been or shall bee upon
the roundnesse of the earth. Well fare <hi>Cid Hamete Benengeli,</hi> that left the stories of
your Greatnesse to Posterity, and more then well may that curious Authour fare, that
had the care to cause them to bee translated out of the Arabick into our vulgar Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
to the generall entertainment of all men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made him rise and said; Then it seems my History is extant, and that
hee was a Moor and a wise man that made it. So true it is (quoth <hi>Samson)</hi> that upon
my knowledge, at this day there bee printed above twelve thousand copies of your
History: if not, let <hi>Portugall, Barcelona,</hi> and <hi>Valencia</hi> speak, where they have been
printed; and the report goes that they are now printing at <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and I have a
kinde of ghesse, that there is no Nation or Language where they will not bee tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated.
One of the things then (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> that ought to give a man virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and eminent content in, is, to see himself living, and to have a good name from
every bodies mouth, to bee printed and in the Presse: I said with a good name; for
otherwise no death could bee equalled to that life. If it bee for good name (said the
Bachelour) your Worship carries the prize from all Knights Errant: For the Moor
in his language, and the Christian in his, were most curefull to paint to the life, your
Gallantry, your great Courage in attempting of Dangers, your Patience in Adversities.
<pb facs="tcp:54746:158"/>
and your Sufferance, as well in Misfortunes as in your Wounds, your Honestie and
Constancie in the <hi>so Platonick</hi> Loves of your self and my Ladie <hi>Donna Dulcinea del
Toboso.</hi> I never (replyed <hi>Sancho)</hi> heard my Lady stiled <hi>Don</hi> before, only the Ladie
<hi>Dulcinea del Toboso;</hi> and there the History erreth somewhat. This is no objection of
moment (said <hi>Carasco.)</hi> No truly (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:)</hi> But tell me, Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Bachelor, which of the exploits of mine are most ponderous in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie?</p>
                     <p>In this (said the Bachelor) there be different opinions, as there be different tastes:
Some delight in the Adventure of the Winde-Mills, that you took to bee Briareans and
Gyants: Others in that of the Fulling-hammers: This man in the description of the
two Armies, which afterwards fell out to bee two Flocks of Sheep: That man doth
extoll your Adventure of the dead man that was carried to bee buried at <hi>Segovia:</hi> One
saith that that of the freeing of the Gally-Slaves goes beyond them all: Another, that
none comes neer that of the Benitian Gyants, with the combat of the valourous Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayner.
Tell me (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> Sir Bachelor, comes not that in of the <hi>Yanguesian</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,
when our precious <hi>Rozinante</hi> longed for the forbidden fruit? The wise man (said
<hi>Samson)</hi> left out nothing, hee sets down all most punctually, even to the very capers
that <hi>Sancho</hi> fetcht in the blanket. Not in the blanket (replyed <hi>Sancho)</hi> but in the aire
more then I was willing.</p>
                     <p>According to my thought (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> there is no humane History in the
World that hath not his changes, especially those that treat of Cavallery, which can
never bee full of prosperous successes. For all that (replied the Bachelor) there bee
some that have read your History, that would bee glad the Authors had omitted some
of those infinite bastings that in divers incounters were given to Sir <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
I, there (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> comes in the truth of the Story. They might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in equity silence them (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> since those actions that neither change
nor alter the truth of the Story are best left out, if they must redound to the misprizing
of the chief person of the Historie. <hi>Aeneas</hi> yfaith was ne'er so pittifull as <hi>Virgill</hi> paints
him out; Nor <hi>Vlisses</hi> so subtill as <hi>Homer</hi> describes him. True it is (said <hi>Samson)</hi> but
it is one thing to write like a Poet, and another like an Historian: the Poet may say
or sing things; not as they were, but as they ought to have been: And the Historian
must write things, not as they ought to bee, but as they have been, without adding or
taking away ought from the truth.</p>
                     <p>Well, (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> if you goe to telling of truths, wee shall finde that this Signior
Moor hath all the bastings of my Master and mee; for I am sure they never took mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Worships shoulders, but they took it of all my body too: but no marvell;
for as my Master himself saith, the rest of the parts must participate of the heads grief.
<hi>Sancho,</hi> you are a Crack-rope (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:)</hi> yfaith you want no memory,
when you list to have it. If I would willingly forget those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Peace <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
and interrupt not the Bachelour, whom I request to proceed; and tell me, what is said
of me in the mentioned History. And of me too (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> for it is said that I am
one of the principall Parsonages of it. Personages, and not Parsonages, you would say
<hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Samson.)</hi> More correcting of words (quoth <hi>Sancho?)</hi> Goe to this,
and wee shall not end in our life time. Hang me <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Samson)</hi> if you bee not
the second person in the Story; and you have some that had as lieve hear you speake
as the best there; though others would not stick to say, you were too credulous, to
beleeve that your government of the Island offered by Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> here present,
might bee true.</p>
                     <p>There is yet Sun-shine upon the walls (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and when <hi>Sancho</hi> comes
to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of more yeers, with the experience of them hee will bee more able and fit then
now, to bee a Governour. By the Masse (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> if I bee not fit to Govern an
Island at these yeers, I shall never Govern, though I come to bee as old as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusalem;</hi>
the mischief is, that the said Island is delaid I know not how, and not that I
want brain to Govern it. Leave all to God <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> for all will be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54746:158"/>
well, and perhaps better then you think for; and the leaves in the Tree move not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the will of God.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeede (said <hi>Samson)</hi> for if God will, <hi>Sancho</hi> shall not want a thousand
Ilands, much lesse one: I have seene (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> of your Governours in the world,
that are not worthy to wipe my shooes, and for all this, they give um titles, and are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in Plate. Those are not Governours of Islands (replyed <hi>Samson)</hi> but of other
easier Governments; for they that governe Islands, must bee at least <hi>Grammarians.</hi>
For your Gra, I care not, but your Mare I could like well enough; but leaving this
government to Gods hands, let him place me where he pleaseth: I say, Sir Bachelour
<hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> that I am infinitely glad that the Author of the History hath spoken
of me, in such sort that the things he speakes of me, doe not cloy the Reader, for by
the faith of a Christian, if he had spoken any thing of mee not befitting an old Christian
as I am, <hi>[In Spanish</hi> Christiano vieio <hi>a name they desire to be distinguisht from the
Moores by:]</hi> I should make deafe men hear on't. That were to work miracles, said <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
Miracles or not miracles (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> every man look how he speaks or writes
of men, and set not down each thing that comes into his noddle in a mingle-mangle.
One of the faults that they say (said <hi>Carrasco)</hi> is in that History, is this; that his
Author put in it a certaine Novell or Tale, intitled the <hi>Curious Impertinent,</hi> not that
it was ill, or not well contrived, but that it was unseasonable for that place, neither
had it any thing to doe with the History of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ile hold a wager (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> the Dog-bolt hath made a Gallimawfry. Let me
tell you (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> the Authour of my storie is not wise, but some ignorant
Prater, that at unawares and without judgement undertook it, hab-nab, as <hi>Orbaneja</hi>
the Painter of <hi>Vbeda,</hi> who being asked what hee Painted? answered, As it happens;
sometimes hee would paint yee a Cock, but so unlike that hee was forced to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneth
it in Gothish letters, <hi>This is a Cock:</hi> and thus I beleeve it is with my History,
that it hath need of a Coment to make it understood.</p>
                     <p>No surely (replied <hi>Samson)</hi> it is so conspicuous and so void of difficultie, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
may handle him, Youths may read him, Men may understand him, and old men
may celebrate him: To co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>clude, hee is so gleaned, so read, and so known to all sorts
of People that they scarce see a lean horse passe by, when they say, <hi>There goeth Rozin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante:</hi>
And amongst these Pages are most given to read him: You have no great mans
withdrawing room that hath not a <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in him; some take him, if others lay
him down; these close with him; they demand him: Lastly, the Story is the most
pleasing, the least hurtfull for entertainment that hath hitherto been seen; for all over
it, there is not to be seen a dishonest word, or one like one; nor an imagination lesse
then Catholique.</p>
                     <p>Hee that should write otherwise (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> should write no truths, but
lies; and hee that doth so, ought to bee burned, like them that coyne false money; and
I know not what the Authour meant to put in Novels and strange Tales, my Storie
affording him matter enough; belike hee holds himself to the Proverb of Chaff and
Hay, &amp;c. Well, I'le tell you, out of mentioning only my thoughts, my sighs, my tears,
my honest wishes, and my on-sets, hee might have made a greater volume then all <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>status</hi>
Works. Indeed, Signior Bachelor, all that I conceive, is, that to write a History
or any other Work of what sort soever, a man had need of a strong judgement and a
ripe understanding: To speak wittily and write conceits, belongs only to good wits:
The cunningest part in a Play is the Fools; because hee must not bee a Fool that would
well counterfeit to seem so. An History is as a sacred thing, which ought to bee true
and reall; and where truth is, there God is, in as much as concerneth truth; howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
you have some that doe so compose and cast their Works from them, as if they
were Fritters.</p>
                     <p>There is no booke so bad (said the Bachelour) that hath not some good in it. No
doubt of that (said <hi>Don-Quixote:)</hi> but many times it fals out, that those that have
worthily hoorded up, and obtained great fame by their writings, when they commit
them to the Presse, they either altogether lose it, or in something lessen it. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:54746:159"/>
of it (quoth <hi>Samson)</hi> is this, that as the printed workes are viewed by leisure, their
faults are easily espied, and they are so much the more pried into, by how much the
greater the Authors fame is: Men famous for their wits, great Poets, illustrious Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
are alwaies, or for the most part envied by them that have a pleasure and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
pastime to judge of other mens writings, without publishing their owne. That's
not to be wondred at (cries <hi>Don-Quixote?)</hi> for there be many Divines that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth in a Pulpit, and are excellent in knowing the defect or excesse of him that
preacheth. All this (said <hi>Carrasco</hi>) Sir <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Qiuxote</hi> is right, but I could wish such
Censurers were more milde and lesse scrupulous, in looking on the moates of the most
cleere sunne of his workes whom they bite; for if <hi>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus,</hi>
let them consider how much hee watched to shew the light of his worke, without the
least shadow that might bee; and it might bee, that what seemes ill to them, were
Moles, that somtimes increase the beautie of the Face that hath them; and thus,
I say, that hee that prints a Booke, puts himselfe into a manifest danger, being of
all impossibilities the most impossible to frame it so that it may content and satisfie all
that read it.</p>
                     <p>The Booke that treats of mee (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> will please very few: Rather
contrarie (saies <hi>Samson)</hi> for as <hi>Stultorum infinitus est numerus,</hi> an infinite number
have beene delighted with this History, but some found fault, and craftilie taxed the
Authors memory, in that he forgot to tell who was the theefe that stole <hi>Sanchoes</hi> dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for there is no mention there, only it is inferred that he was stole, and not long
after we see him mounted upon the same Asse, without knowledge how he was found.
They also say, that he forgot to tell what <hi>Sancho</hi> did with those hundred pistolets which
he found in the Maile in <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi> for he never mentions them more, and there
be many that desire to know what became of them, and how he imployed them, which
is one of the essentiall points in the worke.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Samson</hi> (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> I am not now for your reckonings or relations, for
my stomacke is fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pistolets: And so without expecting any reply, or exchanging another word, home
he goes. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> intreated the Bachelour to stay and take a pittance with him;
The Bachelour accepted the invitement, and so staid dinner: Beside their ordinary
fare, they had a paire of houshold Pigeons added; at table they discoursed of Cavallery,
<hi>Carrasco</hi> followed his humour, the banquet was ended, and they slept out the heat:
<hi>Sancho</hi> returned, and the former discourse was renewed.</p>

my Master and I got us into a thicket, where hee leaning
upon his Launce, and I upon my Dapple, both of us well bruized
and wearied with the former skermishes, we fell to sleep as soundly, as if we had been
upon some fether beds, especially I, that slept so soundly, that he, whosoever he was,
might easily come and put me upon foure Stakes, which he had fastned upon both sides
of my pack-saddle, upon which he left me thus mounted, and without perceiving it, got
my Dapple from under me.</p>
                     <p>This was easie to bee done, and no strange accident; for wee read that the same
happened to <hi>Sacripant,</hi> when being at the siege of <hi>Albraca,</hi> that famous Theefe

                              <desc>•</desc>

It was light day (said hee) when I had scarce stretched my self, but the stakes failed, and
I got a good squelch upon the ground: then I looked for mine Asse, but not finding
him, the tears came to mine eyes, and I made such strange moan, that if the Authour
of our History omitted it, let him bee assured hee forgot a worthy passage. I know
not how long after, comming with my Lady the Princesse <hi>Micomicona,</hi> I knew mine
Asse, and that hee who rode on him in the habit of a <hi>Gipson</hi> was that <hi>Gines de Passamonte,</hi>
that Cheater, that arrant Mischief-monger that my Master and I freed from the
Chaine.</p>
                     <p>The errour was not in this (said <hi>Samson)</hi> but that before there was any news of
your Asse, the Authour still said, you were mounted upon the self-same Dapple. I know
not what to say to that (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> but that either the Historian was deceived, or
else it was the carelesnesse of the Printer. Without doubt (saith <hi>Samson</hi>) 'twas like to
bee so: But what became of the Pistolets? Were they sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt?</p>
                     <p>I spent them upon my self (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> and on my Wife and Children, and they
have been the cause that shee hath indured my Journies and Careers, which I have fetche
in my Master <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> service; for if I should have returned emptie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mine Asse, I should have been welcommed with a pox: And if you will know any
more of me, here I am that will answer the King himself in person and let no body
intermeddle to know whether I brought, or whether I brought not; whether I spent
or spent not; for if the blows that I have had in these Voyages were to bee paid in
money, though every one of them were taxed but at three farthings a peece, an hundred
Pistolets more would not pay me the half of them; and let every man look to himself,
and not take white for black, and black for white; for every man is as God hath made
him, and sometimes a great deale worse:</p>
                     <p>Let me alone (quoth <hi>Carrasco)</hi> for accusing the Authour of the History, that if hee
Print it again, hee shall not forget what <hi>Sancho</hi> hath said, which sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll make it twice as
good as it was. Is there ought else, Sir Bachelour (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> to bee mended
in this Legend? Yes marry is there (said hee) but nothing so important as what hath
been mentioned. Perhaps the Authour promiseth a second part (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?)</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:160"/>
Hee doth (said <hi>Samson)</hi> but saith, hee neither findes nor knowes who hath it, so
that it is doubtfull whether it will come out or no: so that partly for this, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because some hold that Second Parts were never good; and others, That there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
written of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> it is doubted that there will bee no Second Part,
although some more <hi>Ioviall</hi> then <hi>Saturnists,</hi> cry out; Let us have more <hi>Quixotisme:</hi>
Let <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> assault and <hi>Sancho</hi> speake, let the rest be what they will, this is enough.
And how is the Author enclined?</p>
                     <p>To which (said <hi>Samson)</hi> when he had found this History, that he searcheth after with
extraordinary diligence, he will straight commit it to the Presse, rather for his profit tho,
then for any other respect. To this (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> What? doth the Author looke after
money and gain? 'tis a wonder if he be in the right; rather he will be like your false
stitching Taylors upon Christmas Eeves; for your hastie worke is never well performed;
let that Mr. Moore have a care of his businesse, for my Master and I will furnish him
with Rubbish enough at hand, in matter of Adventures, and with such different
successes, that hee may not only make one second Part, but one hundreth: the poore
fellow thinkes belike, that wee sleepe here in an Hay-mow; well, let it come to
scanning, and hee shall see whether wee bee defective: This I know, that if my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
would take my Counsell, hee should now bee abroade in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
remedying grievances, rectifying wrongs, as good Knights Errant are wont
to doe.</p>
                     <p>No sooner had <hi>Sancho</hi> ended this discourse, when the neighing of <hi>Rozinante</hi> came
to his eares, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke to be most auspicious, and resolved within
three or four dayes after to make another sally, and manifesting his minde to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor,
asked his advice to know which way he should begin his journey; whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was, That he should goe to the Kingdome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and to the Citty of
<hi>Saragosa</hi> where, not long after, there were solemn Justs to be held in honour of Saint
<hi>George,</hi> wherein he might get more fame then all the Knights of <hi>Aragon,</hi> which were
above all other Knights. Hee praised his most noble and valiant resolution, but
withall desired him to be more wary in attempting of dangers, since his life was
not his owne, but all theirs also, who needed his protection and succour in their
distresse.</p>
                     <p>I renounce that, Master <hi>Samson,</hi> (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> for my Master will set upon an
hundred armed men, as a boy would upon halfe a dozen of young Melons; Body
of the world, Sir Bachelour, there is a time to attempt, a time to retire, all must not
be <hi>Saint Iacques,</hi> and upon um: [Santingo, y Cierra Espana. <hi>As we use in</hi> England,

                           </gap> Victory.]</hi> Besides, I have heard, and I beleeve from my Master
himself, (if I have not forgotten) that valour is a mean between the two extreames
of a Coward and a rash man: and if this be so, neither would I have him fly, nor follow,
without there be reason for it: but above all, I wish that if my Master carry mee
with him, it be upon condition, that he fight for us both, and that I be tied to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but waiting upon him, to look to his clothes and his diet, for this I will doe as
nimbly, as bring him water; but to think that I will lay hand to my sword, although
it be but against base fellowes and poor rascals, is most impossible. I (Master <hi>Samson)</hi>
strive not to hoord up a fame of being valiant, but of the best and trustiest Squire
that ever served Knight Errant: And if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> my Master, obliged thereunto
by my many services, will bestow any Island on me of those many his Worship saith
wee shall light upon, I shall be much bound to him: And if he give me none, I was borne,
&amp; one man must not live to relie on another, but on God; &amp; perhaps I shall bee as well
with a piece of bread at mine ease, as to bee a Governour; and what doe I know,
whether in these kindes of Government, the Divill hath set any tripping-block before
me where I may stumble and fall, and dash out my Teeth? <hi>Sancho</hi> was I borne, <hi>Sancho</hi>
must I die? but for all that, if so and so, without any care or danger. Heaven
should provide some Island for mee, or any such like thing; I am not so very an
Asse as to refuse it, according to the Proverbe, <hi>Looke not a given Horse in the
Mouth.</hi>

trust in God and Master <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that hee will give you not only an Island,
but a Kingdome too. I think one as well as tother (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> and let me tell
you, Master <hi>Samson</hi> (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> I thinke my Masters Kingdome would not bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on mee in vaine, for I have felt mine owne Pulse, and finde my selfe healthy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to rule Kingdomes and governe Islands, and thus I have told my Master many
times.</p>
                     <p>Look yee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Samson)</hi> Honours change Manners, and perhaps when
you are once a Governour, you may scarse know your own Mother. That's to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
(said <hi>Sancho)</hi> of them that are basely born, and not of those that have on
their Souls four singers fat of the old Christian, as I have [<hi>To expresse his not being borne
a Iew or Moor:]</hi> No, but come to my condition which will bee ungratefull to no
body. God grant it (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and wee shall see when the Government
comes; for me thinks I have it before mine eyes. (Which said) hee asked the Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
whether he were a Poet, and that hee would doe him the favour to make him some
Verses, the subject of his farewell to his Mistris <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> and withall, that
at the beginning of every Verse he should put a letter of her name, that so joyning all
the first letters, there might bee read <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso.</hi> The Bachelor made answer,
that though hee were none of the famous Poets of <hi>Spain,</hi> which they said were but
three and an half; yet hee would not refuse to compose the said meeter, although hee
found a great deal of difficultie in the composition, because there were seventeen letters
in the name; and if hee made four staves, of each four verses, that there would bee a
letter too much; and if hee made them of five, which they call <hi>Decimi,</hi> there would
bee three too little; but for all that hee would see if hee could drown a Letter; so in
four staves there might bee read <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso.</hi> By all means (quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote)</hi>
let it bee so: for if the name bee not plain and conspicuous, there is no woman
will beleeve the meeter was composed for her.</p>
                     <p>Upon this they agreed, and that eight dayes after their departure should be. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
enjoyned the Bachelour to keep it secret, especially from the Vicar and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Nicholas [The Barber]</hi> his Neece and the old woman, lest they should disturb his
noble and valiant resolution. <hi>Carrasco</hi> assured him, and so took leave, charging <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
hee should let him heare of all his good or bad Fortune at his best leisure: So
they took leave, and <hi>Sancho</hi> went to provide for their Journey.</p>

thou speakest so round about the bush that no body can understand thee. It is enough
(quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> that God understands me, who understands all things; and so much
for that: but mark Sister, I would have you for these three daies look well to my

if the said rich man have at any time been poor, there is your grumbling and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and your back-biters never leave, who swarm as thick as hives of Bees thorow the
streets.</p>
                     <p>Marke <hi>Teresa</hi> (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> and give care to my speech, such as peradventure you
have not heard in all your life time, neither doe I speak any thing of mine owne, for all I
purpose to speake, is sentences of our Preacher that Preached all last Lent in this Town,
who (as I remember) said, that all things that wee see before our eyes present,
doe assist our Memories much better, and with much more vehemency, then things
past.</p>
                     <p>(All these reasons here dilivered by <hi>Sancho</hi> are the second, for which the Translator
of the History holds this Chapter for Apocrypha, as exceeding the capacity of <hi>Sancho,</hi>
who proceeded, saying:)</p>
                     <p>Whereupon it happens, that when wee see some personage well clad in rich appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
and with many followers, it seems hee moves and invites us perforce to give him
respect; although our memory at that very instant represents unto us some kinde of
basenesse which wee have seen in that personage, the which doth vilifie him, bee it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Povertie or Linage; both passed over are not: and that which wee see present
only is. And if this man (whom fortune blotted out of his basenesse, and to whom
consequently his father left all height of prosperity) bee well behaved, liberall, and
courteous towards all men, and contends not with such as are most anciently noble,
assure thy self <hi>Teresa,</hi> all men will forget what hee was, and reverence him for what he
is, except the envious, whom the greatest scape not. I understand you not Husband
(replied <hi>Teresa)</hi> doe what you will, and doe not trouble me with your long Speeches
and your Rhetorick: and if you be revolved to doe what you say. Resolved you
must say Wife (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> and not revolved. I pray dispute not with me, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
(said <hi>Teresa)</hi> I speake as it pleases God, and strive not for more eloquence: and
I tell you, if you persist in having your Government, take your Sonne <hi>Sancho</hi> with you,
and teach him from henceforth to Govern; for it is fit that the Sons doe inherit and
learn the Offices of their Fathers.</p>
                     <p>When I have my Government (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> I will send Post for him, &amp; I will send
thee monies, for I shall want none, and there never want some that will lend Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
money when they have none; but clothe him so, that hee shall not appear what
hee is, and may seem what hee must bee. Send you money (quoth <hi>Teresa)</hi> and Ile clad
him like a Date-leafe. So that now (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> we are agreed that our Daughter
shall bee a Countesse.</p>
                     <p>The day that I shall see her a Countesse (said <hi>Teresa)</hi> will bee my deaths day: But
I tell you again, doe what you will; for wee women are borne with this clog, to bee
obedient to our husbands, though they bee no better then Leeks: And here shee began
to weep so heartily, as if her little Diughter <hi>Sancha</hi> had been dead and buried. <hi>Sancho</hi>
comforted her, saying, that though shee must bee a Countesse, yet hee would defer it as
long as hee could. Here their Dialogue ended, and <hi>Sancho</hi> returned to see <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi>
to give order for their departure.</p>

Discourse; <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Neece and old-Woman were
not idle, and by a thousand signes guessed that her Uncle and
their Master would a slashing the third time, and returne to the
exercising of his (for them) ill Knight-Errantry; they sought
by all meanes possible to divert him from so bad a purpose: But
all was to no purpose; to preach in a Desart, or to beat cold
iron: Notwithstanding, amongst many other discourses that
passed betwixt them, the old-Woman told him; Truly Master, if you keepe not your
foote still, and rest quiet at home, and suffer your selfe to bee led through Mountaines
and Valleys, like a Soule in Purgatorie. seeking after those they call Adventures, which
I call Misfortunes, I shall complayne on you, and crie out to God and the King, that
they remedie it. To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered; Woman, what God will answer
to your complaints I know not, nor what his Majesty will: Only I know, if I were a
King, I would save a labor in answering such an infinity of foolish Petitions as are given
him daily; for one of the greatest toyles (amongst many other that Kings have) is
this; To bee bound to hearken to all, to answere all; therefore I would bee loath,
that ought concerning me should trouble him. Then (quoth the old-Woman) tell us
Sir, in his Majesties Court bee there not Knights? Yes (answered he) and many, and
good reason, for the adornment and greatnesse of Princes, and for ostentation of the
<hi>Royall Majesty.</hi> Why would not your worship (replyed she) be one of them that
might quietly serve the King your Master at Court?</p>
                     <p>Looke yee, friend (answered <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> All Knights cannot be Courtiers, nor
all Courtiers neither can, nor ought to be Knights Errant; in the world there must be
of all sorts and though we be all Knights, yet the one and the other differ much:
For your Courtiers, without stirring out of their chambers, or over the Court
thresholds, can travell all the world over, looking upon a Map, without spending a
mite, without suffering heat, cold, hunger or thirst. But wee, the true Knights
Errant, with sunne, with cold, with aire, with all the inclemencies of Heaven, night
and day, a horse backe and on foot, doe trace the whole world through: And wee doe
not know our Enemies by supposition, as they are painted, but in their reall being; and at
all times, and upon every occasion wee set upon them, without standing upon tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </hi> whether a Sword or Launce were longer or shorter, whether
either of the parties wore a charme, or some hidden deceit; if they shall fight after the
Sunnes going down or no, with other ceremonies of this nature which are used in single
Combats betwixt man and man, that thou knowest not of, but I doe. Know further
that the good Knight Errant (although hee see ten Gyants that with their heads, not
only touch, but overtop the clouds, and that each of them hath legs as big as two great
Towers, and armes like the Masts of mighty Ship, and each eye as big as a Mill-wheel,
and more fiery then a Glasse-oven) must not be affrighted in any wise, rather with a
staid pace and undaunted courage, hee must set on them, close with them, and if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
overcome and make them turn tail in an instant; yea, though they came armed
with the shels of a certain fish, which (they say) are harder then Diamonds; and
though instead of Swords they had cutting skeins of <hi>Damasco</hi> steel, or iron clubs with
pikes of the same, as I have seen them more then once or twice. All this have I said,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:163"/>
woman mine, that you may see the difference betwixt some Knights and others, and it is
reason that Princes should more esteeme this second, or (to say fitter) this first speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Knights Errant (for as wee reade in their Histories) such an one there hath
beene amongst them, that hath beene a safe-Guard, not only of one Kingdome, but
many.</p>
                     <p>Ah Sir, then said his Neece, beware; for all is lies and fiction that you have spoken,
touching your Knights errant, whose stories, if they were not burnt, they deserve each
of them at least to have a penance inflicted upon them, or some note by which they
might be known to be infamous, and ruiners of good Customes.</p>
                     <p>I assure thee certainely (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> if thou were not lineally my Neece, as
daughter to mine owne Sister, I would so punish thee for the blasphemy thou hast
spoken, as should resound thorow all the world. Is it possible that a Pisse-kitchin,
that scarce knowes how to make Bone-lace, dares speake and censure the histories of
Knights Errant? What would Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> have said if he should have heard this?
But I warrant he would have forgiven thee, for hee was the humblest and most
courteous Knight of his time; and moreover, a great Protector of Damzels: but such
an one might have heard thee, that thou mightest have repented thee; for all are not
courteous, or pittifull, some are harsh and bruitish. Neither are all that beare the name
of Knights, so, truely; for some are of gold, others of Alchy my, yet all seeme to bee
Knights: but all cannot brooke the touch-stone of truth: You have some base Knaves
that burst again to seeme Knights, and some that are Knights, that kill themselves
in post hast till they become Peasants: The one either raise themselves by their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or virtue; the others fall, either by their negligence, or vice; and a man had
need be wise to distinguish betweene these two sorts of Knights, so neer in their
names, so distant in their actions.</p>
                     <p>Helpe me God (quoth the Neece) that you should know so much Unckle, as
were it in case of necessity, you might step into a pulpit, and preach in the streets, <hi>[<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

you are old, that you are strong being so sickly, that you are able to make crooked
things streight, being crooked with yeeres; and that you are a Knight when you are
none? for though Gentlemen may be Knights, yet the poore cannot.</p>
                     <p>You say well Neece, in that (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and I could tell thee things
concerning linages that should admire thee, but because I will not mingle Divinity with
Humanity, I say nothing: Marke yee hoe, to foure sorrs of linages (hearken to mee)
may all in the world be reduc'd, and they are these. Some that from base beginning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
have arived at the greatest honours. Others that had great beginnings and so conserve
them till the end. Others, that though they had great beginnings, yet they end point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like a <hi>Pyramis,</hi> having lessened and annihilated their beginning, till it ends in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Others there are (and these the most) that neither had good beginning, nor
reasonable middle, and so they passe way without mention, as the linage of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and ordinary sort of people. Let the House of the <hi>Othomans</hi> bee an example to
thee of the first, who had an obscure beginning, but rose to the greatnesse they now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that from a base and poore Sheep-heard that gave them their first beginning have
come to this height in which now wee see them. Many Princes may bee an instance of
the second linage, that began in greatnesse, and was so preserved without augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or diminution, only kept their inheritance, contayning themselves within the limits
of their owne Kingdomes peacefully. Thousands of examples there bee of such, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
in greatnesse, and lessened towards their end. For all your <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> your <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> your <hi>Caesars</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the hurrie (if I may so terme them)
of your infinite Princes, Monarchs, Lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Grecians, and
Barbarians, all these linages, all these Lordships ended, pointed, and came to nought,
as well they, as those that gave them beginning, for it is not possible to finde any of
their successors, and if it were, he must be in mean and base estate; with the common
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54746:163"/>
sort I have nothing to doe, since they only live and serve to increase the number of men,
without deserving more fame or elogie of their greatnesse.</p>
                     <p>Thus much (Fools) you may infer from all that hath been said, that the confusion
of Linages is very great; and that those are the most great and glorious that shew it in
the Virtue, Wealth, and Liberalitie of their owners. Virtue, Wealth and Liberality
(I say) for that great man that is Vicious, will bee the more so, by his greatness; And
the rich man not liberall, is but a covetious begger; for hee that possesseth riches, is not
happie in them but in the spending them; not only in spending, but in well spending
them. The poor Knight hath no way to shew hee is a Knight, but that hee is Virtuous,
Affable, well-Fashioned, Courteous, and well-behaved, and Officious: Not Proud,
not Arrogant, not Back-biting; and above all, Charitable: For in a pennie (that hee
gives cheerfully to the poor) hee shews himself as liberall as hee that for ostentation
gives an Almes before a multitude: And there is no man that sees him adorned with
these Virtues, but although hee know him not, hee will judge of him and think hee is
well descended: for if hee were not, 'twere miraculous, and the reward of Virtue hath
been alwaies Praise, and the Virtuous must needs bee praised.</p>
                     <p>There bee two courses for men to come to bee wealthy and noble by, the one is Arts,
t'other Armes. I have more Armes then Learning, and was borne (according to my
inclination that way) under the influence of the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> so that I must of force
follow his steps, which I mean to doe in spight of all the world, and it is vain for you
to strive to perswade me that I should nill what the Heavens will me, Fortune ordains,
and Reason requires, and above all my affection desires. Well; in knowing
(as I know) the innumerable troubles that are annexed to Knight Errantrie; so I
know the infinite goods that are obtained with it. And I know that the path of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is very narrow, and the way of Vice large and spacious: And I know that
their ends and resting places are different; for that of Vice, large and spacious, ends in
death; and that of Virtue, narrow-and cumbersome, ends in life; and not in a life
that hath ending, but that is endlesse: And I know what our great <hi>[Boscan]</hi> Castilian
Poet said;</p>
                     <l>To the high Seat of immortalitie,</l>
                     <l>Through crabbed paths, wee must our Iourney take;</l>
                     <l>Whence hee that falls can never climbe so high,</l>
                     <p>Woe is me (said the Neece) my Master too is a Poet, hee knows every thing: I hold a
wager if hee would bee a Mason, hee would build a house as easily as a cage. I promise
thee Neece (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> if these Knightly cogitations did not wrap my Senses
there is nothing I could not doe, nor no curiosity should escape me, especially Cages,
and Tooth-pickers. By this one knockt at the dore; and asking who was there, <hi>Sancho</hi>
answered, 'Tis I. The old Woman, as soon as she heard him, ran to hide her self, because
shee would not see him. The Neece let him in; and his Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went to
receive him with open armes; and they both locked themselves is, where they had
another Dialogue as good as the former.</p>

                     <p>At the time that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were locked together, there passed a
discourse between them, which the history tels with much punctuality, and a true
relation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> said to his Master, I have now reluc't my wife to let me goe with you whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
soever you please; reduct you would say, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.)</hi> I have

my self, then you may correct me, for I am so focible.</p>
                     <p>I understand thee not, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> for I know not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your focible. So focible is (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> I am so, so. Lesse and lesse doe I
understand (said <hi>Don-Quixote.)</hi> Why if you do not understand (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54746:164"/>
and that thou art so pliant and so taking, that thou wilt apprehend what I shall
tell thee, and learn what I shall instruct thee in.</p>
                     <p>I'le lay a wager (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> you searched and understood me at first, but that you
would put me out, and hear me blunder out a hundred or two of follies. It may bee
so (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but what saies <hi>Teresa? Teresa</hi> bids me make sure work with
you, and that wee may have lesse saying and more doing; for great sayers are small
doers: A Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush: And I say a womans advice is
but slender, yet hee that refuseth it is a mad-man. I say so too (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:)</hi>
But say friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> proceed; for to day thou speakest preciously.</p>
                     <p>The businesse is (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> that, as you better know then I, we are all mortall
here to day, and gone to morrow; as soon goes the young Lambe to the roast as the
old Sheep; and no man can promise himself more dayes then God hath given him;
for death is deaf, and when shee knocks at lifes doors, shee is in haste, neither thrats,
nor entreaties, nor Scepters, nor Miters can stay her, as the common voyce goes, and as
they tell us in Pulpits.</p>
                     <p>All this is true (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but I know not where thou meanest to stop.
My stop is (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> that your Worship allow me some certain Wages by the
moneth, for the time that I shall serve you <hi>[The custome of</hi> Spain <hi>is to pay their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
Wages by the moneth;]</hi> and that the said Wages bee paid me out of your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
for I'le trust no longer to good turnes, which come either slowly, or meanly,
or never; God give me joy of mine own: In a word I must know what I may gain, little
or much: for the Hen layes as well upon one eg as many, and many littles make a mickle;
and whilest something is gotten nothing is lost: Indeed if it should so happen (which I
neither beleeve nor hope for) that your Worship should give me the Island you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
me, I am not so ungratefull, nor would carrie things with such extremitie, as not
to have the rent of that Island prized, and so to discount for the Wages I received,
cantitie for cantitie. Is not quantitie as much worth as cantitie friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> I understand you now, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> and dare lay any thing that I
should have said quantitie, and not cantitie: but that's no matter, seeing you have
understood me. I understand you very well (answered <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated
the utmost of your thoughts, and know very well what marke you ayme at,
with the innumerable arrows of your Proverbs.</p>
                     <p>Look yee <hi>Sancho,</hi> I could willingly afford you Wages, if I had found in any Histories
of Knights Errant any example that might give me light through the least chink, of any
Wages given monethly or yeerly: but I have read all or the most part of their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
and doe not remember that ever I have read, that any Knight Errant hath
allowed any set Wages to his Squire: Only I know that all lived upon countenance,
and when they least dreamt of it, if their Masters had good luck, they were rewarded,
either with an Island or some such thing equivalent, and at least they remained with
Honour and Title.</p>
                     <p>If you <hi>Sancho,</hi> upon these hopes and additaments have a minde to return to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
a Gods name; but to think that I will pluck the old use of Knight Errantry out
of his bounds, and off the hinges, is a meet impossibilitie: So that <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may
goe home and tell your <hi>Teresa</hi> mine intentention; and if that shee and you will relie
upon my favour, <hi>bene quidem;</hi> and if not, let's part friends; for if my Pigeon-house
have Comyns, it will want no Doves: And take this by the way, A good expectation
is better then a bad possession, and a good demand better then an ill pay. I speake thus
<hi>Sancho,</hi> that you may plainly see I know as well as you to sprinkle Proverbs like rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>showres.
Lastly, let me tell you; if you will not trust to my reward, and runne
the same Fortune with me, God keep you, and make you a Saint; for I shall not want
more obedient Squires, and more carefull, and not so irksome, nor so talkative as
you.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> heard his Masters firm resolution, hee waxed clowdie, and the wings
of his heart began to stoop; for hee thought verily his Master would not goe without
him for all the treasure in the World. Thus being doubtfull and pensative, <hi>Samson
<pb facs="tcp:54746:165"/>
Carrasco</hi> entred, and the Neece desirous to heare how he perswaded her Master that hee
should not returne to his Adventures.</p>
                     <p>In came <hi>Samson,</hi> a notable Crack-rope, and embracing him as at first, began in his
loud key: O flowre of Chivalrie, bright light of Armes, honor and mirror of our
Spanish nation; may it please Almighty God of his infinite goodnesse, that hee, or they
that hinder or disturbe this thy third sally, that they never finde it in the Labyrinth of
their desires, nor let the ill they wish for ever bee accomplished: And turning to the
old woman hee said: You need no longer pray the Orison of Saint <hi>Apolonia,</hi> for I
know the determination of the Spheres, is, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> put in execution his lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and new designes, and I should much burden my Conscience, If I should not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
and intimate unto this Knight, that hee doe no longer withdraw and hold back
the force of his valorous arme, and the courage of his most valiant minde, for with his
delaying he defraudes the rectifying of wrongs, the protection of Orphans, the honor of
Damzels, the Bulwarke of married women, and other matters of this qualitie, which
concern, apertain, depend and are annexed unto the Order of Knight-Errantry. Go
on then, my beautifull, my brave <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> rather to day then to morrow, let
your Greatnesse be upon the way, and if any thing be wanting to your journey, here
am I to supply with my wealth, with my person, and if need be, to bee thy Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
his Squire, which I shall hold a most happy fortune. Then (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> Did not I tell thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I should want no Squires? See who
offers himselfe to me; the most rare Batchelor <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> the perpetual darling
and delighter of the <hi>Salamancan</hi> schooles, sound and active of body, silent, suffering of
heates and colds, hunger and thirst, with all the abilities that belong to the Squire of a
Knight errant: but heav'n forbid, that for my pleasure I hox and break off the Columne
of learning, the vessel of Sciences, and that I lop off the eminent branch of the liberall
Arts: Remain thou another <hi>Samsan</hi> in thy Country, honor it, and those gray hayres of
thine aged Parents, for I will content my selfe with any Squire, since <hi>Sancho</hi> daignes
not to attend me.</p>
                     <p>I doe daign, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> (all tender) and the tears standing in his eyes, and thus
proceeds: It shall not be said Master for me, <hi>no longer pipe no longer dance;</hi> nor am I
made of hardest oake, for all the world knows, and especially my town, who the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaes</hi>
were, from whom I discend; besides I know and have searched out, by many good
works, and many good words, the desire that your worship hath to do me a kindnesse,
and if I have been to blame to meddle in reckonings concerning my wages, it was to
please my wife, who when she once fals into a vaine of perswading, ther's no hammer
that doth so fasten the hoops of a Bucket as she doth, till she obtain what she would
have; but howsoever the husband must be husband, &amp; the wife wife; &amp; since I am a man
every where (I cannot deny that) I will also be so at home in spite of any: so that ther's
no more to be done, but that you make your will, and set to your Codicill, in such sort,
that it may not be revolked, and let's straight to our journey, that Master. <hi>Samsons</hi>
Soule may not suffer; for hee saith, his Conscience is unquiet, till hee have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you to your third sally through the World, and I afresh offer my service faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and loyally, as well, and better then any Squire that ever served Knight errant in
former times or in present:</p>
                     <p>The Batchelor wondred to heare <hi>Sanchoes</hi> manner and method of speaking: for
though in the first Historie hee had read of his Master, hee never thought <hi>Sancho</hi>
had beene so witty as they there paint him out, yet hearing him now mention Will
and Codicill, revolking in stead of Revoking, hee beleeved all that hee had read of
him, and confirmed him to bee one of the most solemnest Coxcombes of our Age,
and said to himselfe, that two such mad-men, as Master and Man, were not in all the
world againe.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> embraced, and remayned friends, and with the
grand <hi>Carrascoes</hi> approbation and good will (who was then their Oracle) it was
Decreed, That within three dayes they should depart, in which they might have time
to provide all things necessarie for their Voyage, and to get an Helmet, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:54746:165"/>
said, hee must by all meanes carry. <hi>Samson</hi> offered him one, for hee knew a
friend of his would not deny it him, although it were souler with mold and rust, then
bright with smoothe steele.</p>
                     <p>The Neece and old woman cursed the Bachelour unmercifully, they tore their
haire, scratcht their faces, and as your funerall mourners use, they howled at their
Masters departure, as if he had been a dead man. The designe that <hi>Samson</hi> had to
perswade him to this third sally, was, to doe what the History tels us hereafter, all
by the advice of the Vicar and the Barber, to whom he had before communicated it.
Well, in those three dayes, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> fitted themselves with what they
thought they needed, and <hi>Sancho</hi> having set down the time to his wife and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
to his Neece, and the old woman; toward night, without taking leave of any body,
but the Bachelor, who would needs bring them halfe a league from the towne,
they tooke their way towards <hi>Toboso. Don-Quixote</hi> upon his good <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and
<hi>Sancho</hi> on his old Dapple, his wallets were stuffed with provant, and his purse
with money that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> gave him for their expences. <hi>Samson</hi> embraced him
and desired him that he might heare of his good or ill fortune, to rejoyce for the one,
or be sorry for the other, as the law of friendship did require; <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made
him a promise. <hi>Samson</hi> returned home, and the two went on towards the famous
Citty of <hi>Toboso.</hi>

of their delightfull History may reckon, that from this time
the exployts and conceits of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his Squire doe begin:
He perswades them they should forget the former Chivalry of the noble Knight,
and fix their eyes upon his Acts to come, which begin now in his way towards <hi>Toboso,</hi>
as the former did in the fields of <hi>Montiel,</hi> and it is a small request, for so much as he
is to performe, so he proceeds, saying:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> were now all alone, and <hi>Samson</hi> was scarce gone from
them, when <hi>Rozinante</hi> began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, both by Knight and
Squire were held for lucky signes, and an happy presaging, though if the truth
were tolde, Dapples sighs and brayings were more then the Horses neighing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Sancho,</hi> collected, that his fortune should exceed and over top of his Masters;
building, I know not upon what judiciall Astrologie, that sure he knew, although the
History sayes nothing of it, onely he would often say, when he fell down or stumbled,
he would have beene glad, not to have gone abroad: for of stumbling or falling came
nothing, but tearing his shooes, or breaking a rib, and though hee were a foole, yet hee
was not out in this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said unto him; Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> the night comes on us apace, and it
will grow too darke for us, to reach <hi>Toboso</hi> ere it be day, whither I am determined to
goe, before I undertake any adventure, and there I meane to receive a benediction,
and take leave of the Peerelesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> after which I know and am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
I shall end and close up every dangerous adventure; for nothing makes Knights
<pb facs="tcp:54746:166"/>
Errant more hardy, then to see themselves favoured by their Mistresses. I beleeve it
(quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi>) but I doubt you will not speak with her; at least, not see her where
you may receive her blessing, if shee give you it not from the Mud-walls where I saw
her the first time, when I carried the Letter and news of your mad pranks which you
were playing in the heart of <hi>Sierra Morena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Were those Mud-walls in thy fantasie <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) through which
thou sawest that never enough-praised gentlenesse and beauty? They were not so, but
Galleries, Walks, or goodly stone Pavements, or how call yee them? of rich and royall
Pallaces. All this might bee (answered <hi>Sancho</hi>) but to me they seemed no better,
as I remember. Yet let's goe thither (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) for so I see her, let them
bee Mud-walls, or not, or Windows; all is one whether I see her thorow chinks, or
thorow Garden-Lattices; for each ray that comes from the sunne of her brightnesse to
mine eyes, will lighten mine understanding, and strengthen mine heart, and make mee
sole and rare in my wisdome and volour.</p>
                     <p>Truly Sir (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) when I saw that Sunne, it was not so bright, that it cast any
rayes from it; and belike 'twas, that as shee was winnowing the Wheat I told you of,
the dust that came from it was like a cloud upon her face, and dimmed it. Still doest
thou think <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) beleeve, and grow obstinate, that my Mistris
<hi>Dulcinea</hi> was winnowing, it being a labor so unfit for persons of quality, that use
other manners of exercises and recreation, which shew a flight-shot off their noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Thou doest ill remember those Verses of our Poet, where hee paints out unto
us, the exercises which those four Nymphs used in their cristall habitations, when they
advanced their heads above the loved <hi>Tagus [A River in Spain;]</hi> and sate in the green
fields working those rich embroyderies which the ingenious Poet there describes unto
us, all which were of Gold, of Purle, and woven with embossed Pearls: Such was the
work of my Mistris when thou sawest her; but that the envie which some base Inchanter
beares to mine affairs, turns all that should give me delight into different shapes; and
this makes me fear that the Historie of my exploits which is in print (if so bee some
Wizard my enemie were the Authour) that hee hath put one thing for another,
mingling with one truth a hundred lyes, diverting himself to tell Tales, not fitting the
continuing of a true Historie. Oh envie! thou root of infinite evils, thou worm of
Virtues.</p>
                     <p>All Vices <hi>Sancho,</hi> doe bring a kinde of pleasure with them; but envie hath nothing
but distaste, rancour, and raving. I am of that minde too (said <hi>Sancho;</hi>) and I think
that in the Historie that <hi>Carrasco</hi> told us of, that hee had seen of us, that my credit is
turned topsie turvy, and (as they say) goes a begging. Well; as I am honest man
I never spoke ill of any Inchanter; neither am I so happie as to bee envied: True it is,
that I am somewhat malicious, and have certain knavish glimpses: but all is covered
and hid under the large cloak of my simplicitie, alwaies naturall to me, but never arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall:
and if there were nothing else in me but my beliefe (for I beleeve in God, and in
all that the Roman Church beleeves, and am sworn a mortall enemie to the Jews) the
Historians ought to pittie me and use me well in their writings: But let um say what
they will, naked was I borne, naked I am; I neither win nor lose; and though they
put me in Books, and carrie me up and down from hand to hand, I care not a fig, let
um say what they will.</p>
                     <p>'Twas just the same (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that hapned to a famous Poet of our
times, who having made a malicious Satyre against all the Curtizans, hee left out one
amongst them, as doubting whether shee were one or no, who seeing shee was not in
the scrowl among the rest, took it unkindely from the Poet, asking him what hee had
seen in her, that hee should not put her amongst the rest, and desired him to inlarge
his Satyre, and put her in the spare room; if not shee would scratch out his eyes: The
Poet consented, and set her down with a vengeance; and shee was satisfied to see her
self famous, although indeed infamous. Besides, the Tale of the Sheapheard agrees
with this, that set <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple on fire, which was one of the seven wonders of the
World, because hee would bee talked of for it; and although there were an Edict, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54746:166"/>
no man should either mention him by speaking or writing, that hee might not attain
to his desire; yet his name was known to bee <hi>Erostratus:</hi> the same allusion may bee
had out of an Accident that befell the great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift with a Knight
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour was desirous to see the famous Temple of the <hi>Rotunda,</hi> which in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times was called <hi>The Temple of all the Gods,</hi> and now by a better stile, <hi>Of all Saints,</hi>
and it is the only entire edifice that hath remained of all the Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>s in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
which doth most conserve the Glory and Magnificence of its Founders: 'tis made like
an half Orenge, exceeding large, and very lightsome, having but one window that gives
it light, or to say truer, but one round Loover on the top of it. The Emperour look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the edifice, there was a Roman Knight with him that shewed him the devices
and contriving of that great Work and memorable Architecture; and stepping from
the Loover, said to the Emperour: A thousand times, mightie Monarch, have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to see your Majestie, and cast my self down from this Loover to leave an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fame behinde me. I thank you (said the Emperour) that you have not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it; and henceforward I will give you no such occasion to shew your Loyaltie; and
therefore I command you, that you neither speake to me, nor come to my presence;
and for all these words he rewarded him.</p>
                     <p>I'le tell you <hi>Sancho,</hi> this desire of honour is an itching thing: What do'st thou
think cast <hi>Horatius</hi> from the Bridge all armed into deep <hi>Tyber?</hi> What egged <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
to launch himself into the Lake? What made <hi>Mutius</hi> burn his hand? What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Caesar</hi> against all the Sooth-sayers to passe the <hi>Rubicon?</hi> And to give you more
modern examples; What was it bored those Ships and left those valorous Spaniards on
ground, guided by the most courteous <hi>Cortez</hi> in the new world?</p>
                     <p>All these and other great and severall exploits are, have been, and shall bee the works
of Fame, which mortalls desire as a reward and part of the immortalitie which their
famous Arts deserve; though we that bee Christian Catholick Knights Errant, must
look more to the happinesse of another World (which is Eternall in the Etheriall and
Celestiall Regions) then to the vanitie of Fame, which is gotten in this present frail
age, and which, let it last as long as it will, it must have ending with this world which
hath its limited time: so that, oh <hi>Sancho,</hi> our Actions must not passe the bounds that
Christian Religion (which wee professe) hath put us in.</p>
                     <p>In Gyants wee must kill Pride, Envie in generousnesse and noble Brests; Anger
in a continent reposed and quiet Minde; Ryot and Drowzinesse in Temperance and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance;
Lasciviousnesse in the Loyaltie wee observe to those that wee have made
the Mistrisses of our thoughts; and Sloth, by travelling up and down the World,
seeking occasions that may make us (besides Christians) famous Knights. These <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
are the means by which the extreams of Glory are obtained, which fame brings
with it.</p>
                     <p>All that you have hithero spoken (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I understand passing well: but
I would faine have you zolve mee of one doubt, which even now comes into my head.
Resolve, thou wouldst say <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) speake a Gods name, for
I 'le answere thee, as well as I can. Tell mee Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> these <hi>Iulies</hi> or <hi>Augusts,</hi>
and all these famous Knights you talke of, that are dead, where are they now? The
Gentiles, said he, undoubtedly are in Hell: the Christians, if they were good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
either in Purgatorie, <hi>[according to the Romish opinion, erronious]</hi> or in Hell. 'Tis
very well, but the Sepulchres where the bodies of these great Lordings lie interred,
have they silver Lamps <hi>[Relicks that use to bee hanged up in the Papists Churches]</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before them, or are their Chappell walls decked with Crutches, winding-sheetes,
Periwigs, Legs, and wax-Eyes? and if not with these, with what? The Sepulchres
of the Gentiles (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) were for the most part, sumptuous Temples,
the ashes of <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> body were put upon a huge Pyramis of stone, which at this
day is called Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Needle. The Emperour <hi>Adrians</hi> Sepulchre was a great
Castle as bigge as a pretty Village, it was called <hi>Moles Adriani,</hi> and at this day,
the Castle of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> in Rome: Queene <hi>Artemisia</hi> buried her husband <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seolus</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:167"/>
in a Sepulchre, which was held to be one of the seven wonders of the World: but
none of all these, nor many others the Gentiles had, were decked with winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheetes,
nor any kinde of Offerings or Signes that testified they were Saints that were
buried in them.</p>
                     <p>That's it I come to (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and tell mee now, which is more, to raise a
dead man, or to kill a Gyant? The answere is at hand (said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>)
to raise a dead man. There I caught you (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) then, the fame of him that
rayseth the dead, gives sight to the Blinde, makes the Lame walke, restoreth Sick-men,
who hath Lampes burning before his Sepulchre, whose Chappell is full of Devout
People, which upon their knees adore his Reliques, this man hath greater renowne,
and in another world, then ever any of your Gentile Emperours, or Knights Errant ever
left behinde them.</p>
                     <p>I grant you that (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>) Well, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> this fame, these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
these prerogatives, how call ye um? have the bodies and Relikes of Saints, that, by
the approbation and license of our holy Mother the Church, have their lamps, their
lights, their winding-sheets, their crutches, their pictures, their heads of haire, their eyes,
and legs, by which they increase mens devotions, and endeere their Christian fame;
Kings carrie the Bodies of Saints, or their Reliques upon their shoulders, they kisse the
peeces of their bones, and doe deck, and inrich their Chappells with them, and their
most precious Altars.</p>
                     <p>What will you have me inferr from all this, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>) I mean
(said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that we endevour to be Saints, and we shall the sooner obtaine the fame
we looke after: and let me tell you Sir, that yesterday or t'other day, (for so I may say,
it being not long since) there were two poor barefoote Friers canonized or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atified,
and now many thinke themselves happie, to kisse or touch, those yron chaines
with which they girt and tormented their bodies, and they are more reverenced,
then is (as I said) <hi>Roldans</hi> sword in the Armorie of our Lord the King, (God save,
him:) So that (Master mine) better it is, to be a poore Frier of what order soever,
then a valiant Knight Errant: a dozen or two of lashes obtaine more at Gods hands,
then two thousand blowes with the launce, whether they be given to Giants, to
Spirits or Hobgoblins.</p>
                     <p>All this is true (answered <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but all cannot be Friers, and God Almighty
hath many waies, by which he carries his Elect to heaven: Cavallerie is a religion,
and you have many Knights Saints in heaven. That may be (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) but I have
heard, you have more Friers there, then Knights Errant. That is (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
because the Religious in number are more then the Knights. But there are many
Knights Errant (said <hi>Sancho.</hi>) Many indeed (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but few that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the name.</p>
                     <p>In these and such like discourses they passed the whole night, and the next day,
without lighting upon any thing, worth relation, for which, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was not
a little sorie: at last, the next day toward night they discovered the goodly Citty of
<hi>Toboso,</hi> with which sight <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> spirits were revived, but <hi>Sancho's</hi> dulled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee knew not <hi>Dulcineaes</hi> House, nor ever saw her in his Life, no more then
his Master, so that, the one to see her, and the other because hee had not seene
her, were at their Wits end, and <hi>Sancho</hi> knew not how to doe, if his Master should
send him to <hi>Toboso:</hi> But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> resolved to enter the Citty in the night, and
till the time came they staid betweene certaine Oakes that were neere <hi>Toboso;</hi> and the

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Idnight was neer spnn out when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> left the
Mountaine and entred the Citie: the Town was all husht, and the
dwellers were asleep with their leggs stretcht at length (as they say:)
The night was brightsome, though <hi>Sancho</hi> wisht it had been darker,
that hee might not see his madnesse: the Doggs in the Town did
nothing but barke and thunder in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> eares, and affrighted
<hi>Sancho's</hi> heart: Now and then an Asle braied, Hoggs grunted,
Cats mewed, whose different howlings were augmented with the silent night; all which
the enamoured Knight held to be ominous; but yet hee spoke to <hi>Sancho:</hi> Son <hi>Sancho</hi>
(said hee) guide to <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> Pallace; it may bee wee shall finde her waking. Body
of the Sunne (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) to what Palace shall I guide? for where I saw her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it was a little house. Belike (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) shee was retired into some
corner of her Palace to solace her self in private with her Damzels, as great Ladies and
Princesses use to doe. Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) since, whether I will or no, you will have
my Mistris <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> house to bee a Pallace; doe you think neverthelesse this to bee a
fit time of night to finde the door open in? Doe you think it fit that we bounce that
they may hear and let us in, to disquiet the whole Town? are wee going to a Bawdie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
think yee, like your Whore-Masters that come and call, and enter, at what houre
they list, how late soever it bee? First of all, to make one thing sure, let's finde the
Pallace (replied <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and then <hi>Sancho</hi> I'le tell thee what's fit to bee done:
and look, <hi>Sancho,</hi> either my sight fails me, or that great bulk and shadow that wee see
is <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> Palace.</p>
                     <p>Well, guide on Sir (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) it may bee it is so, though I'le first see it with my
eyes, and feel it with my hands, and beleeve it as much as it is now day. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
led on, and having walked about some two hundred paces hee lighted on the bulk that
made the shadow, and saw a great Steeple, which hee perceived was not the Pallace,
but of the chiefe Church in the Towne. Then said hee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> wee are come to the
Church. I see it very well (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and I pray God wee come not to our
Graves: for it is no good signe to haunt Church-yeards so late, especially since I told
you (as I remember) that this Ladies house is in a little Ally without passage through.
A pox on thee Block-head (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) where hast thou ever found, that
Kings Houses and Palaces have beene built in such Allies? Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) every
Countrey hath their severall fashions: It may bee here in <hi>Toboso</hi> they build their great
buildings thus, and therefore pray Sir give mee leave to looke up and downe the streets
or lanes that lye in my way, and it may bee that in some corner I may light upon this
Palace (the Divell take it) that thus mocks and misleads us. Speak mannerly Sir (quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) of my Mistrisse things, and let's be merry and wise, and cast not the rope
after the bucket.</p>
                     <p>I will forbeare (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) but how shall I endure, that you will needs have mee
be throughly acquainted with a house I never saw but once, and to find it at mid-night
being you cannot finde it that have seen it a million of times? Sirrah, I shall grow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) come hither Heretick. Have not I told thee a thousand
times that I never saw the Peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> nor never crossed the thresholds of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and that I only am enamoured on her by heare-say, and the great fame of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and discretion? Why now I heare you said <hi>Sancho,</hi> and since you say, you have never
seen her; nor I neither.</p>
                     <p>That cannot bee (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for you told mee at least, that you had
seene her winnowing of Wheate, when you brought mee the answere of the Letter
<pb facs="tcp:54746:168"/>
I sent by you. Ne're stand upon that (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) for let mee tell you, that I
only saw her by heare-say too, and so was the Answere I brought: for I know her as
well as I can box the Moone. <hi>Sancho, Sancho,</hi> said <hi>(Don-Quixote</hi>) there's a time
to laugh, and a time to mourne. Now because I say, I have neyther seene, nor spoken
to the Mistris of my Soul, shouldest thou say thou hast neyther seene nor spoken
to her, it being otherwise (as thou knowest?) Being in this discourse, they saw one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by them with two Mules, and by the noise the Plough made which they drew upon
the ground, they might see it was some Husbandman that rose by breake of day, to goe
to his tillage, and so it was: as he came, he went singing that <hi>Romante</hi> of the battell of
<hi>Roncesualles</hi> with the French-men.</p>
                     <p>In hearing of which (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) <hi>Sancho</hi> hang me if we have any good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
this night. Do not you hear what this Clown sings? Yes marry doe I (said
<hi>Sancho</hi>) but what doth the Chase of <hi>Roncesualles</hi> concerne us? 'Tis no more then
if hee had sung the <hi>Romante</hi> of <hi>Calamos [as if we should have said in English</hi>
Chevie-Case, <hi>or some such like.</hi>] and all one, for our good or ill luck in this
businesse.</p>
                     <p>By this the Plough-man came by them, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> questioned him: Can you
tell mee friend (so God reward you) which is the Palace of the Peerles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boso?</hi>
Sir, answered the yong man, I am a stranger, and have lived but a while in this
towne, and serve a rich husbandman, to till his ground; here over against, the Vicar
and the Sexton both live, any of them will tell you of this Lady Princess, as having a
List of all the inhabitants of <hi>Toboso;</hi> although I think there is no such Princesse here, but
many Gentlefolke, each of which may be a Princesse in her own house. Why friend (qd.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) it may be that she I ask for is amongst these. It may be so said the fellow
and God speed you, for now it begins to be day peep; and switching his Mules, he staid
for no more questions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing his Master in a deep suspence and very Malecontent, told him, Sir, The
day comes on apace, and it will not bee so fitte that wee Sunne our selves in the
Streete: It is better to goe out of the Cittie, and that you shade your selfe in
some Grove hereabouts, and I will come backe anon, and not leave a by place in all
this Towne, where I may search for the House, Castle, or Palace of my Lady, and
it were ill luck if I found her not: and if I doe, I will speake with her and let her
know where, and how you doe, expecting that shee give you Order and Direction,
how you may see her, without any manner of prejudice to her Honour and good
name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) thou hast spoken a thousand sentences, inclosed in the
circle of thy short discourse: The advice that thou hast now given me I hunger after,
and most lovingly accept of: Come sonne, let us take shade, and thou shalt return
(as thou sayest) to seek, to see, and to speak to my Mistris, from whose discretion and
courtesie I hope for a thousand miraculous favours. <hi>Sancho</hi> stood upon Thornes till hee
had drawn his Master from the Town, lest hee should verifie the lie of the answer that
hee had carried him from <hi>Dulcinea</hi> to <hi>Sierra Morena.</hi> So hee hastened him to be gone,
which was presently done, some two miles from the Town, where they found a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
or Wood, where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took shade; and <hi>Sancho</hi> returned to the Citie to
speak with <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> in which Embassie matters befell him that require a new atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a new beliefe.</p>

greatest that ever was: but for all this fear and suspition, hee set it
down as t'other acted it, without adding or diminishing the least

                        </gap>reason; for truth is stretcht, but never
breaks, and tramples on the lie as oyle doth upon water; and so prosecuting his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
hee sayes; That as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had shaded himself in the Forrest or Oake-Wood
neer the grand <hi>Toboso:</hi> hee willed <hi>Sancho</hi> to return to the City, and not to come to
his presence, without hee had first spoken to his Mistris from him, requesting her that
shee would please to bee seen by her captiv'd Knight, and to daigne to bestow her bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on him, that by it hee might hope for many most prosperous successes in all his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
and dangerous enterprizes. <hi>Sancho</hi> took on him to fulfill his command, and to
bring him now as good an answer as the former.</p>
                     <p>Goe Lad (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and bee not daunted when thou comest before the
beams of the Sunne of Beauty, which thou goest to discover: Oh happy thou above all
the Squires of the world! bee mindefull, and forget not how shee entertains thee;
if shee blush just at the instant when thou deliverest my Embassie; if shee bee stirred
and troubled when she heares my name; whether her cushion cannot hold her; if shee
bee set in the rich state of her Authority: And if shee stand up, mark her whether shee
clap sometimes one foot upon another; if shee repeat the answer shee gives thee twice
or thrice over; or change it from milde to curst, from cruell to amorous; whether she
seem to order her haire, though it bee not disorderd: Lastly, observe all her actions
and gestures; for if thou relate them just as they were, I shall ghesse what is hidden in
her heart, touching my Love in matter of fact: for know <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou knowest it
not, that the actions and outward motions that appear (when love is in treaty)
are the certain Messengers that bring news of what passeth within. Goe friend;
and better fortune guide thee then mine, and send thee better successe then I can
expect 'twixt hope and feare in this uncouth solitude in which thou leavest
me.</p>
                     <p>I goe (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and will return quickly: Enlarge that little heart of yours, no
bigger then an Hasell-nur, and consider the saying, <hi>Faint heart never, &amp;c. Sweet meat
must have sowre sauce:</hi> And another, <hi>Where wee least think, there goes the Hare away,</hi>
This I say, because that if to night wee found not the Castle or Palace of my Lady, now
by day I doubt not but to finde it, when I least dream of it, and so to finde her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
me <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) thou alwaies bringest thy Proverbs so to
the haire of the businesse wee treat of, as God give mee no worse Fortune then I
desire.</p>
                     <p>This said, <hi>Sancho</hi> turned his back and switched his Dapple; and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> stayd
a horse-back easing himself on his stirrops, and leaning on his Launce, full of sorrowfull
and confused thoughts where wee will leave him, and wend with <hi>Sancho,</hi> who parted
from his Master no lesse troubled and pensative then hee; insomuch that hee was scarce
out of the Wood, when turning his face, and seeing that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was out of sight,
hee lighted from his Asse, and resting at the foot of a Tree, hee began to discourse thus
<pb facs="tcp:54746:169"/>
to himself, and say; Now brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> I pray let's know; whither is your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
going? To seek some Asse that you have lost? No forsooth. Well; what is it
you seek for? I seek (a matter of nothing) a Princesse, and in her the Sunne of Beauty,
and all Heaven withall. And where doe you think to finde this you speak of <hi>Sancho?</hi>
Where? Why in the grand Citie of <hi>Toboso.</hi> Well, and from whom doe you seek her?
From the most famous Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> hee that righteth wrongs,
gives the thirsty meat, and the hungry drink: <hi>[Mistakes of simplicity.]</hi> All this is well:
And doe you know her house <hi>Sancho?</hi> My Master sayes, it is a Royall Palace, or a lofty
Towre. And have you ever seen her trow? Neither hee nor I, never. And doe you
think it were well, that the men of <hi>Toboso</hi> should know, that you were here to entice
their Princesses, and to trouble their Wenches, and should come and grinde your ribs
with bangs, and leave you never a sound bone? Indeed belike they should consider
that you are commanded friend, but as a Messenger, that you are in no fault, not you.
Trust not to that <hi>Sancho;</hi> for your <hi>Manchegan</hi> People are as cholerick as honest, and
doe not love to bee jested with. In very deed if they smell you, you are sure to pay for
it. Ware Hawk, ware Hawk: No, no, let me for anothers pleasure seeke better bread
then's made of Wheat; and I may as well finde this <hi>Dulcinea</hi> as one <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Robena,
[As if we should say, one</hi> Jone <hi>in</hi> London,] or a Scholler in black in <hi>Salamanca:</hi> The
Devill, the Devill, and none else hath clapt me into this businesse. This Soliloquy
passed <hi>Sancho</hi> with himself, and the upshot was this.</p>
                     <p>All things (said he) have a remedy but death, under whose yoke wee must all passe
in spite of our teethes, when life ends. This Master of mine, by a thousand signes
that I have seen, is a Bedlam, fit to be bound, and I come not a whit short of him,
and am the greater Cox-combe of two, to serve him, if the Proverbe bee true that
sayes <hi>Like master, like man;</hi> and another; <hi>Thou art known by him that doth thee feed,
not by him that doth thee breed.</hi> Hee being thus mad then, and subject, out of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to mistaking of one thing for another, to judge black for white, and white for
blacke, as appeared, when he sayd, the winde-mils were Gyants, and the Friers mules,
Dromedaries, and the flocks of sheep, armies of enemies, and much more to this tune;
it will not be hard to make him beleeve, that some husband-mans daughter, the first
we meet with, is the Lady <hi>Dulcinea:</hi> and if he beleeve it not, Ile swear; and if hee
swear, Ile out-swear him; and if he be obstinate, Ile be so more: and so, that I will
stand to my tackling, come what will on it. Perhaps with mine obstinacy I shall so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with him, that hee will send mee no more upon these kinde of Messages, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what bad dispatch I bring him; or perhaps hee will thinke, that some wicked
Enchanter, one of those that hee saies persecute him, hath changed her shape, to
vexe him.</p>
                     <p>With this conceit <hi>Sancho's</hi> spirit was at rest, and he thought his businesse was brought
to a good passe; and so staying there till it grew to bee toward the Evening, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
might think he spent so much time in going and comming from <hi>Toboso,</hi> all fell
out happily for him; for when he got up to mount upon Dapple, hee might see three
Countrey wenches coming towards him from <hi>Toboso,</hi> upon three Asse-colts, whether
male or female, the Author declares not, though it be likely they were shee-Asses, they
being the ordinary beasts that those country-people ride on: but because it is not very
pertinent to the story, we need not stand much upon deciding that. In fine, when <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
saw the three country-wenches, he turned back apace to find out his Master <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and found him sighing, and uttering a thousand amorous lamentations.</p>
                     <p>As soone as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw him, he said; how now <hi>Sancho,</hi> what is the matter?
May I marke this day with a white or a black stone? 'Twere fitter quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you
would marke it with red-Oker, as the Inscriptions are upon Professors chaires, that they
may plainly read that see them. Belike then (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) thou bringest good
news. So good said <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you need no more but spur <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and straight
discover the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> with two Damzells waiting on her, coming to
see your worship. Blessed God! friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> what sayest thou quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>
See thou deceive me not with thy false myrth to glad my true sorrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54746:169"/>What should I get by deceiving you quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> the rather your selfe being so neer
to discover the truth? Spur Sir, ride on, and you shall see our Mistris the Princesse
coming, clad indeed and adorned like her selfe: Shee and her Damzels are a very spark
of gold; they are all ropes of Pearle; all Diamonds; all Rubies; all cloth of Gold
ten stories high at least: Their haires hung loose over their shoulders, that were like so
many Sun-beams playing with the winde, and besides all this, they are mounted upon
three flea-bitten Nackneys, the finest sight that can bee. Hackneyes thou would'st say
<hi>Sancho.</hi> Hackney or Nackney quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there is little difference; but let them come
upon what they will, they are the bravest Ladies that can be imagined, especially my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the Princesse <hi>Dulcinea</hi> that dazles the sences.</p>
                     <p>Let's goe sonne <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and for a reward for this unlook't for
good news, I bequeathe thee the best spoyle I get in our first Adventure next, and if
this content thee not, I give thee my this yeeres Colts by my three Mares thou knowest
I have to foale in our towne Common. The Colts I like quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but for the
goodnesse of the spoyle of the first Adventure I have no minde to that. By this they
came out of the wood, and saw the three Country-wenches neere them. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
stretcht his eyes all over <hi>Toboso</hi> way, and seeing none but the three wenches, he was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
troubled, and demanded of <hi>Sancho,</hi> if he had left them comming out of the
Citty. How, out of the City quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> are your eyes in your noddle, that you see
them not coming here, shining as bright as the Sunne at noone? I see none said he, but
three wenches upon three Asses.</p>
                     <p>Now God keep me from the Devill (quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi>) and is it possible that three
Hackneyes, or how call ye um, as white as a flake of snow, should appeare to you to
be Asses? As sure as may be, you shall pull of my beard if that be so. Well, I tell
you, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis as sure that they are Hee, or Shee Asses, as I am <hi>Don-Quixote
de la Mancha,</hi> and thou <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> at least to me they seem so.</p>
                     <p>Peace, Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and say not so, but snuffe your eyes, and reverence the
Mistris of your thoughts, for now she drawes neere: and so saying he advanced to
meet the three Country-wenches, and alighting from Dapple, tooke one of their Asses
by the halter, and fastning both his knees to the ground, said, Queen, and Princesse,
and Dutchesse of beauty, let your Haughtinesse and Greatnesse be pleased, to receive
into your grace and good liking, your captiv'd Knight that stands yonder turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
marble, all amazed and without his pulse, to see himselfe before your Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Presence. I am <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his Squire, and he is the Way-beaten Knight
<hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> otherwise called The Knight of the <hi>Sorrowfull Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was on his knees by <hi>Sancho,</hi> and beheld with unglad, but
troubled eyes, her that <hi>Sancho</hi> called Queene and Lady; but seeing he discovered
nothing in her but Country-wench, and not very well-favoured, for shee was
blub-fac'd, and flat-nosed; he was in some suspence, and durst not once open his lips.
The wenches too were astonisht, to see those two so different men upon their knees,
and that they would not let their companion goe forward. But she that was stayed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
to heare her self misused, broke silence first, saying; Get you out of the way with a
mischief, and let's be gone, for we are in haste.</p>
                     <p>To which quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Oh Princesse and universall Lady of <hi>Toboso,</hi> why doth not
your magnanimous heart relent, seeing the Pillar and Prop of Knight Errantry prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before your sublimated presence? Which when one of the other two heard, after
shee had cried out to her Asse, that was turning aside, shee said: Looke how these
Yonkers come to mock at poore Country-folke, as if wee knew not how to returne
their flouts upon them; get you gone your way and leave us, you had best. Rise <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> at this instant, for I perceive now, that mine ill fortune, not
satisfied, hath shut up all the passages by which any content might come to this my
wretched Soule within my flesh. Oh thou! the extreme of all worth to be desired, the
bound of all humane gentlenesse, the only remedy of this mine afflicted Heart that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores
thee, now that the wicked Enchanter persecutes mee, and hath put Clouds and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:170"/>
Cataracts in mine eyes; and for them only, and none else, hath transformed and
changed thy peerlesse beauty and face into the face of a poor Countrey-Wench; if so be
now hee have not turned mine too into some Hobgoblin, to make it loathsome in thy
sight, look on me gently and amorously, perceiving by this submission and kneeling
which I use to thy counterfeit beauty, the humilitie with which my Soule adores
thee.</p>
                     <p>Marry muff (quoth the Countrey-Wench) I care much for your courtings: Get
you gone, and let us goe, and wee shall bee beholding to you. <hi>Sancho</hi> let her passe by
him, most glad that hee had sped so well with his device. The Countrey-Wench that
played <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> part was no sooner free, when spurring her Hackney with a prickle
shee had at the end of her cudgell, shee began to run apace; and the Asle feeling the
smart of it more then ordinary, began to wince so fast, that down came my Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea;</hi>
which when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw, hee came to help her up, and <hi>Sancho</hi> went to
order and gird her Pack-saddle, that hung at the Asses belly; which being fitted, and
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> about to list his inchanted Mistris in his armes to her Asse, shee being
now got upon her legs, saved him that labour; for stepping a little back, shee fetcht a
rise, and clapping both her hands upon the Asses crupper, shee lighted as swift as an
Hawke upon the Pack-saddle, and sate astride like a man.</p>
                     <p>Then said <hi>Sancho:</hi> By Saint <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>que</hi> our Mistris is as light as a Robbin-ruddock, and
may teach the cunningest <hi>Cordovan</hi> or <hi>Mexicanian</hi> to ride on their Ginets: At one
spring shee hath leapt over the crupper, and without spurs makes the Hackney runne
like a Musk-Cat, and her Damzels come not short of her; for they flie like the winde.
And hee said true: for when <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was once on horse-back, they all made after her,
and set a running for two miles without looking behinde them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> still looked after them: but when they were out of sight, turning to
<hi>Sancho,</hi> hee said; <hi>Sancho,</hi> how thinkest thou? How much Inchanters doe hate me?
And see how farre their malice extends, and their aime at me, since they have deprived
me of the happinesse I should have received to have seen my Mistris in her true being.
Indeed I was borne to bee an example of unfortunate men, to bee the Mark and Butt,
at which ill-Fortunes arrows should bee sent: And thou must note <hi>Sancho,</hi> that these
Enchanters were not content to have changed and transformed my <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> but they
have done it into a shape so base and ugly, as of a Countrey-Wench thou sawest; and
withall, they have taken from her that which is so proper to her and great Ladies, to
wit, her sweet sent of flowers and Amber: for let me tell thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> that when I
went to help <hi>Dulcinea</hi> to her Hackney (which as thou sayest, seemed to me to bee a
shee-Asse) shee gave mee such a breath of raw Garlick, as piere't and intoxicated my
brain.</p>
                     <p>O base rowt, cried out <hi>Sancho</hi> instantly! Oh dismall and ill-minded Enchanters!
I would I might see you all strung up together like Galls, or like Pilchers in shoals:
cunning you are, much you can, and much you doe: it had been enough for you Rascals,
to have turned the Pearls of my Ladies eyes into Corkie Galls, and her most pure gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Haire into Bristles of a red Oxes taile; and finally, all her feature from good to
bad, without medling with her Breath; for only by that wee might have ghessed what
was concealed under that course rinde; though, to say true, I never saw her course<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but her beauty, which was in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>initely increased by a Moale shee had upon her lipp,
like a Mostacho, with seven or eight red haires like threeds of gold, and above a handfull
long. To this Moale (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) according to the correspondencie that
those of the face have with those of the body; shee hath another in the table of her
thigh that corresponds to the side, where that of her face is: but haires of that length
thou speakest of, are very much for Moals. Well, I can tell you (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that
there they appeared, as if they had been borne with her. I beleeve it friend (replyed
<hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>) for nature could form nothing in <hi>Dulcinea</hi> that was not perfect
and complete; and so, though shee had a hundreth Moales, as well as that
one thou sawest in her, they were not Moals, but Moons and bright Stars.</p>
                     <p>But tell me <hi>Sancho,</hi> that which thou did'st set on, which seemed to me to bee a pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saddle,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54746:170"/>
was it a plane saddle or a saddle with a back? It was said <hi>Sancho</hi> a Ginet saddle,
with a field covering, worth halfe a Kingdom for the richnesse of it. And could not I
see all this? Well now I say again, and will say it a thousand times, I am the unhappiest
man alive. The crack-rope <hi>Sancho</hi> had enough to doe to hold laughter, hearing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
madnesse, that was so delicately gulled.</p>
                     <p>Finally, after many other reasons that passed betwixt them both, they gate up on
their beasts, and held on the way to <hi>Saragosa,</hi> where they thought to bee fitly, to see
the solemnities that are performed once every yeer in that famous City. But before they
came thither, things befell them, that because they are many, famous and strange, they
deserve to be written and read, as shall be seen here following.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ON-QVIXOTE</hi> went on, wonderfull pensative to thinke what
a shrewd trick the Enchanters had played him, in changing his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
<hi>Dulcinea</hi> into the rustick shape of a Country-wench, and
could not imagine what meanes hee might use to bring her to her
pristine being; and these thoughts so distracted him, that carelesly
hee gave <hi>Rozinante</hi> the Reines, who perceiving the liberty hee had,
stayed every stitch-while to feede upon the greene grasse, of which
those fields were full; but <hi>Sancho</hi> put him out of his Maze, saying Sir; sorrow was not
ordained for beasts, but men, yet if men doe exceede in it, they become beasts; pray
Sir recollect and come to your selfe, and pluck up <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Reines, revive and
cheere your selfe, shew the courage that befits a Knight Errant. What a Devil's the
matter? What faintnesse is this? are we dreaming on a dry Summer? Now Satan take
all the <hi>Dulcineaes</hi> in the world, since the wel-fare of one only Knight Errant, is more
worth then all the Enchantments and transformations in the world.</p>
                     <p>Peace <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) with a voice now not very faint, Peace I say,
and speake no blasphemies against that Enchanted Lady; for I only am in fault for her
misfortune and unhappinesse: Her ill-plight springs from the envie that Enchanters
beare mee. So say I too (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for what heart sees her now, that saw her
before, and doth not deplore? Thou maist well say so <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
since thou sawest her in her just entyre beautie, and the Enchantment dimmed not thy
sight nor concealed her fairnesse: Against me only, only against mine eyes the force of
its venome is directed.</p>
                     <p>But for all that <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have faln upon one thing, which is, that thou didst ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
her beauty to me; for if I forget not, thou saidst she had eyes of Pearles: and
such eyes are rather the eyes of a Sea-Breame then a fayre Dames; but as I thinke, <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineaes</hi>
eyes are like two green-Emralds raled with two Celestiall Arkes, that serve them
for eye-brows. And therfore for your Pearles, take them from her eyes, and put them
to her teeth: for doubtlesse <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou mistook'st eyes for teeth. All this may be, said
<hi>Sancho,</hi> for her beauty troubled me, as much as her foulnesse since hath done you; but
leave we all to God, who is the knower of all things that befalls us in this Vale of teares,
in this wicked world; where there is scarce any thing without mixture of mischief, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postorship,
or villanie.</p>
                     <p>One thing (Master mine) troubles me more then all the rest; to think what meanes
there will bee, when you overcome any Giant or other Knight, and command him to
<pb facs="tcp:54746:171"/>
present himself before the beauty of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> where this poor Gyant, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable

<hi>Toboso,</hi> to finde my Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and though they should meet her in the middle of

                     <p>It may bee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) her Enchantment will not extend to take

therefore in one or two of the first I conquer and send, wee will make tryall whether
they see her or no, commanding them that they return to relate unto me what hath
befaln them.</p>
                     <p>I say Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I like what you have said very well, and by this device wee

and passe it over here as well as wee may, seeking our Adventures; and let time alone,
who is the best Phisician for these and other infirmities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would have answered <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> but hee was interrupted by a
Waggon that came crosse the way, loaden with the most different and strange perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
and shapes that might be imagined. Hee that guided the Mules, and served for
Waggoner, was an ugly Devill. The Wagons self was open without Tilt or Boughs.
The first shape that presented it self to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> eyes, was of Death her self, with
a humane face: And next her an Angel with large painted wings. On one side stood
an Emperour, with a crown upon his head, to see to, of gold. At Deaths feet was the
God called <hi>Cupid,</hi> not blind-folded, but with his Bow, his Quiver, and Arrows. There
was also a Knight compleatly Arm'd, only hee had no Murrion or Head-peece, but a
Hat full of divers colour'd plumes: With these there were other personages of different
fashions and faces.</p>
                     <p>All which seen on a suddain, in some sort troubled <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and affrighted
<hi>Sancho's</hi> heart; but straight <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was jocund, beleeving that some rare and
dangerous Adventure was offered unto him; and with this thought, and a minde, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give the onset to any perill, hee got himself before the Waggon, and with a loud
and threatning voyce cryed out: Carter, Coach-man, or Devill, or whatsoe're thou
art, bee not slow to tell mee who thou art? Whither thou goest? And what People
these are thou carriest in thy Cart-Coach, rather like <hi>Charons</hi> Boat, then Waggons now
in use?</p>
                     <p>To which the Devill, staying the Cart, gently replied, Sir, wee are Players of <hi>Thomas
Angulo's</hi> Companie; wee have played a Play called <hi>The Parliament of Death</hi> against
this <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> tyde, in a Town behinde the ridge of yonder Mountain, and this
afternoon wee are to play it again at the Town you see before us, which because it is
so neer, to save a labour of new attiring us, wee goe in the same clothes in which wee
are to Act. That young man playes Death: That other an Angell: That woman,
our Authors wife, the Queen: A fourth there, a Souldier: A fifth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
And I the Devill, which is one of the chiefest Actors in the Play, for I
have the best part. If you desire to know any thing else of us, ask mee, and
I shall answer you most punctually; for as I am a Devill, nothing is unknown to
mee.</p>
                     <p>By the faith of a Knight Errant (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) as soon as ever I saw this Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
I imagined some strange Adventure towards; and now I say it is fit to bee fully
satisfied of these apparitions, by touching them with our hands. God bee with you
honest people; Act your Play, and see whether you will command any thing wherein
I may bee serviceable to you; for I will be so most cheerfully and willingly: for since I
was a boy, I have loved Mask-shews, and in my youth I have been ravished with Stage-Playes.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they were thus discoursing, it fell out, that one of the companie came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them, clad for the Fool in the Play, with Morrice-bells, and at the end of a stick
hee had three Cows bladders full-blown, who thus masked running toward <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
began to fence with his cudgell, and to thwack the bladders upon the ground,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54746:171"/>
and to frisk with his bells in the aire; which dreadfull sight so troubled <hi>Rozinante</hi> that
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> not able to hold him in (for hee had gotten the bridle betwixt his teeth)
hee fell a running up and down the Field, much swifter then his anatomized bones
made shew for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> that considered in what danger of being thrown down his Master might bee,
leapt from Dapple, and with all speed ran to help him; but by that time hee came to
him, hee was upon the ground, and <hi>Rozinante</hi> by him; for they both tumbled together.
This was the common passe <hi>Rozinante's</hi> tricks and boldnesse came to: But no sooner
had <hi>Sancho</hi> left his horse-backship to come to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> when the damning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
with the bladders leapt on Dapple, and clapping him with them, the fear and noyse,
more then the blows, made him fly thorow the Field, toward the Place where they
were to Play. <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld Dapples career and his Masters fall, and knew not to
which of the ill chances hee might first repaire: But yet, like a good Squire and
faithfull Servant, his Masters love prevailed more with him then the cockering of his
Asse: though every hoysting of the bladders, and falling on Dapples buttocks, were to
him trances and tydings of death, and rather had he those blowes had lighted on his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls,
then on the least haire on his Asses tayle.</p>
                     <p>In this perplexitie hee came to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who was in a great deale worse plight
then he was willing to see him; and helping him on <hi>Rozinante</hi> said; Sir, the Devill hath carried away Dapple. What Devill (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>) He with the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
replied <hi>Sancho.</hi> Well, I will recover him (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) though hee should
lock him up with him in the darkest and deepest dungeons of Hell: Follow me <hi>Sancho,</hi>
for the waggon goes but slowly, and the Mules shall satisfie Dapples losse. There is no
need (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) temper your choller, for now I see the Devill hath left Dapple,
and he returnes to his home: and he said true, for the Devill having falne with Dapple,
to imitate <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Rozinante,</hi> he went on foot to the town, and the Asse
came back to his Master.</p>
                     <p>For all that (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) it were fit to take revenge of the Devil's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerlynesse
upon some of those in the Waggon, even of the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Oh never thinke of any such matter (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and take my Conncell,
that is, Never to meddle with Players, for they are a people mightily beloved: I have
knowne one of um in Prison for two murders, and yet scap'd Scot-free: Know
this Sir, That as they are Merry Joviall Lads; all men Love, Esteeme and helpe them,
especially if they be the Kings Players, and all of them in their fashion and garbe are
Gentleman-like.</p>
                     <p>For all that (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) the Devill-Player shall not scape from mee
and bragge of it, though all mankinde helpe him: And so saying, hee got to the
Waggon, that was now somwhat neere the Towne, and crying aloud, said; Hold,
stay, merry Greekes, for Ile make yee know what belongs to the Asses and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
belonging to the Squires of Knights Errant. <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> noyse was such,
that those of the Waggon heard it; and guessing at his intention by his speeches, in
an instant Mistrisse Death leapt out of the Waggon, and after her the Emperour, the
Devill-Waggoner, and the Angell, and the Queene too, with little <hi>Cupid,</hi> all of them
were streight loaded with stones, and put themselves in Order, expecting <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
with their peeble poynts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that saw them in so gallant a Squadron, ready to discharge strongly
their stones, held in <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Reynes, and began to consider how he should set upon
them with least hazard of his Person. Whil'st hee thus stayed, <hi>Sancho</hi> came to him, and
seeing him ready to give the onset said; 'Tis a meere madnesse Sir, to attempt this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize:
I pray consider, that for your River-sops <hi>[Meaning the stones]</hi> there
are no defensive weapons in the world, but to bee shut up and inlay'd under a brazen
Bell: And consider likewise, 'tis rather Rashnesse then Valour, for one man alone
to set upon an Army wherein Death is, and where Emperours fight in Person,
and where good and bad Angels helpe: And if the consideration of this bee not
sufficient, may this move you to know; That amongst all there (though they
<pb facs="tcp:54746:172"/>
seeme to bee Kings, Princes and Emperours, yet there is not so much as one Knight
Errant.</p>
                     <p>Thou hast hit upon the right <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) the very point that
may alter my determination: I neyther can nor must draw my Sword, as I have
often told thee, against any that bee not Knights Errant. It concernes thee <hi>Sancho,</hi>
if thou meanest to bee Revenged for the wrong done unto thine Asse, and I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
thee, and from hence give thee wholsome instructions. There needes no
being Revenged of any body (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) for there is no Christianity in it;
besides, mine Asse shall bee contented to put his Cause to mee, and to my Will;
which is to live peaceable and quietly, as long as Heaven shall bee pleased to afford
mee Life.</p>
                     <p>Since this is thy determination (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) honest, wise, disceet, Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
pure <hi>Sancho,</hi> let us leave these dreams, and seek other better and more reall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
for I see this Countrey is like to afford us many miraculous ones. So hee
turned <hi>Rozinantes</hi> reines, and <hi>Sancho</hi> took his Dapple, Death with all the flying Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
returned to the Waggon, and went on their voyage: And this was the happy end
of the Waggon of Deaths Adventure; thanks be to the good advice that <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
gave his Master; to whom the day after there hapned another Adventure, no lesse
pleasant, with an enamoured Knight Errant as well as hee.</p>

Deaths encounter, under certain high and shadie Trees, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
having first (by <hi>Sancho's</hi> entreaty) eaten somewhat of
the Provision that came upon Dapple; and as they were at Supper
<hi>Sancho</hi> said to his Master; Sir, what an Asse had I been, had I
chosen for a reward, the spoiles of the first Adventure which you
might end, rather then the breed of the three Mares? Indeed,
indeed, a Bird in the Hand is better then two in the Bush.</p>
                     <p>For all that (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) if thou, <hi>Sancho,</hi> hadst let me give the on-set (as
I desired) thou hadst had to thy share, at least, the Empresses golden crown, and
<hi>Cupid's</hi> painted wings, for I had taken um away against the haire, and given them thee.
Your Players Scepters and Emperors crowns (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) are never of pure Gold, but
Leaf and Tinne.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (answered <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for it is very necessary that your Play-ornaments
bee not fine, but counterfeit and seeming, as the Play it self is, which I would have thee,
<hi>Sancho,</hi> to esteem of, and consequently the Actors too, and the Authors, because they
are the Instruments of much good to a Common-wealth, beeing like Looking-glasses,
where the Actions of humane life are lively represented; and there is no comparison
that doth more truely present to us, what wee are, or what wee should bee,
then Comedie and Comedians: If not, tell me; hast not thou seen a Play acted,
where Kings, Emperors, Bishops, Knights, Dames, and other personages are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?
One playes a Russian, another the Cheater, this a Merchant, t'other a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
one a crafty Fool, another a foolish Lover: And the Comedie ended, and the
apparell taken away, all the rehearsers are the same they were.</p>
                     <p>Yes marry have I (quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi>) Why, the same thing (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in the Comedy and Theater of this World, where some play the Emperors, other
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54746:172"/>
the Bishops; and lastly, all the parts that may bee in a Comedie: but in the end, that
is, the end of our life, Death takes away all the robes that made them differ, and at
their buriall they are equall. A brave comparison (quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi>) but not so strange
to me, that have heard it often, as that of the Chesse-play, that while the game lasts
every Peer hath it's particular motion; and the game ended, all are mingled and
shuffled together, and cast into a leathern bag, which is a kinde of buriall.</p>
                     <p>Every day <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) thou growest wiser and wiser. It must
needs bee (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that some of your wisdome must cleave to me; for grounds
that are dry and barren, by mucking and tilling them, give good fruit: I mean your
conversation hath been the muck that hath been cast upon the sterill ground of my
barren wit; and the time that I have served you, the tillage, with which I hope to
render happie fruit, and such as may not gain-say or slide out of the paths of good
manners, which you have made in my withered understanding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laughed at <hi>Sancho's</hi> affected reasons, and it seemed true to him, what
hee had said touching his reformation: for now and then his talk admired him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for the most part, when <hi>Sancho</hi> spoke by way of contradiction, or like a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
hee ended his discourse with a downfall from the mount of his simplicitie, to the
profunditie of his ignorance: but that wherein hee shewed himself most elegant and
memorable, was in urging of Proverbs, though they were never so much against the
haire of the present businesse, as hath been seen and noted in all this Historie.</p>
                     <p>A great part of the night they passed in these and such like discourses, but <hi>Sancho</hi> had
a great desire to let fall the Port-cullices (as hee called them) of his eyes, and sleepe;
and so undressing his Dapple, hee turned him freely to graze: with <hi>Rozinantes</hi> saddle
he medled not, for it was his Masters expresse command, that whilest they were in field
or slept not, within dores, he should not unsaddle him; it being an ancient custome
observed by Knights Errant, to take the bridle and hang it at the saddle pummell; but
beware taking away the saddle, which <hi>Sancho</hi> observed, and gave him the same liberty
as to his Dapple, whose friendship and <hi>Rozinantes</hi> was so sole and united, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
goes by tradition from father to sonne, that the Author of this true History made
particular chapters of it, only to keepe the decency and decorum due to so Heroick a
Story: he omitted it, although somtimes he forgets his purpose herein, and writes,
that as the two beasts were together, they would scratch one anothee, and being weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and satisfied, <hi>Rozinante</hi> would crosse his throat over Dapples neck at least halfe a
yard over the other side; and both of them looking wistly on the ground, they would
stand thus three dayes together, at least as long as they were let alone, or that hunger
compelled them not to look after their provinder.</p>
                     <p>'Tis said (I say) that the Authour in his Story, compared them, in their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe,
to <hi>Nisus</hi> and <hi>Eurialus,</hi> to <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> which if it were so, it may bee
seene (to the generall admiration) how firm and stedfast the friendship was of these
two pacifique beasts, to the shame of men, that so ill know the rules of friendship one
to another. For this it was said, No falling out like to that of friends. And let no man
think the Author was unreasonable, in having compared the friendship of these beasts,
to the friendshippe of men; for men have received many items from Beasts, and learne
many things of importance, as the Storks dung, the Dogs vomit and faithfullnesse, the
Cranes watchfullnesse, the Ants providence, the Elephants honesty, and the Horses
loyaltie.</p>
                     <p>At length <hi>Sancho</hi> fell fast a sleepe at the foote of a Corke-tree, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himselfe under an Oake: But not long after, a noyse behinde wakened him, and
rising suddainly, hee looked and hearkned from whence the noyse came, and he saw two
men on horseback, and the one tumbling from his saddle, said to the other; Alight
friend, and unbridle our horses, for mee thinks this place hath pasture enough for them,
and befits the silence and solitude of my amorous thoughts: thus he spoke, and stretche
himselfe upon the stround in an instant, but casting himselfe down, his Armor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was armed, made a noyse; a manifest token that made <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thinke
hee was some Knight Errant, and comming to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who was fast asleepe, hee
<pb facs="tcp:54746:173"/>
pluck't him by the Arme, and told him softly. Brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> wee have an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
God grant it bee good (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and where is this Master-Adventures.
Worshippe? Where <hi>Sancho</hi> (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) looke on one side, looke,
and there thou shalt see a Knight Errant stretcht, who (as it appeares to mee) is
not over much joyed, for I saw him cast himselfe from his Horse, and stretch on
the ground, with some shewes of griefe, and as hee fell, hee crossed his Armes. Why,
in what doe you perceive that this is an Adventure (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I will not say (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that this is altogether an Adventure, but an Introduction to it,
for thus Adventures begin.</p>
                     <p>But harke, it seemes hee is tuning a Lute or Violl, and by his spitting and cleering
his brest, hee prepares himselfe to sing. In good faith you say right (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>)
and 'tis some enamoured Knight. There is no Knight Errant said <hi>(Don-Quixote</hi>)
that is not so: Let us give care, and by the circumstance, wee shall search the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of his thoughts, if so bee hee sing; for out of the abundance of the Heart, the
Tongue speaketh. <hi>Sancho</hi> would have replyed to his Master; But the Knight of the
woods voice (which was but so so) hindred him, and whilst the two were astonish't,
he sung as followeth.

this Knight is wide: but let us hear him, it may be, he will unfold himself more. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

But it fell out otherwise; for the Knight of the wood, having over-heard that they
talked somewhat neere him, ceasing his complaints, he stood up, and with a cleer,
but familiar voice thus spake, Who's there, who is it? Is it haply some of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the contented, or of the afflicted? Of the afflicted (answered <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>)
Come to mee then (said he of the wood) and make account, you come to sadnesse
it selfe, and to afflictions selfe. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> when hee saw himselfe answered so
tenderly, and so modestly, drew neere, and <hi>Sancho</hi> likewise. The wailefull Knight
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54746:173"/>
laid hold on <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> arme, saying, Sit downe, Sir Knight: for to know that
you are so, and one that professeth Knight Errantrie, it is enough that I have found you
in this place, where solitarines, and the <hi>Serene</hi> beare you company, [Serene, <hi>the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew
that falls:]</hi> the naturall beds, and proper beings for Knights Errant.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replied, A Knight I am, and of the profession you speake
of, and though disgraces, misfortunes, and sorrowes have their proper seat in my
minde: notwithstanding, the compassion I have to other mens griefs, hath not left
it: by your complaints I ghesse you are enamoured, I meane, that you love that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
faire one, mentioned in your laments. Whilst they were thus discoursing,
they sat together lovingly upon the cold ground, as if by day breake, their heads also
would not breake.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the wood demanded, Are you happily enamoured, Sir Knight?
Unhappily I am (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) although the unhappinesse that ariseth from
well-placed thoughts, ought rather to bee esteemed a happinesse then otherwise. True
it is (replied he of the wood) if disdaines did not vexe our reason and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
which being unmercifull, come neerer to revenge. I was never (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
disdained of my Mistris. No indeed (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) who was neere them: for my
Lady is as gentle as a lambe, and as soft as butter. Is this your Squire (said he of the
wood?) He is (said <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>) I ne're saw Squire (replied he of the wood)
that durst prate so boldly before his Master, at least yonder is mine, as bigge as his father,
and I can proove he never unfolded his lippes, whensoever I spake.</p>
                     <p>Well yfaith (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I have spoken, and may speake before, as, and perhaps:
but let it alone, the more it is stirred, the more it will stinke. The Squire of the
wood tooke <hi>Sancho</hi> by the hand, saying: Let us goe and talke what we list Squire-like,
and let us leave these our Masters, Let them fall from their launces and tell of their
Loves: for I warrant you, the morning will overtake them, before they have done.
A Gods name (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and Ile tell you who I am, that you may see whether I
may be admitted into the number of your talking Squires. So the two Squires went
apart, betweene whom there passed as wittie a Dialogue, as their Master was serious.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Knights and their Squires were devided, these telling their lives,
they their loves: and thus say'th the Storie, that the Squire of the
wood said to <hi>Sancho,</hi> It is a cumbersome life that we leade, Sir,
we, I say, that are Squires to Knights Errant: for truely we eate
our bread with the sweat of our browes, which is one of the curses,
that God laid upon our first parents. You may say also (added
<hi>Sancho</hi>) that we eate it in the frost of our bodies: for who endure
more heats and colds, then your miserable Squires to Knights Errant? and yet not so
bad if we might eate at all, for good fare lessens care: but sometimes it happens, that
we are two daies without eating, except it be the ayre that blowes on us. All this may
be borne (quoth he of the wood) with the hope we have of reward: for if the Knight
Errant whom a Squire serves, be not two unfortunate, he shall, with a little good hap,
see himselfe rewarded with the government of some Island, or with a reasonable Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:174"/>
I (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) have often told my Master, that I would content my self with
the government of any Island, and hee is so Noble and Liberall, that hee hath often
promised it me. I (said hee of the Wood) for my services would bee satisfied with
some Canonrie which my Master too hath promised me.</p>
                     <p>Your Master indeed (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) belike is an Ecclesiasticall Knight, and may doe
his good Squires these kindenesses; but my Master is meerly Lay, though I remember
that some persons of good discretion (though out of bad intention) counselled him,
that hee should bee an Arch-Bishop; which hee would not bee, but an Emperour:
and I was in a bodily fear, lest hee might have a minde to the Church, because I held my
self uncapable of benifits by it: for let me tell you, though to you I seem a man, yet in
Church matters I am a very beast. Indeed Sir (said hee of the Wood) you are in the
wrong; for your Island-Governments are not all so speciall, but that some are crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
some poor, some distastefull; and lastly, the stateliest and best of all brings with
it a heavy burden of cares and inconveniences, which hee (to whom it falls to his lot)
undergoes. Farre better it were that wee who professe this cursed slavery, retire
home, and there entertain our selves with more delightfull exercises, to wit, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and fishing; for what Squire is there in the World so poor that wants his
Nag, his brace of Gray-Hounds, or his Angle-rod, to passe his time with at his
Village?</p>
                     <p>I want none of this (said <hi>Sancho:</hi>) true it is, I have no Nag; but I have an Asse worth
two of my Masters Horse; An ill Christmas God send me (and let it bee the next
ensuing) if I would change for him, though I had four bushels of Barley to boot: you
laugh at the price of my Dapple, for Dapple is the colour of mine Asse: Well, Gray-Hounds
I shall not want neither, there being enough to spare in our Town; besides,
the sport is best at another mans charge.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, indeed, Sir Squire (said hee of the Wood) I have proposed and determined
with my self to leave these bezelings of these Knights, and return to my Village, and
bring up my Children; for I have three like three Orient pearls. Two have I (said
<hi>Sancho</hi>) that may been presented to the Pope in person, especially one, a W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nch,
which I bring up to bee a Count esse (God save her) although it grieve her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And how olde (asked hee of the Wood) is this Lady-Countesse that you bring
up so?</p>
                     <p>Fifteen, somewhat under or over (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) but shee is as long as a Launce, and
as fresh as an <hi>Aprill-</hi> morning, and as sturdie as a Porter. These are parts (said hee of
the Wood) not only for her to bee a Countesse, but a Nymph of the Greeny Grove:
Ah whoreson, whore, and what a sting the Quean hath! To which (quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
somewhat musty) shee is no Whore, neither was her Mother before her; and none of
them (God willing) shall bee, as long as I live; and I pray Sir speak more mannerly;
for these speeches are not consonant from you that have been brought
up amongst Knights Errant, the flowres of courtesie: Oh (said hee of the Wood) Sir
Squire, how you mistake, and how little you know what belongs to praising: what?
have you never observed, that when any Knight in the Market-place gives the Bull a
sure thrust, with his Launce, or when any body doth a thing well, the common people
use to say, Ah whoreson whoremaster, how bravely hee did it? so that that which seems
to bee a dispraise, in that sence is a notable commendation; and renounce you those
sonnes and daughters that doe not the works that may make their Parents deserve such
like praises. I doe renounce (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and if you meant no otherwise, I pray you
clap a whole Whore-house at once upon my Wife and Children; for all they doe or
say, are extreams worthy of such praises, and so I may see them, God deliver me out
of this mortall sinne, that is out of this dangerous profession of being a Squire, into
which this second time I have incurr'd, being inticed and deceived with the Purse of the
hundred Duckats which I found one day in the heart of <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi> and the Devill
cast that bag of Pistolets before mine eyes: me thinks every foot I touch it, hugg it,

when I think of this, all the toyle that I passe with this Block-head, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,

seemes easie and tolerable to mee, who, I know, is more Mad-man then
Knight.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon (said he of the Wood) it is said; that, <hi>All covet, all lose:</hi> And now you

himselfe mad, and will seeke after that, which perhaps once found, will tumble him
upon his snowt. And is he amorous haply? Yes (sayd he of the Wood) hee loves
one <hi>Casildea de Vandalia,</hi> the most raw and most rosted Lady in the world; but she
halts not on that foot of her rawnesse, for other manner of impostures doe grunt in
those entrailes of hers, which ere long will be knowne.</p>
                     <p>There is no way so plaine (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that hath not some rubbe, or pit, or
as the Proverbe goes; In some houses they seethe beanes, and in mine whole kettles
full. So madnesse hath more companions, and more needie ones then wisedome. But
if that which is commonly spoken be true, that to have companions in misery is a
lightner of it, you may comfort me, that serve as sottish a Master as I doe. Sottish
but valiant, (answered he of the wood) but more knave then foole or then valiant.
It is not so with my Master, said <hi>Sancho:</hi> for he is ne're a whit knave; rather he is
as dull as a Beetle, hurts no-body, does good to all, he hath no malice, a childe will
make him beleeve 'tis night at noon day: and for his simplicity, I love him as my heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings,
and cannot finde in my heart to leave him for all his fopperies. For all that,
Brother and friend, (said he of the wood) if the blinde guide the blinde, both will
be in danger to fall into the pit.</p>
                     <p>'Tis better to retire faire and softly, and returne to our loved homes: for they
that hunt after Adventures, doe not alwaies light upon good <hi>Sancho</hi> spit often, and
as it seemed, a kinde of glewy and dry matter: which noted by the charitable wooddy
Squire, he said, Me thinkes with our talking our tongues cleave to our roofes: but
I have suppler hangs at the pummel of my horse as good as touch: And rising up, hee
returned presently with a Borracha of Wine, and a bak'd meat at least half a yard long;
and it is no lye; for it was of a perboyled Cony so large that <hi>Sancho,</hi> when he felt it,
thought it had been of a Goat, and not a Kid: which being seen by <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee said,
And had yee this with you too Sir? Why, what did yee think (said the other?) Doe
you take me to bee some hungrie Squire? I have better provision at my horses crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then a Generall carries with him upon a Martch. <hi>Sancho</hi> fell to without invitation,
and champed his bits in the dark, as if he had scraunched knotted cords, and said, I marry

your feast) which if it came not hither by way of inchantment, yet it seems so at least,

that you may breake a Gyants head with it, and only some dozens of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Weed
leaves, and some few Wall-nuts and Small-nuts (plentie in the strictnesse of my Master
and the opinion hee hath) and the method hee observes, that Knights Errant must only
bee maintained and susteined only with a little dry fruit and sallets. By my faith Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(replied hee of the Wood) my stomack is not made to your thistles nor your stalks,
nor your mountain-roots: let our Masters deale with their opinions and their Knightly
Statutes, and eate what they will, I have my cold meats, and this bottle hanging at the
pommel of my saddle, will hee or nill hee; which I reverence and love so much, that
a minute passeth not, in which I give it not a thousand kisses and embraces: which said,
he gave it to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who rearing it on end at his mouth, looked a quarter of an hour
together upon the starres; and when hee had ended his draught hee held his neck on
one side, and fetching a great sigh, cries, Oh whoreson Rascall, how Catholike it is?
I aw yee there (said hee of the wood, in hearing <hi>Sancho's</hi> whoreson) how you have
praised the wine in calling it whoreson. I say, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I confesse I know it is
no dishonour to call any body whoreson, when their is a meaning to praise him. But

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with a leatherne thong han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
at it. Now you may see, whether he that comes from such a race, may give his
opinion in these matters.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I say to you (quoth he of the wood) let us leave looking after these
Adventures, and since we have content, let us not seeke after dainties, but returne to
our cottages, for there God will finde us, if it be his will. Till my Master come to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragosa,</hi>
I meane (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) to serve him, and then weele all take a new course.
In fine, the two good Squires talked and drank so much, that it was fit sleepe should
lay their tongues, and slake their thirst, but to extinguish, it was impossible; so
both of them fastned to the nigh emptie bottle, and their meate scarce out of their
mouthes, fell asleepe: where for the present wee will leave them, and tell what passed
between the two Knights.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst many discourses that passed between <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and the
Knight of the Wood, the Historie saies that hee of the Wood said to
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> In brief, Sir Knight, I would have you know that my
destinie, or to say better my election enamoured me upon the peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Casildea de Vandalia;</hi> Peerlesse I call her, as being so in the
greatnesse of her Stature, and in the extream of her being and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
This <hi>Casildea</hi> I tell you of, repaid my good and virtuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in employing me, as did the step-mother of <hi>Hercules,</hi> in many and different perils,
promising me at the accomplishing of each one, in performing another, I should
enjoy my wishes: but my labours have been so linked one upon another that they are
numberlesse, neither know I which may bee the last to give an accomplishment to my
lawfull desires.</p>
                     <p>Once shee commanded me to give desiance to that famous Gyantesse of <hi>Sevill,</hi>
called the <hi>Giralda,</hi> who is so valiant and so strong (as being made of brasle and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
changing place) is the most moveable and turning woman in the world. I came, I
saw, and conquered her, and made her stand still and keep distance; for a whole week
together no windes blew but the North. Other whiles shee commanded me to lift
up the ancient stones of the fierce Bulls of <hi>Guisando [As if wee should say, to remove the
stones at</hi> Stonage <hi>in</hi> Wiltshire,] an enterprize sitter for Porters then Knights. Another
time shee commanded me to goe down and dive in the Vault of <hi>Cabra</hi> (a fearfull and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54746:175"/>
unheard of attempt) and to bring her relation of all that was inclosed in that darke
profunditie. I staid the motion of the <hi>Goralda,</hi> I waied the Buls of <hi>Guisando,</hi> I cast
my selfe downe the steepe Cave, and brought to light the secrets of that bottome, but
my hopes were dead, how dead? her disdaines still living, how living? Lastly, she hath
now commanded mee, that I run over all the Provinces of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and make all the
Knights Errant, that wander in them, confesse; That shee alone goes beyond all other
women in beauty, and that I am the valiantest, and most enamoured Knight of the
world: in which demand I have travelled the greatest part of Spaine, and have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
many Knights, that durst contradict mee. But that which I prize and esteeme
most is. That I have conquer'd in single combat, that so famous Knight <hi>Don-Quixote
de la Mancha,</hi> and made him confesse that my <hi>Casildea</hi> is fayrer then his <hi>Dulcinea,</hi>
and in this conquest only I make account, that I have conquer'd all the Knights in the
world, because the aforesaid <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hath conquered them all, and I having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
him, his fame, his glorie and his honour hath beene transferred and passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to my person, and the Conqueror is so much the more esteemed, by how much the
conquered was reputed, so that the innumerable exploits of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are mine, and passe upon my account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> admired to heare the Knight of the Wood, and was a thousand times
about to have given him the lie, and had his <hi>Thou Lyest,</hi> upon the point of his tongue;
but hee defer'd it as well as hee could, to make him confesse with his owne mouth that
he lyed, and so hee told him calmly; That you may have overcome (Sir Knight all
the Knights Errant of Spaine, and the whole world, I grant yee; but that you have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> I doubt it; it may be some other like him, though
few there bee so like. Why not? replyed hee of the Wood: I can assure you Sir,
I fought with him, overcame and made him yield. Hee is a tall fellow, withered faced,
lanke and dry in his limbes, somewhat hory, sharpe-nosed and crooked; his musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes
long, black and falne; hee marcheth under the name of <hi>The Knight of the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Countenance:</hi> hee presses the loine, and rules the bridle of a famous horse called
<hi>Rozinante,</hi> and hath for the Mistrisse of his thoughts, one <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called <hi>Aldonsa Lorenso,</hi> just as mine, that because her name was <hi>Casilda,</hi> and of
<hi>Andaluzia,</hi> I call her <hi>Casildea de Vandalia:</hi> And if all these tokens bee not enough
to countenance the truth, here is my Sword that shall make incredulity it selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it. Have patience good Sir Knight (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and heare what I
shall say.</p>
                     <p>Know that this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> you speake of, is the greatest friend I have in this world
and so much that I may tell you, I love him as well as my selfe, and by the signes that
you have given of him, so punctuall and certaine, I cannot but thinke it is hee whom
you have overcome. On the other side, I see with mine eyes, and feele with my hands,
that it is not possible it should be hee, if it bee not, that, as hee hath many Enchanters
that bee his Enemies, especially one that doth ordinarily persecute him, there be some
one that hath taken his shape on him, and suffered himselfe to bee overcome, to defraud
him of the glory which his noble Chivalry hath gotten &amp; laid up for him throughout the
whole earth. And for confirmation of this, I would have you know, that these Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
mine Enemies (not two daies since) transformed the shape and Person of the
faire <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> into a foule and base country wench, and in this sort belike
they have transformed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and if all this bee not sufficient to direct you in
the truth, here is <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himselfe, that will maintaine it with his Armes on foote
or on horse back, or in what manner you please; and hee grasped his Sword, expecting
what resolution the Knight of the Wood would take; who with a stayed voice answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and said: A good Pay-master needes no surety; he that could once, <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
overcome you when you were transformed, may very well hope to restore you to your
former being. But because it becomes not Knights to doe their feats in the darke, like
high-way Robbers and Ruffians, let us stay for the day, that the Sunne may behold our
actions; and the condition of our combat shall bee, that hee that is therein over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
shall stand to the mercy of the Conqueror; who by his Victory, shall have power
<pb facs="tcp:54746:176"/>
to doe with him according to his will, so far as what he ordaineth shall bee fitting
for a Knight.</p>
                     <p>I am over-joyed with this condition and agreement (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>) And
(this said) they went where their Squires were, whom they found snorting, and just
as they were when sleep first stole upon them. They wakened them and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they should make their Horses ready: For by Sunne-rising they meant to have
a bloody and unequall single combat: At which newes <hi>Sancho,</hi> was astonish'd
and amazed, as fearing his Masters safety, by reason of the Knight of the Wood's
valour, which hee had heard from his Squire: But without any reply, the two
Squires went to seek their Cattell, for by this the three horses and Dapple had smelt out
one another, and were together.</p>
                     <p>By the way, hee of the Wood said to <hi>Sancho,</hi> You must understand Brother, that
your Combatants of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> use, when they are Sticklers in any quarrell, not to
stand idlely with their hands in their Pockets, whilest their friends are fighting. I
tell you this, because you may know That whilest our Masters are at it, wee must
skirmish too, and breake our Launces to shivers. This custome Sir Squire (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Sancho</hi>) may bee currant there, and passe amongst your Ruffians and Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
you talke of: But with your Squires that belong to Knights Errant, not so
much as a thought of it; At least I have not heard my Master so much as speake a word
of any such custome, and hee knowes without booke all the Ordinances of Knight
Errantry. But let mee grant yee, that 'tis an expresse Ordinance that the Squires
sight, whilest their Masters doe so; yet I will not fulfill that, but pay the penalty that
shall bee imposed upon such peaceable Squires; for I doe not thinke it will bee above
two pound of Waxe, [<hi>alluding to some penalties enjoyned by Confessors, to pay to burn in
Candles in the Church</hi>] and I had rather pay them, for I know they will cost meo
lesse then the lint that I shall spend in making Tents to cure my Head, which already I
make account is cut and divided in two; besides, 'tis impossible I should fight, having
never a Sword, and I never wore any.</p>
                     <p>For that (quoth he of the Wood) Ile tell you a good remedy, I have here two
linnen bags of one bignesse, you shall have one, and I the other, and with these equall
weapons, weele fight at bag-blowes, Let us doe so and you will (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) for this
kind of fight will rather serve to dust, then to wound us. Not so said the other, for
within the bags (that the wind may not carry them too and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>) we will put halfe a
dozen of delicate smooth pibbles, of equall weight, and so we may bag-baste one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without doing any great hurt. Look ye, body of my father (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) what
Martins or sables-fur, or what fine carded-wooll he puts in the bags, not to beat out our
brains, or make <hi>Privet</hi> of our bones; but know Sir, if they were silke balls, I would not
fight; let our Masters fight, and heare on it in another world, let us drink and live, for
time will be careful to take away our lives, without our striving to end them before their
time and season, and that they drop before they are ripe. For all that (said hee of
the Wood) we must fight halfe an houre. No, no (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) I will not be so discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and ungratefull, as to wrangle with whom I have eaten and drunk, let the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
be never so small, how much more I being without choller or anger, who the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
can barely without these fight?</p>
                     <p>For this (said he of the Wood) Ile give you a sufficient cause, which is, that before
we begin the combat, I will come me finely to you, and give you three or foure boxes,
and strike you to my feet, with which I shall awake your choller, although it sleep like a
Dormouse. Against this cut I have another (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that comes not short of
it; I will take me a good cudgell, and before you waken my choller, I will make you
sleep so soundly with bastinadoing you, that you shall not wake but in another world, in
which it shall be known, that I am not he that will let any man handle my face; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man looke to the shaft hee-shootes: And the best way were to let every mans
choller sleep with him, for no man knows what's in another, and many come for wooll,
that returne shorne; and God, in all times, blessed the Peace-makers, and ever cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Quarreller; for if a Cat shut into a Roome, much baited and straightned, turne
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54746:176"/>
to be a Lyon, God knowes what I that am a man may turne to: Therefore, from
henceforward, Sir Squire, let me intimate to you, that all the evill and
mischefe that shall arise from our Quarrell, bee upon your head. 'Tis
well (quoth hee of the Wood) let it bee day and wee shall thrive by
this.</p>
                     <p>And now a thousand sorts of painted Birds began to chirp in the Trees and in their
different delightfull Tones, it seemed they bad good morrow, and saluted the fresh
<hi>Aurora</hi> that now discovered the beauty of her face, thorow the gates and bay-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the East, shaking from her locks an infinite number of liquid pearls, bathing
the hearbs in her sweet liquor, that it seemed they also sprouted, and rained white and
small pearls: the Willows did distill their savory Manna; the Fountains laughed;
the Brooks murmured; the Woods were cheered; and the Fields were enriched with
her comming.</p>
                     <p>But the brightnesse of the day scarce gave time to distinguish things, when the first
thing that offered it self to <hi>Sancho's</hi> sight, was the Squire of the Woods nose, which
was so huge that it did as it were shadow his whole body: It is said indeed that it was
of an extraordinary bignesse, crooked in the middest, and all full of warts of a darkish
green colour, like <hi>Berengene,</hi> and hung some two fingers over his mouth: This huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
colour, warts, and crookednesse, did so disfigure his face, that <hi>Sancho</hi> in seeing
him, began to lay about him backward and forward, like a young raw Ancient, and
resolved with himself to endure two hundred boxes, before his choller should waken to
fight with that Hobgoblin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beheld his opposite, and perceived that his Helmet was on and drawn,
so that hee could not see his face; but hee saw that hee was well set in his body, though
not tall: upon his armour hee wore an upper garment or Cassock, to see to, of pure cloth
of gold, with many Moons of shining Looking-glasses spread about it, which made him
appear very brave and gorgeous; a great plume of green feathers waved about his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
with others white and yellow; his Launce which hee had reared up against a Tree
was very long and thick, and with a steel pike above a handfull long. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
observed and noted all, and by what hee had seen and marked, judged that the said
Knight must needs bee of great strength: But yet hee was not afraid (like <hi>Sancho</hi>) and
with a bold courage thus spoke to the Knight of the Looking-glasses: If your eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to fight, Sir Knight, have not spent your courtesie, for it, I desire you to lift up
your Visor a little, that I may behold whether the livelinesse of your face bee answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that of your disposition, whether vanquished or vanquisher you bee in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
Sir Knight (answered hee of the Looking-glasses) you shall have time and
leisure enough to see me; and if I doe not now satisfie your desire, it is because I think I
shall doe a great deal of wrong to the fair <hi>Casildea de Vandalia,</hi> to delay so much time
as to lift up my Visor, till I have first made you confesse what I know you goe about.
Well, yet while wee get a horse-back <hi>(Don-Quixote</hi> said) you may resolve mee whether
I be that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> whom you said you had vanquished.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer you (said hee of the Looking-glasses) You are as like the Knight
I conquered, as one egge is to another: But, as you say, Enchanters persecute you,
and therefore I dare not affirm whether you bee hee or no. It sufficeth (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
for me, that you beleeve your being deceived: but that I may entirely
satisfie you, let's to horse; for in lesse time then you should have spent in the lifting up
your Visor (if God, my Mistris, and mine arme defend me) will I see your face; and
you shall see that I am not the vanquished <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> you speake of.</p>
                     <p>And here cutting off discourse, to horse they goe, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turn'd <hi>Rozin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante</hi>
about to take so much of the Field as was fit for him, to return to encounter his
enemie; and the Knight of the Looking-glasses did the like. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was
not gone twenty paces from him, when hee heard that hee of the Looking-glasses called
him: So the two parting the way, hee of the Glasses said, Bee mindefull, Sir Knight,
that the condition of our combat is, that the vanquished (as I have told you before)
must stand to the discretion of the vanquisher. I know it (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) so that
<pb facs="tcp:54746:177"/>
what is imposed and commanded the vanquished, bee within the bounds and limits of
Cavallerie. So it is meant said hee of the Glasses.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Don Quixote</hi> saw the strange nose of the Squire, and hee did not lesse wonder
at the sight of it then <hi>Sancho;</hi> insomuch that hee deemed him a Monster, or some new
kinde of man not usuall in the world. <hi>Sancho</hi> that saw his Master goe to fetch his
Career, would not tarrie alone with <hi>Nose autem,</hi> fearing that at one snap with t'others
Nose upon his, their fray would bee ended, that either with the blow, or it, hee should
come to ground: So hee ran after his Master, laying hold upon one of <hi>Rozinante's</hi>
stirrop leathers; and when hee thought it time for his Master to turn back, hee said;
I beseech your Worship, Master mine, that before you fall to your encounter, you help
me to climbe up yon Cork-tree, from whence I may better, and with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
then from the ground, see the gallant encounter you shall make with this
Knight.</p>
                     <p>Rather <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) thou wouldest get aloft, as into a scaffold, to
see the Bulls without danger. Let me deale truly (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) the ugly nose of that
Squire hath astonish'd me, and I dare not come neer him. Such an one it is (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
that any other but I might very well bee afraid of it; and therefore come
and I'le help thee up.</p>
                     <p>Whilest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was helping <hi>Sancho</hi> up into the Cork tree, hee of the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasses
took up room for his Career, and thinking that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would have
done the like, without looking for Trumpets sound, or any other warning signe, hee
turned his horses reins (no better to see to, nor swifter then <hi>Rozinante</hi>) and with his full
speed (which was a reasonable trot) hee went to encounter his enemie; but seeing him
busied in the mounting of <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee held in his reins and stopped in the midst of his
Career; for which his horse was most thankfull, as being unable to move. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
who thought his enemie by this came flying, set spurs lustily to <hi>Rozinantes</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
flank, and made him poste in such manner, that the Story sayes, now only hee seemed
to run, for all the rest was plain trotting heretofore. And with this unspeakable furie
he came where he of the Looking-glasses was gagging his spurs into his horse to the very
hoops, without being able to remove him a fingers length from the place where he had
set up his rest for the Career.</p>
                     <p>In this good time and conjucture <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> found his contrary puzzled with
his horse, and troubled with his Launce; for either hee could not, or else wanted time
to set it in his rest. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> that never looked into these inconveniences, safely and
without danger encountred him of the Looking-glasses so furiously, that in spight of
his teeth hee made him come to the ground from his horse crupper, with such a fall,
that stirring neither hand nor foot, he made shew as if hee had been dead. <hi>Sancho</hi> scarce
saw him down, when hee slid from the Cork-tree, and came in all haste to his Master,
who dismounted from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> got upon him of the Looking-glasses, and unlacing
his Helmet to see if hee were dead, or if hee were alive, to give him aire, hee saw (who
can tell without great admiration, wonder, and amaze to him that shall heare it) hee
saw (sayes the History) the selfe same face, the same visage, the same aspect, the same phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomie,
the same shape, the same perspective of the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco;</hi> and
as hee saw it, hee cryed aloud, Come <hi>Sancho,</hi> and behold what thou mayest see, and
not beleeve; run whoreson, and observe the power of Magick, what Witches and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters
can doe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> drew neere, and saw the Bachelour <hi>Samson Carrasco's</hi> face, and so began to
make a thousand crosles, and to blesse himself as oft. In all this while the overthrowne
Knight made no shew of living. And <hi>Sancho</hi> said to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I am of opinion,
Sir, that by all meanes you thrust your sword down this fellowes throte, that is so like
the Bachelour <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> and so perhaps in him, you shall kill some of your
enemies the Enchanters. 'Tis not ill advised (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>) So drawing out
his sword, to put <hi>Sancho's</hi> counsell in execution, the Knights Squire came in, his nose
being off, that had so dis-figured him, and sayd aloud: Take heede, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
what you doe; for hee that is now at your mercy, is the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> your
friend, and I his Squire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:54746:177"/>
Now <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing him without his former deformity, said to him, And your nose?
To which he answered, Here it is in my pocket: and putting his hand to his right
side, hee pulled out a pasted nose, and a varnisht vizard, of the manifacture described.
And <hi>Sancho</hi> more and more beholding him, with a loud and admiring voyce said,
Saint <hi>Mary</hi> defend me: and is not this <hi>Thomas Ceciall</hi> my neighbour and my Gossip?
And how say you by that (quoth the un-nosed Squire?) <hi>Thomas Ceciall</hi> I am, Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sip
and friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> and streight I will tell you, the conveyances, sleights and tricks
that brought mee hither: in the meane time request and intreat your Master, that he
touch not, misuse, wound or kill the Knight of the Looking-glasses, now at his mercy;
for doubtlesse it is the bold and ill-advized Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Knight of the Looking-glasses came to himself, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
seeing, hee clapt the bare point of his sword upon his face, and said, Thou diest, Knight,
if thou confesse not, that the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> excells your <hi>Casildea de
Vandalia</hi> in beauty: and moreover, you shall promise (if from this battell and fall
you remaine with life) to goe to the Citty of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and present your selfe from
me before her, that she may dispose of you as she pleaseth: and if she pardon you, you
shall returne to me; for the tracke of my exploits will bee your guide, and bring you
where I am, to tell mee what hath passed with her. These conditions (according to
those wee agreed on before the battell) exceed not the limits of Knight Errantrie.</p>
                     <p>I confesse, said the faln-Knight, that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso's</hi> torne and foul
shooe, is more worth then the ill-combed haire (though cleane) of <hi>Casildea:</hi> and here
I promise to goe and come from her presence to yours, and give entire and particular
relation of all you require. You shall also confesse and beleeve (added <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
that the Knight whom you overcame, neyther was, nor could bee <hi>Don-Quixote) de la
Mancha,</hi> but some other like him, as I confesse and beleeve, that you, although you
seem to be the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> are not he, but one like him, and that my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
have cast you into his shape, that I may with-hold and temper the force of my
choller, and use moderately the glory of my conquest. I confesse, judge, and allow of all
as you confesse, judge, and allow (answered the backe-broken Knight.) Let me rise,
I pray you, if the blow of my fall will let me; for it hath left me in ill case. <hi>Don Quixote</hi>
helped him to rise, and <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> his Squire, on whom <hi>Sancho</hi> still cast his eyes,
asking him questions, whose answers gave him manifest signes, that he was <hi>Thomas
Cecial</hi> indeed, as he said, but the apprehension that was made in <hi>Sancho,</hi> by what his
Master had said, that the Enchanters had changed the forme of the Knight of the
glasses into <hi>Samson Carrasco's,</hi> made him not beleeve what he saw with his eyes.
To conclude, the Master and Man remained still in their errour: and he of the glasses
and his Squire very moody and ill Errants, left <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> purposing to seeke
some towne where he might seare-cloth himself, and settle his ribbes. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and <hi>Sancho</hi> held on their way to <hi>Saragosa,</hi> where the story leaves them, to tell who
was the Knight of the Glasses and his Nosie Squire.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>On-Quixote</hi> was extreamly contented, glad and vain-glorious, that hee
had subdued so valiant a Knight as hee imagined hee of the Looking-glasses
was, from whose Knightly word hee hoped to know if the
Enchantment of his Mistris were certain, since of necessity the said
vanquished Knight was to return (on pain of not being so) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
what had hapned unto him: but <hi>Don Quixote</hi> thought one
thing, and he of the Glasses another, though for the present hee
minded nothing, but to seek where hee might sear-cloth himself: The History then
tels us, that when the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> advised <hi>Don Quixote</hi> to prosecute his
forsaken Cavallery, hee entred first of all into counsell with the Vicar and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to know what means they should use, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might bee perswaded to
stay at home peaceably and quietly, without troubling himself with his unluckie Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
from which counsail by the common consent of all, and particular opinion
of <hi>Carrasco,</hi> it was agreed, That <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> should abroad again, since it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to stay him; And that <hi>Samson</hi> should meet him upon the way like a Knight
Errant, and should fight with him, since an occasion would not bee wanting, and so to
overcome him, which would not bee difficult, and that there should bee a covenant and
agreement, that the vanquished, should stand to courtesie of the vanquisher, so that
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> being vanquished, the Bachelor Knight should command him to get him
home to his Town and House, and not to stir from thence in two yeers after, or till hee
should command him to the contrary; the which in all likelihood <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> once
vanquished would infallibly accomplish, as unwilling to contradict or bee defective in
the Laws of Knighthood, and it might so be, that in this time of sequestring, he might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all his vanities, or they might finde out some convenient remedie for his madnesse.
<hi>Carrasco</hi> accepted of it, and <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> offered himself to bee his Squire, <hi>Sancho
Panca's</hi> neighbour and Gossip, a merry knave and a witty. <hi>Samson</hi> armed himself, as
you have heard, and <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> fitted the false nose to his own, and afterwards
hee clapt on his vizard, that hee might not bee known by his Gossip when they
should meet: So they held on the same voyage with <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and they came
even just as hee was in the Adventure of Deaths Waggon: And at last they lighted on
them in the Wood, where what befell them, the discreet Reader hath seen, and if it had
not been for the strange opinion that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had, that the Bachelor was not the
selfe-same man, hee had been spoyled for ever, for taking another Degree since hee mist
his mark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> that saw what ill use hee had made of his hopes, and the bad effect that
his journey took, said to the Bachelor; Truely Master <hi>Samson</hi> wee have our deserts;
things are easily conceived, and enterprizes easily undertaken, but very hardly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<hi>Don Quixote</hi> mad; we wife; but he is gone away sound and merry; you are here
bruised and sorrowfull; let us know then who is the greatest mad-man, he that is so and
cannot doe withall, or he that is so for his pleasure? The difference (quoth <hi>Samson</hi>) that
between these mad-men is, that he that of necessity is so, will alwaies remain so; &amp; he that
accidentally is so, may leave it when hee will. Since it is so (said <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi>) I that
for my pleasure was mad, when I would needs bee your Squire; for the same reason I
will leave the Office and return home to my own house. 'Tis fit you should (said
<hi>Samson</hi>) yet to think that I will doe so till I have soundly banged <hi>Don
Quixote</hi> is vain;
and now I goe not about to restore him to his wits, but to revenge my self on him; for
the intollerable pain I feel in my ribs will not permit mee a more charitable discourse.
Thus they two went on parlying, till they came to a Town where by chance they lighted
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54746:178"/>
upon a Bone-setter, who cured the unfortunate <hi>Samson. Thomas Cecial</hi> went home
and left him, and hee stayed musing upon his revenge: and the History hereafter will
return to him, which at present must make merry with <hi>Don Quixote.</hi>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>On-Quixote</hi> went on his journey with the joy, content and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as hath been mentioned, imaging that for the late victory
hee was the most valiant Knight that that age had in the world,
he made account that all adventures that should from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
befall him, were brought to a happy and prosperous end: he
cared not now for any Enchantments, or Enchanters; hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the innumerable bangs that in the prosecution of his Chivalry
had been given him, &amp; the stones cast, that strook out half his teeth,
and the unthankfullnesse of the Gally-slaves, and the boldnesse and showres of stakes of
the <hi>Yangueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In conclusion hee said to himself, that if hee could finde any Art, Manner, or
Means how to disinchant his Mistris <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> he would not envie the greatest happines
or prosperity that ever any Knight Errant of former times had obtained.</p>
                     <p>Hee was altogether busied in these imaginations, when <hi>Sancho</hi> told him: How say
you Sir, that I have still before mine eyes that ill-favoured, more then ordinary, nose
of my Gossip <hi>Thomas Cecial?</hi> And doe you hapily <hi>Sancho,</hi> think that the Knight of
the Looking Glasses was the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> and his Squire <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi>
your Gossip? I know not what to say to it (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) only I know, that the
tokens hee gave me of my House, Wife, and Children, no other could give um me
but he; and his face (his nose being off) was the same that <hi>Thomas Cecials,</hi> as I have
seen him many times in our Town, and next house to mine; and his voyce was the
same. Let us bee reasonable <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don Quixote:</hi>) Come hither: How
can any man imagine that the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> should come like a Knight
Errant, arm'd with Armes offensive and defensive, to fight with me? Have I ever given
him occasion, that hee should dog me? Am I his <hi>Rivall?</hi> or is hee a professor of Arms,
to envie the glory that I have gotten by them? Why, what should I say (answered
<hi>Sancho</hi>) when I saw that Knight (bee hee who hee will) looke so like the Bachelor
<hi>Carrasco,</hi> and his Squire to <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> my Gossip? and if it were an Enchantment
(as you say) were there no other two in the World they might look like? All is jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and cunning (quoth <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) of the Wicked Magicians that persecute me,
who fore-seeing that I should remain Victor in this Combat, had provided that the
vanquisht Knight should put on the shape of my friend <hi>Carrasco,</hi> that the friendship
I beare him might mediate betwixt the edge of my Sword and the rigour of my arme,
and temper my hearts just indignation; and so, that hee might escape with his life,
that with tricks and devices sought to take away mine: For proof of which, oh <hi>Sancho!</hi>
thou knowest by experience, that will not let thee lye or be deceived, how easie it is for
Enchanters to change one face into another, making the beautifull deformed, and the
deformed beautifull; and it is not two dayes, since with thine own eyes thou sawst the
beauty and livelinesse of the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in its perfection and naturall confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
and I saw her in the foulnes and meanesse of a course Milk-maid, with bleare-eyes
and stinking breath, so that the perverse Enchanter that durst cause so wicked a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis,
'tis not much that hee hath done the like in the shapes of <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:179"/>
and <hi>Thomas Cecial,</hi> to rob me of the glory of my conquest. Notwithstanding I am of
good comfort; for in what shape soever it were, I have vanquished mine enemy.
God knowes all (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and whereas hee knew the transformation of <hi>Dulcinea</hi>
had beene a tricke of his, his Masters <hi>Chimera's</hi> gave him no satisfaction: but he durst
not reply a word, for feare of discovering his cozenage.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they were thus reasoning, one overtooke them that came their way, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a faire flea-bitten Mare, upon his backe a riding coate of fine greene cloth, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with tawny Velvet, with a Hunters cap of the same; his Mares furnitur was for the
field, and after the Genet fashion, of the said tawny and greene, he wore a Moorish
Semiter, hanging at a broad Belt of greene and gold, his buskins were wrought with
the same that his belt was, his spurs were not gilt, but layd on with a greene varnish,
so smooth and burnisht, that they were more sutable to the rest of his clothes, then
if they had beene of beaten gold. Comming neere, he saluted them courteously, and
spurring his Mare, rode on: But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said to him, Gallant, if you goe our
way, and your haste be not great, I should take it for a favour that wee might ride
together. Truly Sir, said he with the Mare, I should not ride from you, but that I feare
your horse will bee unruly with the company of my Mare. You may well, Sir (said
<hi>Sancho</hi>) you may well reyne in your Mare: for our horse is the honestest and maner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
horse in the world; he is never unruly upon these occasions; and once when hee
flew out, my Master and I payed for it with a witnesse. I say againe, you may stay if
you please, for although your Mare were given him betweene two dishes, he would
not looke at her.</p>
                     <p>The Passenger held in his reines, wondring at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> countenance and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
who was now without his helmet, for <hi>Sancho</hi> carried it in a Cloke-bag at the
pummell of Dapples pack-saddle: and if hee in the Greene did much looke at <hi>Don-Quixote,
Don-Quixote</hi> did much more eye him, takeing him to be a man of worth; his
age shewed him to bee about fifty, having few gray haires, his face was somewhat
sharp, his countenance of an equall temper: Lastly, in his fashion and posture, hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be a man of good quality. His opinion of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was, that hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seene such a kinde of man before; the lanknesse of his horse, the talenesse of his
owne body, the sparenesse and palenesse of his face made him admire; his armes, his
gesture and composition, a shape and picture, as it were, had not beene seene (many
ages before) in that Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> noted well with what attention the Traveller beheld him, and in
his suspence read his desire, and being so courteous and so great a friend, to give all
men content, before he demanded him any thing to prevent him, he said: This out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of mine that you have seene, Sir, because it is so rare and different from others
now in use, may (no doubt) have bred some wonder in you: which you will cease,
when I shall tell you, as now I doe, that I am a Knight, one of those (as you would say)
that seeke their fortunes. I went out of my Countrey, engaged mine estate, left my
pleasure, commited my selfe to the Armes of Fortune, to carry me whither she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
My desire was to raise againe the dead Knight Errantry, and long agoe stumbling
heere, and falling there, casting my selfe headlong in one place, and rising up in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I have accomplished a great part of my desire, succouring Widdowes, defending
Damzels, favouring married women, Orphans, and distressed children (the proper
and naturall office of Knights Errant) so that by my many valiant and Christian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts,
I have merited to be in the Presse, in all or most nations of the world: thirty
thousand volumes of my History have been printed, and thirty thousand millions more
are like to be if Heaven permit. Lastly, to shut up all in a word, I am <hi>Don-Quixote
de la Mancha,</hi> otherwise called, <hi>The Knight of the Sorrowfull Countenance:</hi> And
though one should not praise himself, yet I must needs doe it, that is, there being none
present that may doe it for me: so that, kinde Gentle-man, neither this horse, this
lance, nor this shield, nor this Squire, nor all these armes together, nor the palenesse of
my face, nor my slender macilency, ought henceforward to admire you, you know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now who I am, and the profession I maintaine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54746:179"/>
This sayd, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was silent, and hee with the greene Coat was a great while
ere he could answer, as if hee could not hit upon't: but after some pause, hee sayd:
You were in the right, Sir Knight, in knowing, by my suspension, my desire: but
yet you have not quite remooved my admiration, which was caused with seeing
you; for although that, as you say Sir, that to know who you are might make me
leave wondring, it is otherwise rather, since now I know it, I am in more suspence and
wonderment: And is it possible that at this day there bee Knights Errant in the
world? and that there bee true Histories of Knighthood printed? I cannot perswade
my self, that any now favor widows, defend Damzels, honour married Women, or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
Orphans; and I should never have beleeved it, if I had not in you beheld it with
mine eyes: Blessed bee Heavens! for with this History you speak of, which is printed
of your true and lofty Chivalrie, those innumerable falsities of fained Knights Errant
will bee forgotten, which the world was full of, so hurtfull to good education and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to true Stories.</p>
                     <p>There is much to bee spoken (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) whether the Histories of Knights
Errant were fained or true. Why, is there any that doubts (said hee in the Green)
that they bee not false? I doe (said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>) and let it suffice; for if our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
last, I hope in God to let you see that you have done ill, to bee led with the stream
of them that hold they are not true. At this last speech of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> the Traveller
suspected hee was some Ideot, and expected when some others of his might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it: but before they should bee diverted with any other discourse <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
desired to know who hee was, since hee had imparted to him his condition and life.
Hee in the Green made answer; I, Sir <hi>Knighs of the Sorrowfull Countenance,</hi> am a
Gentleman borne in a Town, where (God willing) wee shall dine to day: I am well
to live; my name is <hi>Don Diego de Miranda;</hi> I spend my life with my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Friends: my sports are Hunting and Fishing: but I have neither Hawk
nor Gray-Hounds; only a tame Cock-Partridge, or a murthering Ferret; some six
dozen of Books, some Spanish, some Latin, some History, others Devotion: Your
Books of Knighthood have not yet entred the threshold of my door: I doe more
turn over your Prophane Books then Religious, if they bee for honest recreation, such
as may delight for their language, and admire and supend for their invention, although
in <hi>Spain</hi> there bee few of these. Sometimes I dine with my neighbours and friends,
and other whiles invite them: My Meals are neat and handsome, and nothing scarce:
I neither love to back-bite my self, nor to hear others doe it: I search not into other
mens lives, or am a <hi>Lynce</hi> to other mens actions: I heare every day a Masse; part my
Goods with the Poor, without making a muster of my good Deeds, that I may not
give way to hypocrisie and vain-glory to enter into my heart, enemies that easily seize
upon the wariest brest: I strive to make Peace between such as are at Ods: I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to our blessed Lady, and alwaies trust in Gods infinite Mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was most attentive to this relation of the life and entertainments of this
Gentleman, which seeming to him to be good and holy, and that he that led it worked
miracles, hee flung himself from Dapple, and in great haste laid hold of his right stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop,
and with the tears in his eyes often kissed his feet; which being seen by the
Gentleman, he asked him, What doe you Brother? Wherefore be these kisses?</p>
                     <p>Let me kisse (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for, me thinks, your Worship is the first Saint that in
all the dayes of my life I ever saw a horse-back. I am no Saint (said hee) but a great
Sinner: you indeed brother are, and a good Soul, as your simplicitie shews you to bee.
<hi>Sancho</hi> went again to recover his Pack-saddle, having (as it were) brought into the
Market-place his Masters laughter out of a profound melancholy, and caused a new
admiration in <hi>Don Diego.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> asked him how many sonnes hee had; who told him, that one of the
things in which the Philosophers <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> did consist (who wanted the true
knowledge of God) was in the goods of Nature, in those of Fortune; in having many
Friends, and many and virtuous Children. I, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (answered the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
have a son, whom if I had not, perhaps you would judge me more happy then I am,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:180"/>
not that he is so bad but because not so good as I would have him: he is about eighteen
yeers of age, sixe of which he hath spent in <hi>Salamenca,</hi> learning the tongues, Greeke and
Latine, and when I had a purpose that he should fall to other Sciences, I found him so
besotted with Poesy, and that Science (if so it may be called) that it is not possible to
make him look upon the Law (which I would have him study) nor Divinity the Queen
of all Sciences. I would he were the Crown of all his linage, since wee live in an age,
wherein our King doth highly reward good learning: for learning without goodnesse,
is like a pearle cast in a Swines-snout; all the day long he spends in his Critiscismes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Homer</hi> said well or ill in such a verse of his Iliads, whether <hi>Martial</hi> were bawdie
or no in such an Epigram, whether such or such a verse in <hi>Virgil</hi> ought to be understood
this way or that way. Indeed all his delight is in these aforesaid Poets, and in <hi>Horace,
Persius, Iuvenal,</hi> and <hi>Tibullus;</hi> but of modern writers he makes small account: yet for
all the grudg he beares to modern Poesie, he is mad upon your catches, and your glossing
upon four verses, which were sent him from <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and that I think is his true study.</p>
                     <p>To all which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered; Children Sir, are peeces of the very entrails
of their Parents, so let them bee good or bad they must love them, as wee must love
our spirits that give us life: It concernes their Parents to direct them, from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
in the paths of virtue, of good manners, and good and Christian exercises, that
when they come to yeeres, they may bee the staffe of their age, and the glory of their
posteritie; and I hold it not so proper, to force them to study this or that Science,
though to perswade them were not amisse, and though it bee not to studie to get his
bread (the Student being so happy, that God hath given him Parents able to leave
him well) mine opinion should bee, that they let him follow that kinde of study hee is
most inclined to, and though that of Poetry be lesse profitable then delightfull, yet it is
none of those that will dishonor the Professor.</p>
                     <p>Poetry, Signior, in my opinion; is like a tender Virgin, Young and most Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
whom many other Virgins, to wit, all the other Sciences, are to enrich, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and adorne; shee is to bee served by them all, and all are to bee authorized by her:
but this Virgin will not bee handled and hurried up and downe the streetes, nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in every market-nooke, nor Court-corners. She is made of a kinde of Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
that hee that knowes how to handle her, will quickly turne her into the purest
gold of inestimable value, hee that enjoyeth her must hold her at distance, not letting
her lash out in uncleane Satyres, nor in dull Sonnets, shee must not by any meanes bee
vendible, except in Heroick Poems, in lamentable Tragedies, or Pleasant and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Comedies: Shee must not bee medled with by Jesters, nor by the ignorant
vulgar, uncapable of knowing or esteeming the Treasures that are locked up in her;
and thinke not, Sir, that I call here only the common-people vulgar, for whosoever is
ignorant, bee hee Potentate or Prince, hee may and must enter into the number of the
vulgar: So that hee who shall handle and esteeme of Poetry with these Requisites
I have declared, hee shall bee famous, and his name shall be extolled in all the Politique
nations of the world.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Sir, your sonne neglects moderne Poesie, I perswade my selfe hee
doth not well in it, and the reason is this: Great <hi>Homer</hi> never wrote in Latine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee was a Grecian; nor <hi>Virgill</hi> in Greeke, because hee was a Latine: Indeede
all your ancient Poets wrote in the Tongue which they learnt from their Cradle, and
sought not after strange languages to declare their lofty conceits. Which being so, it
were reason this Custome should extend it selfe through all Nations, and that your
<hi>Germane</hi> Poet should not bee under valued, because hee writes in his language, nor the
<hi>Castilian,</hi> or <hi>Biscayner,</hi> because they writ in theirs: But your sonne (as I suppose)
doth not mislike moderne Poesie, but Poets that are meerely moderne, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of other Tongues or Sciences, that may adorne, rowze up, and strengthen their
natural impulse, and yet in this there may be an error. For it is a true opinion, that a
Poet is born so; the meaning is, A Poet is naturaly born a Poet from his mothers womb,
and with that inclination that heaven hath given him, without further Study or Art, he
composeth things, that verifie his saying that said, <hi>Est Deus in nobis, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54746:180"/>Let me also say, that the naturall Poet, that helps himself with Art, shall bee much
better, and have the advantage of that Poet that only out of his Art strives to bee so;
the reason is, because Art goes not beyond Nature, but only perfects it; so that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Art mixt together, and Art with Nature, make an excellent Poet: Let this
then bee the scope of my discourse Sir; let your Sonne proceed whither his Starre calls
him: for if hee bee so good a Student, as hee ought to bee, and have happily mounted
the first step of the Sciences, which is the Languages, with them (by himself) hee will
ascend to the top of humane learning, which appears as well in a Gentleman, and doth
as much adorn, honor, and ennoble him, as a Miter doth a Bishop, or a loose Cassock a
Civilian. Chide your Sonne of hee write Satyrs that may prejudice honest men, punish
him and teare them: But if hee make Sermons, like those of <hi>Horace,</hi> to the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Vice in generall, as hee so elegantly did, then cherish him, for it is lawfull for a
Poet to write against Envie, and to enveigh against envious persons in his Verse, and so
against other Vices, if so bee he aime at no particular person: But you have Poets that
instead of uttering a jerk of wit, they will venture a being banished to the Islands of
<hi>Pontus.</hi> If a Poet live honestly hee will bee so in his Verses; the pen is the mindes
tongue; as the conceits are which bee ingendred in it, such will the writings bee; and
when Kings and Princes see the miraculous Science of Poesie in wise, virtuous and
grave Subjects, they honour, esteem, and enrich them, and even crown them with the
leaves of that Tree which the thunder-bolt offends not [<hi>The Lawrell</hi>] in token that
none shall offend them that have their temples honoured and adorned with such
crowns. The Gentleman admired <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> discourse, and so much, that now he
forsook his opinion he had of him, that hee was a Coxcombe. But in the midest of this
discourse <hi>Sancho</hi> (that was weary of it) went out of the way to beg a little Milk of
some Sheepheards not farre off, curing of their Sheep: so the Gentleman still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
talk with <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> being wonderfully taken and satisfied with his wife
discourse. But <hi>Don Quixote</hi> lifting up sodainly his eyes, saw that in the way toward
them, there came a Cart full of the Kings Colours, and taking it to bee some rare Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
hee called to <hi>Sancho</hi> for his Helmet. <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing himself called on, left
the Sheepheards and spur'd Dapple apace, and came to his Master, to whom a rash and
stupendious Adventure happened.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Historie sayes, That when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> called to <hi>Sancho,</hi> to bring
him his Helmet, hee was buying curds which the Sheepheards sold
him; and being hastily laid at by his Master, hee knew not what to
doe with them, or how to bestow them without losing them; for
hee had payed for them; so hee bethought himself, and clapt them
into his Masters Helmet; and this good order taken, hee went to
see what hee would have; who, when hee came, said, Give mee,
friend, that same Helmet; for either I know not what belongs to Adventures, or
that I see yonder is one that will force me to take Armes. Hee of the green coat that
heard this, turned his eyes every way, and saw nothing but a Cart that came toward
them with two or three small flags, which made him think that the said Cart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Kings money, and so hee told <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but hee beleeved him not, alwaies
<pb facs="tcp:54746:181"/>
thinking that every thing hee saw was Adventure upon Adventure: so hee answered
the Gentleman, Hee that is warn'd is halfe arm'd: there is nothing lost in being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
for I know by experience, that I have enemies visible and invisible; and I know
not when, nor where, nor at what time, or in what shape they will set upon me: and
turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee demanded his Helmet, who wanting leisure to take the curds out,
was forced to give it him as it was. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> took it, and not perceiving what
was in it, clapt it suddainly upon his head; and as the curds were squeazed and thrust
together, the whay began to run down <hi>Don Quixote</hi> face and beard; at which hee
was in such a fright, that hee cryed out to <hi>Sancho;</hi> What ayles me <hi>Sancho?</hi> for me thinks
my skull is softned, or my brains melt, or that I sweat from top to toe; and if it bee
sweat, I assure thee it is not for fear, I believe certainly that I am like to have a terrible
Adventure of this; give me something, if thou hast it to wipe on; for this aboundance
of sweat blindes me. <hi>Sancho</hi> was silent and gave him a cloth, and with it thanks to
God, that his Master fell not into the businesse. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> wiped himself, and
took off his Helmet to see what it was, that (as hee thought) did be num his head, and
seeing those white splaches in his Helmet, hee put them to his nose, and smelling to
them, said, By my Mistris <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso's</hi> life, they are curds that thou hast brought
me here, thou base Traitor and unmannerly Squire. To which <hi>Sancho</hi> very cunningly,
and with a great deale of pawse answered: If they bee curds, give them me pray, and
I'le eate; but let the Devill eat um, for hee put um there: Should I bee so bold as to
foul your Worships Helmet? and there you have found (as I told you) who did it.
In faith Sir, as sure as God lives, I have my Enchanters too that persecute me as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and part of you, and I warrant have put that silth there to stir you up to choller,
and to make you bang my sides (as you use to doe.) Well, I hope this time they have
lost their labour; for I trust in my Masters discretion, that hee will consider that I
have neither curds nor milk, nor any such thing; for if I had, I had rather put it in my
stomack then in the Helmet. All this may bee (said <hi>Don Quixote.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>The Gentleman observed all, and wondred, especially when <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> after
hee had wiped his Head, Face, Beard, and Helmet, clapt it on again, setling himself
well in his stirrops, searching for his Sword and grasping his Launce, hee cryed out:
Now come on't what will, for here I am with a courage to meet Satan himself in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>By this, the Cart with the flags drew neere, in which there came no man but the
Carter with his Mules, and another upon the formost of them. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> put
himself forward, and asked; Whither goe ye, my masters? what Cart is this? what
doe you carry in it? and what colours be these? To which the Carter answered,
The Cart is mine, the Carriage is two fierce Lyons caged up, which the Generall of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
sends to the King at Court for a Present: these Colours be his Majesties, in signe
that what goes here is his. And are the Lyons bigge, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> So bigge
(said he that went toward the Cart dore) that there never came bigger out of <hi>Africa</hi>
into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and I am their keeper, and have carried others, but never any so bigge:
they are Male and Female, the Male is in this first grate, the Female in the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and now they are hungry, for they have not eat to day, and therefore I pray Sir
give us way; for we had neede come quickly where wee may meate them. To which
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> smiling a little) Your Lyon whelps to me? to me your Lyon
whelps? and at this time of day? Well, I vow to God, your Generall that sends um
this way shall know, whether I be one that am afraid of Lyons, Alight, honest fellow,
and if you be the Keeper, open their Cages, and let me your beasts forth; for I'le make
um know in the middest of this Champion, who <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is, in spight of those
Enchanters that sent um. Fye, fye, (said the Gentleman at this instant to himself) our
Knight shewes very well what he is, the Curds have softned his skull, and ripned his
braines. By this <hi>Sancho</hi> came to him and sayd; for Gods love handle the matter so,
Sir, that my Master meddle not with these Lyons; for if he doe they'l worry us all.
Why, is your Master so mad (quoth the Gentleman) that you feare, or beleeve hee
will fight with wilde beasts? Hee is nor mad, sayd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but hardy. I'le make
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54746:181"/>
him otherwise, said the Gentleman, and comming to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that was haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Keeper to open the Cages, sayd, Sir Knight, Knights Errant ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
adventures, that may give a likelihood of ending them well, and not such
as are altogether desperate: for valour grounded upon rashnesse, hath more madnesse
then fortitude. How much more, these Lyons come not to assayle you, they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to bee presented to his Majesty, and therefore 'twere not good to stay or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their journey. Pray get you gone, gentle Sir (quoth <hi>'Don-Quixote</hi>) and deale with
your tame Partridge, &amp; your murdring Ferret, and leave every man to his function: this
is mine, and I am sufficient to know whether these Lyons come against me or no:
so turning to the Keeper, he cried: By this-goodman slave, [Voto a tal. <hi>When hee
would seeme to sweare, but sweares by nothing.</hi>] if you doe not forthwith open the
Cage, I'le nayle you with my Launce, to your Cart. The Carter that perceived the
resolution of that armed Vision, told him, Seignior mine, will you be pleased in charity
to set me unyoke my Mules, and to put my selfe and them in safety, before I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheath
my Lyons? for if they should kill them, I am undone all dayes of my life, for
I have no other living but, this Cart and my Mules. O thou wretch of little Faith
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) light, and unyoke, and doe what thou wilt, for thou shalt see
thou mightest have saved a labour. The Carter alighted, and unyoked hastily, and
the keeper cryed out aloud, Beare witnesse, my Masters all, that I am forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my will to open the Cages and to let loose the Lyons, and that I protest to
this Gentleman, that all the harme and mischiefe that these Beasts shall doe light upon
him; besides that he pay me my wages and due. Shift you Sirs for your selves, before I
open, for I am sure they'l doe mee no hurt. The Gentleman perswaded him the second
time, that he should not attempt such a piece of madnesse; for such a folly was to
tempt God.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, that he knew what he did. The Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
That he should consider well of it, for he knew he was deceived. Well, Sir,
(sayd <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) if you will not be a spectator of this (which you thinke Tragedy)
pray spurre your Flea-bitten, and put your selfe in safety. Which when <hi>Sancho</hi> heard,
with teares in his eyes, he beseeched him to desist from that enterprize, in comparison
of which, that of the Winde-Mils was Cake-bread, and that fearefull one also of the
Fulling-Mill, or all the exployts that ever he had done in his life. Looke ye, Sir (said
<hi>Sancho</hi>) heer's no Enchantment, nor any such thing; for I have looked thorow the
grates and chinkes of the Cages, and have seene a clawe of a true Lyon, by which clawe
I ghesse the Lyon is as big as a mountaine.</p>
                     <p>Thy feare at least (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) will make him as big as half the world. Get thee
out of the way <hi>Sancho,</hi> and leave me, and if I die in the place, thou knowest our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
repayre to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and that's enough.</p>
                     <p>To these he added other reasons, by which he cut off all hope of his leaving the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that foolish enterprize.</p>
                     <p>He of the Green-coat would have hindred him, but he found himself unequally mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in weapons, and thought it no wisdome to deale with a mad man; for now <hi>'Don-Quixote</hi>
appeared no otherwise to him, who hastning the Keeper a fresh, and reiterating
his threats, made the Gentleman set spurs to his Mare, and <hi>Sancho</hi> to his Dapple, and
the Carter to his Mules, each of them striving to get as far from the Cart as they could,
before the Lyons should be unhampered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> bewailed his Masters losse; for he beleeved certainly that the Lyon would
catch him in his pawes, he cursed his fortune, and the time that ever he came again to his
Masters service; but for all his wailing and lamenting, he left not punching of Dapple,
to make him get far enough from the Cart.</p>
                     <p>The Keeper when he saw those that fled far enough off, began anew to require and
intimate to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> what he had formerly done; who answered, That he heard
him, and that he should leave his intimations, for all was needlesse, and that he should
make haste.</p>
                     <p>Whilest the Keeper was opening the first Cage, <hi>Don-Quixot</hi> began to consider,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:182"/>
whether it were best to fight on foote or on horseback: And at last hee determined
it should bee on foote, fearing that <hi>Rozinante</hi> would bee afraid to looke upon the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and thereupon he leaped from his horse, cast by his Lance, buckled his Shield to him,
and unsheathed his Sword fair and softly, with a marvelous courage and valiant heart, he
martched toward the Cart, recommending himselfe first to God, and then to his Lady
<hi>Dulcinea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here it is to bee noted, that when the Authour of the true Historie came to this
passage, hee exclames and cries. O strong (and beyond all comparison) couragious
<hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Thou Looking-glasse, in which all the valiant Knights of the
World may behold themselves! Thou new and second <hi>Don Manuel de Leon,</hi> who
was the Honour and Glorie of the Spanish Knights: With what words shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this fearefull exployt? Or with what Arguments shall I make it credible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
times? Or what Praises shall not fit and square with thee? Though they may
seeme <hi>Hyperboles</hi> above all <hi>Hyperboles?</hi> Thou on foote, alone, undaunted and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnanimous,
with thy Sword only, and that none of your cutting Fox-blades, with a
Shield, not of bright and shining steele, expectest and attendest two of the siercest
Lyons that ever were bred in African Woods. Let thine owne Deedes extoll thee,
brave <hi>Manchegan:</hi> For I must leave um here abruptly, since I want words to endere
them.</p>
                     <p>Here the Authors exclamation ceased, and the thred of the Story went knitting it
selfe on, saying.</p>
                     <p>The Keeper seeing <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in his posture, and that hee must needes let loose the
Male Lyon, on paine of the bold Knights indignation, hee set the first Cage wide open,
where the Lyon (as is said) was, of an extraordinary bignesse, fearfull and ugly to see
to. The first thing hee did, was to tumble up and downe the Cage, stretch one paw,
and rowze himselfe; forthwith hee yawned, and gently sneezed, then with his Tongue
some two handfulls long, hee licked the dust out of his eyes, and washed his face;
which done, hee thrust his head out of the Cage and looked round about him, with
his eyes like fire-coles; a sight and gesture able to make Temeritie it selfe afraid.
Only <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beheld him earnestly, and wished hee would leape out of the Cart,
that they might grapple, for hee thought to slice him in peeces. Hitherto came the
extreme of his not-heard-of madnesse: But the generous Lyon, more courteous then
arrogant, neglecting such childishnesse and bravadoes, after hee had looked round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him (as is said) turned his back, and shewed his Tayle to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and
very quietly lay downe againe in the Cage. Which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Keeper to give him two or three blowes to make him come forth. No,
not I (quoth the Keeper) for if I urge him, I shall bee the first hee will teare in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I pray you Sir Knight, bee contented with your dayes worke, which is as much
as could in valour be done, and tempt not a second hazard. The Lyons door was open, he
might have come out if hee would; but since hee hath not hitherto, hee will not come
forth all this day. You have well shewed the stoutnesse of your courage: no brave
Combatant (in my opinion) is tyed to more then to defie his Enemie, and to expect
him in field; and if his contrary come not, the disgrace is his, and he that expected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
with the prize.</p>
                     <p>True it is (answered <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) friend, shut the dore, and give mee a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in the best forme that you can, of what you have seene mee doe here: to wit, That
you opened to the Lyon, that I expected him and hee came not out; that I expected
him againe yet all would not doe, but hee lay downe. I could doe no more. Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
avant, God maintaine right and truth, and true Chivalrie: shut (as I bad you)
whilest I make signes to them that are fled, that they may know this exployt from thy
Relation. The Keeper obeyed, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> putting his handkerchief on the point
of his Lance, with which hee had wiped the Curd-showre from off his face, hee began
to call those that fled, and never so much as looked behind them, all in a Troope, and
the Gentleman the fore-man: But <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing the white cloth said, Hang mee if my
Master have not vanquished the wilde-Beasts, since hee calls us. All of them made a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54746:182"/>
stand, and knew it was <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> that made the signe: So lessening their fear, by
little and little they drew neer him, till they could plainly heare that he called them.
At length they returned to the Cart: And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said to the Carter, Yoake
your Mules again brother, and get you on your way: and <hi>Sancho,</hi> give him two Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolets
in gold, for him and the Lyon-keeper, in recompence of their stay. With a very
good will (said <hi>Sancho:</hi>) But what's become of the Lyons? are they alive or dead?
Then the Keeper fair and softly began to tell them of the bickering, extolling, as well
as hee could, <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> valour, at whose sight the Lyon trembling, would not, or
durst not sallie from the Cage, although the door were open a prettie while, and that
because he had told the Knight, that to provoke the Lyon, was to tempt God, by making
him come out by force (as hee would that hee should bee provoked in spight of his
teeth, and against his will) hee suffered the doore to bee shut. What think you of this
<hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>) Can Enchantment now prevail against true Valour?
Well may Enchanters make me unfortunate; but 'tis impossible they should bereave
me of my Valour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> bestowed the Pistolets, and the Carter yoaked; the Keeper tooke leave of
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and thanked him for his kindnesse, and promised him to relate his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
exploit to the King himself, when hee came to Court. Well, if his Majestie
chance to ask who it was that did it, tell him <hi>The Knight of the Lyons:</hi> for hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
I will that my name bee trucked, exchanged, turned and changed now from that
I had of <hi>The Knight of the sorrowfull Countenance;</hi> and in this I follow the ancient
use of Knights Errant, that would change their names when they pleased, or thought
it convenient.</p>
                     <p>The Cart went on it's way, and <hi>Don-Quixote, Sancho,</hi> and hee in the green held on
theirs. In all this while <hi>Don Diego de Miranda</hi> spoke not a word, being busied in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> speeches and actions, taking him to bee a wise mad-man, or a mad-man
that came somewhat neer a wise man: Hee knew nothing as yet of the first part
of his History; for if hee had read that, hee would have left admiring his words and
deeds, since hee might have known the nature of his madnesse: But (for hee knew it
not) the held him to be wise, &amp; mad by fits; for what he spoke was consonant, elegant, and
well delivered; but his actions were foolish, rash, and unadvised; And (thought hee
to himself) what greater madnesse could there bee, then to clap on a Helmet full of
Curds, and to make us beleeve that Enchanters had softned his skull? or what greater
rashnesse or fopperie, then forcibly to venture upon Lyons? <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> drew
him from these imaginations, saying, Who doubts, <hi>Seignior Don Diego de Miranda,</hi> but
that you will hold me in your opinion for an idle fellow, or a mad-man; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
that I bee held so; for my Actions testifie no lesse; for all that, I would have you
know that I am not so mad, or so shallow as I seem: It is a brave sight to see a goodly
Knight in the mid'st of the Market-place before his Prince, to give a thrust with his
Launce to a fierce Bull: <hi>[In</hi> Spain <hi>they use with Horse-men and Foot-men to course their
Bulls to death in the Market-places.]</hi> And it is a brave sight to see a Knight armed in
shining Armor passe about the Tilt-yard at the cheerfull Justs before the Ladies; and
all those Knights are a brave sight that in Militarie exercises (or such as may seem
so) doe entertain, revive, and honour their Princes Courts: but above all these, a
Knight Errant is a better sight, that by Desarts and Wildernesses, by Crosse-waies and
Woods, and Mountains, searcheth after dangerous Adventures, with a purpose to end
them happily and fortunately, only to obtain glorious and lasting Fame. A Knight
Errant (I say) is a better sight, succouring a Widdow in some Desart, then a Court
Knight courting some Damzell in the Citie. All Knights have their particular exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises:
Let the Courtier serve Ladies, authorize his Princes Court with Liveries, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
poor Gentlemen at his Table, appoint Justs, maintain Tourneyes, shew himself.
Noble, Liberall, and Magnificent; and above all, Religious: and in these hee shall
accomplish with his obligation. But for the Knight Errant, let him search the corners
of the World; enter the most intricate Labyrinths; every foot undertake Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
and in the Desarts and Wildernesse: let him resist the Sunne-beams in the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:183"/>
midest of Summer, and the sharp rigor of the Windes and Frosts in Winter: Let not
Lyons fright him, nor Spirits terrifie him, nor Hobgoblins make him quake; for to
seeke these to set upon them, and to overcome all, are his prime exercises, And
since it fell to my Lot to bee one of the number of these Knights Errant, I cannot but
undergoe all that I thinke comes under the jurisdiction of my profession. So that the
encountring those Lyons did directly belong to mee, though I knew it to bee an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
rashnesse; for well I know that valour is a virtue betwixt two vicious extremes,
as cowardise and rashnesse: but it is lesse dangerous for him that is valiant, to rise to a
point of rashnesse, then to fall or touch upon the Coward. For as it is more easie for a
Prodigall man to bee liberall then a covetous, so it is easier for a rash man to bee true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
valiant, then a Coward to come to true valour. And touching the on-set in Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
beleeve me <hi>Signior Don Diego,</hi> it is better playing a good trump then a small, for it
sounds better in the hearers eares. Such a Knights is rash and hardy, then such a Knight is
fearfull and cowardly.</p>
                     <p>I say, <hi>Signior</hi> (answered <hi>Don Diego</hi>) that all that you have said and done is levelled
out by the line of Reason, and I thinke if the Statues and Ordinances of Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry
were lost, they might bee found againe in your brest, as in their owne Storehouse
and Register; and so let us haste for the day growes on us, let us get to my Village and
House, where you shall ease your selfe of your former labour; which, though it have
not beene bodily, yet it is mentall, which doth often redound to the bodies wearinesse.
I thanke you for your kinde offer, <hi>Signior</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and spurring on
faster, about two of the clock they came to the Villag and <hi>Don Diego's</hi> House, whom

                     <p>Oh you <hi>Tobosian Tunnes,</hi> that bring to my remembrance the sweet pledge of my
greatest bitternesse! The Scholler Poet, sonne to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> that came out with his
Mother to welcome him, heard him pronounce this, and the Mother and sonne were in
some suspence at the strange shape of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who alighting from <hi>Rozinante</hi>
very courteously desired to kisse her hands: And <hi>Don Diego</hi> said; I pray Wife, give
your wonted welcome to this Gentleman, <hi>Signior Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> a
Knight Errant, and the valiantest and wisest in the world.</p>
                     <p>The Gentlewoman called <hi>Donna Christina</hi> welcomed him very affectionately, &amp; with
much courtesie, which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> retorted with many wise and mannerly comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and did (as it were) use the same over again to the Scholler, who hearing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54746:183"/>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> speake, took him to be wondrous wise and witty. Here the Authour
paints out unto us, all the circumstances of <hi>Don Diego</hi> his house, deciphering to us all
that a Gentleman and a rich Farmers house may have: But it seemed good to the
Translator to passe over these and such like trifles, because they suited not with the
principall scope of this History, the which is more grounded upon truth, then upon bare
digressions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> was led into a Hall; <hi>Sancho</hi> unarm'd him; so that now hee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on but his Breeches and a Chamois Doublet, all smudged with the silth of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
about his neck he wore a little Scholasticall Band, unstrach'd, and without lace;
his Buskins were Date-coloured; and his Shooes close on each side: his good Sword
hee gyrt to him, that hung at a Belt of Sea-Wolves skins; for it was thought hee had
the running of the Reins many yeers; hee wore also a long Cloke of good russet-cloth:
but first of all, in five or six Kettles of water (for touching the quantity there is some
difference) hee washed his Head and his Face; and for all that the water was turned
Whey-colour, God a mercy on <hi>Sancho's</hi> gluttony, and the buying those dismall black
curds that made his Master so white with the aforesaid bravery, and with a sprightly air
and gallantry, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> martched into another Roome, where the Scholler stayed
for him to entertain him till the cloth was laid; for the Mistris of the house, <hi>Donna
Christina,</hi> meant to shew to her honorable guest, that shee knew how to make much
of them that came to her house.</p>
                     <p>Whilest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was disarming himself, <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> had leisure (for that
was <hi>Don Diego's</hi> sonnes name) to ask his Father, What doe you call this Gentleman
Sir, that you have brought with you? for his name, his shape, and your calling him
Knight Errant, makes my Mother and me wonder. Faith sonne (quoth <hi>Don Diego</hi>)
I know not what I should say to thee of him; only I may tell thee, I have seen him
play the madest pranks of any mad-man in the world, and speake again speeches so wise
as blot out and undoe his Deeds; doe thou speake to him, and feel the pulse of his
vnderstanding, and since thou art discreet, judge of his discretion or folly as thou
seest best, though to deale plainly with thee, I rather hold him to bee mad then
wise.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Don Lorenzo,</hi> as is said, went to entertain <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and amongst
other discourse that passed betwixt them, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said to <hi>Don Lorenzo; Signior
Don Diego de Miranda</hi> your Father, hath told me of your rare abilities and subtill
wit, and chiefly that you are an excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent Poet. A Poet perhaps (replyed <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>)
but excellent, by no means: true it is that I am somewhat affectionated to Poesie,
and to read good Poets; but not so that I may deserve the name of excellent, that my
Father stiles me with. I doe not dislike your modestie (quoth <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) for you
have seldome times any Poet that is not arrogant, and thinks himself to bee the best
Poet in the world. There is no rule (quoth <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>) without an exception, and
some one there is that is so, yet thinks not so. Few (said <hi>Don Quixote:</hi>) But tell me
Sir; What Verses bee those that you have now in hand, that your Father sayes doe
trouble and puzzle you? and if it bee some kinde of glosse, I know what belongs to
glossing, and should bee glad to heare them; and if they be of your Verses for the Prize,
content your selfe with the second reward; [De justa literaria: <hi>A custome in Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
in</hi> Spain, <hi>of rewards proposed to them that make the best Verses:]</hi> For the first
goes alwayes by favour, or according the qualitie of the person; and the second is justly
distributed; so that the third comes (according to this account) to bee the second, and
the first the third, according to degrees that are given in Universities: but for all that
the word first is a great matter.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto (thought <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> to himself) I cannot think thee mad: Proceed we:
and hee said; It seems Sir, you have frequented the Schooles; what Sciences have you
heard? That of Knight Errantry (quoth <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) which is as good as your Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and somewhat better. I know not what Science that is (quoth <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>)
neither hath it as yet come to my notice. 'Tis a Science (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that
contains in it all, or most of the Sciences of the world, by reason that hee who professes
<pb facs="tcp:54746:184"/>
it, must bee skillfull in the Laws, to know Justice distributive and Commutative, to
give every man his own and what belongs to him: hee must bee a Divine to know how
to give a reason cleerly and distinctly of his Christian profession, wheresoever it shall
bee demanded him: Hee must bee a Physician, and chiefly an Herbalist, to know in a
Wildernesse or Desart, what hearbs have virtue to cure wounds; for your Knight
Errant must not bee looking every pissing while who shall heale him: Hee must bee
an Astronomer, to know in the night by the starres what a clock 'tis, and in what part
and Climate of the world hee is: Hee must bee skillfull in the Mathematicks, because
every foot hee shall have need of them: And to let passe that hee must bee adorned
with all divine and morall virtues; descending to other trifles, I say hee must learn to
swimme, as they say, fish <hi>Nicholas,</hi> or <hi>Nicolao</hi> did: Hee must know how to shooe a
Horse, to mend a Saddle or Bridle: And comming again to what went before, hee
must serve God and his Mistris inviolably: he must be chaste in his thoughts; honest
in his words; liberall in his deeds; valiant in his actions; patient in afflictions; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
towards the poor: and lastly, a defender of truth, although it cost him his life
for it. Of all these great and lesser parts a good Knight Errant is composed, that you
may see <hi>Signior Don Lorenzo,</hi> whether it be a sniveling Science that the Knight that
learns it professeth, and whether it may not bee equalled to the proudest of them all
taught in the Schooles.</p>
                     <p>If it bee so (said <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>) I say this Science goes beyond them all. If it bee so
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>) Why let me tell you (said <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>) I doubt whether there
be any Knights Errant now adorned with so many virtues. Oft have I spoken (replyed
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that which I must now speak again, that the greatest part of men in the
world are of opinion, that there bee no Knights Errant; and I think, if Heaven doe
not miraculously let them understand the truth, that there have been such, and that at
this day there bee, all labour will bee in vain (as I have often found by experience:)
I will not now stand upon shewing you your errour: all I will doe, is, to pray to God
to deliver you out of it, and to make you understand how profitable and necessary
Knights Errant have been to the world in former ages, and also would bee at present, if
they were in request: But now, for our sinnes, sloth, idlenesse, gluttonie, and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
doe raigne. I faith (thought <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>) for this once our guest hath scaped
me: but for all that, hee is a lively Asse, and I were a dull foole if I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it.</p>
                     <p>Here they ended their discourse, for they were called to dinner. <hi>Don Diego</hi> asked
his sonne what tryall hee had made of their guests understanding; To which hee made
answer; All the Physicians and Scriveners in the world will not wipe out his madnesse.
Hee is a curious mad-man, and hath neat Dilemma's. To dinner they went, and their
meat was such as <hi>Don Diego</hi> upon the way described it, such as hee gave to his guests,
well drest, savory, and plentifull: But that which best pleased <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> was the
marvellous silence throughout the whole house, as if it had been a Covent of <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians:</hi>
So (that lifting up his eyes, and grace being said, and that they had washed
hands) he earnestly intreated <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> to speake his Prize-verses.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth hee) because I will not bee like your Poets, that when they are
over intreated, they use to make scruple of their works; and when they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
they vomit them up; I will speake my Glosse, for which I expect no reward,
as having written them only to exercise my Muse. A wise friend of mine (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
was of opinion, that to Glosse was no hard task for any man, the reason
being, that the Glosse could ne'er come neere the Text, and most commonly the Glosse
was quite from the Theame given; besides that, the Laws of Glossing were too strict,
not admitting interrogations of <hi>Said he?</hi> or <hi>Shall I say?</hi> or changing No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s into
Verbs, without other ligaments and strictnesses to which the Glossor is tyed, as you
know. Certainly Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (said <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>) I desire to catch you in
an absurdity, but cannot; for still you slip from me like an Eele. I know not (said
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) what you mean by your slipping. You shall know my meaning (said
<hi>Don Lorenzo;</hi>) but for the present I pray you hearken with attention to my glossed
verses, and to the Glosse, as for example.

screecht, taking <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> by the hand, and said; Assuredly, genetous youth, I think
you are the best Poet in the world, and you deserve the Lawrell, not of <hi>Cyprus</hi> or <hi>Gaeta,</hi>
as a Poet said (God forgive him) but of <hi>Athens,</hi> if it were extant, <hi>Paris, Bolonia</hi> and
<hi>Salamanca:</hi> I would to God those Iudges that would denie you the prize might bee
shot to death with arrowes by <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and that the Muses never come within their
thresholds. Speak Sir, if you please, some of your loftier verses, that I may altogether
feele the pulse of your admirable wit.</p>
                     <p>How say you by this, that <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> was pleased, when hee heard himselfe thus
praised by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> although he held him to bee a mad-man? O power of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
how farre thou canst extend, and how large are the bounds of thy pleasing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction!
<pb facs="tcp:54746:185"/>
This truth was verified in <hi>Don Lorenzo,</hi> since hee condescended to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>

so many consumed Poets as be, I have found one consummate, as you are, Sir,
which I perceive by your well-framed Sonnet. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> remained foure dayes
(being well entertained) in <hi>Don Diego's</hi> house, at the end of which he desired to take
his leave, and thanked him for the kindnesse and good wellcome he had received:
but because it was not fit that Knights Errant should bee too long idle, hee purposed
to exercise his Function, and to seeke after Adventures he knew of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee meant to goe to, would give him plenty enough to passe his time with, till
it were fit for him to goe to the Justs at <hi>Saragosa,</hi> which was his more direct course:
but that first of all he meant to goe to <hi>Montesino's</hi> vault, of which there were so many
admirable tales in every mans mouth: so to search and enquire the Spring and Origine
of those seven Lakes, commonly called of <hi>Ruydera. Don Diego</hi> and his Sonne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his noble determination, and bid him furnish himselfe with what hee pleased
of their house and wealth, for that hee should receive it with all love and good will;
for the worth of his person, and his honourable profession obliged them to it.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the day for his parting came, as pleasing to him, as bitter and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who liked wondrous well of <hi>Don Diego's</hi> plentifull provision, and was
loth to returne to the hunger of the forrests and wildernesse, and to the hardnesse of
his ill-furnisht wallets, notwithstanding hee filled and stuffed them with the best
provision hee could. And <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as hee tooke his leave of <hi>Don Lorenzo,</hi> said; I
know not, Sir, whether I have told you heretofore, but though I have, I tell you again,
that when you would save a great deale of labour and paines, to arrive at the inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
top of <hi>Fames</hi> Temple, you have no more to doe, but to leave on one hand the
straight and narrow path of Poesie, and to take the most narrow of Knight Errantry,
sufficient to make you an Emperour, ere you would say, <hi>What's this?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With this Epilogue <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> shut up the Comedy of his madnesse, onely this
hee added: God knowes, I would willingly carry Signior <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi>
with me, to
teach him, what belongs to pardoning the humble, to curbing and restraining the proud;
virtues annexed to my profession: but since his slender age is not capable, and his lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
enterprises will not permit him, I am onely willing to advize you, that being
a Poet, you may bee famous, if you governe your selfe by other mens judgements,
more then by your owne; for you have no parents that dislike their owne children, faire
or foule, and this errour is more frequent in mens understandings.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>On-Quixote</hi> was not gone far from <hi>Don Diego's</hi> towne, when hee
overtooke two men that seemed to be Parsons, or Schollers, with
two Husbandmen that were mounted upon four Asses. One of
the Schollers had (as it were in a Portmantue) a piece of white
cloth for Scarlet, wrapped up in a piece of greene Buckeram, and
two payre of Cotton Stockings. The other had nothing but
two Foiless and a paire of Pumpes. The Husbandmen had other
things, which shewed they came from some Market Towne, where they had
bought them to carry home to their village: so as well the Schollers as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
fell into the same admiration, that all they had done who first saw
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> &amp; they longed to know what manner of fellow he was, so different from
all other men. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saluted them, and after hee asked them whither they went,
and that they had said they went his way, he offered them his company, and desired them
to go softlyer, for that their young Asses travelled faster then his horse: and to oblige
them the more, he told them who he was, and of his profession, that he was a Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that he went to seeke Adventures round about the world. Hee told them his
proper name was <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> but his ordinary name, <hi>The Knight
of the Lyons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this to the Husbandmen was Heathen Greek, or Pedlers French: but not to
the Schollers, who straight perceived the weakenesse of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> brain: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they beheld him with great admiration and respect, and one of them
said, Knight, if you goe no set journey, as they which seeke Adventures seldome doe,
I pray goe with us, and you shall see one of the bravest and most sumptuous mariages
that ever was kept in the <hi>Mancha,</hi> or in many leagues round about. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
asked them if it were of any Prince (for so hee imagined.) No, Sir, (said hee) but
betwixt a Farmer, and a Farmers daughter: hee is the richest in all the Countrey, and
she the fairest alive. Their provision for this marriage is new and rare, and it is to be
kept in a medow neere the Brides towne. Shee is, called, the more to set her out,
<hi>Quiteria</hi> the faire, and hee <hi>Camacho</hi> the rich: she is about eightteene yeeres of age,
and hee two and twenty, both well met, but that some nice people, that busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in all mens linages, will say that the faire <hi>Quiteria</hi> is of better parentage then
he: but that's nothing, riches are able to soulder all clests. To say true, this
<hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macho</hi> is liberall, and he hath longed to make an Arbor, and cover all the Medow on the
Top so that the Sunne will bee troubled to enter to visit the greene hearbs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.
Hee hath also certaine warlike Morrices, as well of swords, as little jyngling
bels; for wee have those in the towne that will jangle them. For your foot-clappers
I say nothing, you would wonder to see them bestirre themselves: but none of these, nor
others I have told you of, are like to make this marriage so remarkeable, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
<hi>Basilius.</hi> This <hi>Basilius</hi> is a neighbouring swaine of <hi>Quiteria's</hi> Towne, whose
house was next dore to her Fathers. From hence Love tooke occasion to renew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, the long forgotten loves of <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thyshe;</hi> for <hi>Basilius</hi> loved
<pb facs="tcp:54746:186"/>
                        <hi>Quiteria</hi> from a childe, and shee answered his desires with a thousand loving favors. So
that it grew a common talke in the towne, of the love betweene the two little ones.
<hi>Quiteria</hi> began to grow to some yeeres, and her Father began to deny <hi>Basilius</hi> his
ordinary accesse to the house; and to avoyd all suspicion, purposed to marry her to the
rich <hi>Camacho,</hi> not thinking it fit to marry her to <hi>Basilius,</hi> who was not so rich in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
goods, as in those of the minde, (for to say truth without envy) hee is the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
youth wee have, a famous Barre-pitcher, an excellent Wrastler, a great Tennis-player,
hee runnes like a Deere, out-leapes a shee-goat, and playes at tenne pinnes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously,
sings like a Larke, playes upon a Gitterne as if hee made it speake, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, fenceth as well as the best.</p>
                     <p>For that slight only (quoth <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) the youth deserves not onely to match
with the faire <hi>Quiteria,</hi> but with Queene <hi>Ginebra</hi> her selfe, if she were now alive,
in spight of <hi>Lansarote,</hi> and all that would gain say it. There's for my wife now (quoth
<hi>Sancho</hi> that had beene all this while silent) that would have every one marry with their
equals, holding her selfe to the Proverbe, that sayes; <hi>Like to like (quoth the Devill to the
Collier.)</hi> All that I desire, is, that honest <hi>Basilius</hi> (for me thinkes I love him) were
married to <hi>Quiteria,</hi> and God give um joy (I was saying) those that goe about to
hinder the marriage of two that love well. If all that love well (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
should marry, Parents would lose the priviledge of marrying their children, when
and with whom they ought; and if daughters might chuse their husbands, you should
have some would choose their fathers servants, and others, any passenger in the street,
whom they thought to bee a lusty swaggerer, although hee were a cowardly Russian;
for love and affection doe easily blinde the eyes of the understanding, which is onely
fit to choose, and the state of Matrimony is a ticklish thing, and there is great heed to be
taken, and a particular favour to be given from above to make it light happily.</p>
                     <p>Any man that would but undertake some voyage, if hee bee wise, before hee is on
his way, hee will seeke him some good companion. And why should not hee doe so,
that must travell all his life time till hee come to his resting place, Death? and the rather
if his company must bee at bed and at boord, and in all places, as the Wives companie
must be with the Husband? Your wife is not a commodity like others that is bought
and sold, or exchang'd; but an inseparable accident, that lasts for terme of life. It is a
nooze, that being fastned about the neck, turns to a Gordian knot, which cannot bee
undone but by Deaths sickle.</p>
                     <p>I could tell yee much more in this businesse, were it not for the desire I have to
bee satisfied by Master Parson, if there bee any more to come of <hi>Basilius</hi> his story. To
which hee answered, This is all, that from the instant that <hi>Basilius</hi> knew the faire <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi>
was to bee married to the rich <hi>Camacho,</hi> hee was never seene to smile, or talke sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly;
and hee is alwaies sad and pensative, talkes to himselfe; an evident token that hee
is distracted: eates little, sleepes much; all he cates is fruits, and all his sleepe is in the
fields, upon the hard ground like a Beast; now and then hee lookes up to Heaven, and
sometimes casts his eyes downeward, so senslesse, as if he were only a Statue cloathed,
and the very ayre strikes off his garments. In fine, hee hath all the signes of a passionate
heart, and wee are all of opinion, that by that time <hi>Quiteria</hi> to morrow gives the, I, it
will be the Sentence of his Death. God forbid (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) for God gives the wound,
and God gives the salve, no body knowes what may happen, 'tis a good many houres
betweene this and to morrow, and in one houre, nay one minute, a house falls; and I
have seen the Sunne shine, and foule weather in an instant; one goes to bed sound at
night, and stirres not the next morning: and pray tell mee, is there any one here that
can say hee hath stayed the course of Fortunes great wheele? No truly, and betweene a
womans I, and no, I would be loth to put a pins point, for it would hardly enter. Let
mee have Mistrisse <hi>Quiteria</hi> love <hi>Basilius</hi> with all her heart, and Ile give him a bag full
of good luck, for your love (as I have heard tell) lookes wantonly with eyes that
make copper seeme gold, and poverty riches, and filth in the eyes, pearles. Whether a
plague run'st thou <hi>Sancho,</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>) when thou goest threding on thy
Proverbs and thy flim-flams, <hi>Iudas</hi> himselfe though hee take thee cannot hold thee: Tell
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54746:186"/>
me Beast; what knowest thou of fortune or her wheel, or any thing else? Oh if you
understand me not, no marvell though my sentences bee held for fopperies: well,
I know what I say, and know I have not spoken much from the purpose;
but you, Sir, are allwaies the Tourney to my words and actions. Attourney thou
wouldest say: God confound thee thou, prevaricator of language.</p>
                     <p>Doe not you deale with me (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) since you know I have not been brought
up in Court, nor studied in <hi>Salamanca</hi> to know whether I add or diminish any of my
syllables. Lord God, you must not think your <hi>Galizian [One of that Province that
speak a bastard language to the Spanish,]</hi> can speak like your <hi>Toledonian,</hi> and they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are not all so nimble. For matter of your Court language (quoth the Parson)
'tis true; for they that are bred in the Tanner-rows and the <hi>Zocodoner [The Market
place so called in</hi> Toledo,] cannot discourse like them that walk all day in the high
Church Cloysters; yet all are <hi>Toledonians,</hi> the language is pure, proper, and elegant
(indeed) only in your discreet Courtiers, let them bee borne where they will: Discreet
I say, because many are otherwise, and discretion is the Grammer of good language,
which is accompanied with practice: I Sir, I thank God have studied the Canons in
<hi>Salamanca,</hi> and presume sometimes to yeeld a reason in plain and significant tearms.
If you did not presume (said the other Scholler) more on your using the foyles you carry
then your tongue, you might have been Senior in your degree, whereas now you are lag.
Look you Bachelour (quoth the Parson) you are in the most erronious opinion of the
world, touching the skill of the weapon, since you hold it frivolous. 'Tis no opinion
of mine (said <hi>Corchuelo</hi>) but a manifest truth; and, if you will have me shew it by
experience, there you have foyles commodious: I have an arme, and strength, which,
together with my courage, which is not small, will make you confesse I am not deceived;
alight, and keep your distance, your circles, your corners, and all your Science; I hope
to make your see the starres at noon day with my skill, which is but modern and mean,
which though it bee small, I hope to God the man is yet unborn that shall make mee
turne my back; and there is no man in the world but I'le make him give ground. For
turning your back (said the skillfull) I meddle not, though perhaps where you first set
your foot, there your grave might bee diged, I mean, you might bee killed for despising
skill. That you shall trye (said <hi>Corchuelo</hi>) and lighting hastily from his Asse, hee snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of the Swords that the Parson carried. Not so (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> instantly)
I'le bee the Master of this Fence, and the Judge of this undecided controversie: and
lighting from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and taking his Launce, hee stepped between them till such
time as the Parson had put himself into his Posture and distance against <hi>Corchuelo,</hi> who
rann (as you would say) darting fire out of his eyes. The two Husbandmen that were
by, without lighting from their Asses, served for spectators of the mortall Tragedy:
the blows, the stockadoes, your false thrusts, your back-blows, your doubling blows,
that came from <hi>Corchuelo,</hi> were numberlesse, as thick as hopps, or haile, hee laid on like
an angry Lyon; but still the Parson gave him a stopple for his mouth, with the button
of his foyle, which stopped him in the mid'st of his fury; and hee made him kisse it as
if it had been a Relike, though not with so much devotion as is due to them. In a
word, the Parson with pure Stocados told all the buttons of his Cassock which hee had
on, his skyrts flying about him like a fishes tayle. Twice hee strook off his hat, and so wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him, that what for despight, what for choller and rage, he took the sword by the hilt
and flung it into the aire so forcibly, that one of the Husbandmen that was by, who was
a notary, and went for it, gave testimony after, that he flung it almost three quarters of
a mile; which testimony serves, and hath served, that it may bee known and really seen
that force is overcome by Art.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Corchuelo</hi> sate down, being very weary, and <hi>Sancho</hi> coming to him, said; Truely
Sir Bachelor, if you take my advice, hereafter challenge no man to fence, but to wrastle
or throw the bar, since you have youth and force enough for it; for I have heard those
that you call your skillfull men say, that they will thrust the poynt of a Sword through
the eye of a Needle. I am glad (quoth <hi>Corchuelo</hi>) that I came from my Asse, and that
experience hath shewed me what I would not have beleeved. So rising up, hee embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:54746:187"/>
the Parson, and they were as good friends as before So, not staying for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
that went for the Sword, because they thought he would tarry long, they resolved
to follow, and come betimes to <hi>Quiteriaes</hi> Village, of whence they all were. By the
way the Parson discourses to them, of the excellency of the Art of Fencing,
with so many demonstrative Reasons, with so many Figures and Mathematicall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
that all were satisfied with the rareness of the Science, and <hi>Corchuelo</hi> reduced
from his obstinacy.</p>
                     <p>It began to grow darke, but before they drew neere, they all saw a kind of heaven of
innumerable Stars before the Town. They heard likewise harmonious and confused
sounds of divers instruments, as Flutes, Tabers, Psalteries, Recorders, hand-Drums and
Bells; and when they drew neere, they saw that the trees of an Arbor, which had been
made at the entrance of the towne, were all full of lights, which were not offended by
the winde,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that then blew not, but was so gentle, that it scarce moved the leaves of the
trees. The Musicians were they that made the marriage more sprightly, who went two
and two in companies, som dancing and singing, others playing upon divers of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
instruments: Nothing but myrth ran up and down the Medow, others were
busied in raysing scaffolds, that they might the next day see the representations and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
commodiously, dedicated to the marriage of the rich <hi>Camacho,</hi> and the Obsequies

was the custome of Knights Errant to sleep in Fields and Forrests, rather then in habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though it were under golden roofs: so he went a little out of the way, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

up, and called <hi>Sancho</hi> his Squire, that still lay snorting: which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
seeing, before he could wake, he said; Oh happy thou above
all that live upon the face of the earth, that without envie, or being
envied, sleepest with a quiet brest, neither persecuted by Enchanters, nor frighted by
Enchantments. Sleepe I say, once againe, nay an hundred times sleepe: let not thy
Masters jealousie keepe thee continually awake, nor let care to pay thy debts make thee
watchfull, or how another day thou and thy small, but straightned Family may live,
whom neither ambition troubles, nor the worlds vaine pompe doth weary, since the
bounds of thy desires extend no farther then to thinking of thine Asse: for, for thine
own person, that thou hast committed to my charge, a counterpoize and burden that
Nature and Custome hath laid upon the Masters. The servant sleeps, and the Master
wakes, thinking how he may maintaine, good him, and do him kindnesses; the griefe
that it is to see heav'n obdurate in relieving the earth with seasonable moysture, troubles
not the servant, but it doth the Master, that must keep in sterility and hunger, him that

awaked so soon, if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had not made him come to himself with the little end
of his Launce. At length hee awaked sleepie and drowsie, and turning his face round
about, hee said, From this Arbor (if I bee not deceived) there comes a steem and

the two mounted, and fair and softly entred the Arbor. The first thing that <hi>Sancho</hi> saw
was a whole Steer spitted upon a whole Elme, and for the fire, where it was to bee
roasted, there was a prettie mountain of wood, and six pots that were round about this
Bon-fire, which were never cast in the ordinary mold that other pots were, for they
were six half Olive-buts, and every one was a very Shambles of meat, they had so many
whole Sheep soking in them which were not seen, as if they had been Pigeons; the
flayed Hares, and the pulled Hens that were hung upon the trees to bee buried in the
pots, were numberlesse; Birds and Fowle of divers sorts infinite, that hung on the
Trees, that the aire might cool them. <hi>Sancho</hi> counted above threescore skinnes of wine,
each of them of above two <hi>Arrobaes;</hi> [Arroba, <hi>a measure of 25. pound weight, which
may bee some six gallons of Wine:</hi>] and as it afterward seemed, of spritely liquor: there
were also whole heaps of purest Bread, heaped up like Corne in the threshing-floors:
your Cheeses, like bricks piled one upon another, made a goodly wall: and two
Kettles of Oyle, bigger then a Dyars, served to frie their Paste-work, which they took
out with two strong Peels when they were fryed, and they ducked them in another
Kettle of Honey that stood by for the same purpose: There were Cooks above fifty,
men and women, all cleanly, carefull and cheerfull: In the spacious belly of the Steer
there were twelve sucking Pigs, which being sowed there, served to make him more
savory: The Spices of divers sorts, it seems they were not brought by pounds, but
by <hi>Arrones,</hi> and all lay open in a great Chest: To conclude, this preparation for the
marriage was rusticall; but so plentifull that it might furnish an Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> beheld all, and was much affected with it: and first of all the goodly
Pots did captivate his desires, from whence with all his heart hee would have been glad
to have received a good Pipkin full; by and by hee was enamored on the skins; and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:188"/>
last of all on the fryed meats, if so bee those vast Kettles might bee called Frying-pans
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>so, without longer patience, wanting absteinence he came to one of the Cooks, and with
courteous and hungry reasons, desired him, that he might sop a cast of bread in one of the
Pots. To which the Cook replyed; Brother this is no day on which hunger may
have any jurisdiction (thanks bee to the rich <hi>Camacho</hi>) alight, and see if you can
finde ever a ladle there, and skimme out a Hen or two, and much good may they doe
you.</p>
                     <p>I see none (said <hi>Sancho.</hi>) Stay (said the Cook) God forgive me! what a Ninny 'tis?
And saying this, hee layed hold of a Kettle, and sowsing into it one of the half butts, hee
drew out of it three Hens and two Geese, and said to <hi>Sancho;</hi> Eat friend, and break
your fast with this froth till dinner time. I have nothing to put it in (said <hi>Sancho.</hi>)
Why take spoon and all (said the Cook) for <hi>Camacho's</hi> riches and content will very
well beare it.</p>
                     <p>Whilest <hi>Sancho</hi> thus passed his time, <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>Quixote</hi> saw that by one side of the Arbor
there came a dozen Husband-men upon twelve goodly Mares, with rich and sightly
furniture fit for the Countrey, with many little bells upon their Petrels, all clad in
bravery for that dayes solemnity, and all in a joynt troop ran many Careers up and
down the Medow, with a great deal of mirth and jollity, crying, Long live <hi>Camacho</hi>
and <hi>Quiteria,</hi> hee as rich as shee fair, and shee the fairest of the world. Which when
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> heard, thought hee to himself, it well appears that these men have not
seen my <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso:</hi> for if they had, they would not be so forward in praising
this their <hi>Quiteria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A while after there began to enter at divers places of the Arbor, certain different
Dances, amongst which there was one Sword-dance by four and twenty Swains,
handsome lusty Youths, all in white linnen, with their Handkerchifs wrought
in severall colours of fine silk, and one of the twelve upon the Mares asked him
that was the fore-man of these, a nimble Lad, if any of the Dancers had hurt themselves.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto (said hee) no body is hurt; wee are all well, God be thanked: and straight
hee shuffled in amongst the rest of his companions, with so many tricks, and so much
slight, that <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> though hee were used to such kinde of Dances, yet hee never
liked any so well as this: Hee also liked another very well, which was of faire young
Maids, so young, that never a one was under fourteen, nor none above eighteen, all
clad in course green, their haire partly filletted and partly loose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but all were yellow,
and might compare with the Sonne, upon which they had Garlands of <hi>Iasmines,</hi> Roses,
Woodbine and Hony-suckles, [Jasmines, <hi>a little sweet white flowre that grows in</hi> Spain
<hi>in hedges, like our sweet Marjoram:</hi>] they had for their guides a reverend old man and
a matronly woman, but more light and nimble then could bee expected from their
yeers.</p>
                     <p>They Danc'd to the sound of a <hi>Zomara</hi> Bag-pipe: [Zomara, <hi>a Town in</hi> Castile <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for that kinde of Musick, like our</hi> Lancashire <hi>Horn-pipe:</hi>] so that with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
looks and their nimble feet, they seemed to bee the best Dancers in the world.
After this there came in another artificiall Dance, of those called Brawles, it consisted
of eight Nymphs, divided into two ranks; God <hi>Cupid</hi> guided one rank, and <hi>Money</hi>
the other; the one with his Wings, his Bow, his Quiver and Arrows; the other was
clad in divers rich colours of gold and silk: The Nymphs that followed <hi>Love,</hi> carried
a white parchment scrowle at their backs, in which their names were written in great
letters; the first was <hi>Poesie,</hi> the second <hi>Discretion,</hi> the third <hi>Nobility,</hi> the fourth <hi>Valour.</hi>
In the same manner came those whom God <hi>Money</hi> led; the first was <hi>Liberality,</hi> the
second <hi>Reward,</hi> the third <hi>Treasure,</hi> the fourth <hi>quiet Possession:</hi> before them came a
wodden Castle, which was shot at by two Savages clad in Ivie, and Canvas dyed in green,
so to the life, that they had well-nigh frighted <hi>Sancho:</hi> Upon the Frontispice, and of
each side of the Castle, was written, <hi>The Castle of good heed:</hi> Four skillfull Musicians
played to them on a Taber and Pipe; <hi>Cupid</hi> began the Dance, and after two changes, he
lifted up his eyes, &amp; bent his Bow against a Virgin that stood upon the battlements of the
Castle, and said to her in this manner.

only remembred (for he had a great memorie) the rehearsed ones, and now
the whole troope mingled together, winding in and out with great spritelynesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xteritie,
and still as <hi>Love</hi> went before the Castle, he shot a flight aloft, but <hi>Money</hi> broke

                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:189"/>At last, after <hi>Money</hi> had danc'd a good while, hee drew out a great Purse made of a
Roman Cats skinne, which seemed to bee full of money, and casting it into the Castle,
with the blow, the boords were disjoyned and fell downe, leaving the Damzell disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
without any defence. <hi>Money</hi> came with his Assistants, and casting a great
chaine of gold about her neck, they made a shew of leiding her Captive: Which when
<hi>Love</hi> and his Party saw, they made shew as if they would have rescued her, and all these
motions were to the sound of the Tabrer, with skillfull dancing, the Savages parted
them, who very speedily went to set up and joyne the boords of the Castle, and the
Damzell was inclosed there anew; and with this the dance ended, an the great content
of the spectators.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> asked one of the Nymphs, Who had so drest and ordered her? Shee
answered, A Parson of the towne, who had an excellent capacity for such inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I'le lay a wager (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) he was more <hi>Basilius</hi> his friend then <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho's,</hi>
and that he knowes better what belongs to a Satyre then an Even song; he hath
well fitted <hi>Basilius</hi> his abilities to the dance, and <hi>Camacho's</hi> riches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> that heard all, sayd; The King is my Cocke, I hold with <hi>Camacho.</hi>
Well, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) thou art a very Peasant, and like them that,
Long live the Conquerour. I know not who I am like (said <hi>Sancho:</hi>) but I know
I shall never get such delicate froth out of <hi>Basilius</hi> his Pottage-pots, as I have out of
<hi>Camacho's:</hi> and with that shewed him the kettle full of Geese and Hens, and laying
hold on one, he fell to it merrily and hungerly, and for <hi>Basilius</hi> abilities this he sayd to
their teeth: So much thou art worth as thou hast, and so much as thou hast, thou art
worth. An old Grandame of mine was wont to say, there were but two linages
in the world, <hi>Have-much,</hi> and <hi>Have-little;</hi> and she was mightly enclined to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
and at this day, Master, your Physician had rather feele a having pulse, then a
knowing pulse, and an Asse covered with gold makes a better shew then a horse with
a pack-saddle. So that I say again, I am of <hi>Camacho's</hi> side, the scumme of whose pots
are Geese, Hens, Hares, and Conies, and <hi>Basilius</hi> his, bee they neere or farre off, but
poore thin water.</p>
                     <p>Hast thou ended with thy tediousnesse, <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>) I must end
(sayd hee) because I see it offends you; for if it were not for that, I had worke cut
out for three dayes. Pray God, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that I may see thee
dumbe before I die. According to our life (sayd <hi>Sancho</hi>) before you die, I shall bee
mumbling clay, and then perhaps I shall bee so dumbe, that I shall not speake a word
till the end of the world, or at least till Dooms-day.</p>
                     <p>Although it should bee so, <hi>Sancho</hi> (said hee) thy silence will never bee equall to
the talking past, and thy talke to come; besides, 'tis very likely that I shall die before
thee, and so I shall never see thee dumbe, no not when thou drinkest or sleepest, to
paint thee out thorowly. In good faith, Master (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) there is no trusting
in the raw bones, I meane Death, that devoures lambes as well as sheepe, and I have
heard our Vicar say, shee tramples as well on the high Towres of Kings, as the humble
cottages of poore men: this Lady hath more power then squeamishnesse, she is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

ages, and preeminences: Shee is no Mower that sleepes in the hot weather, but
mowes at all houres, and cuts as well the greene grasse as the hay: shee doth not chew,
but swallowes at once, and crams downe all that comes before her; shee hath a Canine

were a jugg of colde water.</p>
                     <p>No more, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) at this instant, hold while thou art well,
and take heed of falling, for certainely thou hast spoken of Death in thy rusticall tearms,
as much as a good Preacher might have spoken. I tell thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that for thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
discretion, thou might'st get thee a Pulpit, and preach thy fine knacks up and
downe the world. Hee preaches well that lives well (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and I know no
other preaching. Thou needest not (quoth hee:) But I wonder at one thing, that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54746:189"/>
beginning from the feare of God, that thou, who fearest a Lizard more then
him, should'st be so wise? Judge you of your Knight Errantry (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and
meddle not with other mens feares or valors, for I am as pretty a Fearer of God as any
of my neighbours, and so let mee snuffe away this scum: [<hi>Meaning to eat his Hen
and the Goose:</hi>] for all the rest are but idle words, for which wee must give account in
another life. And in so saying hee began to give another assault to the kettle, with
such a courage, that hee wakened <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that undoubtedly would have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
his part, if he had not beene hindered by that, that of necessity must be set down.</p>

Mistris <hi>Dulcinea</hi> aside, hee never saw a fairer woman: the beauteous <hi>Quiteria</hi> was
somewhat pale belike, with the ill night that Brides alwaies have when they dresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the next daies marriage: They drew neer to a Theater on one side of the
Medow that was dressed with Carpets and Boughs, where the marriage was to bee
solemnized, and where they should behold the Dances and inventions: And just as they
should come to the place, they heard a great out-cry behinde them, and a voyce saying;
Stay a while rash people as well as hasty: At whose voyce and words they all turned
about, and saw that hee that spoke was one clad (to see to) in a black Jacket, all welted
with Crimson in flames, crowned (as they straight perceived) with a crown of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Cypresse; in his hand he had a great Truncheon: and comming neerer he was the
known to bee the gallant <hi>Basilius,</hi> who were in suspence, expecting what should be the
issue of those cryes &amp; words, fearing some ill successe from this so unlooked-for arrivall:
Hee drew neer, weary, and out of breath; and comming before the married couple,
and clapping his Truncheon upon the ground, which had a steel pike at the end of it:
his colour changed, and his eyes fixed upon <hi>Quiteria,</hi> with a fearfull hollow voyce,
thus spoke.</p>
                     <p>Well knowest thou, forgetfull <hi>Quiteria,</hi> that according to the Law of God that we
<pb facs="tcp:54746:190"/>
professe, that whilest I live thou canst not bee married to any other; neither are you
ignorant, that because I would stay till time and my industrie might better my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
I would not break that <hi>decorum</hi> that was fitting to the preserving of thy hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty:
but you forgetting all duetie due to my virtuous desires will make another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of what is mine, whose riches serve not only to make him happie in them, but every
way fortunate; and that he may bee so to the full (not as I think hee deserves it, but
as the Fates ordain it for him) I will with these hands remove the impossibilitie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
that may disturbe him, removing my self out of the way. Live rich <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
live with the ungratefull <hi>Quiteria</hi> many and prosperous yeers; and let your poor
<hi>Basilius</hi> die, whose povertie cliped the wings of his happinesse, and laid him in his grave:
And saying this, hee laid hold of his Truncheon that he had stuck in the ground, and the
one half of it remaining still there, shewed that it served for a scabberd to a short Tuck
that was concealed in it, and putting that which might bee called the hilt on the ground,
with a nimble spring and a resolute purpose, hee cast himself upon it, and in an instant
the bloody poynt appeared out of his back, with half the steel blade; the poor soul
weltring in his blood all along on the ground, runne thorow with his own weapon:
His friends ranne presently to help him, grieved with his misery and miserable hap, and
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> forsaking his <hi>Rozinante,</hi> went also to help him; took him in his armes,
but found that as yet there was life in him. They would have pulled out the Tuck,
but the Vicar there present, was of opinion that it were not best, before hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself; for that the drawing it out and his death would bee both at one instant.
But <hi>Basilius</hi> comming a little to himself, with a faint and dolefull voyce, said, If thou
wouldest, O <hi>Quiteria,</hi> yet in this last and forcible trance, give me thy hand to be my
Spouse, I should think my rashnesse might something excuse me, since with this I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to bee thine.</p>
                     <p>The Vicar hearing this, bade him hee should have a care of his souls health, rather
then of the pleasures of his body, and that hee should heartily ask God forgivenesse for
his sinnes, and for his desparate action. To which <hi>Basilius</hi> replyed, That hee would by
no means confesse himself if <hi>Quiteria</hi> did not first give him her hand to bee his Spouse,
for that content would make him cheerfully confesse himself. When <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
heard the wounded mans petition, hee cryed aloud, that <hi>Basilius</hi> desired a thing very
just and reasonable, and that <hi>Signior Camacho</hi> would bee as much honoured in receiving
<hi>Quiteria,</hi> the worthy <hi>Basilius</hi> his Widdow, as if hee had received her from her Fathers
side: here is no more to doe but give one I, no more then to pronounce it, since the
nuptiall Bed of this marriage must be the Grave.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Camacho</hi> gave eare to all this, and was much troubled, not knowing what to doe
or say: but <hi>Basilius</hi> his friends were so earnest, requesting him to consent that <hi>Quite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
might give him her hand to be his Spouse, that hee might not endanger his Soul by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
desperately, that they moved him and enforced him to say, That if <hi>Quiteria</hi>
would, hee was contented, seeing it was but deferring his desires a minute longer. Then
all of them came to <hi>Quiteria,</hi> some with intreaties, others with tears, most with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
reasons, and perswaded her shee should give her hand to poor <hi>Basilius;</hi> and shee
more hard then marble, more lumpish then a statue, would not answer a word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would shee at all, had not the Vicar bid her resolve what shee would doe, for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi>
was even now ready to depart, and could not expect her irresolute determination.
Then the fair <hi>Quiteria,</hi> without answering a word, all sad and troubled, came where
<hi>Basilius</hi> was with his eyes even set, his breath failing him, making shew as if hee would
dye like a Gentile, and not like a Christian. <hi>Quiteria</hi> came at length, and upon her
knees made signes to have his hand. <hi>Basilius</hi> unjoyned his eyes and looking stedfastly
upon her, said, Oh <hi>Quiteria!</hi> thou art now come to bee pittifull, when thy pittie
must bee the sword that shall end my life, since now I want force to receive the glory
that thou givest in choosing me for thine, or to suspend the dolor that so hastily closeth
up mine eyes with the fearfull shade of death: All I desire thee is (oh fatall starre of
mine!) that the hand thou requirest, and that that thou wilt give me, that it bee not
for fashion-sake, nor once more to deceive me, but that thou confesse and say, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54746:190"/>
being forced to it, that thou givest mee thy hand freely, as to thy lawfull Spouse,
since it were unmercifull in this Trance to deceive mee, or to deale falsly with him that
hath beene so true to thee. In the middest of this Discourse hee fainted, so that all
the standers by thought now hee had beene gone. <hi>Quiteria</hi> all honest and shamefac'd,
laying hold with her right hand on <hi>Basilius</hi> his hand, said to him; No force can worke
upon my Will, and so I give thee the freest hand I have, to bee thy lawfull Spouse,
and receive thine, if thou give it mee as freely, and that the anguish of thy sodaine
accident doe not too much trouble thee. I give it (said <hi>Basilius</hi>) lively and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously,
with the best understanding that Heaven hath endowed mee withall,
and therefore take mee, and I deliver my selfe as thy Espousall; and I (said <hi>Quiteria</hi>)
as thy Spouse, whether thou live long, or whether from my armes they carry thee to
thy Grave.</p>
                     <p>This young man said <hi>Sancho,</hi> being so wounded, talks much mee think, let him leave
his wooing, and attend his soules health, which me thinks appeares more in his tongue,
then in his teeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Quiteria</hi> having their hands thus fastened, the Vicar tender-hearted and
compassionate, powred his blessing upon them, and prayed God to give good rest
to the new married mans soule, who as soone as he received this benediction, sodainly
starts up, and with an unlook'd for agility, drew out the Tuck which was sheathed in
his body. All the spectators were in a maze, and some of them, more out of simplicitie
then curiositie, began to cry out, A miracle, a miracle: But <hi>Basilius</hi> replyed, No
Miracle, no miracle; but a Trick, a trick. But the Vicar heed-lesse and astonish't,
came with both his hands to feele the wound, and found that the blade had neyther pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through flesh or ribs, but through a hollow pipe of iron, that hee filled with blood,
well fitted in that place, and (as after it was knowne) prepared so that it could not
congeale. At last the Vicar and <hi>Camacho,</hi> and all the standers by, thought that they
were mocked and made a laughing stock. The Bride made no great shew of sorrow, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when shee heard say that the marriage could not stand currant, because it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,
shee said, that shee anew confirmed it; by which they all collected,
That the businesse had beene plotted by the knowledge and consentment of them
both.</p>
                     <p>At which <hi>Camacho</hi> and his friends were so abashed, that they remitted their revenge
to their hands, and unsheathing many swords, they set upon <hi>Basilius,</hi> in whose favour,
in an instant there were as many more drawne: and <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

way through um all. <hi>Sancho</hi> (whom such feares did never please or solace) ran to the
pottage-pot, from whence hee had gotten the skimmings, thinking that to bee a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and so to bee respected. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> cryed aloud, Hold, hold Sirs; for there
is no reason that you should take revenge for the wrongs that Love doth us; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Love and Warre are all one; and as in warre it is lawfull to use sleights and

and juggling-tricks are held for good, to attaine to the wished end, so it bee not
in prejudice and dishonour of the thing affected. <hi>Quiteria</hi> was due to <hi>Basilius,</hi> and
<hi>Basilius</hi> to <hi>Quiteria,</hi> by the just and favourable inclination of Heaven. <hi>Camacho,</hi> is
rich, and may purchase his delight, and whom God hath joyned, let no man separate.
<hi>Basilius</hi> hath but this one sheepe, let none offer to take it from him, bee hee never so
powerfull: Hee that first attempts it, must first passe through the point of this Launce;
at which hee shaked his Launce strongly and cunningly, that hee frighted all that knew
him not: But <hi>Quiteriaes</hi> disdaine was so inwardly fixt in <hi>Camachoes</hi> heart, that hee
forgot her in an instant; so that the Vicars perswasions prevailed with him (who was
a good discreete and honest-minded man) by which <hi>Camacho</hi> and his complices were
pacified and quieted, in signe of which, they put up their swords, rather blaming <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terias</hi>
facilitie, then <hi>Basilius</hi> his industry. <hi>Camacho</hi> fram'd this Discourse to himselfe,
That if <hi>Quiteria</hi> loved <hi>Basilius</hi> when shee was a maide, shee would also have continued
her love to him though she had beene his wife, so that he ought to give God thanks ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:54746:191"/>
for having ridden him of her, then to have given her to him. <hi>Camacho</hi> then, and
those of his crue being comforted and pacified; all <hi>Basilius</hi> his likewise were so: and
<hi>Camacho,</hi> to shew that hee stomacked not the jest, nor cared for it, was willing the
Feast should goe forward, as if hee had been really married. But neither <hi>Basilius</hi> nor
his Spouse, nor their followers would stay, but went to <hi>Basilius</hi> his Town: for your
poor that bee virtuous and discreet, have as well those that will follow, honour, and
uphold them, as the rich theirs, and such as will flatter them. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went with
them too, for they esteemed him to bee a man of worth and valour: But <hi>Sancho's</hi>
minde was in a mist to see that it was impossible for him to stay for <hi>Camacho's</hi> sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Feast and Sports that lasted till the evening; so that straightned and sorrowfull
he followed on with his Master that went in <hi>Basilius</hi> his Squadron, and thus left behinde
him those flesh-pots of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> though he bore them with him in his minde, whose skum
which hee carried in the Kettle being consumed now and ended, represented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him the glorious and aboundant happinsse hee lost; so that all sad and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

himself three daies at the Bridegrooms charge, and now knew that

trick of <hi>Basilius,</hi> who hoped for the successe that hath been shewed:
true it was, that hee had made some of his loving friends acquainted with his purpose,
that they might help him at need, and make good his deceit. They cannot bee called
deceits (quoth <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>Quixote</hi>) that are done to a virtuous end, and that the marriage
of a loving couple was an end most excellent: but by the way, you must know that
the greatest opposite that loue hath, is want and continuall necessity; for Love is all
mirth, content, and gladsomenesse, and the more, when hee that Loves, enjoyes the
thing Loved, against which, Necessity and Poverty are open and declared enemies.
All this hee spoke with a purpose to advise <hi>Basilius,</hi> that hee should leave exercising
his youthfull abilities, that although they got him a name, yet they brought no wealth,
and that hee should look to lay up something now by lawfull and industrious means,
which are never wanting to those that will bee wary and apply themselves: the honest
poor man (if so bee the poor man may bee called honest) hath a Jewell of a fair Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which if any man bereave him of, dishonors him and kills her: Shee that is fair
and honest when her Husband is poor, deserves to bee crowned with Lawrell and
triumphant Bayes. Beauty alone attracts the eyes of all that behold it; and the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Eagles and high flying Birds doe stoop to it as to the pleasing Lure: but if extream
Necessity bee added to that Beauty, then Kites and Crows will grapple with it, and
other ravenous Birds; but shee that is constant against all these assaults, doth well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to bee her Husbands crown. Mark wise <hi>Basilius</hi> (proceeds <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) it was
an opinion of I know not what sage man, that there was but one good woman in the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54746:191"/>
World; and his advice was, That every man should think that was married, that his
Wife was shee, and so hee should bee sure to live contented. I never yet was married,
neither have I any thought hitherto that way; notwithstanding, I could bee able to
give any man councell herein that should ask it, and how hee should choose his
Wife.</p>
                     <p>First of all I would have him rather respect Fame then Wealth; for the honest woman
gets not a good name only with being good, but in appearing so; for your publique
loosenesse and libertie doth more prejudice a womans honestie, then her sinning secretly.
If you bring her honest to your house, 'tis easie keeping her so and to better her in that
goodnesse: but if you bring her dishonest, 'tis hard mending her; for it is not very
plyable to passe from one extream into another, I say not impossible; but I hold it to
bee very difficult.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> heard all this, and said to himself, This Master of mine, when I speak matters
of marrow and substance, is wont to tell me, that I may take a Pulpit in hand, and
preach my fine knacks up and down the world; but I may say of him, that when hee
once begins to thred his sentences, hee may not only begin to take a Pulpit in hand, but
in each finger too, and goe up and down the Market place, and cry, Who buyes my
Ware? The Divell take thee for a Knight Errant, how wise he is? On my soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>naps
at all, and there is no boat that hee hath not an oare in. <hi>Sancho</hi> spoke this somewhat
aloud, and his Master over-heard him, and asked, What is that thou art grumbling
<hi>Sancho?</hi> I say nothing, neither doe I grumble (quoth hee) I was only saying to my
self, that I would I had heard you before I was married, and perhaps I might now have
said, The sound man needs no Physician, Is <hi>Teresa</hi> so bad <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>
Not very bad (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and yet not very good, at least, not so good as I would
have her. Thou do'st ill <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) to speake ill of thy Wife, who
is indeed mother of thy children.</p>
                     <p>There's no love lost (quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi>) for shee speaks ill of me too when shee list,
especially when shee is jealous; for then the Divell himself will not cope with her.
Well, three dayes they stayed with the married couple, where they were welcommed
like Princes. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> desired the skilfull Parson to provide him a guide that might
shew him the way to <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave, for hee had a great desire to enter into it, and
to see with his own eyes if those wonders that were told of it up &amp; down the Countrey
were true. The Parson told him, that a Cousin-german of his, a famous Student, and
much addicted to Books of Knighthood should goe with him, who should willingly
carry him to the mouth of the Cave, and should shew the famous Lake of <hi>Ruydera,</hi>
telling him hee would bee very good company for him, by reason hee was one that
knew how to publish Books, and direct them to great men</p>
                     <p>By and by the young Student comes me upon an Asse with Foale, with a course
packing cloth, or doubled carpet upon his Pack-saddle. <hi>Sancho</hi> saddled <hi>Rozinante,</hi>
and made ready his Dapple, furnished his Wallets, and carried the Students too, as
well provided; and so taking leave and bidding all, God bee with you, they went on,
holding their course to <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave. By the way <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> asked the
Scholler of what kinde or quality the exercises of his profession and studie were. To
which hee answered, that his Profession was Humanity, his Exercises and Studie to
make Books for the Presse, which were very beneficiall to himself and no lesse gratefull
to the Common-wealth; that one of his Books was intituled, <hi>The Book of the Liveries,</hi>
where are set down seven hundred and three sorts of Liveries, with their Colours, Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's,
and Cyphers, from whence any may bee taken at Festivall times and shews by
Courtiers, without begging them from any body, or distilling (as you would say) from
their own brains to sute them to their desires and intentions; for I give to the jealous,
to the forsaken, to the forgotten, to the absent, the most agreeable, that will fit them
as well as their Punks. Another Book I have, which I mean to call the <hi>Metamorphosis.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:54746:192"/>

not forgetting that of <hi>Pioio,</hi> that of the gilded Pipe and of the Abbesse, and all this
with the Allegories, Metaphors, and Translations, that they delight, suspend and instruct
all in a moment. Another book I have, which I call a supply to <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the invention of things, which is of great reading and study, by reason that I doe
verifie many matters of waight that <hi>Polydore</hi> omitted, and declare them in a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
stile; <hi>Virgil</hi> forgot to tell us who was the first that had a Catarre in the world, and
the first that was anoynted for the French-disease, and I set it down presently after I
propose it, and Authorize it with at least foure and twenty Writers, that you may see
whether I have taken good paines, and whether the said booke may not bee profitable
to the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> that was very attentive to the Schollers narration, asked him: Tell mee Sir,
so God direct your right hand in the Impression of your Bookes; Can you tell mee?
(for I know you can, since you know all) who was the first man that scratcht his head,
for I beleeve it was our first father <hi>Adam?</hi> Yes marry was it (said he) for <hi>Adam,</hi> no
doubt, had both head and haire, and being the first man in the world, would sometimes
scratch himselfe. I beleeve it (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) but tell me now, Who was the first Vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the world? Truly Brother (said he) I cannot at present resolve you, I will stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it when I come to my bookes, and then Ile satisfie you when wee see one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
for I hope this will not bee the last time. Well Sir said <hi>Sancho,</hi> never trouble
your selfe with this, for now I can resolve the doubt: Know, that the first Tumbler
in the world was <hi>Lucifer,</hi> when he was cast out of heaven, and came tumbling downe
to hell.</p>
                     <p>You say true (quoth the Scholler.) And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said; This answere <hi>Sancho,</hi> is
none of thine, thou hast heard some body say so. Peace Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for if I fall
to question and answere, I shall not make an end betweene this and Morning: And

for you have some that are most busied in knowing and averring things, whose
knowledge and remembrance is not worth a button. All that day they passed in these
and other delightfull Discourses, and at night they lodged in a little Village, from
whence the Scholler told them they had but two little leagues to <hi>Montesinoes</hi> Cave,
and that if hee meant to enter it, he must be provided of Ropes to tie, and let himselfe
downe into the depth. <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>Quixote</hi> said, that though it were as deepe as Hell, hee
would see whither it reached; so they bought a hundred fathome of cordage, and the
next day at two of the clock they came to the Cave, whose mouth is wide and spacious,
but full of briers and brambles, and wilde fig-trees, and weeds so intricate and thick,
that they altogether blind and dam it up. When they came to it, <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
alighted, and <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> whom they tyed strongly with the cordage, and whil'st
they were swathing and binding of him, <hi>Sancho</hi> said to him; Take heed Sir what you doe
doe not bury your selfe alive, and doe not hang your self, like a bottle, to bee cooled in
some well; for it neither concernes nor belongs to you, to search this place, worse then
a Dungeon.</p>
                     <p>Binde mee and peace (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for such an enterprize as this, <hi>Sancho</hi>
was reserved for mee. Then said the Guide, I beseech you Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
that you take heede, and looke about you with an hundred eyes, to see what is within;
for perhaps you may meete with things that will bee fit for mee to put in my booke of
Transformations. He hath his Instrument in his hand (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that knows how
to use it.</p>
                     <p>This said, and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> binding ended (which was not upon his Harnesse, but
upon his arming doublet) hee said. Wee did unadvisedly, in not providing our selves
of some small bell, that might have beene tyed with mee to the same cord, by whose
sound you might know that I were still toward the bottome and alive; but since there
is now no remedy, God bee our good speede, and streight hee kneeled upon his knees,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54746:192"/>
and made a soft Prayer to God Almighty, desiring his ayde, and to give him good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in that (to see to) dangerous and strange Adventure, and then straight waies
hee cried aloud; Oh thou Mistrisse of my Actions and motions, most excellent, peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> if it bee possible, that the prayers and requests of this thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

                     <p>And in saying this he came to the mouth, but saw he could not come neer to bee let
down, except it were by making way with maine force, or with cutting through; and
so laying hand on his Sword, he began to cut and slash the weeds that were at the mouth
of the Cave, at whose rushing and noyse, there came out an infinite company of Crowes
and Dawes, so thick and so hastily, that they tumbled <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> on the ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he had been as superstitious, as good Christian, hee would have taken it for an ill signe,
and not have proceeded.</p>
                     <p>Well, he rose, and seeing the Crowes were all gone, and that there were no other
night-byrd, as Bats, that came out amongst the Crowes, <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Scholer let him
down to search the bottom of that fearfull Cave; but <hi>Sancho</hi> first bestowed his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
on him, and making a thousand crosses over him, said; God and the <hi>Rock</hi> of

little and little; and when his voyce (that was stopt in the gutters of the Cave) could
bee no longer heard, and that they had let downe their hundred fathome of Rope, they
were of opinion to hoyst him up againe, since they could give him no more Cord; for
all that, they stayed some half an houre, and then beganne easily to draw up the Rope,
and without any weight, which made them think <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was within, and <hi>Sancho</hi>
beleeving it wept bitterly, and drew up apace, that he might be satisfied; but coming
somewhat neere fourescore fathome, they felt a weight, which made them very much
rejoyce.</p>
                     <p>At length when they came to ten, they plainly saw <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to whom <hi>Sancho</hi>
cried out saying; You are well returned Sir, for we thought you had stayed there for
breed. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did not answer a word, but drawing him altogether out, they
saw that his eyes were shut, as if he were asleep; they stretcht him on the ground and
unbound him, and for all this he awaked not. But they so turned, tos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, that a pretty while after he came to himself, lazing himself, as if he had wakened
out of a great and profound sleep, and looking wildly round about him said; God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
you Friends, for you have raysed me from one of the delicatest and pleasingest lives
and sights that ever was seen by humane eye: Now at length I perceive, that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights

                     <p>The Schaller and <hi>Sancho</hi> gave eare to these words which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> spake, as if
with great paine they came from his very entrailes: They desired him to let them know
his meaning, and to tell them what hee had seene in that hellish place. Hellish, call yee
it, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Well, call it not so, for it deserves not the name, as straight
you shall heare: Hee desired them to give him somewhat to eate, for he was exceeding
hungry. They laid the Scholers course wrapper upon the greene grasse, and went to
the <hi>Spence</hi> of their Wallets, and all three of them being set like good fellowes, eat their

two clouds, shewed but a dim light, and with his temperate
beams, gave <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> leave, without heat or trouble, to relate
to his two conspicuous Auditors, what hee had seen in <hi>Montesino's</hi>
Cave; and hee began as followeth: About a twelve or fourteen
mens heights in the profunditie of this Dungeon, on the right hand,
there is a concavitie and space able to contain a Cart, Mules and all;
some light there comes into it by certain chinks and loop-holes, which answer to it a
farre off in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the earth; this space and concavitie saw I, when I was
weary and angry to see my self hanging by the rope, to goe down to that obscure, region
without being carried a sure or known way; so I determined to enter into it, and to
rest a little; I cryed out unto you, that you should let down no more rope till I bade
you; but it seemed you heard me not: I went gathering up the rope you let down
to me, and rowling of it up into a heap, sate me down upon it very pensative, thinking
with my self what I might doe to get to the bottome; and being in this thought and
confusion, upon a suddain (without any former inclination in me) a most profound
sleep came upon me, and when I least thought of it, without knowing how, nor which
way, I awaked out of it, and found my self in the midest of the fairest, most pleasant,
and delightfull Medow that ever Nature created, or the wisest humane discretion can
imagine; I snuffed mine eyes, wiped them, and saw that I was not asleep, but really
awake, notwithstanding I felt upon my head and my brest, to bee assured if I were
there my self or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p in person, or that it were some illusion, or counterfeit; but my
tounching, feeling, and my reasonable discourse that I made to my self certified me, that
I was then present, the same that I am now.</p>
                     <p>By and by I saw a Princely and sumptuous Palace or Castle, whose walls and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
seemed to bee made of transparent Cristall, from whence (upon the opening
of two great gates) I saw that there came towards me a reverend old man, clad in a
tawny bayes Frock, that hee dragged upon the ground: over his shoulders and brest
hee wore a Tippet of green sattin, like your fellows of Colledges; and upon his cap
a black <hi>Milan</hi> Bonnet, and his hoary beard reached down to his gyrdle; hee had no
kinde of weapon in his hand, but only a <hi>Rosary</hi> of Beads, somewhat bigger then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Wall-nuts, and the <hi>Credo</hi>-Beads, about the bignesse of Ostrich eggs; his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
pace, gravitie, and his spreading presence, each thing by it self, and all together,
suspended and admired.</p>
                     <p>Hee came to me, and the first thing hee did, was to imbrace me straightly, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
said; It is long since (renowned Knight, <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi>) that
wee who live in these inchanted Desarts have hoped to see thee, that thou mightest let
the World know what is contained here, and inclosed in this profound Cave which
thou hast entred, called <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave; an exploit reserved only to bee attempted
by thy invincible Heart and stupendious Courage: Come with me thou most illustrious

of which I am the Governour, and perpetuall chief Warder, as being the same <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinos,</hi>
from whom the Cave takes name.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had hee told me that hee was <hi>Montesinos,</hi> when I asked him, Whether it
were true that was bruited here in the world above, that hee had taken his great friend
<hi>Durandartes</hi> heart out of the midest of his bosome with a little Dagger, and carried it
to the Lady <hi>Belerm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> (as hee willed) at the instant of his death? He answered me, that
all was true, but only that of the Dagger; for it was no Dagger, but a little Stilletto
as sharp as a Nawle.</p>
                     <p>Belike (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) it was of <hi>Ramon de Hozes</hi> the Sevillians making. I know
not (sayd <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but 'twas not of that Stilletto-maker, for hee lived but the
other day, and that battell of <hi>Roncesualles,</hi> where this accident happened, was many
yeeres since: but this averring is of no importance or let, neither alters the truth, or
Stories text.</p>
                     <p>You say right (quoth the Scholler) for I hearken with the greatest delight in the
world. With no lesse doe I tell it you (sayd <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and proceede; The
venerable <hi>Montesinos</hi> brought me into the Cristalline Palace, where in a low Hall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fresh and coole, all of Alablaster, was a great Sepulcher of Marble, made with
singular Art, upon which I saw a Knight layd at length, not of Brasse, Marble, or
Jaspar, as you use to have in other tombes, but of pure flesh and bone, hee held his
right hand (which was somewhat hairy and sinowy, a signe that the owner was very
strong) upon his heart-side, and before I asked <hi>Montesinos</hi> ought, that saw mee in
suspence, beholding the tombe, hee said:</p>
                     <p>This is my friend <hi>Durandarte,</hi> the flower and mirror of Chivalrie, of the enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and valiant Knights of his time: Hee is kept here inchanted, as my selfe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Knights and Ladies are, by <hi>Merlin [For so I translate it, to shew the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
mistake.]</hi> that French Enchanter; who, they say, was sonne to the Devill, but
as I beleeve hee was not so, only hee knew more then the Devill. Why or how hee
enchanted us, no body knowes, which the times will bring to light, that I hope are not
farr off: all that I admire is, (since I know for certaine, as it is now day, that <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darte</hi>
dyed in my armes, and that after hee was dead, I tooke out his heart, and surely
it weighed above two pounds; for according to naturall Philosophy, hee that hath
the biggest heart, is more valiant then hee that hath but a lesse: which being so, and
that this Knight died really) how hee complaines and sighes sometimes as if hee were
alive? Which said, the wretched <hi>Durandarte,</hi> crying out aloud, said; Oh my Cousin
<hi>Montesinos,</hi> the last thing that I requested you when I was dying, and my soule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting;
was, That you would carry my heart to <hi>Belerma,</hi> taking it out of my bosome,
either with ponyard or dagger: which when the venerable <hi>Montesinos</hi> heard, hee
kneeled before the greeved Knight, and with teares in his eyes, said; Long since, Oh
<hi>Durandarte,</hi> long since my dearest Cousin, I did what you en-joyn'd mee in that
bitter day of our losse; I tooke your heart, as well as I could, without leaving the
least part of it in your brest: I wiped it with a laced handkerchiefe, and posted with
it towards <hi>France,</hi> having first layd you in the bosome of the earth, with so many
teares as was sufficient to wash my hands, or to wipe off the bloud from them, which I
had gotten by stirring them in your entrailes: and for more assurance that I did it,
my dearest Cousin, at the first place I came to from <hi>Roncesualle,</hi> I cast salt upon your
heart, that it might not stinke, and might bee fresh, and embalmed when it should
come to the presence of the Lady <hi>Belerma,</hi> who with you and mee, <hi>Guadiana</hi> your
Squire, the waiting-woman <hi>Ruydera,</hi> and her seven Daughters, and her two Neeces,
and many other of your acquaintances and friends, have beene enchanted heere by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
that Wizard long since, and though it bee above five hundred yeeres agoe, yet none
of us is dead; only <hi>Ruydera,</hi> her Daughters and Neeces are wanting, whom by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their lamentation. <hi>Merlin</hi> that had compassion on them, turned them into so
many Lakes now living in the world: and in the Province of <hi>Mancha</hi> they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Lakes of <hi>Ruydera;</hi> seven belong to the Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the two Neeces
<pb facs="tcp:54746:194"/>
to the Knights of the most holy Order of Saint <hi>Iohn. Guadiana</hi> your Squire, wailing
in like manner this mis-hap, was turned into a River that bore his owne name, who
when hee came to the superficies of the earth, and saw the Sun in another heaven,
such was his griefe to have left you, that hee straight plunged himselfe into the entrailes
of the earth: but, as it is not possible for him to leave his naturall Current, sometimes
hee appeares and shewes himselfe, where the Sunne and men may see him. The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
Lakes do minister their waters to him, with which, and many others, hee enters
Portugall in pompe: but which way so-ere hee goes, hee shewes his sorrow and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and contemnes the breeding of dainty fish in his waters, and such as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed,
but only muddie and unsavorie, farre differing from those of golden <hi>Tagus;</hi>
and what I now tell you, Cousin mine, I have told you often, and since you answer
mee nothing, I imagine you eyther beleeve mee not, or not heare mee; for which
(God knowes) I am heartily sorry. One newes I will let you know, which though
perhaps it may not any way lighten your griefe, yet it will no way increase it: Know,
that you have here in your presence, (open your eyes and you shall see him) that
famous Knight, of whom <hi>Merlin</hi> prophesied such great matters, that <hi>Don-Quixote
de la Mancha,</hi> I say, that now newly and more happily then former Ages, hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the long forgotten Knight Errantry, by whose meanes and favour, it may bee, that
wee also may bee dis-inchanted; for great exploits are reserved for great Personages.
And if it be otherwise (answered the grieved <hi>Durandarte</hi>) with a faint and low voyce,
if it bee otherwise, oh Cousin, I say, Patience and shuffle: [Patiencia ybaraiar. <hi>A
Metaphor taken from Card-players, who when they lose, cry to the dealer, Patience, and
shuffle the Cards.</hi>] and turning on one side, hee returned to his accustomed silence,
without speaking one word.</p>
                     <p>By this wee heard great howling and moane, accompanied with deepe sighes,
and short-breath'd accents: I turned mee about, and saw that in another roome there
came passing by the Christall waters, a procession of a company of most beautifull
Damzels, in two rankes, all clad in mourning, with Turbants upon their heads, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Turkish fashion; at last, and in the end of the rankes, there came a Lady, who
by her majesty appear'd so, clothed in like manner in blacke, with a white dressing
on her head, so large, that it kissed the very ground. Her Turbant was twice as bigg
as the bigest of the rest: shee was somewhat beetle-brow'd, flat-nosed, wide mouth'd,
but red lipped: her teeth, for sometimes shee discovered them, seemed to bee thin, and
not very well placed, though they were as white as blanch'd Almonds: in her hand shee
carried a fine cloth, and within it (as might be perceived) a mommied Heart, by reason
of the dry embalming of it: <hi>Montesinos</hi> told me, that all those in that procession were
servants to <hi>Durandarte</hi> and <hi>Belerma</hi> that were there enchanted with their Masters;
and that shee that came last with the linnen cloth and the heart in her hand, was the
Lady <hi>Belerma,</hi> who, together with her Damzels, four dayes in the week did make that
procession, singing, or to say truer, howling their Dirges over the body and grieved
heart of his Cousin; and if now shee appeared somewhat foul to me, or not so fair
as Fame hath given out, the cause was, her bad nights, but worse dayes that shee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
in that enchantment, as I might see by her deep-sunk eyes, and her broken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and her monethly disease, is not the cause of these (an ordinary thing in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
for it is many moneths since, and many yeers that shee hath not had it, not known
what it is; but the grief that shee hath in her own heart, for that shee carries in her
hand continually, which renews and brings to her remembrance, the unfortunatenesse
of her lucklesse Lover; for if it were not for this, scarce would the famous <hi>Dulcinea
del Toboso</hi> equall her in Beauty, Wit, or livelinesse, that is so famous in the <hi>Mancha,</hi>
and all the world over. Not too fast (then said I) Signior <hi>Don Montesinos,</hi> on with
your story as befits; for you know all comparisons are odious; and so leave your
comparing; the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> is what shee is, and the Lady <hi>Belerma</hi> is
what shee is and hath been; and let this suffice.</p>
                     <p>To which hee answered, Pardon me Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I confesse I did ill,
and not well, to say the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> would scarce equall the Lady <hi>Belerma,</hi> since it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54746:194"/>
had beene sufficient, that I understood (I know not by what ayme) that you are
her Knight, enough to have made mee bite my Tongue, before I had compared her
with any thing but Heaven it selfe. With this satisfaction that <hi>Montesinos</hi> gave mee,
my heart was free from that sodaine passion I had, to heare my Mistresse compared to
<hi>Belerma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I marvell (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that you got not to the old Carl aud bang'd his bones
and pul'd his beard, without leaving him a haire in it.</p>
                     <p>No friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> said hee, it was not fit for mee to doe so; for we are all bound to
reverence our Elders, although they bee no Knights, and most of all when they are so,
and are enchanted. I know well enough, I was not behinde hand with him in other
questions and answers that passed betweene us. Then said the Scholer, I know not Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how you in so little time (as it is since you went downe) have
seene so many things, and spoken and answered so much. How long is it (quoth hee)
since I went downe? A little more then an houre (said <hi>Sancho.</hi>) That cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> because it was Morning and Evening, and Evening and Morning
three times; so that by my account, I have beene three dayes in those parts so remote
and hidden from our sight. Surely my Master, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> is in the right; for as all
things that befall him are by way of Enchantment, so perhaps that which appeares to us,
but an houre, is to him there three nights and three dayes. Hee hath hit it (said <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>)
And have you eat Sir in all this time (quoth the Scholer?) Not a bit
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) neyther have I beene hungry, or so much as thought of eating.
And the Enchanted, eat they, said the Scholer? No, said hee, neyther are they troubled
with your greater excrements, although it bee probable that their nayles, their beards,
and their hayres grow; Sleepe they haply said <hi>Sancho?</hi> No indeede said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
at least these three dayes that I have beene with them, not one of them hath closed his
eyes, nor I neyther. That fits the Proverb (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) which sayes, You shall
know the Person by his company; you have beene amongst the Enchanted, and those
that watch and fast; no mervail therefore though you neyther slept nor eate whilest
you were amongst them; but pray Sir pardon me if I say, God (or the Devill, I was
about to say) take mee, if I beleeve a word of all this you have spoken. Why not, said
the Scholer? Doe you thinke Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would lie to us, for though hee
would, hee hath not had time to compose or invent such a million of lies? I doe not
beleeve, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that my Master lies: But what doe you beleeve then quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>
Mary I beleeve (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that that <hi>Merlin,</hi> or those Enchanters that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
all that rabble, that you say you have seene and conversed with there below,

of our journey I shall tell thee: Hee shewed mee three Country-wenches, that
went leaping and frisking up and down those pleasant fields, like Goates, and I scarce
saw them, when I perceived the one was the peerelesse <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and the other two,
the selfe same that wee spoke to when wee left <hi>Toboso.</hi> I asked <hi>Montesinos</hi> whether hee
knew them; who answered me, Not; but that sure they were some Ladies of quality
there Enchanted, that but lately appeared in those fields, and that it was no wonder,
for that there were many others of former times, and these present, that were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
in strange and different shapes, amongst whom hee knew <hi>Queene Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivere,</hi>
and her woman <hi>Quintani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Britaine.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> heard his Master thus farre, it made him starke mad, and ready to burst
with laughter; for by reason that hee knew the truth of <hi>Dulcineaes</hi> Enchantment, as
having beene himselfe the Enchanter, and the raiser of that Tale, hee did undoubtedly
ratifie his beliefe, that his Master was madde and out of his wits; and so told him:
In an ill time, and dismall day (Patron mine) went you downe into the other world,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:195"/>
and at an ill season met with Signior <hi>Montesinos,</hi> that hath returned you in
this pickle: you were well enough here above, in your right sences as God
hath given them you, uttering sentences, and giving good counsaile every
foote, and not as now, telling the greatest unlikelihoods that can bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
                     <p>Because I know thee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) I make no account of thy words.
Nor I of yours (said hee;) you may strike or kill me if you will, either for those I have
spoken, or those I mean to speak, if you doe not correct and amend your self. But pray
tell me Sir, whilest wee are at quiet, How knew you it was our Mistris? Spoke you to
her? What said shee? And what answered you? I knew her (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
by the same clothes shee had on at such time as thou shewd'st her mee; I spoke to her,
but shee gave me not a word, but turned her back, and scudded away so fast, that a
flight would not have overtaken her: I meant to have followed her, and had done it
but that <hi>Montesinos</hi> told me it was in vain, and the rather, because it was now high
time for me to return out of the Cave. Hee told me likewise, that in processe of time
hee would let me know the means of disinchanting <hi>Durandarte,</hi> and <hi>Belerma,</hi> and
himself, together with all the rest that were there: But that which most grieved me,
was, that whilest I was thus talking with <hi>Montesinos,</hi> one of the unfortunate <hi>Dulcinea's</hi>
companions came on one side of me (I not perceiving it) and with teares in her eyes
and hollow voyce said to me; My Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> commends her to you,
and desires to know how you doe; and withall, because shee is in great necessity, shee
desires you with all earnestnesse, thou you would bee pleased to lend her three shillings
upon this new Cotten Petticoat that I bring you, or what you can spare; for shee will
pay you again very shortly. This Message held me in suspence and admiration: so that
turning to Signior <hi>Montesinos,</hi> I asked him, Is it possible, Signior, that those of your
better sort that bee enchanted are in want? To which hee answered, Beleeve me, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> this necessity rangeth and extends it self every where, and over-takes
all men, neither spares shee the Enchanted; and therefore since the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi>
demands these three shillinigs of you, and that the pawn seems to bee good, lend them
her, for sure shee is much straightned. I will take no pawn (quoth I) neither can I lend
what she requires; for I have but two shillings: These I gave, which were the same <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
that thou gavest me t'other day, for almes to the poor we met: and I told the Maid,
Friend, tell your Mistris that I am sorry with all my heart for her wants, and I would
I were a <hi>Fucar</hi> to relieve them: [Fucares <hi>were a rich Family and name in</hi> Germanie
<hi>that maintained a bank of monies in</hi> Spain, <hi>and still used to furnish</hi> Philip <hi>the 2. with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in his Warres:</hi>] and let her know that I neither can, nor may have health, wanting
her pleasing company and discreet conversation; and that I desire her as earnestly as
may bee, that this her captive Servant and way-beaten Knight may see and treat with
her.</p>
                     <p>You shall also say, that when shee least thinks of it, shee shall heare say, that I have
made an Oath and Vow, such as was the Marquis his of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to revenge his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phue
<hi>Baldwine,</hi> when hee found him ready to give up the Ghost in the midest of the
Mountain; which was, Not to eat his meat with Napkins, and other flim-flams added
thereunto, till hee had revenged his death: And so swear I, Not to be quiet, till I have
travelled all the seven partitions of the World, more Punctually then Prince <hi>Don
Manuel</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> till I have disinchanted her. All this and more you owe to my
Mistris, said the Damzell; and taking the two shillings, instead of making me a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
shee fetch'd a caper two yards high in the ayre.</p>
                     <p>Blessed God! (<hi>Sancho</hi> cryed out) and is it possible that Enchanters and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should so much prevaile upon him, as to turn his right understanding into such
a wilde madnesse? Sir, Sir, for Gods love have a care of your self, and look to your
credit: beleeve not in these bubbles that have lessened and crazed your wits. Out of
thy love <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou speakest this (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and for want of experience in
the world, all things that have never so little difficultie seem to thee to bee impossible:
but time will come (as I have told thee already) that I shall relate some things that I

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Translator of this famous Historie out of his Originall, written by
<hi>Cid Hamete Benengeli,</hi> sayes; That when hee came to the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
going before, these words were written in the margin by the same
<hi>Hamete.</hi> I cannot beleeve or bee perswaded that all that is written
in the antecedent Chapter hapned so punctually to the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>
the reason is, because all Adventures hitherto have been
accidentall and probable; but this of the Cave, I see no likelihood of the truth of it, as
being so unreasonable: Yet to think <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would lye, being the worthiest
Gentleman, and noblest Knight of his time, is not possible; for hee would not lye
though hee were shot to death with arrows. On the other side I consider, that hee
related it, with all the aforesaid circumstances, and that in so short a time hee could
not frame such a Machina of fopperies; and if this Adventure seem to bee Apocrypha,
the fault is not mine; so that leaving it indifferent, I here set it down. Thou, Oh
Reader, as thou art wise, judge as thou thinkest good; for I can doe no more; though
one thing bee certain, that when hee was upon his death-bed, hee disclaimed this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and said, That hee had only invented it, because it suted with such as hee had
read of in his Histories: so hee proceeds, saying:</p>
                     <p>The Scholler wondred, as well at <hi>Sancho's</hi> boldnesse as his Masters patience; but hee
thought, that by reason of the joy that hee received in having seen his Mistris <hi>Dulcinea</hi>
(though enchanted) that softnesse of condition grew upon him; for had it been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>Sancho</hi> spoke words that might have grinded him to powder; for in his opinion
hee was somewhat sawcy with his Master, to whom hee said:</p>
                     <p>Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I think the journey that I have made with you very well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
because in it I have stored up four things: The first is, the having known your
self, which I esteem as a great happinesse: The second, to have known the secrets of
this <hi>Montesinos</hi> Cave, with the transformations of <hi>Guadiana</hi> and <hi>Ruydera's</hi> Lakes,
which may help me in my Spanish <hi>Ovid</hi> I have in hand: The third is, to know the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of Card-playing, which was used at least in time of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, as may bee collected out of the words you say <hi>Durandarte</hi> used, when, after a
long speech between him and <hi>Montesinos,</hi> hee awakened saying, Patience and shuffle:
and this kinde of speaking hee could not learn when hee was Enchanted, but when hee
lived in <hi>France,</hi> in time of the aforesaid Emperour: and this observation comes in
pudding time for the other Book that I am making, which is, My supply to <hi>Polydore
Vergil</hi> in the invention of Antiquities, and I believe in his hee left out Cards which
I will put in, as a matter of great importance, especially having so authentike
an Authour as Signior <hi>Durandarte.</hi> The fourth is, to have known for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the true spring of the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> which hath hitherto beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
                     <p>You have reason (said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) but I would fain know of you, now that it
pleased God to give you abilities to print your Books, To whom will you direct them?
You have Lords and <hi>Grandees [A name given to men of Title, as Dukes Marquisses,
or Earls in</hi> Spain, <hi>whose only priviledge is to stand covered before the King,]</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>
(said the Scholler) to whom I may direct them. Few of them (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) not
<pb facs="tcp:54746:196"/>
because they doe not deserve the Dedications, but because they will not admit
of them, not to obliege themselves to the satisfaction that is due to the Authours
Paines and Courtesie. One Prince I knowe that may supply the deserts of the rest,
with such advantage, that should I speake of it; it might stirre up envie in some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Breasts: But let this rest till some fit time, and let us looke out where wee may
lodge to night.</p>
                     <p>Not farre from hence (said the Scholer) there is a Hermitage, where dwels a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
that they say hath beene a Souldier, and is thought to bee a good Christian, and
very discreete and charitable. Besides the Hermitage, he hath a little House which hee
hath built at his owne charge; yet though it bee little, it is fit to receive guests. Hath hee
any Hens trow, said <hi>Sancho?</hi> Few Hermits are without them, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for
your Hermites now a dayes, are not like those that lived in the Desarts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that
were clad in Palme-leaves, and lived upon the rootes of the Earth, but mistake me not,
that because I speak well of them, I should speak ill of these, only the penetency of these
times comes not neere those; yet for ought I know, all are good, at least I think so, and
if the worst come to the worst, your Hypocrite that fains himself good, doth lesse hurt
then he that sins in publique.</p>
                     <p>As they were thus talking, they might espy a Foot-man comming towards them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pace, and beating with his wand a hee-Mule laden with Lances &amp; Halberts; when he
came neere them, he saluted them and passed on; but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said to him; honest
fellow stay, for mee thinks you make your Mule goe faster then needes. I cannot stay
Sir, said he, because these weapons that you see I carry, must be used to morrow Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
so I must needs goe on my way, Farewell: But if you will know why I carry
them, I shall lodge to night in the <hi>Vente</hi> above the Hermitage, [<hi>Ventes places in</hi> Spain,
<hi>in barren unpeopled parts for lodging, like our beggerly Alehouses upon the high-waies,</hi>]
and if you goe that way, there you shall have mee, and I will tell you wonders; and so
once more, Farewell. So the Mule pricked on so fast; that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to aske him what wonders they were; and as hee was curious, and alwaies desirous
of novelties, hee tooke order that they should presently goe and passe that night in
the <hi>Vente,</hi> without touching at the Hermitage, where the Scholer would have stayed that
night.</p>
                     <p>So all three of them mounted, went toward the <hi>Vente,</hi> whither they reached some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before it grew darke, and the Scholer invited <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to drinke a sup by the
way at the Hermitage; which as soone as <hi>Sancho</hi> heard, hee made haste with Dapple, as
did <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and the Scholer likewise: but as <hi>Sanchoes</hi> ill-luck would have it, the
Hermite was not at home, as was told them by the under-Hermit; they asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee had any of the deerer sort of wine? who answered, his Master had none; but
if they would have any cheape water, hee would give it them with a good will. If my
thirst would be quench'd with water, we might have had Wels to drinke at by the way.
Ah <hi>Camachoes</hi> marriage, and <hi>Don Diegoes</hi> plenty, how oft shall I misse you? Now
they left the Hermitage, and spurred toward the <hi>Vente,</hi> and a little before them, they
overtooke a youth that went not very fast before them; so they overtooke him: he had
a sword upon his shoulder, and upon it, as it seemed, a bundle of cloathes, as breeches
and cloake, and a shirt; for hee wore a velvet jerkin that had some kinde of remainder
of Sattin, and his shirt hung out, his stockins were of silke, and his shooes square at
toe, after the Court fashion, he was about eighteene yeeres of age, and active of body
to see to; to passe the tediousnesse of the way, he went singing short peeces of Songs,
and as they came neer him he made an end of one, which the Scholer (they say learnt by
heart) and it was this:
<q>
                           <l>To the Warres I goe for necessitie,</l>
                           <l>At home would I tarry if I had Monie.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was the first that spoke to him, saying; You goe very naked, Sir Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
And whither a Gods-name? Let's know, if it be your pleasure to tell us? To
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54746:196"/>
which the Youth answered, Heat and Poverty are the causes that I walke so light, and
my journey is to the Wars. Why for poverty (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for heat it may
well be, Sir said the Youth, I carry in this bundle a payre of slops, fellowes to this Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
if I weare um by the way, I shall doe my self no credit with them when I come to
any Town, and I have no money to buy others with, so as well for this, as to aire my
selfe, I goe till I can overtake certaine Companies of Foote, which are not above
twelve leagues from hence, where I shall get mee a place, and shall not want carriages
to travell in, till I come to our imbarking place, which they say, must bee in
<hi>Cartagina,</hi> and I had rather have the King to my Master, and serve him, then any
beggerly-Courtier. And, pray tell mee, have you any extraordinary pay, said the
Scholer.</p>
                     <p>Had I served any <hi>Grandee,</hi> or man of qualitie (said the Youth) no doubt I should;
for that comes by your serving good Masters, that out of the Scullary men come to bee
Livetenants or Captaines, or to have some good pay: but I alwaies had the ill-luck to
serve your shag-rags and up-starts, whose alowance was so bare and short, that one
halfe of it still was spent in starching me a Ruffe, and it is a miracle, that one ventring
Page amongst a hundred, should ever get any reasonable Fortune. But tell mee friend
quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> is it possible, that in all the time you served, you never got a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?
Two said the Page: but as he that goes out of a Monastery, before he professeth
hath his habit taken from him, and his clothes given him back; so my Masters returned
me mine, when they had ended their businesses, for which they came to the Court, and
returned to their own homes, and with-held their Liveries which they had only shewed
for ostentation.</p>
                     <p>A notable <hi>Espilooherio [Cullionry,]</hi> as saith your <hi>Italian</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
for all that, thinke your selfe happy that you are come from the Court, with so good
an intention, for there is nothing in the world better, nor more profitable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> then to serve
God first, and next your Prince and naturall Master, especially in the practise of Armes,
by which, if not more wealth, yet at least, more honour is obtained then by Learning:
as I have said many times; That though Learning hath raysed more Houses then Armes,
yet your Sword-men have a kinde of (I know not what) advantage above Scholers,
with a kind of splendor, that doth advantage them over all.</p>
                     <p>And beare in your minde what I shall now tell you, which shall bee much for your
good and much lighten you in your travells, that is, not to think upon adversity; for
the worst that can come is death, which if it be a good death, the best fortune of all is to
die. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> that brave Romane Emperour, being asked, Which was the best
death? answered, A suddain one, and unthought of; and though hee answered like a
Gentile, and void of the knowledge of the true God, yet hee said well to save humane
feeling a labour; for say you should bee slain in the first skirmish, either with Canon
shot, or blown up with a mine, what matter is it? All is but dying, and there's an end:
And as <hi>Terence</hi> sayes, A Souldier slain in the Field, shews better then alive and safe in
flight; and so much the more famous is a good Souldier, by how much hee obeyes his
Captains, and those that may command him; and mark childe, it is better for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
to smell of his Gun-powder then of Civet: and when old age comes upon you
in this honourable exercise, though you bee full of scars, maimed, or lame, at least you
shall not bee without honour, which poverty cannot diminish: and besides, there is
order taken now, That old and maimed Souldiers may bee relieved; neither are they
dealt withall like those mens Negars, that when they are old and can doe their Masters
no service, they (under colour of making them free) turn them out of doors and make
themslaves to hunger, from which nothing can free them but death: [<hi>Hee describes the
right subtil and cruel nature of his damned Country-men:</hi>] and for this time I will say
no more to you, but only get up behinde me till you come to the <hi>Vente,</hi> and there you
shall sup with me, and to morrow take your Journey, which God speed as your desires
deserve.</p>
                     <p>The Page accepted not of his invitement, to ride behinde him; but for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hee did: And at this season (they say) <hi>Sancho</hi> sayd to himselfe; Lord defend thee,

good things (as hee hath sayd here) should say hee hath seene such impossible foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as hee hath told us of <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave. Well, wee shall see what will become
of it. And by this they came to the <hi>Vente</hi> just as it was night, for which <hi>Sancho</hi> was

with the Lances and Halberds: [Ventero, <hi>the Master of the</hi> Vente:] who answered
him, Hee was in the stable looking to his Moyle: <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Scholler did the

tell him his tale heartily:) thus sitting downe upon a bench, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> by him,
with the Scholler, Page, and <hi>Sancho,</hi> and the <hi>Venter,</hi> for his complete Senate and
Auditory, hee began:</p>
                     <p>You shall understand, that in a towne, some foure leagues and an halfe from this
<hi>Vente,</hi> it fell out, that an Alderman there, by a trick and wile of a wench, his maid-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
(which were long to tell how) lost his Asse, and though the sayd Alderman used
all manner of diligence to finde him, it was impossible. His Asse was wanting (as
the publike voyce and fame goeth) fifteene dayes: when the Alderman that lost him,
being in the market-place, another Alderman of the same towne told him; Pay mee
for my news, Gossip, for your Asse is forth-comming. I will willingly, Gossip (said
the other) but let mee know where hee is? This morning (said the Second) I saw
him upon the mountaines without his pack-saddle, or any other furniture, so leane,
that it was pitty to see him, I would have gotten him before mee, and have driven
him to you, but hee is so mountainous and wilde, that when I made towards him, hee
flew from mee, and got into the thickest of the wood: If you please, wee will both
returne and seeke him, let mee first put up this Asse at home, and I'le come by and
by. You shall doe mee a great kindnesse (quoth hee) and I will repay you (if neede
bee) in the like kinde.</p>
                     <p>With all these circumstances, just as I tell you, all that know the truth, relate it:
In fine, the two Aldermen, afoot and hand to hand, went to the Hils, and comming
to the place where they thought to finde the Asse, they missed of him, neither could
they finde him, for all their seeking round about. Seeing then there was no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of him, the Alderman that had seene him, sayd to the other; Harke you, Gossip,
I have a trcike in my head, with which wee shall finde out this Beast, though hee bee
hidden under ground, much more if in the mountaine: Thus it is, I can bray excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54746:197"/>
well, and so can you a little: well, 'tis a match. A little, Gossip (quoth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
Verily, I'le take no ods of any body, nor of an Asse himself. We shall see then
(said the second Alderman) for my plot is, that you goe on one side of the hill, and
I on the other, so that wee may compasse it round, now and then you shall bray, and
so will I, and it cannot bee, but that your Asse will answer one of us, if hee bee in the
mountaine,</p>
                     <p>To this the owner of the Asse answered; I tell you Gossip, the device is rare, and
worthy your great wit: so dividing themselves (according to the agreement) it fell
out, that just at one instant both brayed, and each of them cozened with the others
braying, came to look one another thinking now there had been news of the Asse: and
as they met, the Loser said; Is it possible Gossip, that it was not mine Asse that bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
No, 'twas I, said the other. Then (replyed the Owner) Gossip, between you and
an Asse there is no difference touching your braying; for in my life I never heard a
thing more naturall.</p>
                     <p>These praises and extolling (said the other) doe more properly belong to you then
me; for truely you may give two to one, to the best and skillfullest Brayer in the
world; for your sound is lofty, you keep very good time, and your cadences thick and
suddain: To conclude, I yeeld my self vanquished, and give you the prize and glory
of this rare abilitie. Well (said the Owner) I shall like my self the better for this
hereafter, and shall think I know something, since I have gotten a qualitie; for
though I ever thought I brayed well, yet I never thought I was so excellent at it as
you say.</p>
                     <p>Let me tell you (said the other) there bee rare abilities in the world that are lost
and ill imployed in those that will not good themselves with them. Ours (quoth the
Owner) can doe us no good but in such businesses as wee have now in hand, and pray
God in this they may.</p>
                     <p>This said, they divided themselves again, and returned to their braying, and every
foot they were deceived and met, till they agreed upon a counter-signe, that to know
it was themselves and not the Asse, they should bray twice together: So that with this
doubling their brayes, every stitch-while they compassed the hill, the lost Asse not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
so much as by the least signe: but how could the poor and ill-thriving Beast
answer, when they found him in the Thicket eaten with Wolve? And his Owner
seeing him, said; I marvelled hee did not answer; for if hee had not been dead, hee
would have brayed, if hee had heard us, or else hee had beene no Asse: But i'faith
Gossip, since I have heard your delicate braying, I think my pains well bestowed in
looking this Asse, though I have found him dead.</p>
                     <p>'Tis in a very good hand Gossip (said the other: [En buenna mano esta. <hi>Alluding
to two that strive to make one another drink first,</hi>] And if the Abbot sing well, the little
Monk comes not behinde him: [<hi>The one as very an Asse as the other.</hi>] With this all
comfortlesse and hoarce, home they went, where they told their Friends, Neighbours,
and Acquaintances what had hapned in the search for the Asse, the one exaggerating the
others cunning in braying; all which was known and spread abroad in the neighbouring
Towns: And the Devell that alwaies watcheth how hee may sow and scatter Quarrels
and Discord every where, raising brabbles in the aire, and making great Chimeraes of
nothing, made the People of other Towns, that when they saw any of ours, they should
bray, as hitting us in the teeth with our Aldermans braying.</p>
                     <p>The Boyes at length fell to it, which was, as if it had faln into the jaws of all the
Divels in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll: so this braying spread it self from one town to the other, that they
which are borne in our Town, are as well known as the Begger knows his Dish; and
this unfortunate scoff hath proceeded so far, that many times those that were scoffed at
have gone out armed in a whole Squadron, to give Battell to the Scoffers, without
fear or wit, neither King nor Keiser being able to prevent them: I beleeve that to
morrow or next day those of my Town will bee in Field (to wit, the Brayers)
against the next Town, which is two leagues off, one of them that doth most persecute
us; and because wee might bee well provided, I have bought those Halberds and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:198"/>
Launces that you saw. And these bee the wonders that I said I would tell you of; and
if these bee not so, I know not what may.</p>
                     <p>And here the poor fellow ended his discourse; and now there entred at the door
of the <hi>Vente</hi> one in Chamois, in hose and doublet, and called aloud; Mine Host, have
you any Lodging? for here comes the Prophesying Ape, and the Motion of <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendra.</hi>
Body of me (quoth the <hi>Venter</hi>) here is Master <hi>Peter,</hi> wee shall have a brave
night of it: (I had forgot to tell how this Master <hi>Peter</hi> had his left eye and half his
cheek covered with a patch of green Taffata, a signe that all that side was sore:) So
the <hi>Venter</hi> proceeded, saying; You are welcome Master <hi>Peter;</hi> Where's the Ape and
the Motion that I see um not? They are not farre off (quoth the Chamois man) only
I am come before to know if you have any lodging.</p>
                     <p>I would make bold with the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> himselfe (sayd the <hi>Venter</hi>) rather then
Master <hi>Peter</hi> should bee disappoynted: let your Ape and your Motion come; for
wee have ghests here to night, that will pay for seeing that, and the Apes abilities. In
good time (sayd hee of the Patch) for I will moderate the price, so my charges this
night bee pay'd for; and therefore I will cause the Cart where they are, to drive on:
with this hee went out of the <hi>Vente</hi> againe. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> straight asked the <hi>Venter,</hi>
What Master <hi>Peter</hi> that was, and what Motion, or Ape those he brought?</p>
                     <p>To which the <hi>Venter</hi> answered; Hee is a famous Puppet-Master, that this long time
hath gone up and downe these parts of Aragon, shewing this motion of <hi>Melisendra,</hi>
and <hi>Don Gayferos,</hi> one of the best histories that hath been represented these many yeeres
in this Kingdome. Besides, hee hath an Ape, the strangest that ever was; for if you
aske him any thing, hee marketh what you aske, and gets up upon his Masters shoulder,
and tells him in his eare by way of answer, what hee was asked: which Master <hi>Peter</hi>
declares: hee tells things to come, as well as things past, and though hee doe not alwaies
hit upon the right, yet hee seldome erres, and makes us beleeve the Divill is in him:
Twelve pence for every answer wee give, if the Ape doe answer, I mean, if his Master
answer for him, after hee hath whispered in his eare; so it is thought that Master
<hi>Peter</hi> is very rich, hee is a notable fellow, and (as your Italian saith) a boon companion;
hath the best life in the world, talkes his share for six men, and drinks for a dozen, all
at his Tongues charge, his Motion, and his Apes.</p>
                     <p>By this, Master <hi>Peter</hi> was return'd, and his Motion and Ape came in a small car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
his Ape was of a good bignesse, without a tayle, and his bumm as bare as a Felt,
but not very ill-favoured. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> scarce beheld him, when he demanded, Master
Prophesier, What fish doe we catch? Tell us what will become of us, and here is
twelve-pence, which he commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to give Master <hi>Peter;</hi> who answered for
the Ape and said: Sir, this beast answeres not, nor gives any notice of things to come,
of things past hee knowes something, and likewise a little of things present. Zwoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
(quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I'le not give a farthing to know what is past: for who can tell
that better then my selfe? and to pay for what I know, is most foolish: but since you
say he knows things present, here's my twelve-pence, and let good-man Ape tell me
what my wife <hi>Teresa Panca</hi> doth, and in what she busies her selfe.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Peter</hi> would not take his money, saying; I will not take your reward before
hand, till the Ape hath first done his duty: So giving a clap or two with his right hand
on his left shoulder; at one frisk the Ape got up, and laying his mouth to his eare,
grated his teeth apace; and having shewed this feat the space of a Creeds saying, at
another frisk hee leap'd to the ground, and instantly Master <hi>Peter</hi> very hastily ran and
kneeled down before <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and embracing his legs, said; These legs I embrace
as if they were <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars: O famous reviver of the long forgotten Knight Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!
Oh never sufficiently extolled Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha!</hi> Raiser of the
Faint-hearted, Propper of those that Fall, the Staffe and Comfort of all the
Unfortunate! <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was amazed, <hi>Sancho</hi> confused, the Scholler in
suspence, the Page astonish'd, the Bray Towns-man all in a gaze, the <hi>Venter</hi> at
his wits end, and all admiring that heard the Puppet-mans speech, who went on,
saying:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:54746:198"/>And thou honest <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> the best Squire to the best Knight of the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
for thy Wife <hi>Teresa</hi> is a good Houswife, and at this time shee is dressing a pound
of Flax; by the same token shee hath a good broken-mouth'd pot at her left side that
holds a prettie scantling of Wine, with which shee easeth her labour.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve that very well (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) for shee is a good soul; and if shee were not
jealous, I would not change her for the Gyantesse <hi>Andandona,</hi> that as my Master sayes,
was a woman for the nonce: and my <hi>Teresa</hi> is one of those that will not pine her self,
though her heirs smart for it.</p>
                     <p>Well, I say now (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) hee that reads much and travells much, sees
much and knows much: This I say; for who in the world could have perswaded me
that Apes could Prophesie, which now I have seen with mine own eyes? for I am tho
same <hi>Don Quixote</hi> that this Beast speakes of, although hee have beene somewhat
too liberall in my praise: but howsoever I am I give God thanks that hee hath
made me so relenting and compassionate; alwaies enclined to doe good to all, and
hurt to no man.</p>
                     <p>If I had money (said the Page) I would ask Master Ape what should befall me in
the Peregrination I have in hand. To which Master <hi>Peter</hi> answered, that was now
risen from <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> foot; I have told you once that this little Beast foretells
not things to come; for if hee could, 'twere no matter for your money; for here is
Signior <hi>Don Quixote</hi> present<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for whose sake I would forgoe all the interest in the
world: and to shew my duety to him, and to give him delight, I will set up my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and freely shew all the companie in the Vent some pastime <hi>gratis.</hi> Which the
Venter hearing, unmeasurably glad, pointed him to a place where hee might set it up;
which was done in an instant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> liked not the Apes prophesying very well, holding it to bee frivolous,
that an Ape should only tell things present, or not past, or to come. So whilest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Peter</hi> was fitting his Motion, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took <hi>Sancho</hi> with him to a corner of
the Stable, and in private said:</p>
                     <p>Look thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have very well considered of this Apes strange qualitie, and finde
that this Master <hi>Peter</hi> hath made a secret expresse compact with the Divell, to infuse
this abilitie into the Ape, that hee may get his living by it, and when hee is rich, hee will
give him his soul, which is that that this universall enemie of mankinde pretends: and
that which induceth me to this belief, is, that the Ape answers not to things past, but
only present; and the Divells knowledge attains to no more; for things to come hee
knows not, only by conjecture: for God alone can distinguish the times and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and to him nothing is past, or to come; but all is present: Which being so,
it is most certain that this Ape speaks by instinct from the Divell, and I wonder hee
hath not been accused to the Inquisition, and examined, and that it hath not been pressed
out of him, to know by what virtue this Ape Prophesieth; for certainly, neither hee
nor his Ape are Astrologers, nor know how to cast Figures, which they call judiciary,
so much used in <hi>Spain:</hi> for you have no paltry Woman, nor Page, nor Cobler that
presumnes not to cast a Figure, as if it were one of the Knaves at Cards upon a Table,
falsifying that wondrous Science with their ignorant lying.</p>
                     <p>I knew a Gentlewoman that asked one of these Figure-slingers, if a little foysting-Hound
of hers should have any Puppies, and if it had, how many, and of what colour the
Whelps should bee? To which my cunning-man (after hee had cast his Figure) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That the Bitch should have young, and bring forth three little Whelps, the one
Green, the other Carnation, and the third of a mix'd colour, with this Proviso, that
shee should take the Dog between eleven and twelve of the clock at noon, or at night,
which should bee on the Monday or the Saturday; and the successe was, that some two
dayes after the Bitch dyed of a surfeit, and Master Figure-raiser was reputed in the
Town a most perfect Judiciary, as all, or the greatest part of such men are. For all
that (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) I would you would bid Master <hi>Peter</hi> ask his Ape, whether all
were true that befell you in <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave; for I think (under correction)
all was cogging and lying, or at least but a dreame. All might bee (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:54746:199"/>
yet I will doe as thou doest advise mee, though I have one scruple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they were thus communing, Master <hi>Peter</hi> came to call <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and
to tell him that the Motion was now up, if hee would please to see it, which would give
him content.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> told him his desire, and wished that his Ape might tell him, if certaine
things that befell him in <hi>Montesinoes</hi> Cave were true, or but dreames; for himselfe
was uncertaine whether. Master <hi>Peter,</hi> without answering a word, fetcht his Ape,
and putting him before <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> said; Looke you Master Ape, Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would have you tell him, whether certaine things that hapned to him
in <hi>Montesinoes</hi> Cave were true or false? And making the accustomed signe, the Ape
whipt upon his left shoulder, and seeming to speake to him in his eare, Master <hi>Peter</hi>
streight interpreted. The Ape, Signior, sayes that part of those things are false, and
part of them true, and this is all hee knowes touching this demand; and now his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is gone from him, and if you will knowe any more, you must expect till Friday
next, and then hee will answere you all you will aske, for his virtue will not returne
till then.</p>
                     <p>Law ye there (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) did not I tell you that I could not beleeve that all
you said of <hi>Montesinoes</hi> Cave could hold currant? The successe hereafter will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for time the discoverer of all things, brings every
thing to the Sunnes light, though it bee hidden in the bosom of the earth; and now let
this suffice, and let us goe see the Motion, for I beleeve we shall have some strange no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie.
Some strange one quoth Master <hi>Peter;</hi> this Motion of mine hath a thousand
strange ones: I tell you Signior, it is one of the rarest things to be seen in the world;
<hi>operibus credite &amp; non verbis,</hi> and now to work for it is late, and we have much to doe,
say and shew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> obeyed, and went where the Motion was set and opened,
all full of little wax lights, that made it most sightly and glorious. Master <hi>Peter</hi> streight
clapped himself within it, who was he that was to manage the Artificiall Puppets, and
without stood his Boy to interpret and declare the mysteries of the Motion; in his hand
he had a white wand, with which he pointed out the several shapes that came in and out.
Thus all that were in the <hi>Vente</hi> being placed, and some standing over against the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Don-Quixote, Sancho,</hi> the Scholer and the Page, placed in the best seats; the Trudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
began to speak [<hi>El Truxaman. An Interpreter amongst the Turks, but here taken

of Kettle-Drums and Trumpets, and a volly of great-shot within
the Motion, which passing away briefly, the Boy began to rayse his
voice and to say. This true History which is here represented to you,
is taken word for out of the French Chronicles, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Romants, which are in every bodies mouth, and sung by Boyes up and downe the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54746:199"/>
streets. It treats of the liberty that Signior <hi>Don Gayferos</hi> gave to <hi>Melisendra</hi> his wife,
that was imprisoned by the Moores in Spayne, in the City of <hi>Sansuena,</hi> which was then
so called, and now <hi>Saragosa;</hi> and look you there, how <hi>Don Gayseros</hi> is playing at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
according to the Song;
<q>
                           <l>Now Don Gayferos at Tables doth play,</l>
                           <l>Vnmindfull of Melisendra away.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>And that Personage that peeps out there with a Crowne on his head and a Scepter in
his hand, is the Emperor <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the supposed father of the said <hi>Melisendra,</hi> who
grieved with the sloth and neglect of his sonne in Law, comes to chide him; and marke
with what vehemency and earnestnesse he rates him, as if he meant to give him halfe a
dozen Cons with his Scepter; some Authors there be that say he did, and sound ones too:
and after he had told him many things concerning the danger of his reputation, if he did
not free his Spouse, 'twas said he told him, I have said enough, look to it. Look ye Sir, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
how the Emperor turns his back, and in what case he leaves <hi>Don Gayferos,</hi> who all
enraged, flings the Tables and the table-men from him, and hastily calls for his Armour,
and borrowes his Cosin-Germane <hi>Roldan</hi> his sword <hi>Durindana;</hi> who offers him his
company in this difficult enterprize. But the valorous enraged Knight would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it, saying; that he is sufficient to free his Spouse, though she were put in the deepe
centre of the earth, and now he goes in to Arm himself for his Journey.</p>
                     <p>Now turne your eyes to yonder Towre that appeares, for you must suppose it is one
of the Towres of the Castle of <hi>Saragosa,</hi> which is now called the <hi>Aliaferia,</hi> and that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that appeares in the window, clad in a Moorish habit, is the peerlesse <hi>Melisendra,</hi>
that many a time lookes toward <hi>France,</hi> thinking on <hi>Paris</hi> and her Spouse, the only
comfort in her imprisonment. Behold also a strange accident now that happens, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never the like seen: see you not that Moore that comes faire and softly, with his
finger in his mouth, behinde <hi>Melisendra?</hi> look what a smack he gives her in the midst
of her lippes, and how sodainly she begins to spit, and to wipe them with her white
smock-sleeves, and how she laments, and for very anguish despighteously rootes vp her
faire hayres, as if they were to blame for this wickednesse. Marke you also that grave
Moor that stands in that open Gallery, it is <hi>Marsilius</hi> King of <hi>Sansueuna,</hi> who when
he saw the Moores saw cinesse, although he were a kinsman, and a great favorite of his,
he commanded him straight to be apprehended, and to have two hundred stripes given
him, and to be carried through the chiefe streetes in the Citie, with Minstrels before, and
rods of Justice behinde; and looke ye how the Sentence is put in execution before the
fault be scarce committed; for your Moores use not (as we doe) any legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

and fall not into your crookes and your transversals; for to verifie a thing I tell you
there had neede to bee a Legall proceeding. Then Master <hi>Peter</hi> too said from

you, which is the best course; sing you your playne-Song, and meddle not
with the Treble, lest you cause the strings break. I will Master (said the Boy) and
proceeded saying:</p>

Cloake, is <hi>Don Gayferos</hi> himselfe, to whom his Wife (now revenged on the Moore

a bay-window to ride away behinde her good Spouse: but alas I unhappie creature,
one of the skirts of her Kirtle hath caught upon one of the iron barrs of the window,
and shee hovers in the aire without possibilitie of comming to the ground: but see
how pittifull Heavens relieve her in her greatest necessitie; for <hi>Don Gayferos</hi> comes,
and without any care of her rich Kirtle, layes hold of it, and forcibly brings her down
with him, and at one hoist sets her astride upon his horses crupper, and commands her
to sit fast, and clap her armes about him, that shee fall not; for <hi>Melisendra</hi> was not
used to that kinde of riding, Look you how the Horse by his neighing shews that hee
is proud with the burden of his valiant Master and fair Mistris: Look how they turn
their backs to the Citie and merrily take their way toward <hi>Paris.</hi> Peace bee with

Friends and Kindred see you enjoy the rest of your yeers (as many as <hi>Nestors</hi>)
peaceably.</p>
                     <p>Here Master <hi>Peter</hi> cryed out aloud again, saying; Plainnesse, good Boy, doe not
you soare so high, this affectation is scurvy. The Interpeter answered nothing, but went
on, saying, There wanted not some idle spectators that pry into every thing, who saw
the going down of <hi>Melisendra,</hi> and gave <hi>Marsilius</hi> notice of it, who straight command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to sound an Alarm; and now behold how fast the Citie even sinks again with the
noyse of Bels that sound in the high, Towres of the <hi>Mesquits:</hi> [Mesquitas, <hi>Moorish
Churches.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>There you are out Boy (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and Master <hi>Peter</hi> is very improper in
his Bells; for amongst Moores you have no Bells, but Kettle-drums, and a kinde of
Shaulmes that bee like our Waits; so that your sounding of Bells in <hi>Sansuenna</hi> is a
most idle fopperie. Stand not upon trifles Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (said Master <hi>Peter</hi>)
and so strictly upon every thing, for we shall not know how to please you: Have you not
a thousand Comedies ordinarily represented; as full of incongruities and absurdities,
and yet they runne their Career happily, and are heard not only with applause, but
great admiration also? On boy say on, &amp; so I fill my purse, let there be as many impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
as moats in the Sunne. You are in the right (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and the
Boy proceeded.</p>
                     <p>Look what a companie of gallant Knights goe out of the Citie in pursuit of the
Cotholike Lovers, how many Trumpets sound, how many Shaulmes play, how many
Drummes and Kettles make a noyse; I fear me they will over-take them, and
bring them back both bound to the same Horses tayle; which would bee a horrible
spectacle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Quixote</hi> seeing and hearing such a deale of Moorisme and such a coyle, hee
thought fit to succour those that fled: So standing up, with a loud voyce hee cryed
out; I will never consent while I live, that in my presence such an outrage as this bee
offered to so valiant, and to so amorous a bold Knight as <hi>Don Gayferos:</hi> Stay, you base
Scoundrels, doe not yee follow or persecute him; if you doe, you must first wage
warre with me: So doing and speaking, hee unsheathed his Sword, and at one frisk
hee got to the Motion, and with an unseen and posting furie, hee began to rain strokes
upon the Puppetish Moorisme, overthrowing some, and behading others, maiming
this, and cutting in pieces that; and amongst many other blows, he fetched one so down
right, that had not Master <hi>Peter</hi> tumbled and squatted down, hee had clipped his
Mazard as easily as if it had been made of March-pane. Master <hi>Peter</hi> cryed out, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Hold Signior <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> hold; and know that these you hurl down, destroy,
and kill, are not reall Moors, but shapes made of Paste-board: Look you, look yee
now (wretch that I am) hee spoyles all and undoes me. But for all this, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
still multiplyed his flashes, doubling and redoubling his blows as thick as
hops.</p>
                     <p>And in a word, in lesse then two <hi>Credo's,</hi> hee cast down the whole Motion (all the
tackling first cut to fitters, and all the Puppets) King <hi>Marsilius</hi> was sore wounded, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54746:200"/>
the Emperour <hi>Charlemaine</hi> his head and crown were parted in two places: The Senate
and Auditors were all in a hurry; And the Ape gat up to the top of the house, and so
out at the window: The Scholler was frighted: The Page clean dastarded: And even
<hi>Sancho</hi> himself was in a terrible perplexity; for (as hee sware after the Storm was past)
hee never saw his Master so outragious.</p>
                     <p>The generall ruine of the Motion thus performed, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> began to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pacified, and said; Now would I have all those here at this instant before me,
that beleeve not how profitable Knights Errant are to the world; and had not I been
now present, what (I marvell) would have become of Signior <hi>Don Gayferos</hi> and the
fair <hi>Melisendra?</hi> I warrant e're this, those Doggs would have overtaken and shewed
them some foul play: when all is done, long live Knight Errantry above all things
living in the world.</p>
                     <p>Long live it on Gods name (said Master <hi>Peter</hi>) again with a pittifull voyce; and
may I die, since I live to bee so unhappie, as to say with King <hi>Don Roarigo.</hi> Yesterday
I was Lord of all <hi>Spain,</hi> but to day have not a Battlement I can call mine: [Don Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo
<hi>was the last King of the Goths that raigned in</hi> Spain, <hi>conquered by the Moors:</hi>]
'Tis not yet half an houre, scarce half a minute, that I was Master of Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours;
had my Stables, Coffers, and Bags full of Horses and Treasure; but now I
am desolate, dejected and poor: and to add more affliction, without my Ape, that
before I can catch him again, I am like to sweat for it, and all through the unconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
furies of this Sir Knight, who is said to protect the Fatherlesse, to rectifie Wrongs,
and to doe other Charitable works; but to me only this his generous intention hath
been defective, I thank God for it: In fine, it could bee none but <hi>The Knight of the
sorrowfull Countenance</hi> that discountenanced mee and mine. <hi>Sancho</hi> grew compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
to hear Master <hi>Peters</hi> lamentation, and said; Weep not, nor grieve Master <hi>Peter,</hi>
for thou breakest my heart; and let me tell thee, that my Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is so
scrupulous and Catholike a Christian, that if hee fall into the reekoning, that hee have
done thee any wrong, hee knows how, and will satisfie it with much advantage. If (said
Master <hi>Peter</hi>) Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would but pay me for some part of the Pieces that
hee hath spoyled, I should be contented, and his Worship might not be troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
for he that keeps that that is another mans, against the Owners will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
it not, can hardly bee saved.</p>
                     <p>That's true (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) But hitherto, Master <hi>Peter,</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have detained ought of yours. No? not, said Master <hi>Peter?</hi> why these poor
relikes that lie upon the hard and barren earth, who scattered and annihilated them
but the invincible force of that powerfull arme? And whose were those bodies, but
mine? And with whom did I maintain my self, but with them? Well, I now (said
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) verily beleeve what I have done often, that the Enchanters that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
me, doe nothing but put shapes really as they are before mine eyes, and by and by
truck and change them at their pleasure. Verily my Masters, you that heare me, I tell
you, all that here passed seemed to me to bee really so, and immediately that that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisendra</hi>

and <hi>Charlemain, Charlemain:</hi> And this was it that stirred up my choller; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
my Profession of Knight Errant; my meaning was to succour those that fled:
and to this good purpose I did all that you have seen; which if it fell out unluckily, 'twas
no fault of mine, but of my wicked persecutors: yet for all this errour (though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from no malice of mine) I my self will condemne my self in the charge; let
Master <hi>Peter</hi> see what hee will have for the spoyled Pieces, and I will pay it all in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
currant coyne of <hi>Castile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Peter</hi> made him a low leg, saying; I could expect no lesse from the unheard
of Christianity of the most valorous <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the true Succourer
and Bulwark of all those that bee in need and necessitie, or wandring Vagamunds; and
now let the <hi>Venter</hi> and the Grand <hi>Sancho</hi> bee Arbitrators, and Price-setters between
your Worship and me, and let them say what every torne Piece was worth. The <hi>Venter</hi>
and <hi>Sancho</hi> both agreed: And by and by Master <hi>Peter</hi> reached up <hi>Marsilius</hi> King of
<pb facs="tcp:54746:201"/>
                        <hi>Saragosa</hi> headlesse, and said; You see how impossible it is for this Prince to returne
to his first being, and therefore, saving your better judgements, I think fit to have for
him two shillings and three-pence.</p>
                     <p>On then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Then for this (quoth Master <hi>Peter</hi>) that is parted
from head to foote, taking the Emperour <hi>Charlemain</hi> up, I thinke two shillings seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
half-penny is little enough, Not very little quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Nor much said the
<hi>Venter;</hi> but moderate the bargaine, and let him have halfe a crowne. Let him have his
full asking (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for, for such a mishap as this, wee'l nere stand upon
three half-pence more or lesse, &amp; make an end quickly Master <hi>Peter;</hi> for it is neer supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and I have certain suspicions that I shall eat. For this Puppet said M. <hi>Peter,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a nose, and an eye wanting, of the fair <hi>Melisendra,</hi> I aske but in Justice fourteene
pence half-penny.</p>
                     <p>Nay, the Devil's in it (sayd <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) if <hi>Melisendra</hi> bee not now in <hi>France,</hi>
or upon the borders, at least, with her Husband; for the horse they rode on, to my
seeming, rather flew then ran; and therefore sell not mee a Cat for a Coney, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
mee here <hi>Melisendra</hi> nose lesse, when shee (if the time require it) is wantonly
solacing with her Husband in <hi>France:</hi> God give each man his owne, Master <hi>Peter,</hi> let
us have plaine dealing; and so proceed. Master <hi>Peter,</hi> that saw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in a
wrong vaine, and that hee returned to his olde Theame thought yet hee should not
escape him, and so replied; Indeede this should not bee <hi>Melisendra,</hi> now I think
on't; but some one of the Damzels that served her, so that five pence for her will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
mee.</p>
                     <p>Thus hee went on prizing of other torne Puppets, which the Arbitrating Judges
moderated to the satisfaction of both parties, and the whole prices of all were, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
one shillings and eleven pence, which when <hi>Sancho</hi> had disbursed, Master <hi>Peter</hi>
demanded over and above twelve-pence for his labour, to looke the Ape. Give it
him <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) not to catch his Ape, but a Monkey; [<hi>As w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certainly tell mee, that the Lady <hi>Melisendra</hi> and <hi>Don Gayferos</hi> were safely arrived in
<hi>France,</hi> amongst their owne people.</p>
                     <p>None can better tell then my Ape (said Master <hi>Peter</hi>) though the Devill himselfe
will scarce catch him; yet I imagine, making much of him, and hunger, will force
him to seeke mee to night, and by morning wee shall come together. Well, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;
the storme of the Motion passed, and all supped merrily, and like good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> charge; who was liberall in extremity. Before day, the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with the Lances and Halberds was gone, and some-what after, the Scholler and
the Page came to take leave of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the one to returne homeward, and
the other to prosecute his intended voyage, and for a releefe <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> gave him
six shillings.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Peter</hi> would have no more to doe with him; for hee knew him too well.
So hee got up before the Sunne, and gathering the relikes of the Motion together,
and his Ape, hee betooke him to his Adventures. The <hi>Venter</hi> that knew not <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
wondred as much at his liberality, as his madnesse. To conclude, <hi>Sancho</hi>
payed him honestly, by his Masters order, and taking leave, about eight of the clocke
they left the <hi>Vente,</hi> and went on their way, where wee must leave them; for so it is
fit, that wee may come to other matters pertaining to the true declaration of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ID Hamete,</hi> the Chronicler of this famous History, beginnes this
Chapter with these words: I sweare like a Catholike Christian.
To which the Translatour sayes, That <hi>Cid</hi> his swearing like a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Christian hee being a Moore, as undoubtedly hee was, was
no other wise to bee understood, then that as the Catholike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
when hee sweares, doth or ought to sweare truth, so did hee,
as if hee had sworne like a Catholike Christian, in what hee meant
to write of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> especially in recounting who Master <hi>Peter</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying
Ape were; that made all the Countrey astonisht at his fore-telling things.
Hee sayes then, that hee who hath read the former part of this History, will have well
remembred that same <hi>Gines de Passamonte,</hi> whom <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> amongst other Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-slaves,
freed in <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi> a benefit for which afterward hee had small thankes,
and worse payment, from that wicked and ungratefull Rowr.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Gines de Passamonte,</hi> whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> called <hi>Ginesillo de Parapilla,</hi> was hee
that stole <hi>Sancho's</hi> Dapple; which, because neither the manner nor the time were put
in the first part, made many attribute the fault of the Impression, to the Authours
weakenesse of memory. But true it is, that <hi>Gines</hi> stole him, as <hi>Sancho</hi> slept upon his
backe, using the same tricke and device of <hi>Brunelo's,</hi> when as <hi>Sacripante</hi> being upon
the siege of <hi>Albraca,</hi> hee stole his horse from under his legs; and after <hi>Sancho</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him again, as was shewed.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Gines,</hi> fearefull of being found by the Justices that sought after him, to punish
him for his infinite villanies and faults, that were so many and so great, that himselfe
made a great volume of them, determined to get him into the Kingdome of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
and so covering his left eye, to apply himself to the office of a Puppet man; for this
and juggling hee was excellent at. It fell out so, that hee bought his Ape of certain
captive Christians that came out of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> whom he had instructed, that upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a certain signe, he should leap upon his shoulder, and should mumble, or seeme to
doe so, at least somthing in his eare.</p>
                     <p>This done, before he would enter into any town with his Motion or Ape, he infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
himself in the neerest town, or where he best could, what particulars had hapned in
such a place, or to such Persons, and bearing all well in mind, the first thing he did, was
to shew his Motion, which was sometimes of one story, otherwhiles of another; but all
merry, delightfull and familiarly known.</p>
                     <p>The sight being finished, hee propounded the rarities of his Ape, telling the People
that hee could declare unto them, all things past and present; but in things to come,
hee had no skill: For an Answere to each Question hee demanded a shilling; but
to some hee did it cheaper, according as hee perceived the Demanders in case to pay
him; and sometimes hee came to such places as hee knew what had happened to the
Inhabitants, who although they would demand nothing, because they would not pay
him; yet hee would still make signes to the Ape, and tell them the Beast had told him
this or that, which fell out just by what he had before heard, and with this he got an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
name, and all men slocked about him, and at other times (as he was very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
he would reply so, that the answer fell out very fit to the questions: and since no
body went about to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> or to presse him, how his Ape did Prophesse, hee gulled every
one and filled his Pouch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:202"/>As soone as ever hee came into the <hi>Vente,</hi> hee knew <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> and
all that were there; but it had cost him deere, if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had let his hand fall
somewhat lower, when he cut off King <hi>Marsilius</hi> his head, and destroyed all his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
as was related in the antecedent Chapter. And this is all that may be said of Mr.
<hi>Peter</hi> and his Ape.</p>
                     <p>And returning to <hi>Don Quixote de la Manca,</hi> I say, that after he was gone out of the
<hi>Vente,</hi> he determined first of all to see the bankes of the river <hi>Heber,</hi> and all round about,
before he went to the City of <hi>Saragosa,</hi> since between that &amp; the Justs there, he had time
enough for all. Hereupon he went on his way, which he passed two dayes without light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on any thing worth writing, till the third day, going up a ridg-way, he heard a sound
of Drums, Trumpets and Guns; at first he thought some Regiment of Souldiers passed
by that way: so, to see them, he spurred <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and got up the Ridg, and when he
was at the top, he saw (as he guessed) at the foot of it, neer upon two hundred men,
armed with different sorts of Arms, to wit, Speers, Cros-bows, Partizans, Halberds
and Pikes, and some Guns, and many Targets. He came down from the high-ground,
and drew neer to the Squadron, insomuch that he might distinctly perceive their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
judged of their colours, and noted their <hi>Impreses,</hi> and especially one, which was
on a Standard or shred of white Satten, where was lively painted a little Asse, like one
of your <hi>Sardinian</hi> Asses, his head lifted up, his mouth open, and his tongue out, in act
and posture just as he were Braying, about him were these two verses written in faire
Letters:
<q>
                           <l>'Twas not for nought that day.</l>
                           <l>The one and th'other Iudge did Bray.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this device <hi>Don Quixote</hi> collected that those People belonged to the Braying
Town, and so hee told <hi>Sancho,</hi> declaring likewise what was written in the Standard;
hee told him also, that hee that told them the Story was in the wrong, to say they were
two Aldermen that Brayed; for by the Verses of the Standard, they were two Judges.
To which <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, Sir, that breakes no square; for it may very well be, that
the Aldermen that then brayed, might come in time to bee Judges of the Town; so
they may have been called by both Titles. Howsoever, 'tis not materiall to the truth
of the Story, whether the Brayers were Aldermen or Judges, one for another,
bee they who they would, and a Judge is even as likely to Bray as an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, they perceived and knew that the Town that was mocked, went out to
skirmish with another that had too much abused them, and more then was fitting for
good neighbours. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went towards them, to <hi>Sancho's</hi> no small grief, who
was no friend to those Enterprizes. Those of the Squadron hemmed him in, taking
him to be some one of their side. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> lifting up his Visor, with a pleasant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and courage, came toward the Standard of the Asse, and there all the chiefest
of the Army gathered about him to behold him, falling into the same admiration as all
else did the first time they had seen him, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> that saw them atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
look on him, and no man offering to speake to him, or ask him ought,
taking hold on their silence, and breaking his own, hee raised his voyce and
said:</p>
                     <p>Honest friends, I desire you with all earnestnesse, that you interrupt not the discourse
that I shall make to you, till you shall see that I either distaste or weary you; which if
it bee so, at the least signe you shall make, I will seal up my looks and clap a gag on my
tongue. All of them bade him speak what hee would; for they would heare him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> having this licence, went on, saying; I, my friends, am a Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
whose Exercise is Armes, whose Profession to favour those that need favour,
and to help the distressed. I have long known of your misfortune, and the cause that
every while moves you to take Armes to bee revenged on your Enemies. And having
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54746:202"/>
not once, but many times pondered your businesse in my understanding, I finde (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of Duell) that you are deceived to think your selves affronted;
for no particular person can affront a whole Town, except it bee for defying them for
Traitors in generall, because hee knows not who in particular committed the Treason,
for which hee defied all the Town.</p>
                     <p>Wee have an example of this in <hi>Don Diego Ordonnez de Lara,</hi> who defied the whole
Towne of <hi>Zamora,</hi> because hee was ignorant, that only <hi>Velido de Olfos</hi> committed the
treason in killing his King; so hee defied them all, and the revenge and answer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
them all: though howsoever <hi>Don Diego</hi> was somewhat too hasty and too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
for it was needlesse for him to have defied the Dead, or the Waters, or the
Corne, or the Children unborn, with many other trifles there mentioned: but let it
goe, for when choller over-flows, the tongue hath neither Father, Governour, or Guide
that may correct it. This being so then, that one particular person cannot affront a
Kingdome, Province, Citie, Common-wealth, or Town only, it is manifest, that the
revenge of defiance for such as affront is needlesse, since it is none; for it were a goodly
matter sure that those of the Town of <hi>Reloxa</hi> should every foot go out to kill those that
abuse them so: Or that your <hi>Cazoteros, Verengeneros, Vallenatos, Xanoneros [Severall nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
given to Towns in</hi> Spain, <hi>upon long tradition, and too tedious to bee put in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,]</hi>
or others of these kindes of nick-names that are common in every Boyes mouth,
and the ordinary sort of People: 'twere very good I say, that all these famous Towns
should bee ashamed, and take revenge, and runne with their Swords continually drawn
like Sack buts, for every slender Quarrell. No, no, God forbid: Men of wisedome
and well governed Common-wealths ought to take Armes for four things, and so to
endanger their Persons lives and estates: First, To defend the Catholike Faith: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Their Lives; which is according to Divine and Naturall Law: Thirdly, To
defend their Honour, Family, aud Estates: Fourthly, To serve their Prince in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
warre; And if wee will, we may add a fift (that may serve for a second) To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Country. To these five capitall causes, may bee joyned many others, just
and reasonable, that may oblige men to take Armes: But to take them for trifles, and
things that are rather fit for laughter and pastime then for any affront, it seems that hee
who takes them wants his judgement. Besides, to take an unjust revenge (indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can bee just by way of revenge) is directly against Gods Law which wee professe,
in which wee are commanded to doe well to our enemies, and good to those that hate
us; a Commandement that though it seem difficult to fulfill, yet it is not only to those
that know lesse of God then the world, and more of the slesh then the Spirit; for
Jesus Christ, true God and man, who never lyed, neither could, nor can, being our
Law-giver, said, That his Yoak was sweet and his Burden light; so hee would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us nothing that should bee unpossible for us to fulfill: So that, my Masters, you
are tyed both by Laws Divine and humane to bee pacified.</p>
                     <p>The Devill take me (thought <hi>Sancho</hi> to himself at this instant) if this Master of mine
bee not a Divine; or if not not, as like one as one egge is to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took breath a while, and seeing them still attentive, had proceeded in
his discourse, but that <hi>Sancho's</hi> conceitednesse came betwixt him and home, who seeing
his Master pause, took his turne, saying:</p>
                     <p>My Master <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> sometimes called <hi>The Knight of the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
Countenance,</hi> and now <hi>The Knight of the Lyons,</hi> is a very judicious Gentleman,
speaks Latin and his mother tongue as well as a Bachelour of Arts, and in all hee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
or adviseth, proceeds like a man of Armes, and hath all the Laws and Statutes of
that you call <hi>Duell, ad unguem:</hi> therefore there is no more to bee done, but to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
your selves according to his direction, and let me bear the blame if you doe amisse.
Besides, as you are now told 'tis a folly to bee ashamed to heare one Bray; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when I was a Boy, I could have brayed at any time I listed, without any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hinderance, which I did so truely and cunningly, that when I Brayed, all the Asses
in the Town would answer me; and for all this I was held to bee the sonne of honest
Parents, and though for this rare qualitie I was envied by more then foure of the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb facs="tcp:54746:203"/>
of my Parish, I cared not two straws; and that you may know I say true, doe but
stay and hearken; for this Science is like swimming, once known never forgotten: so
clapping his hand to his nose hee began to Bray so strongly that the Vallies neer-hand
resounded again. But one of them that stood neerest him, thinking hee had flouted them,
lifted up a good Bat he had in his hand, and gave him such a blow, that hee tumbled him
to the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that saw <hi>Sancho</hi> so evill intreated, set upon him that did it, with his
Lance in his hand; but so many come betwixt, that it was not possible for him to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged:
rather seeing a cloud of stones comming towards himselfe, and that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
bent Crosse-bowes beganne to threaten him, and no lesse quantitie of Gunnes;
turning <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Reines, as fast as hee could gallop hee got from among them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
himselfe heartily to God, to free him from that danger, and fearing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
foote, lest some Bullet should enter him behinde, and come out at his breast:
so hee still went fetching his breath, to see if it failed him. But they of the Squadron
were satisfied when they saw him flie, and so shot not at him. <hi>Sancho</hi> they set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Asse (scarce yet come to himselfe) and let him goe after his Master, not that
he could tell how to guide him; but <hi>Dapple</hi> followed <hi>Rozinantes</hi> steps, without whom
he was no body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> being now a pretty way off, looked backe, and saw that <hi>Sancho</hi>
was comming, and marked that no body followed him. Those of the Squadron
were there till darke night, and because their Enemies came not to Battell with them,
they returned home to their Towne, full of myrth and jollitie: And if they had
knowne the ancient custome of the Grecians, they would have raised a Trophie in
that place.</p>

and it is the part of wise men to reserve themselves to better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions:
This truth was verified in <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who giving way
to the furie of the people, and to the ill intentions of that angry
Squadron, took his heels, and without remembring <hi>Sancho,</hi> or the
danger he left him in, got himself so farr as he might seem to be safe.
<hi>Sancho</hi> followed laid a-thwart upon his Asse, as hath been said: At
last hee over-took him, being now come to himself; and comming neer, hee fell off his
Dapple at <hi>Rozinantes</hi> feet, all sorrowfull bruised and beaten.. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> alighted to
search his wounds; but finding him whole from top to toe, very angrily hee said, You
must Bray with a plague to you; and where have you found that 'tis good naming the
halter in the hanged mans house? To your Bray musick what counterpoint could you
expect but Bat-blows? And <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may give God thanks, that since they bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
you with a cudgell, they had not made the <hi>per signum crucis</hi> on you with a Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter.</p>
                     <p>I know not what to answer (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for me thinks I speak at my back; pray
let's bee gone from hence, and I'le no more braying; yet I cannot but say, that your
Knights Errant can flye and leave their faithfull Squires to be bruised like Privet by
their enemies.</p>
                     <p>To retire is not to flye (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that Valour that is
not founded upon the Bassis of Wisdome, is stiled Temerity, and the rash mans actions
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54746:203"/>
are rather attributed to good fortune then courage. So that I confesse I retired, but fled
not, and in this have imitated many valiant men, that have reserved themselves for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p>By this time <hi>Sancho,</hi> with <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> helpe, got to horse, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
mounted <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and by little and little, they had gotten into a little Elme-grove,

and dolorous sighes. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanding the reason of his pittifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
he said, that from the point of his back-bone, to the top of his crowne, he was
so sore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> hee knew not what to doe. The cause of that paine undoubtedly (quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) is, that as the cudgell with which they banged thee was long and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it lighted upon those parts of thy back all along that grieve thee; and if it had been
thicker, it had grieved thee more. Truly (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) you have resolved mee of
a great doubt, and in most delicate termes declared it to mee. Body of mee, was the
cause of my griefe so concealed that you must needes tell mee that all of mee was sore
where the cudgell lighted? If my ankles did paine mee, I warrant you would riddle the
cause of it; but 'tis poore ridling to tell that my bruising grieves mee. Yfaith, yfaith,
Master mine, other mens ills are sleightly regarded, and every day I discover Land, and
see how little I can expect from your service; for if at this time you suffered mee to
bee dry beaten, wee shall come a hundred and a hundred times to the Blanket-tossing
you wot of, and other childish tricks, which if they now lighted on my shoulders,
they will after come out at mine eyes. It were a great deale better for mee, but that I
am a beast, and shall never doe ought well while I live. It were a great deale better
(I say againe) for mee to get mee home to my Wife and Children, to maintaine and
bring them up with that little God hath given mee, and not to follow you up and down
these hy-waies, drinking ill, and eating worse. And for your Bed, good honest
Squire, even count mee out seven foote of good earth; and if you will have any more,
take as many more; for you may feede at pleasure, stretch your selfe at your case, I
would the first that made stitch in Knight Errantry were burned, or beaten to powder,
or at least hee that first would bee Squire to such fooles, as all your Knights-Errant in
former times have been, of the present I say nothing; for your selfe being one, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
them, and because I know that you know an Ace more then the Devill in all
you speak or think.</p>
                     <p>I durst venter a good wager with thee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>) that now
thou talkest and no body controules thee, thou feelest no paine in all thy Body:
Talke on, childe mine, all that is in thy minde, or comes to thy Mouth, for so thou
beest not grieved, I will bee pleased with the distaste that thy impertinencies might
give mee. And if you desire so much to bee at home with your Wife and Children,
God forbid I should gain say it: you have money of mine, and see how long 'tis since
our third sally from home, and how much is due to you for every Moneth, and pay
your selfe.</p>
                     <p>When I served (quoth <hi>Sancho): Tome Carrasco,</hi> Father to the Bachelor <hi>Carrasco,</hi>
whom you know well, I had two Ducats a moneth besides my victualls: of you I know
not how much I shall have, though I am sure it is a greater toyle to bee a Squire to
a Knight Errant, then to serve a rich Husbandman; for indeed, wee that serve Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
though wee labour never so much in the day time, if the worst come to the
worst, at night wee sup with the Pottage-pot, and lye in a bed, which I have not done
ever since I served you, except it were that short time wee were at <hi>Don Diego de
Miranda's</hi> house, and after when I had the cheere of the skimmings of <hi>Camacho</hi>'s pots,
and when I ate and drunke and slept at <hi>Basilius</hi> his house; all the rest hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the cold ground, to the open ayre, and subject, as you would say, to the inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Heavens, onely living upon bits of cheese, and scraps of bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water, sometimes of brookes, sometimes of Springs, which wee met withall by the
waies wee went.</p>
                     <p>I confesse, <hi>Sancho,</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that all thou sayest may bee true;
<pb facs="tcp:54746:204"/>
how much more thinkest thou should I give thee then <hi>Tomè Carrasco?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You shall please me (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) with twelve pence more a moneth, and that
concerning my wages for my service: but touching your word and promise you gave
me, That I should have the Government of an Island, it were fit you added the t'other
three shillings, which in all make up fifteen.</p>
                     <p>It is very well (said <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) and according to the wages that you have allotted
unto your self, it is now twenty five dayes since our last sallie; reckon <hi>Sancho,</hi> so much
for so much, and see how much is due to you, and pay your self, as I have bidden
you.</p>
                     <p>Body of mee (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) you are clean out of the reckoning; for to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>hing the
promise of governing the Island, you must reckon from the time you promised, till this
present. Why, how long is it (quoth hee) since I promised it? If I bee not forgetfull
(said <hi>Sancho</hi>) it is now some twenty yeers wanting two or three dayes. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
gave himself a good clap on the fore-head, and began to laugh heartily, saying; Why,
my being about <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi> and our whole travells were in lesse then two
moneths, and doest thou say it was twenty yeers since I promised thee the Island? I am
now of opinion, that thou wouldest have all the money thou hast of mine consumed in
paying thee wages: which if it bee so, and that thou art so minded, from hence forward
take it, much good may it doe thee; for so I may not bee troubled with such a Squire,
I shall bee glad to bee poor, and without a farthing. But tell me thou Prevaricator of
the Squirely Laws of Knight Errantry; where hast thou ever seen or read of any Squire
belonging to Knight Errant, that hath capitulated with his Master to give him thus
much or so much: Lanch, lanch, thou base lewd fellow, thou Hobgoblin; Lanch, I say,
into the <hi>Mare magnum</hi> of their Histories; and if thou finde that any Squire have said,
or so much as imagined what thou hast said, I will give thee leave to brand my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
and to boot, to seal me with four tucks in the mouth: [<hi>A trick to give a tuck
with the thumbe upon ones lips, as fresh men are used in a Vniversitie:</hi>] Turne thy reins
or thine Asses halter, and get thee to thine house; for thou shalt not goe a step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with me. Oh ill given bread, and ill placed promises! Oh man, more beast then
man! now when I thought to have put thee into a fortune, and such a one, that, in
spight of thy wife, thou shouldest have been stiled <hi>My Lord:</hi> Thou leavest me: now
doest thou goe, when I had a purpose to have made thee Lord of the best Island in the
world. Well, well, as thou thy self hast said many times, The hony is not for the
Asses mouth; An Asse thou art, an Asse thou wilt bee, and an Asse thou shalt die, and
till then wilt thou remain so, before thou fallest into the reckoning that thou art a
Beast.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld <hi>Don Quixote</hi> earnestly all the while hee thus rated him, and was so
moved that the teares stood in his eyes, and with a dolorous low voyce hee said; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
mine, I confesse, that to be altogether an Asse, I want nothing but a taile; if you
will put one on me, I will bee contented, and will serve you like an Asse all dayes of my
life. Pardon me Sir, and pittie my youth, and consider my folly; for if I speak much,
it proceeds rather out of simplicity then knavery: <hi>Who erres and mends, to God himself
commends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would bee sorry, little <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but that thou shouldest min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
some by-pretty Proverb in thy Dialogue. Well, I'le pardon thee for this once,
upon condition hereafter thou mend; and shew not thy self so covetous, but that thou
rouze up thy Spirits, and encourage thy self with hope of the accomplishment of my
promise; for better late then not at all. <hi>Sancho</hi> answered him, hee would, though it
were to make a virtue of necessity.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon they put into the Elme-Grove, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> got to the foot of an
Elme, and <hi>Sancho</hi> to the foot of a Beech; for these kinde of Trees and such like have
alwaies feet, but no hands. <hi>Sancho</hi> had an ill night on it; for his Bat blow made him
more sensible in the cold. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> fell into his usuall imaginations; yet they
both slept, and by day-peep they were on their way, searching after the famous banks of
<hi>Heber,</hi> where they hapned upon what shall bee told in the ensuing Chapter.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ON Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> by their computation, two dayes after they
were out of the Elme Grove, came to the River <hi>Heber,</hi> whose sight
was very delightsome to <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for first hee contemplated
on the amenitie of those banks, the cleernesse of the water, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
current and the abundancy of the liquid Cristall, whose pleasing
sight brought a thousand amorous thoughts into his head, especially
hee fell to think what hee had seen in <hi>Montesinos's</hi> Cave: for
though Master <hi>Peters</hi> Ape had told him, that part of it was true, and part false, hee
leaned more to the truth then to the other; contrarie to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who held all as false
as Falshood it self.</p>
                     <p>As they were thus going on, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might see a little Boat without Oares or
any other kinde of Tackling, which was tyed by the brink of the River to a Trees stump
on the bank. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> looked round about him, but could see no bodie; so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more adoe, hee alighted from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to doe the like
from Dapple, and that hee should tye both the Beast very well to the root of an Elme
or Willow there. <hi>Sancho</hi> demanded of him the cause of that suddain lighting, and of
that tying. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made answer; Know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that this Boat thou seest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
(for it can bee nothing else) calls and invites me to goe and enter into it, to give
ayde to some Knight, or other personage of rank and note that is in distresse: for this
is the stile of Books of Knighthood, and of Enchanters that are there intermingled,
that when any Knight is in some danger, that hee cannot bee freed from it, but by the
hand of some other Knight, although the one bee distant from the other two or three
thousand leagues or more, they either snatch him into a cloud, or provide him a Boat
to enter in, and in the twinkling of an eye, either carry him thorow the aire, or thorow
the Sea, as they list, and where his assistance is needfull: So that <hi>Sancho,</hi> this Boat is
put here to the same effect; and this is as cleer as day, and before wee goe, tye Dapple
and <hi>Rozinante</hi> together, and let's on in Gods name; for I will not fail to imbarque my
self though bare-foot Friers should intreat me.</p>
                     <p>Well, seeing 'tis so (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and that you will every foot run into these (I know
not what I shall call them) fopperies, there's no way but to obey and lay down the
neck; according to the Proverb, Doe as thy Master commands thee, and sit down at
Table with him: But for all that, for discharge of my conscience, let me tell you,
that (me thinks) that is no Enchanted Boat, but one that belongs to some Fisher-men
of the River; for here the best <hi>Saboga's</hi> in the world are taken.</p>
                     <p>This hee spoke whilest hee was tying his Beasts, leaving them to the protection and
defence of Enchanters, which grived him to the soul. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> bade him hee should
not bee troubled for the leaving those Beasts; for hee that should carry them thorow
such longinque wayes and regions, would also look to the other. I understand not
your Lognick (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) neither have I heard such a word in all the dayes of my
life. Longinque (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that is, farre, remote: and no marvell thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandest
not that word; for thou art nor bound to the understanding of Latin, though
yee have some that presume to know when they are ignorant. Now they are bound
(said <hi>Sancho</hi>) what shall wee doe next?</p>
                     <p>What? (said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) blesse our selves and weight anchor, I mean, let us
imbarque our selves, and cut the rope by which this Boat is tyed: So leaping into it,
and <hi>Sancho</hi> following him, hee cut the cord, and the Boat fair and softly fell off from
the Bank; and when <hi>Sancho</hi> saw himself about a two rods length within the River, hee
began to tremble, fearing his perdition: but nothing so much troubled him as to hear
<pb facs="tcp:54746:205"/>
Dapple-bray, and to see that <hi>Rozinante</hi> strugled to unloose himselfe; and hee told
his Master; Dapple brayes and condoles for our absence, <hi>Rozinante</hi> strives to bee at
Libertie to throwe himselfe after us. Oh most deere friends, remayne you there in
safetie, and may the madnesse that severs us from you, converted into Repentance,
bring us back to your Presence: And with that hee beganne to weepe so bitterly, that
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> all moody and cholerick, beganne to cry out; What makes thee feare,
thou cowardly Impe? What cryest thou for, thou heart of Curds? Who persecutes
thee? Who baites thee thou soule of a Milk-sop? Or what wantest thou in the midst
of all abundance? Art thou happily to goe bare-foot over the <hi>Riphaean</hi> Mountaines?

to goe to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> one of the greatest signes they have, to know whether they
have passed the <hi>aequinoctial,</hi> is, that all men that are in the Ship, their Lice die upon them,
and not one remaines with them, not in the Vessel, though they would give their weight
in gold for him: so that <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou maist put thy hand to thy thigh, and if thou meet
with any live thing, we shall be out of doubt; if thou findest nothing, then wee have
passed the Line.</p>
                     <p>I cannot beleeve any of this quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but yet I will doe what you will have mee,
though I know no necessity for these trials, since I see with these eyes that we have not
gone five rods lengths from the Banke, for there <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple</hi> are, in the same
places where we left them, and looking well upon the matter, as I now doe, I swear by
Me, that we neither move nor goe faster then an Ant.</p>
                     <p>Make the triall that I bad you, and care for no other; for thou knowest not, what
<hi>Columnes</hi> are, what <hi>Lines, Paralels, Zodiacks, Clyptilks, Poles, Solstices,
Aequinoctials, Planets, Signes, Poynts</hi> and <hi>Measures,</hi> of which the <hi>Caelestiall</hi>
and <hi>Terrestriall Spheres</hi> are composed: For if thou knewest all these, or any part of
them, thou mightst plainly see what <hi>Paralels</hi> we have cut, what Signes we have seene,
and what Images we have left behind, and are leaving now. And let me wish thee again
that thou search and feel thy self: for I doe not think but that thou art as cleane as a
sheet of white smooth Paper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> beganne to feele, and comming softly and warily with his hand to the left
side of his neck, hee lifted up his Head, and said to his Master; Eyther your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is false, or else wee are not come neere the place you speake of, by many Leagues.
Why (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) hast thou met with something? I with some things
(said hee) and shaking his fingers, hee washed his whole hand in the River; by which,
and in the Current, the boat softly slid along, without being moved by any secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
or hidden Enchantment, but the very course it selfe of the water, as yet soft
and easie.</p>
                     <p>By this they discovered two great Water-Milles in the middest of the River: And
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as soone as hee saw them, cried aloud to <hi>Sancho;</hi> seest thou Friend,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54746:205"/>
that Citie, Castle or Fortresse, that shewes it selfe, where some Knight is sure op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
or some Queene or Princesse in ill plight, for whose succour I am brought
hither?</p>
                     <p>What the Devill of City, Castle or Fortresse, Sir, doe you talke of (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>)
doe you not see that those are Water-Mills, in the River to grinde Corne? Peace <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
(said hee) for though they looke like Water-Milles, yet they are not, and I
have told thee already, that these Enchantments chop and change things out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
being; I say not that they change them out of one being into another really, but
in appearance, as was seene by experience in the transformation of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> the only
refuge of my hopes.</p>
                     <p>Now the Boat being gotten into the middest of the Current, began to moove
somewhat faster then before. They of the Mills, that saw the Boat come downe the
River, and that it was now even gotten into the swift streame of the wheeles, many of
them came running out with long poles to stay it: and as their faces and clothes were
all covered with meale-dust, they made a strange shew, and cryed out, saying; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
of men, whither goe you? Are you mad to drowne your selves, or bee beaten to
pieces against these wheeles?</p>
                     <p>Did not I tell thee <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) then, that wee should come where
I should shew the force of mine Arme? look what wicked uncouth fellowes come
to encounter mee; look what a troope of Hobgoblins oppose themselves against mee;
looke what ugly visages play the Bull-beggers with us: Now you shall see, you Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals;
and standing up in the Boat, hee began aloud to threaten the Millers, saying;
You base Scumme and ill-advised, free and deliver that person, which is in your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
or Prison opprest, bee hee high or low, or of what sort or quality soever; for
I am <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> otherwise called <hi>The Knight of the Lyons,</hi> for whom
the happy ending of this Adventure is reserved by order of the high Heavens: and
this sayd, hee layd hand to his sword, and beganne to fence in the aire against the
Millers, who hearing, but not understanding those madnesses, stood with their poles
to stay the Boat, which was now entring the source and channell of the wheeles. <hi>Sancho</hi>
kneeled devoutly upon his knees, praying Heaven to free him from so manifest a
danger, which succeeded happily, by the quicknesse and skill of the Millers, who
opposing their staves to the Boat, stayd it: but so, that they overturned it, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and <hi>Sancho</hi> topled into the River: but it was well for <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who
could swimme like a Goose, though the weight of his Armes carried him twice to
the bottome, and had it not beene for the Millers, who leaped into the water, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them out both, as if they had waighed them up, there they had both perished.</p>
                     <p>When they were both on land, more wet then thirsty, <hi>Sancho,</hi> upon his knees,
with joyned hands, and his eyes nailed to Heaven, prayed to God with a large and
devout prayer, to free him from thence-forward, from the rash desires and enterprizes
of his Master. And now the Fisher-men came, the Owners of the Boat, which was
broken to pieces by the wheeles, who seeing it spoyled, began to dis-robe <hi>Sancho,</hi> and
to demand payment of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who very patiently, as if hee had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
sayd to the Millers and Fisher-men, that hee would very willingly pay for the
Boat, upon condition they should freely deliver him, without fraud or guile, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or persons that were oppressed in their Castle.</p>
                     <p>What person, or what Castle mad-man? (sayd one of the Millers) will you,
trow, carry away those that came hither to grinde their corne? Enough, thought <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
to himselfe, here a man may preach in a wildernesse, to reduce a base people
to a good worke. In this Adventure two deep Enchanters have met. And the one
disturbes the other: the one provided mee the Barke, and the other overthrew mee out
of it, God help us, all this world is tricks and devices, one contrary to the other; I can
doe no more: and raising his voyce, hee went on, saying; Friends, whosoever you are,
locked up in this prison, pardon mee; for, by my ill fortune and yours, I cannot deliver
you from your pain: this Adventure is kept and reserved for some other Knight.
When hee had said this, hee agreed with the fishers, and paid 25. shillings for the boat,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:206"/>
which <hi>Sancho</hi> gave with a very good will, saying, With two of these boat-trickes wee
shall sinke our whole stocke.</p>
                     <p>The Fishermen and the Millers were in a great admiration, to see two such strange
shapes, quite from the ordinary fashion of other men, and never understood to what
purpose <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> used all those discourses to them; so holding them for mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they left them, and got to their Milles, and the Fishers to their quarters. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and <hi>Sancho</hi> like beasts turne to their beasts: and this end had the Adventure
of the Enchanted Barke.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ery melancholy and ill at ease went the Knight and Squire to horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
especially <hi>Sancho,</hi> for it grieved him at the soule to meddle
with the stocke of their money; for it seemed to him, that to part
with any thing from thence, was to part with his eye-balls. To be
briefe, without speaking a word, to horse they went, and left the
famous river. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> buried in his amorous cogitations,
and <hi>Sancho</hi> in those of his preferment; for as yet hee thought hee
was farre enough off from obtaining it: for although hee were a foole, yet hee well
perceived, that all his Masters actions, or the greatest part of them were idle: so hee
sought after some occasion, that without entring into farther reckonings, or leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
with his Master, hee might one day get out of his clutches, and goe home,
but fortune ordered matters contrary to his feare. It fell out then, that the next
day about Sun-setting, and as they were going out of a wood, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> spreads
his eyes about a green meadow, and at one end of it saw company, and comming neer,
hee saw they were Falconers; hee came neerer, and amongst them beheld a gallant
Lady upon her Palfrey, or milke-white Nagge, with green furniture, and her Saddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pummell
of silver. The Lady her selfe was all clad in greene, so brave and rich, that bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
it selfe was transformed into her. On her left hand shee carried a Soare-Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
a signe that made <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> think shee was some great Lady, and Mistresse to
all the rest, as true it was: so hee cried out to <hi>Sancho;</hi> Runne, sonne <hi>Sancho,</hi> and tell
that Lady on the Palfrey with the Soare-hawke, that I, <hi>The Knight of the Lyons,</hi> doe
kisse her most beautifull hands; and if her magnificence give me leave. I will receive her
commands, and bee her servant to the uttermost of my power, that her highnesse may
please to command mee in; and take heede, <hi>Sancho,</hi> how thou speakest, and have a
care thou mixe not thy Ambassage with some of those Proverbs of thine. Tell mee of
that? as if it were now the first time that I have carried Embassies to high and mighty
Ladies in my life? Except it were that thou carriedst to <hi>Dulcinea</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
I know not of any other thou hast carried, at least whilest thou wert with mee.
That's true, said <hi>Sancho;</hi> but a good pay-master needs no surety: and where there is
plenty, the ghests are not empty, I meane, there is no telling nor advising mee ought;
for of all things I know a little. I beleeve it (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) get thee gone in good
time, and God speed thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> went on, putting Dapple out of his pace with a Careere, and comming
where the faire Huntresse was, alighting, hee kneeled downe, and said; Faire Lady,
that Knight you see there, called <hi>The Knight of the Lyons,</hi> is my Master, and I am a
Squire of his, whome at his house they call <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> this said <hi>Knight of the Lyons,</hi>
who not long since was called, <hi>The Knight of the sorrowfull Countenance,</hi> sends me to tell
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54746:206"/>
your Greatnesse, That you bee pleased to give him leave, that with your liking, good
will, and consent, hee put in practice his desire, which is no other (as hee sayes, and
I beleeve) then to serve your lofty high-flying beauty: [<hi>For so it is in the Spanish to
make the simple Squire speake absurdly enough, for in stead of</hi> Alteca, <hi>the Author makes
him say</hi> Altaneria:] and if your Ladyship give him leave, you shall doe a thing that
may redound to your good, and hee shall receive a most remarkeable favour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                     <p>Truely honest Squire, said the Ladie, thou hast delivered thy Ambassage with all the
circumstances that such an Ambassage requires: Rise, rise, for the Squire of so renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Knight as hee of <hi>The sorrowfull Countenance</hi> (of whom wee have here speciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice)
'tis not fit should kneel: Rise up friend, and tell your Master that hee come neer
on Gods name, that the Duke my Husband and I may doe him service at a house of
pleasure wee have here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> rose up astonish't, as well at the good Ladies beauty as her courtship and
courtesie, especially for that shee told him shee had notice of his Master, <hi>The Knight of
the sorrowfull Countenance;</hi> for in that shee called him not <hi>Knight of the Lyons,</hi> it was
because it was so lately put upon him. The Duchesse asked him (for as yet wee know
not of what place shee was Duchesse) tell me, Sir Squire, is not this your Master one of
whom there is a History printed, and goes by the name of, The ingenious Gentleman,
<hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the Lady of whose life is likewise one <hi>Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boso?</hi>
The very self-same (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and that Squire of his that is or should bee in
the Historie, called <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> am I, except I were changed in my cradle, I mean
that I were changed in the Presse. I am glad of all this (quoth the Duchesse:) goe,
brother <hi>Panca,</hi> and tell your Master that hee is welcome to our Dukedome, and that no
news could have given mee greater content. <hi>Sancho,</hi> with this so acceptable an answer,
with great pleasure returned to his Master, to whom hee recounted all that the great
Ladie had said to him, extolling to the Heavens her singular beauty, with his rusticall
tearms, her affablenesse and courtesie. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> pranked it in his saddle, sate stiff
in his stirrops, fitted his Visor, rowsed up <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and with a comely boldnesse went
to kisse the Duchesses hands, who causing the Duke her Husband to bee called, told
him, whilest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was comming, his whole Embassie: So both of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read his first part, and understood by it his besotted humour, attended him with
much pleasure and desire to know him, with a purpose to follow his humour, and to
give way to all hee should say, and to treat with him as a Knight Errant, as hee should
bee with them, with all the accustomed ceremonies in Books of Knight Errantry, which
they had read, and were much affected with.</p>
                     <p>By this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came with his Visor pulled up, and making shew to alight,
<hi>Sancho</hi> came to have held his stirrop: but hee was so unluckie, that as hee was light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Dapple, one of his feet caught upon a halter of the pack-saddle, so that it was
not possible for him to disintangle himselfe, but hung by it with his mouth and his brest
to the ground-ward. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> who used not to alight without his stirrops being
held, thinking <hi>Sancho</hi> was already come to hold it, lighted sodainly down, but brought
saddle and all to ground (belike being ill gyrt) to his much shame, and curses inwardly
laid upon the unhappie <hi>Sancho,</hi> that had still his legg in the stocks. The Duke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
some of his Falconers to help the Knight and Squire, who raised <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
in ill plight with his fall, and limping as well as he could, hee went to kneel before the
two Lordings: but the Duke would not by any means consent, rather alighting from
his horse hee embraced <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> saying:</p>
                     <p>I am very sorrie Sir <hi>Knight of the sorrowfull Countenance,</hi> that your first fortune hath
been so ill in my ground; but the carelesnesse of Squires is oft the cause of worse suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.
It is impossible, volorous Prince, that any should bee bad, since I have seen you,
although my fall had cast me to the profound Abisme, since the glory of seeing you
would have drawn me out and raised me up. My Squire (a curse light on him) unties
his tongue better to speak maliciously, then hee gyrts his horses saddle to sit firmly: but
howsoever I am down or up, on foot or on horse-back, I will alwaies bee at yours and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:207"/>
my Ladie the Duchesses service, your worthy Consort, the worthy Lady of beautie, and
Princesse of universall courtesie. Softly, my Signior (<hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi>) qd.
the Duke, for where my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> is present, there is no reason other
beauties should be praised.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> was free from the noose, and being at hand, before his Master
could answere a word, hee said, it cannot be denied but affirmed, that my Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea
del Toboso</hi> is very faire; but where wee least thinke there goes the Hare away; for
I have heard say, that shee you call Nature, is like a Potter that makes Vessells of Clay,
and he that makes a handsome Vessell, may make two or three, or an hundred;
this I say, that you may know my Lady the Duchesse comes not a whit behinde my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso. Don-Quixote</hi> turned to the Duchesse, and said; Your
Greatnesse may suppose that never any Knight in the world had ever such a prater to his
Squire, nor a more conceited then mine, and hee will make good what I say, if your
Highnesse shall at any time bee pleased to make Triall. To which quoth the Dutchesse,
that honest <hi>Sancho</hi> may be conceited, I am very glad, a signe he is wise; for your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
conceits, Signior, as you very well know, rest not in dull braines, and since <hi>Sancho</hi>
is wittd and conceited, from hence forward I confirm him to bee discreet: And a
Prater added <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> So much the better (said the Duke) for many conceits
cannot be expressed in few words, and that we may not spend the time in many, come,
Sir <hi>Knight of the sorrowfull Countenance. Of the Lyons,</hi> your Highnesse must say quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> for now we have no more sorrowfull Countenance. And now let the Lyons
beare countenance. The Duke proceeded, I say let the <hi>Knight of the Lyons</hi> come to my
Castle, which is neere here, where he shall have the entertainment that is justly due to so
high a Personage, and that that the Duchesse and I are wont to give to Knights Errant
that come to us.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Sancho</hi> had made ready and gyrded <hi>Rozinantes</hi> saddle well; and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
mounting him, and the Duke upon a goodly Horse, set the Duchesse in
the middle, and they went toward the Castle. The Duchesse commanded that <hi>Sancho</hi>
should ride by her, for she was infinitely delighted to heare his discretions. <hi>Sancho</hi> was
easily intreated, and weaved himselfe betweene the three, and made a fourth in their
conversation. The Duke and Duchesse were much pleased, who held it for a great
good fortune, to have lodged in their Castle such a Knight Errant, and such a Squire
Erred,</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>REAT was the joy that <hi>Sancho</hi> conceived to see himselfe a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
to the Duchesse, as he thought; for it shaped out unto him,
that he should finde in her Castle, as much as in <hi>Don Diegoes,</hi> or
that of <hi>Basilius;</hi> for hee was alwaies affected with a plentifull
life, and so lay'd hold upon Occasions lock, ever when it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.
The History then tells us, that before they came to the
house of Pleasure or Castle; the Duke went before, and gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to all his followers how they should behave themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who as hee came on with the Duchesse to the Castle gates, there
came out two Lackyes, or Palfrey-boyes, cloathed down to the feete in coates like
night-gownes, of fine Crimson Satten, and taking <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in their armes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing or looking on him they said; Goe, and let your greatnesse help my Lady to
alight. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did so, and there was great complementing betwixt both about it;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54746:207"/>
but in the end the, Duchesses earnestnesse prevailed, and shee would not descend or
alight from her Palfrey, but in the Dukes armes, saying, That shee was too unworthy
to bee so unprofitable a burden to so high a Knight. At length the Duke helped her:
and as they entred a great Base Court, there came two beautifull Damzells, and cast
upon <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> shoulders a fair mantle of finest Scarlet; and in an instant all the
Leads of the Courts and Entries were thronged with men and maid-servants of the
Dukes, who cryed aloud; Welcome, oh Flower and Cream of Knights Errant, and all
or most of them sprinkled pots of sweet water upon <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and upon the Duke,
all which made <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> admire; and never till then did hee truely beleeve that he
was a Knight Errant really and not fantastically, seeing hee was used just as hee had read
Knights Errant were in former times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> forsaking Dapple, shewed himself to the Duchesse, and entered into the
Castle; but his conscience pricking him, that hee had left his Asse alone, hee came to a
reverend old waiting woman that came out amongst others to wait upon the Duchesse
and very softly spoke to her, Mistris <hi>Gonsalez,</hi> or what is your name forsooth? <hi>Donna
Rodriguez de Grishalua,</hi> said the waiting woman; what would you have brother with
me? To which (quoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Sancho</hi>) I pray will you doe me the favour as to goe out at the
Castle gate, where you shall finde a Dapple Asse of mine, I pray will you see him put, or
put him your self in the Stable; for the poor wretch is fearfull, and cannot by any means
indure to bee alone. If the Master (quoth shee) bee as wise as the man, wee shall have
a hot bargain on it: get you gone with a Murrin to you, and him that brought you
hither, and look to your Asse your self; for the waiting women in this house are not
used to such drudgeries. Why truly (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I have heard my Master say, who
is the very Wizard of Histories, telling that storie of <hi>Lanzarote,</hi> when hee came from
<hi>Britaine,</hi> that Ladies Looked to him and waiting women to his Courser; and touching
my Asse in particular, I would not change him for <hi>Lanzarotes</hi> horse. Brother (quoth
shee) if you bee a Jester, keep your wit till you have use of it, for those that will pay
you, for I have nothing but this* figg to give you: [*La higa: <hi>a word of disgrace.</hi>]
Well yet (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) the figg is like to bee ripe, for you will not lose the <hi>Prima vista</hi>
of your yeers by a peep lesse. Sonne of a Whore (said the waiting woman all in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with choller) whether I am old or no, God knows, I shall give him account, and not
to thee, thou Rascall, that stinkest of Garlike. All this shee spoke so loud that the
Duchesse heard her, who turning and seeing the woman so altered, and her eyes so
bloody red, shee asked her with whom shee was angry?</p>
                     <p>Here (said shee) with this Ideot, that hath earnestly intreated mee to put up his Asse
in the Stable that is at the Castle gate, giving me for an instance that they have done so
I know not where, that certain Ladies looked to one <hi>Lanzarote,</hi> and waiting women
to his Horse, and to mend the matter, in mannerly tearms calls me old one: [Vicia:
<hi>a name that a woman in</hi> Spain <hi>cannot indure to heare, though shee were as old as</hi> Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.]
That would more disgrace mee (quoth the Duchesse) then all hee should say;
and speaking to <hi>Sancho,</hi> shee said, Look you friend <hi>Sancho, Donna Rodriguez</hi> is very
young, and that <hi>Stole</hi> shee wears is more for authority and for the fashion, then for her
yeers. A pox on the rest of my yeers I have to live (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) if I meant her any
ill; I only desired the kindenesse for the love I bear to mine Asse, and because I thought
I could not recommend him to a more charitable person then Mistris <hi>Rodriguez Don-Quixote,</hi>
that heard all, said; Are these discourses, <hi>Sancho,</hi> fit for this place? Sir (said
<hi>Sancho</hi>) let every man expresse his wants wheresoe're he be: Here I remembred my Dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and here I spoke of him; and if I had remembred him in the Stable, there I would
have spoken.</p>
                     <p>To this (quoth the Duke) <hi>Sancho</hi> is in the right, and there is no reason to blame him:
Dapple shall have Provander, as much as hee will; and let <hi>Sancho</hi> take no care, hee
shall bee used as well as his own person. With these discourses, pleasing unto all but
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they went up stairs, and brought <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> into a goodly Hall, hung
with rich cloth of Gold and Tissue; six Damzels unarm'd him, and served for Pages,
all of them taught and instructed by the Duke and Duchesse what they should doe, and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:208"/>
how they should behave themselves towards <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that he might imagine and see
they used him like a Knight Errant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> once un-armed, was in his straight Trouses and Doublet of Chamois,
dry, high and lanke, with his Jawes, that within and without bussed one another; a
picture, that if the Damzels that served him, had not had a care to hold in their laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(which was one of the precise orders their Lords had given them) had burst with
laughing. They desired him to uncloathe himselfe to shift a shirt; but hee would by no
meanes consent saying; that honestie was as proper to a Knight Errant, as valour. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
he bad them give a shirt to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and locking himself up with him in a
chamber, where was a rich bed, he plucked off his clothes, and put on the shirt, and as
<hi>Sancho</hi> and he were alone, he thus spoke to him.</p>
                     <p>Tell mee (moderne Jester and old Jolt-head) is it a fit thing, to dishonour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
so venerable an old waiting-woman, and so worthy to be respected as shee? Was
that a fit time to remember your <hi>Dapple?</hi> Or thinke you, that these were Lords to let
Beasts fare ill, that so neatly use their Masters? For Gods love <hi>Sancho,</hi> looke to thy self,
and discover not thy course thred, that they may see thou art not woven out of a base
web. Know sinner as thou art, that the Master is so much the more esteemed, by how
much his servants are honest and mannerly; and one of the greatest advantages that
great men have over inferiours is, that they keepe servants as good as themselves.
Know'st thou not poor fellow, as thou art, and unhappy that I am, that if they see thee
to be a grosse Pesant, they will thinke that I am some <hi>Mountebank</hi> or shifting Squire?
No, no, friend <hi>Sancho;</hi> shunne, shunne these inconveniencies, for hee that stumbles
too much upon the Prater and Wit-monger, at the first toe-knock falls, and becomes
a scornfull Jester: Bridle thy tongue, consider and ruminate upon thy words, before
they passe, and observe wee are now come to a place, from whence, with Gods help and
mine arms valour, we shall goe bettered three fold, nay five-fold in fame and wealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> promised him very truly, to sowe up his Mouth, or to bite his Tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee would speake a word that should not bee well considered, and to purpose, as
hee had commanded; and that he should not feare, that by him they should ever bee
discovered. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> dressed himselfe, buckled his sword to his Belt, and claped
his skarlet mantle upon him, puting on a Hunters cap of greene satten, which the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozels
had given him; and thus adorned to the great chamber hee went, where hee
found the Damozells all in a rowe, sixe on one side, and sixe on the other, and all with
provision for him to wash, which they ministred with many courtesies and ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt them streight they got him full of Pompe and Majesty, and carried him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Roome, where was a rich Table, with service for foure Persons. The Duke and
Duchesse came to the doore to receive him, and with them a grave Clergy-man, one
of them that govern greet mens Houses; [<hi>A good Character of a poore Pedant,</hi>] one
of those, that as they are not borne nobly, so they know not how to instruct those that
are; one of those that would have great mens liberalityes, measured by the straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their mindes; of those that teaching those they governe to bee frugall, would
make them miserable; such a one I say, this grave Clergy-man was, that came with the
Duke to receive <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> there passed a thousand loving complements, and at last,
taking <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> between them, they sate down to dinner.</p>
                     <p>The Duke invited <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to the upper end of the Table, which, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused;
yet the Duke so importuned him, that hee was forced to take it. The Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
sate over against him, and the Duke and Duchesse on each side. <hi>Sancho</hi> was by
at all, gaping in admiration, to see the honour those Princes did to his Master, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many Ceremonies and intreaties that passed betwixt the Duke and him, to make
him sit downe at the Tables end, hee said; If your worships will give mee leave, Ile
tell you a tale that hapned in our town, concerning places. Scarce had <hi>Sancho</hi> said this,
when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> began to shake, beleeving certainly he would speak some idle speech.
<hi>Sancho</hi> beholding, understood him and said; Fear not Sir, that I shall be unmannerly,
or that I shall say any thing that may not be to the purpose; for I have not forgotten
your Counsell, touching speaking much or little, well or ill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:54746:208"/>I remember nothing <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don Quixote</hi>) speak what thou wilt so thou
speak quickly. Well, what I shall speak (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) is as true, as my Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
will not let me lie, who is here present. For me (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) lie
as much as thou wilt, for I'le not hinder thee: but take heed what thou speakest. I have
so heeded and re-heeded it, that you shall see I warrant yee. 'Twere very fit (quoth
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that your Greatnesses would command this Coxcombe to bee thrust
out; for hee will talk you a thousand follies.</p>
                     <p>Assuredly (quoth the Duchesse) <hi>Sancho</hi> shall not stirre a jot from me; for I know
hee is very discreet. Discreet yeers live your Holinesse (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for the good
opinion you have of me, although I deserve it not, and thus sayes my Tale: A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of our Town, very rich and well born; for hee was of the blood of the <hi>Alimi</hi> of
<hi>Medina del Campo,</hi> and married with <hi>Donna Mencia de Quinnones,</hi> that was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Don Alonso de Maranon,</hi> Knight of the order of Saint <hi>sacques,</hi> that was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Herradura,</hi> touching whom that quarrell was not long since in our Town;
for, as I remember, my Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was in it, where little <hi>Thomas</hi> the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap,
sonne to <hi>Baluastro</hi> the Smith was wounded. Is not all this true, Master mine?
[<hi>After hee had begun a Tale without head or or foot, hee asks a question.</hi>] Say by your life,
that these Lords may not hold me for a prating Lyer.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto (said the Clergy man) I rather hold thee for a Prater then a Lyer; but
from hence-forward, I know not for what I shall hold thee. Thou givest so many
witnesses, and so many tokens <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I cannot but say (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
thou tellest true: on with thy Tale, and make an end; for I think thou wilt
not have ended these two dayes. Let him goe on (quoth the Duchesse) to doe me a
pleasure, and let him tell his Tale as hee pleaseth, though hee make not an end these
six dayes; for if they were so many yeers they would bee the best that ever I passed in
my life.</p>
                     <p>I say then, My Masters, that the said Gentleman I told you of at first, and whom I
know, as well as I know one hand from another (for, from my house to his, 'tis not a
Bow-shoot) invited a poor, but honest Husband-man. On Brother (said the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
for me thinks you travell with your Tale, as if you would not rest till the next
world. In lesse then half this I will, if it please God (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and so I proceed:
The said Husband-man comming to the said Gentleman-Inviters house (God bee
mercifull to him, for hee is now dead) and for a further token, they say, dyed
like a Lambe; for I was not by: for at that time I was gone to another Town to
reaping.</p>
                     <p>I prethee (quoth the Clergy-man) come back from your reaping, and without bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Gentleman (except you mean to make more obsequies) end your Tale. The
businesse then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) was this, That both of them being ready to sit down at
Table; for, me thinks, I see them now more then ever. The Dukes received great
pleasure, to see the distaste that the Clergy-man took at the delayes and pawses of
<hi>Sancho's</hi> Tale. And <hi>`Don-Quixote</hi> consumed himself in cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er and rage. Then thus
(quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) both of them being ready to sit down, the Husband-man contended
with the Gentleman, not to sit uppermost, and hee with the other that hee should, as
meaning to command in his own house: but the Husband-man presuming to bee
mannerly and courteous, never would, till the Gentleman very moody, laying hands
upon him, made him sit down perforce, saying, Sit down you Thresher; for wherefoe'ere
I sit that shall bee the Tables end to thee: And now you have my Tale, and truly I
beleeve it was brought in here pretty well to the purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> face was in a thousand colours, that Jaspered upon his brow. The
Lords dissembled their laughter, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might not bee too much abashed,
when they perceived <hi>Sancho's</hi> Knavery: And to change discourse, that <hi>Sancho</hi> might
not proceed with other fooleries, the Duchesse asked <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> what news hee had
of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and if hee had sent her for a Present lately any Gyants or Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears,
since he could not but have overcome many<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered,
Lady mine; my misfortunes, although they had a beginning, yet they will never have
<pb facs="tcp:54746:209"/>
ending: Gyants, Elves, and Bug-bears I have overcome and sent her; but where
should they finde her that is Enchanted, and turned into the foulest creatures that can
bee? I know not (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) me thinks shee is the fairest creature in the world,
at least I know well, that for her nimblenesse and leaping [<hi>A good mistake</hi>] shee'l give
no advantage to a Tumbler: In good faith, my Lady Duchesse, shee leaps from the
ground upon an Asse as if shee were a Cat. Have you seen her Enchanted <hi>Sancho,</hi> said
the Duke? How? seen her (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) Why, who the Devill but I was the
first that fell into the trick of her Enchantment? shee is as much Enchanted as my
Asse.</p>
                     <p>The Clergy-man, that heard them talk of Gyants, Elves, and Bug-bears, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,
fell into reckoning, that that was <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> whose
Story the Duke ordinarily read, and for which hee had divers times reprehended him,
telling him, 'twas a madnesse to read such fopperies, and being assured of the certainty
which hee suspected, speaking to the Duke very angerly, hee said: Your excellency
ought to give God Almighty an account for this mans folly. This <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> or
Don Coxcombe, or how doe you call him? I suppose hee is not so very an Ideot
as your Excellencie would make him, giving him ready occasions to proceede
in his emptie-brain'd madnesse. And framing his discourse to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hee
said:</p>
                     <p>And who, good-man Dull-pate hath thrust into your braine, that you are a Knight
Errant, that you overcome Gyants, and take Bug-beares? get you in Gods name,
so bee it spoken, return to your house, and bring up your children if you have them,
and looke to your stocke, and leave your ranging thorow the world, blowing bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and making all that know you, or not know you, to laugh. Where have you
ever found with a mischiefe, that there have beene, or are Knights Errant? Where
any Gyants in <hi>Spain?</hi> or Bug beares in <hi>Mancha?</hi> or Enchanted <hi>Dulcinea's,</hi> with
the rest of your troope of simplicities?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was very attentive to this Venerable mans discourse, and seeing him
now silent, without any respect of the Dukes, with an angry countenance, hee stood
up and said: But his answer deserves a Chapter by it selfe.</p>

to foot, like a man filled with quicke-silver, with a hasty and
thicke voyce, said, The place, and Presence before whom I am,
and the respect I have, and alwaies had to men of your Coat,
do binde and tye up the hands of my just wrath; so that as well
for what I have said, as for I know, all know that women, and
gowned mens weapons are the same, their tongues: I will enter
into single combat with you with mine, though I rather expected
good counsaile from you, then infamous revilings; good and well-meant reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
require and aske other circumstances, other points; at least, your publike and
so bitter reprehensions have passed all limits, and your gentle ones had beene better:
neyther was it fit that without knowledge of the sinne you reprehend, you call the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
without more adoe, Cox-comb and Ideot. Well, for which of my Coxcombries seen

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54746:209"/>
I have any of these? Is there no more to bee done, but in a hurry to enter other
mens houses, to rule their owners? nay one that hath beene a poore <hi>Pedagogue,</hi> or
hath not seene more world then twenty miles about him, to meddle so roundly to
give Lawes to Chivalry, and to judge of Knights Errant? Is it happily a vaine plot,
or time ill spent, to range thorow the world, not seeking it's dainties, but the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
of it, whereby good men aspaire to the seat of immortality? If your Knights,
your Gallants, or Gentlemen should have called mee Cox comb, I should have held
it for an affront irreparable: but that your poore Schollers account mee a mad-man,
that never trod the paths of Knight Errantry, I care not a chip; a Knight I am, a
Knight I'le die, if it please the most Highest. Some goe by the spacious field of proud
ambition, others by the way of servill and base flattery, a third sort by deceitfull hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
and few by that of true Religion: But I by my starres inclination goe in
the narrow path of Knight-Errantry; for whose exercise I despise wealth, but not
honor. I have satisfied grievances, rectified wrongs, chastised insolencies, overcome
Gyants, trampled over Sprits; I am enamoured, onely because there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Knights Errant should bee so, and though I bee so, yet I am not of those vicious
Amorists, but of your chaste <hi>Platonicks.</hi> My intentions alwaies aime at a good end, as,
to doe good to all men, and hurt to none: If hee that understands this, if hee that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
it, that practiseth it, deserve to bee called foole, let your Greatnesses judge,
excellent Duke and Duchesse.</p>
                     <p>Well, I advise you (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) Master mine, speake no more in your owne
behalfe, for there is no more to bee said, no more to be thought, no more persevering in
the world: besides, this Signior, denying as hee hath done, that there neyther is, nor
hath beene Knight Errant in the world, no marvell though hee knowes not what hee
hath said. Are you trow (quoth the Clergy man) that <hi>Panca,</hi> whom they say your
Master hath promised an Island? Marry am I (said hee) and I am he that deserves it, as
well as any other, and I am hee that keepe company with good men, and thou shalt
bee as good as they: [<hi>Hee blunders out Proverbs as usually to no purpose, which is</hi>
Sancho's <hi>parts alwaies:</hi>] and I am one of those that: Not with whom thou wert
bred, but with whom thou hast fed; and of those that. Leane to a good tree and it will
shadow thee. I have leaned to my Master, and it is many Moneths since I have kept
him company, and I am his other selfe. If God please, live he and I shall live, hee shall
not want Empires to command, nor I Islands to govern.</p>
                     <p>No surely friend <hi>Sancho</hi> straight said the Duke, for I in Signior <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> name,
will give thee an od one of mine, of no small worth. Kneel down <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and kisse his Excellencies foot for the favor he hath done thee; which <hi>Sancho</hi>
did, but when the Clergy-man saw this he rose up wonderfull angry, saying; by my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Order, I am about to say; Your Excellency is as mad as one of these sinners, and see
if they must not needs be mad, when wise men canonize their madness; your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
may doe well to stay with them, for whilest they be here, Ile get me home and save a
labor of correcting what I cannot amend; and without any more adoe, leaving the rest
of his dinner he went away, the Duke and the Duchess not being able to pacifice him,
though the Duke said not much to him, as being hindred with laughter at his unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
choller.</p>
                     <p>When he had ended his langhter, hee said to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> Sir <hi>Knight of the Lyons,</hi>
you have answered so deeply for your selfe, that you left nothing unsatisfied to this
your grievance, which though it seeme to bee one, yet is not; for as women have not
the power to wrong, neither have Church-men, as you best know. 'Tis true quoth <hi>Don Quixote,</hi>
the cause is, that hee who cannot bee wronged, can doe no wrong to any
body; women, children and Church-men, as they cannot defend themselves when
they are offended, so they cannot suffer an affront and a grievance, there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(as your Excellency best knowes:) The affront comes from one that may best
doe it, and be able to make it good, the grievance may come from either Party without
affronting. For example. One stands carelesly in the streete, some ten men come ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and bastanadoing him, he claps hand to his sword, and doth his devoir; but the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:210"/>
multitude of his assailants hinder him of his purpose, which is to bee revenged; this
man is wronged, but not affronted, and this shall bee confirmed by another example.
One stands with his back turned, another comes and strikes him, and when he hath done
runns away; th'other follows, but overtakes him not: hee that received the blow
is wronged, but not affronted, because the affront ought to have been maintained: if
he that strook him (though hee did it basely) stand still and face his enemie; then hee
that was strook is wronged and affronted both together: Wronged, because hee was
strook cowardly; Affronted, because hee that strook him stood still to make good
what hee had done: And so according to the Laws of cursed Duell, I may bee wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but not affronted; for Children nor Women have no apprehension, neither can
they flye, nor ought to stand still: and so is it with the Religious; for these kindes of
people want Armes offensive and defensive: So that though they bee naturally bound
to defend themselves, yet they are not to offend any body: and though even now I
said I was wronged, I saw now I am not; for hee that can receive no affront, can give
none: for which causes I have no reason to resent, nor doe I, the words that that
good man gave me; only I could have wished hee had stayed a little, that I might
have let him see his errour, in saying or thinking there have been no Knights Errant in
the world; for if <hi>Amadis</hi> had heard this, or one of those infinite numbers of his Linage,
I know it had not gone well with his Worship.</p>
                     <p>I'le swear that (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) they would have given him a slash that should have
cleaved him from top to foot like a Pomegranate or a ripe musk-Melon; they were
pretty Youths to suffer such jests. By my Holidam, I think certainly if <hi>Renaldos de
Montalnan</hi> had heard these speeches from the poor Knave, he had bung'd up his mouth
that hee should not have spoken these three yeers; I, I, he should have dealt with them,
and see how hee would have scaped their hands.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse was ready to burst with laughter at <hi>Sancho,</hi> and to her minde shee
held him to bee more conceited and madder then his Masser, and many at that time
were of this opinion.</p>
                     <p>Finally, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was pacified and dinner ended, and the cloth being taken away,
there came four Damzels, one with a silver Bason, the other with an Ewre, a third with
two fine white Towels, the fourth with her armes tucked up to the middle, and in her
white hands (for white they were) a white Naples washing-ball. Shee with the Bason
came very mannerly, and set it under <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> chin, who very silent and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at that kinde of ceremonie, taking it to bee the custome of the Country, to wash
their faces instead of their hands; hee stretcht out his face as farre as hee could, and
instantly the Ewre began to rain upon him, and the Damzell with the soap ran over his
beard apace, raising white slakes of snow; for such were those scowrings, not only upon
his beard, but over all the face and eyes of the obedient Knight, so that hee was forced
to shut them.</p>
                     <p>The Duke and Duchesse that knew nothing of this, stood expecting what would
become of this Lavatory. The Barber Damzell, when shee had soaped him well with
her hand, feigned that shee wanted more water, and made her with the Ewre to goe for
it, whilest <hi>Signior Don-Quixote</hi> expected; which shee did, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> remained
one of the strangest pictures to move laughter that could bee imagined. All that were
present (many in number) beheld him, and as they saw him with a neck half a yard long,
more then ordinary swarthy, his eyes shut, and his beard full of soap, it was great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
and much discretion they could forbear laughing. The Damzels of the jest cast
down their eyes, not daring to look on their Lords; whose bodies with choller and
laughter even tickled again, and they knew not what to doe, either to punish the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Gyrls, or reward them for the pastime they received to see <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in
that manner.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, shee with the Ewre came, and they made an end of washing <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
and straight shee that had the Towels wiped and dryed him gently, and all four of them
at once making him a low courtesie, would have gone: but the Duke, because <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
should not fall into the jest, called to the Damzel with the Bason, saying,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54746:210"/>
Come and wash mee too, and see that you have Water enough. The Wench, that
was wylie and carefull, came and put the Bason under the Duke, as shee had done to
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and making haste, they washed and scowred him very well, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him dry and cleane, making Courtesies, they went away. After, it was known
that the Duke swore that if they had not washed him as well as <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he would
punish them for their lightnesse, which they discreetly made amends for, with soape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> marked all the Ceremonies of the Lavatorie, and said to himselfe, Lord
(thought he) if it be the custome in this Country to wash the Squires beards, as well as
the Knights? for of my soule and conscience I have neede of it, and if they would, to
run over me with a Rasor too.</p>
                     <p>What sayest thou to thy selfe <hi>Sancho?</hi> said the Duchesse. I say Madam quoth hee,
that I have heard that in other Princes Palaces they use to give water to wash mens
hands when the Cloth is taken away, but not Lye to scowre their Beards; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I see 'tis good to live long, to see much; although 'tis said also, that hee that
lives long, suffers much, though to suffer one of these Lavatories, is rather pleasure
then paine.</p>
                     <p>Take no care <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth the Duchesse, for Ile make one of my Damozells wash
thee, and if neede bee, lay thee a bucking. For my Beard quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I should bee
glad for the present, for the rest God will provide hereafter. Looke you, Carver,
said the Duchesse, what <hi>Sancho</hi> desires, doe just as hee would have you. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
answered, that Signior <hi>Sancho</hi> should bee punctually served, and so hee went
to dinner, and carried <hi>Sancho</hi> with him, the Dukes and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sitting still, and
conferring in many and severall affaires, but all concerning the practise of Armes and
Knight Errantry.</p>
                     <p>The Duchess requested <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to delineate and describe unto her (since hee
seemed to have a happy Memory) the beauty and feature of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boso,</hi>
for according to Fames Trumpet, she thought that shee must needs bee the fairest
creature in the world, and also of the <hi>Mancha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sighed at the Duchesses command, and said; If I could take out my
heart, and lay it before your Greatnesses eyes upon this Table in a dish, I would save
my Tongue a labour to tell you that which would not bee imagined: for in my heart,
your Excellency should see her lively depainted; but why should I be put to describe
and delineate exactly, peece for peece, each severall beauty of the peerelesse <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> a
burden fitter for other backs then mine; an enterprize in which the pensils of <hi>Parrasius,
Timantes</hi> and <hi>Apelles,</hi> and the tooles of <hi>Lisippus,</hi> should indeed be imployed, to paint
and carve her in tables of Marble and Brasse, and <hi>Ciceronian</hi> and <hi>Demosthenian Rhetorick</hi>
to praise her.</p>
                     <p>What meane you by your <hi>Demosthenian,</hi> Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> quoth the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse?
<hi>Demosthenian Rhethorique</hi> (quoth hee) is as much as to say, the <hi>Rhethorique</hi>
of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> as <hi>Ciceronian</hi> of <hi>Cicere,</hi> both which were the two greatest <hi>Rhethoricians</hi>
in the world. 'Tis true quoth the Duke, and you shewed your ignorance in asking that
question; but for all that, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might much deligh us, if hee would paint
her out; for Ile warrant, though it bee but in her first draught, shee will appeare so
well, that the most fair will envy her. I would willingly said he, if misfortune had not
blotted out her <hi>Idea,</hi> that not long since befell her, which is such, that I may rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
it, then describ her; for your Greatnesses shall understand, that as I went here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
to have kissed her hands, and receive her Benediction, Leave and License, for this
my third sally; I found another manner of one then I looked for, I found her Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and turned from a Princesse to a Country-wench, from fair to foule, from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to a Deviil, from sweet to contagious, from well spoken to rustick, from modest to
skittish, from light to darkness, and finally from <hi>Dulcinea del Tob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Sayago.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now God defend us quoth the Duke, with a loud voice, who is hee that hath done
so much hurt to the world? Who hath taken away the beautie that cheered it? The
<pb facs="tcp:54746:211"/>
quicknesse that entertained it? and the honesty that did credit it? Who, said hee?
who but some cursed Enchanter? one of those many envious ones that persecute me:
This wicked race borne in the world to darken and annihilate the exploits of good men,
and to give light and raise the deeds of evill. Enchanters have me persecuted: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters
me persecute: and Enchanters will me persecute, till they cast me and my
lofty Chivalry into the profound Abisme of forgetfullnesse, and there they hurt and
wound me where they see I have most feeling; for to take from a Knight Errant his
Lady, is to take away his eye-sight, with which hee sees the Sunne that doth lighten him,
and the food that doth nourish him. Oft have I said, and now I say again, that a Knight
Errant without a Mistris is like a Tree without leaves; like a Building without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or a Shadow without a Body, by which it is caused.</p>
                     <p>There is no more to bee said (quoth the Duchesse:) but yet if wee may give credit
to the History of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that not long since came to light, with a generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
it is said, as I remember, That you never saw <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and that there is no such
Ladie in the world; but that shee is a meer fantasticall creature ingendred in your
brain, where you have painted her with all the graces and perfections that you
please.</p>
                     <p>Here is much to bee said, quoth hee, God knows, if there bee a <hi>Dulcinea</hi> or no in
the world; whether shee bee fantasticall or not: and these bee matters, whose justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
must not bee so farre searcht into: Neither have I ingendred or brought forth
my Lady, though I contemplate on her, as is fitting, shee being a Lady, that hath all
the parts that may make her famous thorow the whole world: as these; Fair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Blemish; Grave without Pride; Amorous, but Honest; Thankfull, as Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
Courteous as Well-bred: And finally, of high Descent; by reason that Beauty
shines and martcheth upon her noble Blood in more degrees of perfection then in mean
born Beauties.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (said the Duke:) but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> must give me leave to say what the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
where his exploits are written, sayes, where is inferred, That though there bee a
<hi>Dulcinea</hi> in <hi>Toboso,</hi> or out of it, and that shee bee fair in the highest degree, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
her; yet in her highnesse of Birth shee is not equall to your <hi>Oriana's,</hi> your <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siraxaria's,</hi>
or your <hi>Madasima's, [Names of faigned Ladies in Books of Knighthood,]</hi>
with others of this kinde, of which your Histories are full, as you well know. To this
I answer you (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote) Dulcinea</hi> is Virtuous, and Virtue adds to Linage,
and one that is Mean and Virtuous ought to bee more esteemed then another Noble
and Vicious: Besides, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> hath one shred that may make her Queen with
Crown and Scepter: for the merit of a Fair and Virtuous Woman extends to doe
greater miracles, and although not formally, yet virtually shee hath greater fortunes laid
up for her.</p>
                     <p>I say, Signior <hi>Don Quixote</hi> (quoth the Duchesse) that in all you speak, you goe with
your leaden plummet, and, as they say, with your sounding Line in your hand, and that
henceforward I will beleeve, and make all in my house beleeve, and my Lord the Duke
too, if need bee, that there is a <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in <hi>Toboso,</hi> and that at this day shee lives, that
she is fair and well borne, and deserves that such a Knight as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> should serve
her, which is the most I can, or know how to endeer her: But yet I have one scruple
left, and, I know not, some kinde of incling against <hi>Sancho:</hi> the scruple is, that the
Historie sayes, That <hi>Panca</hi> found the said Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> (when hee carried your Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
winnowing a Bag of Wheat, and for more assurance, that it was red Wheat, a thing
that makes me doubt of her high Birth.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replyed: Lady mine, you shall know, that all or the most
part of my Affairs are clean different from the ordinary course of other Knigts Errant,
whether they bee directed by the unserutable will of the Destinies, or by the malice of
some envious Enchanter, and as it is evident, that all, or the most of your famous
Knights Errant, one hath the favour not to bee Enchanted; another to have his flesh
so impenetrable, that hee cannot bee wounded, as the famous <hi>Roldan,</hi> one of the twelve
Peers of <hi>France,</hi> of whom it was said, that hee could not bee wounded, but upon the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54746:211"/>
soale of his left foot; and that this too must bee with the poynt of a great Pin, and
with no other kind of weapon; so that when <hi>Bernardo del Carpio</hi> did kill him in <hi>Ronce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualles,</hi>
seeing he could not wound him with his sword, he lifted him in his armes from
ground and stifled him, as mindefull of the death that <hi>Hercules</hi> gave <hi>Anteon,</hi> that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Gyant, that was said to be the son of the earth.</p>
                     <p>From all this I inferre, that it might bee I might have had some of these favours, as
not to be wounded; for many times experience hath taught mee, that my flesh is soft
and penetrable, or that I might have the power not to be Enchanted; but yet I have
seen my selfe clapt in a Cage, where all the world was not able to enclose me, had it not
been by virtue of Enchantments; but since I was free, I shall beleeve that no other can
hinder mee: So that these Enchanters, who see, that upon me they cannot use their
sleights, they revenge themselves upon the things I most affect, and mean to kill me, by
ill-intreating <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> by whom I live; and so I beleeve, that when my Squire carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Ambassage, they turned her into a Pesant, to be imployed in so base an Office, as
winnowing of wheat; but I say, that wheat was neither red, nor wheat; but seeds of
Oriental Pearls, and for proof of this, let me tell your Magnitudes, that coming a while
since by <hi>Toboso,</hi> I could never find <hi>Dnlcineaes</hi> Palace, and <hi>Sancho</hi> my Squire, having seen
her before in her own shape, which is the fairest in the world, to me she then seemed a
foule course Country-wench, and meanly nurtured, being the very Discretion of the
world: And since I am not Enchanted, neither can I be in all likelyhood, shee is shee
that is Enchanted, grieved, turned, choped and changed, and my Enemies have revenged
themselves on me, in her, and for her I must live in perpetual sorrow, till she come to her
pristine being.</p>
                     <p>All this have I spoken, that no body may stand upon what <hi>Sancho</hi> said of that sifting
and winnowing of hers; for since to mee shee was changed, no marvell though for
him she was exchanged. <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is nobly borne, and of the best blood in <hi>Toboso,</hi> of
which I warrant she hath no small part in her; and for her that Towne shall be famous
in after-ages, as <hi>Troy</hi> for <hi>Helen,</hi> and <hi>Spayn</hi> for <hi>Cava [Daughter to an Earle that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed</hi>
Spaine <hi>to the Moores. Vide Marian. Hist. de Reb.</hi> Hisp.] though with more honor
and reputation: On the other side I would have your Lordships know that <hi>Sancho
Panca</hi> is one of the prettiest Squires that ever served Knight Errant; somtimes he hath
such sharp simplicities, that to think whether he be fool or knave, causeth no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
he hath malice enough to be a knave, but more ignorance to be thought a foole;
he doubts of every thing, and yet beleeves all; when I think sometimes hee will tumble
headlong to the foot, he comes out with some kinde of discretion that lifts him to the
Clouds.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I would not change him for any other Squire, though I might have a City
to boot, therefore I doubt, whether it be good to send him to the Government that your
Greatness hath bestowed on him, though I see in him a certain fitnesse for this you call
governing; for, triming his understanding but a very little, hee would proceed with his
gouernment as well as the King with his Customes: Besides, wee know by experience,
that a Gevernor needs not much learning, or other abilities; for you have a hundred
that scarce can read a word, and yet they govern like <hi>Ier-Falcons;</hi> the business is, that
their meaning be good, and to hit the matter aright they undertake, for they shall not
want Counsellors to teach them what they shall doe, as your Governors that be sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and not Scholers, that have their Assistants to direct them: my councell should be
to him; that neither Bribe he take, nor his due forsake, and some other such toyes as
these that I have within me, and shall be declared at fit time to <hi>Sancho's</hi> profit, and the
Islands which he shall govern.</p>
                     <p>To this point of their discourse came the Duke, Duchesse, and <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> when
straight they heard a great noyse of people in the Palace, and <hi>Sancho</hi> came, into the Hall
unlook'd for, in a maze, with a strayner in stead of a Bib, and after him many Lads, or
Scullions of the Kitchin, and other inferior people, and one came with a little kneading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub
of water, that seemed to be dish-water who followed and persecuted <hi>Sancho,</hi> and
sought by all means to joyn the vessel to his chin, and another would have washed him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:212"/>What's the matter, Hoe (quoth the Duchesse?) What doe yee to this honest man?
What? doe yee not know hee is Governor Elect? To which the Barber-Scullion
replyed, This Gentleman will not suffer himself to bee washed according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
as my Lord the Duke and his Master were. Yes marry will I (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) in
a great huffe: but I would have cleaner Towels and clearer Sudds, and not so sluttish
hands; for there is no such difference between my Master and mee, that they should
wash him with Rose-water and me with the Devills lye: The customes of great mens
Palaces are so much the better, by how little trouble they cause; but your Lavatory
custome here is worse then Penetentiaries; my beard is clean, and I need no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing;
and hee that comes to wash me, or touch a hair of my head (of my beard,
I say) sir-reverence of the companie, I'le give him such a box, that I'le set my fist in his
skull; for these kinde of ceremonies and soap-layings are rather flouts then entertainers
of guests.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse was ready to die with laughter, to see <hi>Sancho's</hi> choller, and to heare
his reasons: But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was not very well pleased to see him so ill dressed with
his jaspered Towell, and hemmed in by so many of the Kitchin Pensioners; so making a
low leg to the Dukes, as if hee intended to speake, with a grave voyce hee spoke to the
skoundrels.</p>
                     <p>Hark yee Gentlemen, Pray let the youth alone, and get you gone as you came, if
you please; for my Squire is as cleanly as another, and these Troughs are as straight
and close for him as your little red clay drinking Cups: take my counsail and leave
him, for neither hee nor I can abide jests. <hi>Sancho</hi> caught his words out of his mouth
and went on, saying; No, let um come to make sport with the setting Dogg and I'le
let um alone; as sure as it is now night, let um bring a Comb hither, or what they will,
and curry my Beard, and if they finde any thing foul in it, let um shear me to fitters.
Then quoth the Duchesse, (unable to leave laughing) <hi>Sancho</hi> sayes well, hee is clean, as
hee sayes, and needs no washing: and if our custome please him not, let him take his
choyce; besides, you ministers of cleanlinesse have been very slack and carelesse, I know
not whether I may say presumtuous, to bring to such a personage and such a beard,
instead of a Bason and Ewre of pure gold and Diaper Towels, your kneeding-Troughs
and Dish-clouts: but you are unmannerly raskalls, and like wicked wretches must
needs shew the grude you bear to the Squires of Knights Errant.</p>
                     <p>The Raskall Regiment, together with the Carver that came with them, thought
verily the Duchesse was in earnest: So they took the Sive-cloth from <hi>Sancho's</hi> neck,
and even ashamed went their wayes and left him, who seeing himself out of that (as hee
thought) great danger, kneeled before the Duchesse, saying; From great Ladies great
favours are still expected; this that your worship hath now done me, cannot be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with lesse, then to desire to see my self an Armed Knight Errant, to imploy my
self all dayes of my life in the service of so high a Lady. I am a poor Husbandman,
my name is <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> Children I have, and serve as a Squire; if in any of these I
may serve your Greatnesse, I will bee swifter in obeying, then your Ladyship in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</p>
                     <p>'Tis well seen <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Duchesse, that you have learnt to bee courteous in
the very school of courtesie: I mean, it seems well, that you have been nursed at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
brest, who is the cream of Complement, and the flower of Ceremonies: well
fare such a Master and such a Servant; the one for North-starre of Knight Errantry,
the other for the starre of Squire-like fidelitie: Rise, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I will repay your
courtesie, in making my Lord the Duke, as soon as hee can, performe the promise hee
hath made you, of being Governor of the Island.</p>
                     <p>With this their discourse ceased, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went to his afternoons sleep, and
the Duchesse desired <hi>Sancho,</hi> that if hee were not very sleepie, hee would passe the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
with her and her Damzels in a cool room. <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, That though true it
were, that hee was used in the afternoons to take a some five hours nap, yet to doe her
goodnesse service, hee would doe what hee could, not to take any that day, and would
obey her command: so hee parted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:54746:212"/>The Duke gave fresh order for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> usage to bee like a Knight Errant,
without differing a jot from the ancient stile of those Knights.</p>

to his promise came, when hee had dined, to see the Duchesse, who
for the delight shee received to heare him, made him sit down by
her in a low Chaire, though <hi>Sancho,</hi> out of pure mannerlinesse,
would not sit: but the Duchesse bade him sit as hee was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and speak as hee was Squire, though in both respects hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the very seat of <hi>Cyd Ruydiaz</hi> the Champion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> shrunk up his shoulders, [<hi>The Spainiards lowsie humility,</hi>] obeyed and sate
down, and all the Duchesses Waiting-women and Damzels stood round about her,
attending with great silence to <hi>Sancho's</hi> discourse: but the Duchesse spake first,
saying:</p>
                     <p>Now that wee are all alone, and that no body hears us, I would Signior Governor
would resolve me of certain doubts I have, arising from the printed History of the
Grand <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> one of which is, That since honest <hi>Sancho</hi> never saw <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> I
say the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> neither carried her <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Letter (for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the Note-Book in <hi>Sierra Morena</hi>) how hee durst feign the answer, and that
hee found her sifting of Wheat; this being a mock and a lye and so prejudiciall to the
Lady <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> reputation, and so unbefitting the condition and fidelity of a faithfull
Squire.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Sancho</hi> rose without answering a word, and softly crooking his body, and with
his finger upon his lipps, hee went up and down the room, lifting up the hangings:
which done, hee came and sate down again, and said; Now I see Madame, that no body
lies in wait to hear us, besides the by-standers, I will answer you without fear of fright,
all that you have asked, and all that you will ask mee. And first of all I say, That I
hold my Master <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for an incurable Mad-man, though sometimes hee speaks
things, that in my opinion, and so in all theirs that heare him, are so discreet, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in so even a track, that the Devill himself cannot speak better; but truly and
without scruple I take him to bee a very Frantick; for so I have it in my mazard, I dare
make him beleeve that, that hath neither head nor foot, as was the answer of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and another thing that hapned some eight dayes agoe, which is not yet in print, to
wit, the Enchantment of my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for I made him beleeve she is Enchanted,
it being as true as the Moon is made of green Cheese.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse desired him to tell her that Enchantment and conceit; which hee did
just as it passed; at which the hearers were not a little delighted. And prosecuting
her discourse, the Duchesse said, I have one scruple leaps in my minde,, touching what
<hi>Sancho</hi> hath told mee, and a certain buz comming to mine eares that tells me; If <hi>Don-Quixote
de la Mancha</hi> bee such a shallow Mad-man and Widgin, and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
his Squire know it; yet why for all that hee serves and follows him, and relies on his
vain promises; doubtlesse, hee is as very a Mad-man and Block-head as his Master,
which being so as it is, it will be very unfitting for my Lord the Duke to give <hi>Sancho</hi> an
Island to Govern; for hee that cannot govern himself, will ill govern others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:213"/>By'r Lady (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that scruple comes in pudding-time: but bid your
Buzze speake plaine, or how he will; for I know he sayes true; and if I had been wise,
I might long since have left my Master: but 'twas my lucke, and this vilde Errantry,
I cannot doe withall, I must follow him, wee are both of one place, I have eaten
his bread, I love him well, hee is thankfull hee gave mee the Asse-colts, and above all, I
am faithfull and it is impossible any chance should part us, but death: and if your Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
will not bestow the Government on mee, with lesse was I borne, and perhaps,
the missing it might bee better for my conscience; for though I bee a foole, yet I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Proverbe that sayes, The Ant had wings to doe her hurt, and it may bee,
<hi>Sancho</hi> the Squire may sooner goe to Heaven, then <hi>Sancho</hi> the Governour. Here

path as the Journey-man; and the Popes body takes up no more roome then a Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
though the one bee higher then the other; for when wee come to the pit, all are
even, or made so in spite of their teethes and, and good-night.</p>
                     <p>Let mee say againe, If your Lady-ship will not give mee the Island, as I am a foole
I'le refuse it, for being a wise man: for I have heard say, The neerer the Church, the
further from God; and, All is not gold that glistreth; and that from the Oxen, plough
and yokes, the Husband-man <hi>Bamba</hi> was chosen for King of <hi>Spaine:</hi> and that <hi>Radrigo,</hi>
from his tissues, sports, and riches, was cast out to bee eaten by Snakes (if wee may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the rimes of the old <hi>Romants,</hi> that lye not.)</p>
                     <p>Why, no more they doe not (said <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> the Wayting-woman, that
was one of the Auditours) for you have one <hi>Romant</hi> that sayes, that <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi>
was put alive into a Tombe full of Toades, Snakes, and Lizards, and some two
dayes after from within the Tombe, hee cryed with a low and pittifull voyce, <hi>Now
they eat, now they eat mee in the place where I sinned most:</hi> and according to this, this
man hath reason to say, hee had rather bee a Labourer then a King, to bee eaten to
death with vermine.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse could not forbeare laughing, to see the simplicity of her woman,
nor to admire to heare <hi>Sancho's</hi> proverbiall reasons, to whom shee said; Honest
<hi>Sancho</hi> knows, that when a Gentleman once makes a promise, he will perform it though
it cost him his life. My Lord and Husband the Duke, though hee bee no Errant, yet
hee is a Knight, and so hee will accomplish his promise of the Island, in spight of envy
or the worlds malice. Bee of good cheere, <hi>Sancho;</hi> for when thou least dreamest
of it, thou shalt bee seated in the Chayre of thy Island, and of Estate, and shalt claspe
thy Government in thy robes of Tissue. All that I charge thee, is that you looke
to the governing your Vassalls, for you must know, they are all well-borne and
loyall.</p>
                     <p>For governing (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) there's no charging mee; for I am naturally cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and compassionate to the poor, and of him that does well they will not speake ill,
and by my Holidam they shall play mee no false play: I am an old dog, and understand
all their Hist, hist: and I can snuffe my selfe when I see time, and I will let no cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs
fall in my eyes, for I know where my shoo wrings mee: this I say, because honest
men shall have hand heart, but wicked men neyther foot nor fellowship. And mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
for matter of Government, there is no more but to begin, and in fifteen daies
Governour, I could manage the place, and know as well to governe, as to labour in
which I was bredd. You have reason, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Duchesse, for no man is born
wise, and Bishops are made of men, and not of stones. But turning to our discourse
that wee had touching the Lady <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> Enchantment, I am more then assured, that
that imagination that <hi>Sancho</hi> had to put a tricke upon his Master, and to make him
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54746:213"/>
thinke the Country wench was <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> that if his Master knew her not, all was
invented by some of those Enchanters that persecute Signior <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for I
know partly, that that Country wench that leapt upon the Asse-colt, was, and is
<hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> thinking to be the deceiver, is himselfe deceived; and there is
no more to be doubted in this, then in things that wee never saw: and know, <hi>Sancho,</hi>
that here wee have our Enchanters too, that love, and tell us plainly and truely, what
passed in the world, without trickes or devices; and beleeve mee, <hi>Sancho</hi> that leaping
wench was, and is <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> who is inchanted as the Mother that brought her forth,
and when wee least thinke of it, wee shall see her in her proper shape, and then <hi>Sancho</hi>
will thinke hee was deceived.</p>
                     <p>All this may be quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and now will I beleeve all that my Master told mee of
<hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave where he said he saw our Mistresse <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> in the same apparel and
habit, that I said I had seen her in, when I Enchanted her at my pleasure; and it may
be Madam, all is contrary (as you say) for from my rude wit, it could not bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that I should in an instant make such a witty Lie; neither doe I beleeve that my
Master is so mad, that with so poore and weake a perswasion as mine, he should beleeve
a thing so incredible; but for all that good Ladie, doe not think me to be so malevolent,
for such a Leeke as I am, is not bound to boare into the thoughts and maliciousnesse of
most wicked Enchanters. I fained that, to scape from my Masters thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts, and not
with any purpose to hurt him, and if it fell out otherwise, God is above that judgeth
all hearts. 'Tis true said the Duchesse, but tell mee <hi>Sancho,</hi> what is that you said of
<hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave? I should be glad to heare it. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> began to tell word for
word, all that passed in that Adventure: Which when the Duchesse heard, shee said;
Out of this successe may bee inferred, that since the grand <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sayes that hee
saw there the same lobouring wench that <hi>Sancho</hi> saw at their coming from <hi>Toboso,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt it is <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and that in this the Enchanters here are very listning and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This I said (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that if my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> be Enchanted, at
her perill be it, for Ile have nothing to doe with my Masters Enemies, who are many,
and bad ones. True it is, that shee that I saw was a Countrey-wench, and so I held her,
and so I judged her to bee, and if that were <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> Ile not meddle with her, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall the Blowze passe upon my account. I, I, let's have giving and taking every
foot. <hi>Sancho</hi> said it, <hi>Sancho</hi> did it, <hi>Sancho</hi> turned, <hi>Sancho</hi> return'd, as if <hi>Sancho</hi> were
a dish-clout, and not the same <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> that is now in print all the world over, as
<hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> told mee, who at least is one that is Bachelorized in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and
such men cannot ly, but when they list, or that it much concerns them; so there is no
reason any man should deale with me, since I have a good report, and as I have heard
my Master say; Better have an honest name then much wealth. Let um joyne mee to
this Government and they shall see wonders; for he that hath been a good Squire, will
easily be a good Governor.</p>
                     <p>Whatsoever <hi>Sancho</hi> hitherto hath said (quoth the Duchesse) is <hi>Caton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>an</hi> Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or at least taken out of the very entrailes of <hi>Michael Verinus, Florentibus occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
annis.</hi> Well, well, to speake as thou dost, a badd cloake often hides a good drinker.
Truely Madam, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> I never drunke excessively in my life, to quench my thirst
sometimes I have, for I am no hypocrite, I drinke when I am dry, and when I am
urged too; for I love not to bee nice or unmannerly; for what heart of marble is
there, that will not pledge a friends carowse? but though I take my cup, I goe not
away drunke: besides, your Knight Errants Squires ordinarily drinke water, for they
alwaies travell by Forrests, Woods, Medowes, Mountaines, cragy Rockes, and meet
not with a pittance of Wine, though they would give an eye for it.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve it, said the Duchesse, and now, <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou maist repose thy selfe, and
after wee will talke at large, and give order how thou maist bee joyned, as thou saist,
to the Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> againe gave the Duchesse thankes, but desired her shee would doe him the
kindenesse, that his Dapple might bee well lookt to. What Dapple (quoth shee?)
My Asse (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) for not to call him so, I say my Dapple: and when I came into
<pb facs="tcp:54746:214"/>
the Castle, I desired this waiting woman to have a care on him, and shee grew so loud
with me, as if I called her ugly or old; for I held it fitter for them to Provander Asses,
then to Authorize Rooms: Lord God, a Gentleman of my Town could not indure
these waiting-women. Some Pesant, quoth <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> the waiting-woman;
for if hee had been a Gentleman and well bred, hee would have extolled them above the
Moon.</p>
                     <p>Goe too, no more (quoth the Duchesse;) Peace <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> and bee quiet <hi>Sancho,</hi>
and let me alone to see that <hi>Sancho's</hi> Asse bee made much of; for being <hi>Sancho's</hi> hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-stuff,
I will hold him on the Apples of mine eyes. Let him bee in the Stable (quoth
<hi>Sancho;</hi>) for neither hee nor I am worthy to bee so much as a minute upon those Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of your Greatnesse eyes; and I had as liefe stab my self as consent to that: for
although my Master sayes, that in courtesies one should rather lose by a card too much
then too little; yet in these Asse-like courtesies, and in your Apples, it is fit to bee
wary and proceed with discetion. Carry him <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Duchesse) to thy
Government; for there thou mayest cherish him at thy pleasure, and manumit him
from his labour. Doe not think you have spoken jestingly Lady Duchesse (quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi>)
for I have seen more then two Asses goe to Governments, and 'twould bee no
novelty for me to carrie mine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho's</hi> discourse renewed in the Duchesse more laughter and content; and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to repose, shee went to tell the Duke all that had passed between them, and
both of them plotted and gave order to put a jest upon <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> that might bee a
famous one, and suting to his Knightly style, in which kinde they played many pranks
with him, so proper and handsome, that they are the best contained amongst all the
Adventures of this Grand History.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat was the pleasure the Duke and Duchesse received with <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi> conversation; and they resolved to play
some tricks with them, that might carry some twi-lights and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of Adventures. They took for a Motive that which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
had told unto them of <hi>Montesinos</hi> Cave, because they
would have it a famous one: but that which the Duchesse most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
at, was, that <hi>Sancho's</hi> simplicity should bee so great, that hee
should beleeve for an infallible truth, that <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was Enchanted, hee hmself having
been the Enchanter and the Impostor of that businesse: So giving order to their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
for all they would have done, some a week after they carried <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to a
Boar-hunting, with such a troop of Wood-men and Hunters, as if the Duke had been
a crowned King. They gave <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> a Hunters sute, and to <hi>Sancho</hi> one of sinest
green cloth: but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would not put on his, saying; That shortly hee must
return again to the hard exercise of Armes, and that therefore hee could carry no Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes
or Sompters. But <hi>Sancho</hi> took his, meaning to sell it with the first occasion
offered.</p>
                     <p>The wisht for day being come, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> Armed himself, and <hi>Sancho</hi> clad him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and upon his Dapple (for hee would not leave him, though they had given him a
Horse) thrust himself amongst the troop of the Wood-men. The Duchesse was bravely
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54746:214"/>
attyred, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> out of pure courtesie and manners took the Reins of her
Palfrey, though the Duke would not consent: at last they came to a wood that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two high Mountains, where taking their stands, their lanes and paths, and the
Hunters divided into severall stands, the chase began with great noyse, hooting and
hollowing, so that one could scarce heare another, as well for the cry of the dogs, as for
the sound of the Hornes.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse alighted, and with a sharpe Javelin in her hand, shee tooke a stand,
by which shee knew some wilde Boares were used to passe: The Duke also alighted
and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and stood by her, <hi>Sancho</hi> stayed behinde them all, but stirred not
from Dapple, whom he durst not leave, lest some ill chance should befall him, and they
had scarce lighted, and set themselves in order with some servants, when they saw there
came a huge Boar by them baited with the Dogs, and followed by the Hunters, gnashing
his teeth and tuskes, and foaming at the mouth; and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing him, buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his shield to him, and laying hand on his sword, went forward to encounter him;
the like did the Duke with his Javelin; but the Duchesse would have beene formost of
all, if the Duke had not stopped her. Only <hi>Sancho,</hi> wen he saw the valiant Beast, left
<hi>Dapple,</hi> and began to scud as fast as hee could, and striving to get up into a high Oake,
it was not possible for him, but being even in the middest of it, fastned to a bough, and
striving to get to the top, he was so unluckie and unfortunate that the bough broke,
and as he was tumbling to the ground, he hung in the ayre fastned to a snag of the
Oake, unable to come to the ground, and seeing himselfe in that perplexitie, and that
his greene coat was torne, and thinking that if that wilde-Beast should come thither,
he might lay hold on him, he began to cry out and call for help so outragiously, that
all that heard him, and saw him not, thought verily some wilde-Beast was devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the Tuskie Boare was laid along, with many Javelins points, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
turning aside to <hi>Sanchoes</hi> noyse, that knew him by his note, hee saw him
hanging on the Oake and his head downward, and <hi>Dapple</hi> close by him, that never left
him in all his calamitie; and <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> sayes, that he seldome saw <hi>Sancho</hi> without
<hi>Dapple,</hi> or <hi>Dapple</hi> without <hi>Sancho,</hi> such was the love and friendship betwixt the
couple:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went and unhung <hi>Sancho,</hi> who seeing himselfe free and on the ground,
beheld the torne place of his hunting suite, and it grieved him to the soule, for hee
thought he had of that suite at least an inheritance. And now they layed the Boare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
upon a great Mule, and covering him with Rosemary-bushes, and Myrtle
boughs, he was carried in signe of their victorious spoiles, to a great field-Tent, that
was set up in the midst of the wood, where the Tables were set in order, and a dinner
made ready, so plentifull and well drest, that it well shewed the bounty and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of him that gave it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> shewing the wounds of his torne Garment to the Duchesse said; If this
had beene hunting of the Hare, my Coate had not seene it selfe in this extremitie: I
know not what pleasure there can bee in looking for a Beast, that if hee reach you with
a tuske, he may kill you: I have often heard an old song that sayes; <hi>Of the Beares maist
thou be eat, as was</hi> Favila <hi>the great.</hi> He was a Gothish King (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that
going a hunting in the Mountains, a Beare eat him. This I say (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) I
would not that Kings and Princes should thrust themselves into such dangers, to
enjoy their pleasure; for what pleasure can there bee to kill a Beast that hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no fault?</p>
                     <p>You are in the wrong <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Duke; for the exercise of Beast-hunting is
the necessariest for Kings and Princes that can bee. The Chase is a shew of Warre,
where there be stratagems, crafts, deceits to overcome the Enemy at pleasure; in it
you have sufferings of cold and intolerable heates, sleepe and idlenesse are banisht, the
powers are corroborated, the members agilitated. In conclusion, 'tis an exercise that
may bee used without prejudice to any body, and to the pleasure of every-body, and the
best of it is, that it is not common, as other kindes of sports are, except flying at the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:215"/>
Fowle onely fit for Kings and Princes. Therefore, <hi>Sancho,</hi> change thy opinion, and
when thou art a Governour, follow the chase, and thou shalt bee a hundred times the
better.</p>
                     <p>Not so (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) 'tis better for your Governor to have his leggs broken and
bee at home: 'twere very good that poor suiters should come and seek him, and hee
should bee taking his pleasure in the Woods: 'twould bee a sweet Government yfaith.
'Good faith Sir, the Chase and Pastimes are rather for idle companions then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors:
My sport shall bee Vyed Trump at Christmas, and at Skettle pinns Sundaies and
Holydayes; for your Hunting is not for my condition, neither doth it agree with my
conscience.</p>
                     <p>Pray God <hi>Sancho</hi> it bee so (quoth the Duke;) for to doe and to say goe a severall
way. Let it bee how 'twill (said <hi>Sancho;</hi>) for a good Pay-master needs no Pledge, and
Gods help is better then early rising; and the belly carries the leggs, and not the leggs
the belly: I mean, that if God help me, and I doe honestly what I ought, without
doubt I shall Govern as well as a <hi>Ier-Falcon:</hi> I, I, put your finger in my mouth, and
see if I bite or no.</p>
                     <p>A mischief on thee, cursed <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) and when shall wee heare
thee, as I have often told thee, speak a wise speech, without a Proverb? My Lords, I
beseech you leave this: Dunce; for hee will grinde your very souls, not with his two,
but his two thousand Proverbs, so seasonable, as such bee his health or mine, if I hearken
to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho's</hi> Proverbs (quoth the Duchesse) although they bee more then <hi>Mallara's,</hi>
yet they are not lesse to bee esteemed then his, for their sententious brevity. For
my part, they more delight me then others that bee farre better, and more sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>With these and such like savory discourses, they went out of the Tent to the Wood,
to seek some more sport; and the day was soon past, and the night came on, and not so
light and calm as the time of the yeer required, it being about Mid-summer: but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dismallnesse it had, agreeing much with the Dukes intention, and so as it grew to
bee quite dark; it seemed that upon a sodain, all the wood was on fire, thorow every
part of it; and there were heard here and there, this way and that way, an infinite compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Cornets, and other warlike instruments, and many troops of Horse that passed
thorow the Wood: The light of the Fire and the sound of the warlike Instruments, did
as it were blinde, and stunned the eyes and eares of the by-standers, and of all those that
were in the wood. Straight they heard a companie of Moorish cries, [Le li lies, <hi>like the
cries of the Wild Irish,</hi>] such as they use when they joyn Battell; Drums and Trumpets
sounded and Fifes, all, as it were, in an instant, and so fast, that he that had had his sences,
might have lost them, with the confused sound of these Instruments.</p>
                     <p>The Duke was astonish'd, the Duchesse dismay'd, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> wondred, <hi>Sancho</hi>
trembled: And finally, even they that knew the occasion were frighted: Their fear
caused a generall silence, and a Post in a Devills weed passed before them, sounding,
instead of a Cornet, a huge hollow Horne that made a hoarce and terrible noyse. Hark
you Post (quoth the Duke; What are you? Whither goe you? And what men of
warre are they that crosse over the Wood? To which the Post answered, with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and free voyce; I am the Devill, I goe to seek <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> and
they which come here, are six Troops of Enchanters that bring the Peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea
del Toboso</hi> upon a Triumphat Charriot; shee comes here Enchanted with the brave
French man <hi>Montesinos,</hi> to give order to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how shee may bee disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted.</p>
                     <p>If thou wert a Devill, as thou sayest (quoth the Duke) and as they shape shews thee
to bee, thou wouldst have known that Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> for hee is
here before thee. In my soul and conscience (quoth the Devill) I thought not on it;
for I am so diverted with my severall cogitations, that I quite forgot the chief for which
I came. Certainly (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) this Devill is an honest fellow, and a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
for if hee were not hee would not have sworn by his soul and conscience: and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54746:215"/>
now I beleeve, that in Hell you have honest men. Straight the Devill without lighting,
directing his fight toward <hi>Don Quixote</hi> said; The unluckie, but valiant Knight <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinos,</hi>
sends me to thee, <hi>O Knight of the Lyons</hi> (for me thinks now I see thee in their
pawes) commanding me to tell thee from him, that thou expect him here, where he will
meet thee; for he hath with him <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> and meanes to give thee instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
how thou shalt disinchant her; and now I have done my message I must away, and
the Devills, like mee bee with thee: and good Angels guard the rest. And this said,
he windes his monstrous horne, and turned his back, and went without staying for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Answere.</p>
                     <p>Each one began afresh to admire, especially <hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote. Sancho,</hi> to see
that in spight of truth, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> must bee enchanted: <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to think whether
that were true that befell him in <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave, and being elevated in these dumps,
the Duke said to him; Will you stay, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Should I not, quoth hee?
Here will I stay couragious and undanted, though all the Devils in Hell should close
with me. Well quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I heare another Devill and another Horne, I'le stay in
<hi>Flanders</hi> as much as here.</p>
                     <p>Now it grew darker, and they might perceive many lights up and downe the
Wood; like the dry exhalations of the Earth in the Skie, that seeme to us to bee shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Starres:
Besides, there was a terrible noyse heard, just like that of your creak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wheeles of Oxe-wains, from whose piercing squeake (they say) Beares and Wolves
doe fly, if there be any the way they pass. To this tempest there was another added,
that increast the rest, which was, that it seemed that in all four parts of the Wood,
there were foure Encounters or Battels in an instant; for there was first a sound of
terrible Cannon-shotte, and an infinite company of Guns were discharged, and the
voyces of the Combatants seemed to be heard by and by a farre off, the Moorish cries
reiterated.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the Trumpets, Cornets and Hornes, Drums, Canons and Guns, and above
all, the fearefull noyse of the Carts, all together made a most confused and horrid
sound, which tried <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> uttermost courage to suffer it: but <hi>Sancho</hi> was
quite gone, and fell in a swound upon the Duchesses coates, who received him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should cast cold water in his face; which done, he came to himselfe, just
as one of the Carts of those whistling wheeles came to the place, foure lazie Oxen
drew it, covered with black clothes; at every horne they had a lighted torch tyed,
and on the top of the Cart there was a high seat made, upon which a venerable old
man sate, with a Beard as white as snow, and so long that it reached to his gyrdle; his
garment was a long gowne of black-Buckoram: for because the Cart was full of lights,
all within it might very well bee discerned and seen; two ugly Spirits guided it, clad in
the said Buckoram, so monstrous, that <hi>Sancho,</hi> after hee had seen them, winked, because
he would see them no more; when the Cart drew neer to their standing, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
old man rose from his seat, and standing up with a loud voice said; <hi>I am the wise
Lyrgander;</hi> and the Cart passed on, he not speaking a word more,</p>
                     <p>After this, there passed another Cart in the same manner, with another old man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronized;
who making the Cart stay; with a voice no lesse lofty then the other said; <hi>I
am the wise Alquife,</hi> great friend to the ungratefull <hi>Vrganda;</hi> and on he went: And
straight another Cart came on, the same pace; but he that sate in the chief seat, was no
old man (as the rest) but a good robustious fellow, and ill favoured, who when hee
came neere, rose up, as the rest; but with a voice more hoarce and divellish, sayd;
I am <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Enchanter, mortall enemy to <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and all his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:
And so on hee passed, all three of these Carts turning a little forward, made a
stand, and the troublesome noyse of their wheeles ceased, and straight there was heard
no noyse, but a sweet and consenting sound of well-formed musicke, which comforted
<hi>Sancho,</hi> and hee held it for a good signe, and hee sayd thus to the Duchesse, from
whom hee stirred not a foot, not a jot.</p>
                     <p>Madam, where there is musicke, there can bee no ill. Neither (quoth the Duchesse)
where there is light and brightnesse. To which (sayd <hi>Sancho</hi>) the fire gives light, and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:216"/>
your Bon-fires (as wee see) and perhaps might burne us: but Musick is alwaies a signe
of feasting and jollity. You shall see that (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for hee heard all, and
hee said well, as you shall see in the next chapter.</p>

you call Triumphant Chariots come towards them, drawn by six
dun Mules, but covered with white linnen, and upon each of them
came a Penetentiary with a Torch, clothed likewise all in white:
the Cart was twice or thrice as big as the three former, and at the
top and sides of it were twelve other Penetentiaries, as white as
snow, all with their Torches lighted, a sight that admired and
astonisht joyntly: And in a high throne sate a Nymph, clad in a
vail of cloth of silver, a world of golden spangles glimmering about her; her face was
covered with a fine cloth of Tiffany, for all whose wrinkles the face of a most delicate
Damzell was seen thorow it, and the many lights made them easily distinguish her beauty
and yeers, which (in likelyhood) came not to twenty, nor were under seventeen: Next
her came a shape, clad in a gown of those you call side-Garments, down to her foot;
her head was covered with a black vaile: But even as the Cart came to bee just over
against the Dukes and <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Musick of the Hoboyes ceased, and the Harps
and Lutes that came in the Cart began; and the gowned Shape rising up, unfolding her
Garment on both sides, and taking her vail off from her head, shee discovered
plainly the picture of raw-boned Death, at which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was troubled, and
<hi>Sancho</hi> afraid, and the Dukes made shew of some timerous resenting. This live Death
standing up, with a drowzie voyce, and a tongue not much waking, began in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

'twere fitter that <hi>Sancho</hi> took the discipline of Rowels or Bullets with Prickles

That though I am a Clown, yet my flesh is rather Cotten then Mattresse; and there's
no reason I should kill my self for anothers good. You say well (quoth the Duchesse)
to morrow I'le give you a whip that shall fit you, and agree with the tendernesse of
your flesh, as if it were a kinn to them. To which (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) Lady of my soul,
I beseech you know, that I have written a Letter to my Wife <hi>Teresa Panca,</hi>
letting her know all that hath hapned to (me, since I parted from her;

you write it (quoth shee?) Nothing lesse (said hee;) for I can neither write nor

for a Coat and Bodies. My Master <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as I have heard

that I am ne're a whit behind him. We have been in <hi>Montesinos</hi> Cave:

but let no body know this; for put it thou to discant on, some will cry

look into it, and send thee word whether it bee fit for thee to come to me

not leave him, although I were to goe to bee Great Turk. My Lady the
Duchesse kisses thy hands a thousand times: Return her two thousand;
for ther's nothing costs lesse, nor is better cheap, as my Master tells me,
then complement. God Almighty hath not yet been pleased to blesse me
with a Cloke-bag, and another hundred Pistolets, as those you wot of:
But bee not grieved, my <hi>Teresa,</hi> there's no hurt done; all shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
when wee lay the Government a bucking: only one thing

shewed <hi>Sanchoes</hi> Letter to the Duke, which gave him great content. They dined
and when the cloth was taken away, and that they had entertained themse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ves a pretty
while with <hi>Sanchoes</hi> savory conversation; upon a sodaine they heard a dolefull sound
of a Flute, and of a hoarce and untuned Drum; all of them were in some amazement
at this confused, martiall, and sad harmony, especially <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who was so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
he could not sit still in his seat; for <hi>Sancho</hi> there is no more to be said, but that
feare carried him to his accustomed refuge, which was the Duchesses side or her lap;
for in good earnest, the sound they heard was most sad and melancholy. And all of them
being in this maze, they might see two men come in before them into the Garden, clad
in mourning weedes, so long that they dragged on the ground, these came beating of
two Drums, covered likewise with black, with them came the Fife, black and besmeared
as well as the rest. After these there followed a personage of a Gyantly body, bemant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and not clad in a cole-black Cassock, whose skyrt was extraordinary long, his Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sock
likewise was gyrt with a broad black Belt, at which there hung an unmeasurable
Scimitar, with hilts and scabard; upon his face he wore a transparent black Vaile, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
which they might see a huge long beard, as white as snow His pace was very grave
and stayed, according to the sound of the Drum and Fife. To conclude, his hugeness, his
motion, his blackness, and his consorts, might have held all that knew him not, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on him, in suspence.</p>
                     <p>Thus hee came with the state and <hi>Prosopopeia</hi> aforesaid, and kneeled before the Duke,
who with the rest that stood up there, awaited his comming: but the Duke would
not by any meanes heare him speake till hee rose, which the prodigious Scar-crow
did; and standing up, hee pluckt his maske from off his face, and shewed the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
long, white, and thicke beard, that ere till then humane eyes beheld; and straight
hee let loose and roared out from his broad and spreading brest, a majesticall loud
voyce, and casting his eyes toward the Duke, thus said:</p>

Ambassage to your Greatnesse, which is, that your Magnificence bee pleased to give
her leave, and licence to enter and relate her griefes, which are the most strange and
admirable that ever troubled thoughts in the world could thinke: but first of all, she
would know whether the valorous and invincible Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>
bee in your Castle, in whose search shee comes afoot, and hungry from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Candaya,</hi> even to this your Dukedome: a thing miraculous, or by way of
Enchantment: she is at your Fortresse gate, and onely expects your permission to
come in; thus hee spoke, and forthwith coughed and wiped his Beard from the top
to the bottome, with both his hands, and with a long pawse attended the Dukes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
which was;</p>
                     <p>Honest Squire <hi>Trifaldin</hi> with the white Beard, long, since the misfortune of the
Countesse <hi>Trifaldi</hi> hath come to our notice, whom Enchanters have caused to be stiled.
<hi>The afflicted Matron:</hi> tell her, stupendious Squire, shee may come in, and that here
is the valiant Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> from whose generous condition shee
may safely promise her selfe all aid and assistance: and you may also tell her from mee,
that if shee neede my favour, shee shall not want it; since I am oblieged to it by being
a Knight, to whom the favouring of all sorts of her sexe is pertained and annexed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Matron widowes ruin'd and afflicted, as her Ladyship is. Which when <hi>Trifaldin</hi>
heard, he bent his knee to the ground, and making signes to the Drum and Flfe, that
they should play to the same pace and sound as when they entred, he returned back out
of the Garden, and left all in admiration of his presence and posture.</p>

were present, who the other day at Table, seemed to bee so distasted, and to bear such a
grudge against Knights Errant, that hee might see with his eyes, whether those Knights
are necessary to the world; hee might feel too with his hands that your extraordinary
afflicted and comfortlesse and great affairs, and enormious mishaps goe not to seek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
to Book-mens houses, or to some poor Country Sextons, not to your Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that never stirred from home, nor to the lazie Courtier that rather hearkens after
news which hee may report again, then procures to perform deeds and exploixts, that
others may relate and write; the redresse of griefs; the succouring of necessities; the
protection of Damzells; the comfort of Widdows, is had from no sort of persons so
well as from Knights Errant; and that I am one, I give heaven infinite thanks, and I
think my disgrace well earned, that I may receive in this noble calling. Let this Matron
come and demand what shee will; for I will give her redresse with this my strong
Arme and undaunted resolution of my couragious Spirit.</p>

these kinde of women were intermedling, there could no good
follow: [Duennas: <hi>Here</hi> Sancho <hi>takes</hi> Duenna <hi>in the former
sence, for an old Waiting-woman.</hi>] Lord, what an enemy that
Apothecary was to them! for since all your Matrons, of what condition or quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they bee, are irksome and foolish; what kinde of ones shall your afflicted bee? as
this Countesse* Three skirts, or Three tailes; for tails and skirts, all is one: [* <hi>Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

and this was his mistake.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Peace, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for since this Matron-Lady comes
from so remote parts to seek me, shee is none of those that the Apothecary hath in his
bed-roll: Besides, this is a Countesse; and when your Countesses are Waiting-women,
'tis either to Queens or Empresses, who in their houses are most absolute, and are served
by other Wayting-women. To this, quoth <hi>Donna Rod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

My Lady the Duchesse hath women in her service that might have beene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses,
if Fortune had been pleased: but the weakest goe to the walls, and let no man
speak ill of Waiting-women, and especially of ancient Maids; for although I am none,
yet I well and cleerly perceive the advantage, that your Mayden Wayting-women have
over Widdow-women, and one pair of sheers went between us both.</p>
                     <p>For all that (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) there is so much to bee sheered in your Waiting-women
<pb facs="tcp:54746:220"/>
(according to mine Apothecary) that, The more you stirre this businesse, the more it
will stink. Alwayes these Squires (quoth <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi>) are malicious against us;
for, as they are Faries that haunt the out-rooms, and every foot spy us, the times that
they are not at their devotions (which are many) they spend in back-biting us, undig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
our bones, and burying our reputation. Well, let me tell these mooving Blocks
that in spite of them, wee will live in the world and in houses of good fashion, though
wee starve for it, or cover our delicate or not delicate flesh with a black Monks weed,
as if wee were old walls covered with Tapistry, at the passing of a Procession. I'faith
if I had time and leisure enough, I would make all that are present know, that there is
no virtue, but is contained in a Waiting-woman. I beleeve (said the Duchesse) my
honest <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> is in the right; but shee must stay for a fit time to answer for
her self and the rest of Waiting-women, to confound the Apothecaries ill opinion, and
to root it out altogether from <hi>Sancho's</hi> brest. To which (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) since the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernourship
smoaks in my head, all Squirely sumes are gone out, and I care not a wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fig
for all your Waiting-women.</p>
                     <p>Forward they had gone with this Wayting-woman discourse, had they not heard
the Drum and Fife play, whereby they knew that the afflicted Matron was entring:
the Duchesse askt the Duke if they should meet her, since shee was a Countesse and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
personage. For her Counteship (quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> before the Duke could answer)
I like it that your Greatnesse meet her: but for her Matronship, that yee stirre not a
foot. Who bids thee meddle with that <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> Who Sir (said
hee?) I my self, that may meddle, that, as a Squire, have learnt the terms of courtesie
in your Worships Schoole, that is the most courteous and best bred Knight in all Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and as I have heard you say in these things, Better play a card too much then too
little; and good wits will soon meet. 'Tis true as <hi>Sancho</hi> sayes (quoth the Duke) wee
will see what kinde of Countesse shee is, and by that ghesse what courtesie is due to her.
By this the Drum and Fife came in, as formerly: And here the Author ended this
brief Chapter, beginning another, which continues the same Adventure, one of the
notablest of all the History.</p>

twelve Matron-wayters, divided into two ranks, all clad in
large Monks weeds, to see to, of fulled Serge, with white Stoles of
thin Callico, so long that they only shewed the edge of their black
weeds. After them came the Countesse <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> whom <hi>Trifaldin</hi>
with the white beard led by the hand, clad all in finest unnapped
Bayes; for had it been napped, every grain of it would have been
as big as your biggest pease: Her taile or her train (call it whether you will) had three
corners, which was borne by three Pages, clad likewise in mourning: Thus making a
sightly and Mathematicall shew with those three sharp corners, which the poynted
skirt made, for which belike shee was called the Countesse <hi>Trifaldi [the word in Spanish
importing so]</hi> as if wee should say the Countesse of the three trains; and <hi>Benengeli</hi>
sayes it was true, and that her right name was the Countesse <hi>Lobuna,</hi> because there
were many Wolves bred in her Country; and if they had been Foxes, as they were
Wolves, they would have called her the Countesse <hi>Zorruna,</hi> [Zorra <hi>in Spanish, a Fox</hi>]
by reason that in those parts it was the custome that great ones took their appellations
from the thing or things that did most abound in their States: but this Countesse taken
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54746:220"/>
with the strangenesse of the three-fold train, left her name of <hi>Lobuna,</hi> and took that of
<hi>Trifaldi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twelve Wayters and their Lady came a procession pace, their faces covered with

thorow. Just as the Matronly Squadron came in; the Duke, the Duchesse, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
stood up, and all that beheld the large Procession. The twelve made a stand
and a Lane, thorow the middest of which the afflicted came forward, <hi>Trifaldin</hi> still
leading her by the hand, which the Duke, the Duchesse, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing, they
advanced some dozen paces to meet her. Shee kneeling on the ground, with a voyce
rather course and hoarce, then fine and cleer, said, May it please your Greatnesses to
spare this courtesie to your servant; I say, to mee your servant; for as I am <hi>The Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
I shall not answer you as I ought, by reason that my strange and unheard of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
hath transported my understanding I know not wither, and sure 'tis farre off,
since the more I seek it, the lesse I finde it. Hee should want it Lady (quoth the Duke)
that by your person could not judge of your worth, the which without any more look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into, deserves the Cream of Courtesie, and the flower of all mannerly Ceremonies:
So taking her up by the hand, hee led her to sit down in a chair by the Duchesse, who
welcommed her also with much courtesie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was silent, and <hi>Sancho</hi> longed to see the <hi>Trifaldi's</hi> face, and some of
her waiting-women: but there was no possibilitie, till they of their own accords would
shew them; so all being quiet and still, they expected who should first breake silence,
which was done by the afflicted Matron, with these words. Confident I am (most
powerfull Sir, most beautifull Lady, and most discreete Auditors) that my most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serablenesse
[<hi>A fustian Speech on purpose and so continued.</hi>] shall finde in your most
valorous Brests shelter, no lesse pleasing then generous and compassionate; for it is
such as is able to make marble relent, to soften the Diamonds, and to mollifie the steele
of the hardest hearts in the world; but before it come into the market-place of your
hearing (I will not say your eares) I should be glad to know, if the most Purifiediferous
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Manchissima,</hi> and his Squiriferous <hi>Panca,</hi> be in this Lap, this Quire,
this Company.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Panca</hi> is here (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) before any body else could answere, and <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xotissimo</hi>
too, therefore most <hi>Afflictedissimous Matronissima,</hi> speake what you <hi>willissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
[Sancho strives to answere in the same key]</hi> for we are all ready and most forward
to be your <hi>Servitorissimus.</hi> Then <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rose up, and directed his speech to the
<hi>Afflicted Matron</hi> and said; If your troubles, straightned Lady, may promise you any
hope of remedy, by the valour and force of any Knight Errant; Behold, here are my
poor and weake armes, that shall bee imployed in your service. I am <hi>Don-Quixote de
la Mancha,</hi> whose Function is to succour the needy, which being so (as it is) you need
not, Lady, to use any Rhetorick, or to seek any Preambles; but plainly and without
circumstances, tell your griefs; for they shall bee heard by those, that if they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
them, yet they will commiserate them.</p>
                     <p>Which when the afflicted Matron heard, shee seem'd to fall at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> feet,
and cast her self down, striving to embrace them, and said; Before these feet and leggs
I cast my self, oh invincible Knight; since they are the <hi>Basis</hi> and Columnes of Knight
Errantry, these feet will I kisse, on whose steps the whole remedy of my misfortunes
doth hang and depend. Oh valorous Errant! whose valorous exploits doe obscure
and darken the fabulous ones of the <hi>Amadises, Esplandiasus,</hi> and <hi>Belianises:</hi> And
leaving <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> shee laid hold on <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and griping his hands, said; Oh

in goodnesse then my Usher <hi>Trifaldins</hi> beard; well mayest thou vaunt, that in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou servest, in Cipher, the whole Troop of Knights that have worn
Armes in the world: I conjure thee, by thy most loyall goodnesse, that thou be a good
Intercessor with thy Master, that hee may eftsoons favour this most humble most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Countesse.</p>
                     <p>To which (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that my goodnesse, Lady, bee as long as your Squires beard,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:221"/>
I doe not much stand upon; the businesse is, Bearded or with Mustacho's, let me have my
soul goe to Heaven when I die: for, for beards here I care little or nothing: but without
these clawings or intreaties, I will desire my Master (for I know hee loves me well, and
the rather, because now in a certain businesse hee hath need of me) that hee favour and
help your Worship as much as hee may: but pray uncage your griefs, and tell them us,
and let us alone to understand them.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes were ready to burst with laughter, as they that had taken the pulse of
this Adventure, and commended within themselves the wit and dissimulation of the
<hi>Trifaldi,</hi> who sitting her down, said; Of the famous Kingdome of <hi>Taprobana,</hi> which
is between the great <hi>Taprobana</hi> and the South sea, some two leagues beyond Cape <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morin,</hi>
was Queen the Lady <hi>Donna Maguncia,</hi> widdow to King <hi>Archipielo,</hi> her Lord
and Husband, in which matrimony they had the Princesse <hi>Antonomasia,</hi> Heire to the
Kingdome: The said Princesse was brought up, and increased under my Tutorage and
instruction, because I was the ancientest and chiefest Matron that waited on her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It fell out then, that times comming and going, the Childe <hi>Antonomasia</hi> being
about fourteen yeers of age, shee was so fair that Nature could give no further addition.
Discretion it self was a Snotty-nose to her, that was as discreet as fair, and shee was the
fairest in the world, and is, if envious Fates and inflexible Destinies have not cut the
threed of her life: but sure they have not; for Heaven will not permit, that
Earth suffer such a losse, as would bee the lopping of a branch of the fairest Vine in the
world.</p>
                     <p>On this beauty (never-sufficiently extolled by my rude tongue) a number of Princes
were enamoured, as well Neighbours as strangers, amongst whom, a private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
durst raise his thoughts to the Heaven of that beauty, one that lived in Court,
confident in his youth and gallantry, and other abilities, and happy facilities of wit;
for let mee give your Greatnesses to understand (if it bee not tedious) hee played
on a Gitterne, as if hee made it speake, hee was a Poet, and a great Dancer, and could
very well make Bird-cages, and onely with this Art, might have gotten his living,
when he had been in great necessity: so that all these parts and adornments were able
to throw downe a mountaine, much more a delicate Damzell: but all his gentry,
all his graces, all his behaviour and abilities, could have little prevailed, to render my
childes fortresse, if the cursed theefe had not conquered mee first. First, the cursed
Rascall Vagamund sought to get my good will, and to bribe mee, that I, ill keeper,
should deliver him the keyes of my fortresse.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, hee inveigled my understanding, and obtained my consent, with
some toyes and trifles (I know not what) that hee gave mee: but that which most did
prostrate mee, and made mee fall, was certaine verses, that I heard him sing one night
from a grated Window, toward a Lane where hee lay, which were as I remember
these.
<q>
                           <l>An ill upon my soule doth steale,</l>
                           <l>From my sweetest enemy:</l>
                           <l>And it more tormenteth mee</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Ditty was most precious to mee, and his voyce as sweet as sugar, and many
a time since have I thought, seeing the mis-hap I fell into, by these and such other like
verses, and have considered, that Poets should bee banisht from all good and well-governed
Common-wealths, as <hi>Plato</hi> counselled, at least lascivious Poets; for they
write lascivious verses, not such as those of the Marquesse of <hi>Mantua, [Old Ballad
verses, the Author speakes here Satyrically,]</hi> that delight and make women and children
weepe, but piercing ones, that like sharpe thornes, but soft, traverse the soule, and
wound it like lightning, leaving the garment sound; and againe he sung.

                     </p>
                     <p>Other kindes of songs hee had, which being sung, enchanted, and written, suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for when they daigned to make a kinde of verse in <hi>Candaya,</hi> then in use, called
<hi>Roundelaies,</hi> there was your dancing of soules, and tickling with laughter and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the body: and finally, the quicksilver of all the sences. So, my Masters, let mee
say, that such Rithmers ought justly to bee banished to the Island of Lizards: but the
fault is none of theirs, but of simple creatures that commend them, and foolish wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that beleeve in them: and if I had been as good a Waiting-woman, as I ought
to have beene, his over-nights conceits would not have moved mee, neither should
I have given credit to these kinde of speeches: I live dying, I burne in the frost, I shake
in the fire, I hope hopelesse, I goe, and yet I stay: with other impossibilities of this
seumme, of which his writings are full: and then, your promising the Phoenix of <hi>Arabia,
Ariadne's,</hi> Crowne, the Lockes of the Sunne, the Pearles of the South, the Gold of
<hi>Tyber,</hi> and <hi>Balsamum</hi> of <hi>Pancaia:</hi> and here they are most liberall in promising that,
which they never think to performe.</p>
                     <p>But whither, aye mee unhappy, doe I divert my selfe? What folly or what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
makes mee recount other folkes faults, having so much to say of mine owne? Aye
mee againe, unfortunate, For not the verses, but my folly, vanquished mee; not his
musicke, but my lightnesse, my ignorance softned mee; that, and my ill fore sight ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the way, and made plaine the path to <hi>Don Clanixo,</hi> for this is the aforesaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-mans
name; so that I being the Bawde, hee was many times in the chamber of the
(not by him, but mee) betrayed <hi>Antonomasia,</hi> under colour of being her lawfull Spouse;
for though a sinner I am, I would not have confented, that without being her Husband,
hee should have come to the bottome of her shoo-sole.</p>
                     <p>No, no, Matrimony must ever bee the colour in all these businesses, that shall bee
treated of by mee: onely there was one mischiefe in it, that <hi>Don Clanixo</hi> was not her
Equall, hee being but a private Gentle-man, and shee such an Inheritrix. A while
this juggling was hid and concealed, with the sagacity of my warinesse, till a kinde of
swelling in <hi>Antonomasia's</hi> belly, at last discovered it, the feare of which made us all
three enter into counsell, and it was agreed, that before the mis-hap should come to
light, <hi>Don Clanixo</hi> should demand <hi>Antonomasia</hi> for wife before the Vicar, by vertue
of a bill of her hand, which shee had given him to bee so: this was framed by my inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so forcibly, that <hi>Samson</hi> himselfe was not able to break it.</p>
                     <p>The matter was put in practice, the Vicar saw the bill, and tooke the Ladies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
who confessed plainely, hee committed her prisoner to a Sargeants house.
Then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) have you Sargeants too in <hi>Candaya,</hi> Poets, and Roundelayes? I
sweare I thinke, the world is the same every-where: but make an end, Madam <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldi:</hi>
for it is late, and I long to know the end of this large story. I will, answered

whereat the Queen <hi>Donna Maguncia Antonomasia's</hi> Mother
was so full of wrath that some three dayes after wee buried her.
Well, Sir Squire (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) it hath been seen e're now, that
one that hath been but in a swound, hath been buried, thinking he was dead; &amp; me thinks
that Queen <hi>Maguncia</hi> might but rather have been in a swound, for with life many
things are remedied; and the Princesses error was not so great, that shee should so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it. If shee had married with a Page or any other Servant of her house (as I
have heard many have done) the mischance had been irreparable: but to marrie with
so worthy a Gentleman, and so understanding as hath been painted out to us, truly,
truly, though 'twere an over-sight, yet 'twas not so great as wee think for; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Masters rules, here present, who will not let me lye, as Schollers become

who with his Art to revenge his Cousins death, and for <hi>Don Clanixo's</hi> boldnesse, and
for despight of <hi>Antonomasia's</hi> oversight, enchanted them upon the same Tombe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her into a Brazen Ape, and him into a fearfull Crocodile of unknown metall,
and betwixt them both is likewise set a Register of metall, written in the <hi>Siriack</hi> tongue,
which being translated into the <hi>Candayan,</hi> and now into the <hi>Castilian,</hi> contains
this sentence:</p>
                     <p>These two bold Lovers shall not recover their naturall form, till the valiant Manchegan
come to single <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for his great valour.</p>
                     <p>This done hee unsheathed a broad and unwieldly Scimiter, and taking me by the haire
of the head, hee made as if hee would have cut my throat, or sheared off my neck at a
blow. I was amazed, my voice cleaved to the roof of my mouth; I was troubled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly:
but I enforced my self as well as I could, and with a dolorous and trembling
voyce, I told him such and so many things, as made him suspend the execution of his
rigorous punishment.</p>
                     <p>Finally, hee made all the waiting-women of the Court bee brought before him,
which are here present now also, and after hee had exaggerated our faults, and reviled

the conditions of waiting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> women, their wicked wyles, and worse sleights, and laying
my fault upon them all, hee said he would not capitally punish us, but with other dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
paines, that might give us a civil and continuate death: and in the very same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and moment that hee had said this, wee all felt that the Pores of our faces opened,
and that all about them wee had prickles, like the pricking of needles; by and by wee
clapped our hands to our faces, and found them just as you see them now; with this
the Afflicted, and the rest of the waiting-women lifted up their masks which they had
on, and shewed their faces all with Beards, some red, some black, some white, and lime
smeared; at sight of which the Duke and Duchesse admired; <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi>
were astonish't, and all the by-standers wonder-strucken, and the <hi>Trifaldi</hi> proceeded:
Thus that Fellon and hard-hearted <hi>Malambruno</hi> punished us, covering the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and smoothenesse of our Faces with these rough Bristles: Would God hee
had beheaded us with his unwildy Scemiter, and not so dimmed the light of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with these blots that hide us; for, my Masters if wee fall into reckoning, (and that
which now I say, I would spake it with mine eyes running a Fountaine of Teares,
but the consideration of our misfortunes, and the Seas that hitherto have rayned,
have drawne them as dry as eares of Corne, and therefore let mee speake without
Teares.) Whither shall a waiting-woman with a Beard goe? What Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will take compassion on her? For when her flesh is at the smoothest, and her
Face Martyrized with a thousand sorts of slibber-slabbers and Waters, shee can scarce
finde any body that will care for her; What shall shee doe then when shee weares a
wood upon her face? O Matrons, Companions mine, in an ill time were wee borne,
in a lucklesse houre our Fathers begat us: And saying this, shee made shew of
dismaying.</p>

Oh happy <hi>Don-Quixote!</hi> Oh renowned <hi>Dulcinea!</hi> Oh
pleasant <hi>Sancho!</hi> all together, and each in particular, long may you live, to the delight
and generall recreation of mortalls. The Storie then goes on, that just as <hi>Sancho</hi> saw
the Afflicted dismay'd, he said, As I am honest man, and by the memorie of the <hi>Pancaes,</hi>
I never heard nor saw, nor my Master never told me, nor could he ever conceit in his
fancy such an Adventure as this. A thousand Satans take thee (not to curse thee) for
an Enchanter as thou art, Gyant <hi>Malambruno,</hi> and hadst thou no kinde of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for these sinners but this bearding them? What, had it not beene better and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them, to have bereaved them of halfe their Noses, though they had snuffled for
it, and not to have clapt these Beards on them? I hold a wager they have no money to
pay for their shaving. You say true Sir, quoth one of the twelve, wee have nothing
to cleanse us with, therefore some of us have used a remedy of sticking Plaisters, which,
applyed to our faces, and clapped on upon a suddaine, make them as plaine and smooth
<pb facs="tcp:54746:223"/>
as the bottome of a stone Morter; for though in <hi>Candaya</hi> there be women that goe up
and down from house to house to take away the haire of the body, and to trim
the eye-brows, and other slibber-sawces touching women, yet wee my Ladies wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would never admit them, because they smell something of the Bawde: and
if Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> doe not help us, wee are like to goe with beards to our
graves.</p>
                     <p>I would rather lose mine amongst Infidels (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) then not ease you
of yours. By this the <hi>Trifaldi</hi> came to her self again, and said, the very jyngling of this
promise came into my eares in the midest of my Trance, and was enough to recover my
sences: therefore once again renowned Errant and untamed Sir, let mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you that your graciouspromise bee put in execution. For my part it shall
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) tell me Lady what I am to doe, for my minde is very prompt,
and ready to serve you.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is (quoth the Afflicted) from hence to the Kingdome of <hi>Candaya,</hi> if you goe
by Land, you have five thousand leagues, wanting two or three; but if you goe in the
ayre, some three thousand two hundred and seven and twenty by a direct line. You
must likewise know, that <hi>Malambruno</hi> told me, that when Fortune should bring mee
to the Knight that must free us, that hee would send a Horse much better, and with
fewer tricks then your Hirelings, which is the self-same Horse of wood, on which the
valiant <hi>Pierres</hi> stole and carried away the fair <hi>Magalona,</hi> which Horse is governed by
a pin that hee hath in his forehead, that serves for a bridle, and flies in the aire so swiftly
as if the Devills themselves carried him. This Horse, according to Tradition, was made
by the sage <hi>Merlin,</hi> and hee lent him to his friend <hi>Pierres,</hi> who made long voyages
upon him, and stole away, as is said, the faire <hi>Magalona,</hi> carrying her in the aire at his
Crupper, leaving all that beheld them on earth in a staring gaze; and hee lent him to
none but those whom hee loved, or that payed him best; and since the Grand <hi>Pierres,</hi>
hitherto wee have not heard that any else hath come upon his back: <hi>Malambruno</hi> got
him from thence by his Art, and keeps him, making use of him in his voyages, which hee
hath every foot thorow all parts of the world; and hee is here to day, and to morrow
in <hi>France,</hi> and the next day at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and the best is, that this Horse neither eats
nor sleeps, nor needs shooing; and hee ambles in the aire without wings, that hee that
rides upon him, may carry a cup full of water in his hand, without spilling a jot:
hee goes so soft and so easie, which made the fair <hi>Magalona</hi> glad to ride upon
him.</p>
                     <p>Then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for your soft and easie going, my Dapple bears the bell, though
hee goe not in the aire; but upon earth I'le play with him with all the Amblers in the
world.</p>
                     <p>All of them laughed, and the Afflicted went on: And this Horse (if <hi>Malambruno</hi>
will grant an end of our misfortune) within half an hour at night will bee with us; for
hee told me, that the signe that I had found the Knight that should procure our liberty,
should bee the sending of that Horse, whither hee should come speedily. And how
many (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) may ride upon that Horse? The Afflicted answered, Two; one
in the Saddle, and the other at the Crupper; and most commonly such two are Knight
and Squire, when some stoln Damzell is wanting. I would faine know, Afflicted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) what this Horses name is. His name (quoth shee) is not like
<hi>Bellerophons</hi> horse <hi>Pegasus,</hi> or <hi>Alexanders</hi> the great <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> or <hi>Orlando Furioso's
Briliadoro,</hi> or <hi>Bayarte Reynaldos de Mantaluans,</hi> or <hi>Rogeros Frontino,</hi> or <hi>Bootes,</hi> or
<hi>Perithons,</hi> the horses of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> nor <hi>Orelia Rodrigo</hi> the last unhappie King of the
Goths his Horse, in that Battell where hee lost his life and Kingdome together.</p>
                     <p>I hold a wager (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that since hee hath none of all these famous known
names, that his name neither is not <hi>Rozinante</hi> my Masters horses name, which goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all those that have been named already.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (quoth the bearded Countesse) notwithstanding hee hath a name that fits
him very well, which is <hi>Clavileno</hi> the swift: [Clavo <hi>a naile or wooden pinne;</hi> Leno
<hi>wood in Spanish:</hi>] first, because hee is of wood; and then, because of the pinne in his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54746:223"/>
fore-head: so that for his name, hee may compare with <hi>Rozinante.</hi> I dislike not his
name (said <hi>Sancho:</hi>) but what bridle, or what halter is hee governed with? I have told
(said the <hi>Trifaldi</hi>) that with the pinne, turned as pleaseth the party that rides on him;
hee will goe either in the aire, or raking and sweeping along the earth, or in a meane
which ought to be sought in all well-ordered actions. I would faine see him (quoth
<hi>Sancho</hi>) but to thinke that Ile get up on him, eyther in the saddle, or at the crupper,
were to aske Peares of the Elme. 'Twere good indeede, that I that can scarce sit upon
Dapple, and a pack-saddle as soft as silke, should get up upon a woodden crupper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Cushion or Pillow-beere: by Gad Ile not bruise my selfe to take away any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Beard; let every one shave himselfe as well as hee can, for Ile not goe so long a
Voyage with my Master: Besides, there is no use of mee for the shaving of these
Beards, as there is for the disinchanting my Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> Yes mary is there, said the
<hi>Trifaldi,</hi> and so much, that I beleeve, without you we shall doe nothing. God and the
King (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) [<hi>aqui del Roy; The usuall speech of Officers in Spayne, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
arested Person resists.</hi>] What have the Squires to doe with their Masters Adventures,
they must reape the credit of ending them, and wee must beare the burden? Body of
mee, if your Historians would say, Such a Knight ended such an Adventure, but with
the helpe of such and such a Spuire, without whom it had been impossible to end it,
'twere somthing; but that they write drylie, <hi>Don Parlalipomenon,</hi> Knight of the three
starres, ended the Adventure of the sixe Hob-goblins, without naming his Squires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that was present at all, as if hee were not alive, I like it not my Masters; I tell you
againe my Master may goe alone, much good may it doe him, and Ile stay here with
my Lady the Duchesse, and it may bee when hee comes back, he shall find the Lady
<hi>Dulcineaes</hi> business three-fold, nay five-fold bettered, for I purpose at idle times and
when I am at leisure to give my selfe a Bout of whipping, bare-breeched. For all that
(quoth the Duchesse) if need bee you must accompany him, honest <hi>Sancho,</hi> for all good
People will intreat, that for your unnecessary feare these Gentlewomens faces be not so
thick-bearded, for it were great pitty.</p>
                     <p>God and the King againe (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) when this charity were performed for
some retired Damozels, as some working Gyrles, a man might undertake any hazard;
but for to unbeard wayting-women, a pox: I would I might see um bearded from the
highest to the lowest, from the nicest to the neatest. You are still bitter against waiting-women
friend, quoth the Duchesse, you are much addicted to the <hi>Toledanian</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
opinion; but on my faith you have no reason, for I have women in my
House, that may bee a Patterne for Waiting-women, and here is <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi>
that will not contradict mee. Your Excellency (quoth <hi>Rodriguez</hi>) may say what you
will, God knowes all, whether wee bee Good or Bad; Bearded or Smoothe, as
wee are our Mothers brought us forth as well as other Women, and since God cast
us into the world, he knowes to what end; and I rely upon his mercy, and no bodies
beard.</p>
                     <p>Well Mistrisse <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> and Lady <hi>Trifaldi</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I hope to God he
will behold your sorrowes with pittying eyes, and <hi>Sancho</hi> shall doe as I will have
him, if <hi>Clavilenno</hi> were come once, and that I might encounter <hi>Malambruno;</hi>
for I know, no Rasor would shave you with more facilitie, then my Sword should
shave <hi>Malambrunoes</hi> head from his shoulders, for God permits the wicked, but not
for ever.</p>
                     <p>Ah (quoth the Afflicted) now all the starres of the heavenly Region looke upon
your Greatnesse, valorous Knight, with a gentle aspect, and infuse all prosperitie into
your minde, and all valour, and make you the shield and succour of all dejected and
reviled Waiting-woman-ship, abhominable to Apothecaries, backbited by Squires,
and scoffed at by Pages, and the Devill take the Queane that in the floure of her youth
put not her selfe in a Nunnery, rather then bee a waiting-woman, unfortunate as wee
are, for though wee descend in a direct line, by man to man from <hi>Hector</hi> the Trojan,
yet our Mistresses will never leave bethouing of us, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sure in my promises) send the matchlesse <hi>Clavileno</hi> unto us, that our misfortune may
have an end; for if the heats come in, and these beards of ours last, woe bee to our ill
fortune.</p>
                     <p>This the <hi>Trifaldi</hi> said with so much feeling, that she drew tears from all the spectators
eyes, and stroaked them even from <hi>Sancho's;</hi> so that now hee resolved to accompanie his
Master to the very end of the world, so he might obtain the taking the wooll from those
venerable faces.</p>

the famous horse should come, whose delay troubled <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
thinking that <hi>Malambruno</hi> deferring to send him, argued,
that either hee was not the Knight for whom the Adventure was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
or that <hi>Malambruno</hi> durst not come to single Combat with
him: But look yee now, when all unexpected, four Savages entred
the Garden, clad all in green Ivie, bearing upon their shouldiers a
great wooden horse: they set him upon his leggs on the ground; and one of them said,
Let him that hath the courage, get up upon this Engine.</p>
                     <p>Then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) not I, I have no courage, I am no Knight. And the Salvage
replyed, saying; And let his Squire ride behinde; and let him bee assured, that no sword
but <hi>Malambruno's</hi> shall offend him: And there is no more to bee done, but to turn
that pinn, which is upon the horses neck, and hee will carrie them in a moment where
<hi>Malambruno</hi> attends: But lest the height and distance from earth make them light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
let them cover their eyes till the horse neigh, a signe that they have then
finisht their voyage. This said, with a slow pace, they martched out the same way they
came.</p>
                     <p>The Afflicted, as soon as shee saw the horse, with very tears in her eyes, shee said to
<hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> Valourous Knight; <hi>Malambruno</hi> hath kept his word, the horse is here,
our beards increase, and each of us with every haire of them beseech thee to shave and
sheere us, since there is no more to bee done, but that thou and thy Squire both mount,
and begin this your happy new voyage. That will I willingly (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) my
Lady <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> without a cushion or spurs, that I may not delay time so much Lady, I
desire to see you and all these Gentlewomen smooth and cleer. Not I (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>)
neither willingly nor unwillingly; and if this shaving cannot bee performed without
my riding at the Crupper, let my master seek some other Squire to follow him, and these
Gentlewomen some other means of smoothing themselves; for I am no Hagg that
love to hurry in the Ayre: And what will my Islanders say, when they heare their
Governour is hovering in the winde? Besides, there being three thousand leagues from
hence to <hi>Candaya,</hi> if the horse should bee weary, or the Gyant offended, wee might bee
these half dozen of yeers e're we return; and then perhaps there would bee neither
Island nor dry-land in the world to acknowledge me: and since 'tis ordinarily said,
that delay breeds danger, and hee that will not when hee may, &amp;c. these Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
beards shall pardon me, for 'tis good sleeping in a whole skin; I mean, I am very
well at home in this house, where I receive so much kindenesse, and from whose Owner
I hope for so great a good, as to see my self a Governour.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth the Duke) Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Island that I promised you, is not
moveable nor fugitive, it is so deep rooted in the earth, that a great many pulls will not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54746:224"/>
root it up: and since you know, that I know there is none of these prime kinde of
Officers, that payes not some kinde of bribe, some more, some lesse, yours for this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
shall bee, that you accompanie your Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to end and finish
this memorable Adventure, that, whether you return on <hi>Clavileno</hi> with the brevity
that his speed promiseth, or that your contrary fortune bring and return you home on
foot like a Pilgrim from Inn to Inn, and from Ale-house to Ale-house; at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
back, you shall finde the Island where you left it, and the Islanders with the same
desire to receive you for their Governour that they have alwaies had, and my good will
shall alwaies bee the same; and doubt not Signior <hi>Sancho</hi> of this, for you should doe
much wrong (in so doing) to the desire I have to serve you.</p>
                     <p>No more Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I am a poor Squire, and cannot carry so much courtesie
upon my back: let my Master get up and blindefold me, and commend me to God
Almighty, and tell mee, if, when I mount into this high-flying, I may recommend my
self to God, or invoke the Angels that they may favour me.</p>
                     <p>To which the <hi>Trifaldi</hi> answered, You may recommend your self to God, or to
whom you will; for <hi>Malambruno,</hi> though hee bee an Enchanter, yet hee is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and performs his Enchantments with much sagacity, and very warily, without
medling with any body. Goe to then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) God and the holy Trinity of
<hi>Gaeta</hi> help me. Since the memorable Adventure of the Full-Mills (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
I never saw <hi>Sancho</hi> so fearfull as now; and if I were as superstitious as some,
his pusillanimity would tickle my conscience: but hark thee <hi>Sancho;</hi> by these Gentles
leaves, I will speak a word or two with thee: and carrying <hi>Sancho</hi> amongst some trees
in the Garden, taking him by both the hands, hee said, Thou seest, Brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> the
large voyage that wee are like to have, and God knows when wee shall return from it,
nor the leisure that our affaires hereafter will give us: I prethee therefore retire thy
self to thy Chamber, as if thou wentst to look for some necessary for the way, and give
thy self in a trice, of the three thousand and three hundred lashes, in which thou standest
engaged, but five hundred only; so that the beginning of a businesse is half the ending
of it.</p>
                     <p>Verily (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I think you have lost your wits, this is just: I am going, and
thou art crying out in haste for thy Mayden-head; I am now going to sit upon a bare
peece of wood, and you would have my bumm smart. Beleeve me, you have no reason;
let's now goe for the shaving these Matrons; and when wee return, I'le promise you to
come out of debt: let this content you, and I say no more. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made answer,
Well, with this promise <hi>Sancho</hi> I am in some comfort, and I beleeve thou wilt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
it; for though thou beest a fool,* yet I think thou art honest. [* <hi>Here I left out
a line or two of a dull conceit; so it was no great matter; for in English it could not bee
expressed.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>So now they went to mount <hi>Clavileno,</hi> and as they were getting up, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
said, Hud-wink thy self <hi>Sancho,</hi> and get up; for hee that sends from so farre off for
us, will not deceive us; for hee will get but small glory by it, and though all should
succeed contrary to my imagination, yet no malice can obscure the glory of having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
this Adventure. Let's goe Master (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for the beards and teares
of these Gentlewomen are nailed in my heart, and I shall not eat a bit to doe me
good, till I see them in their former smoothnesse. Get you up Sir, and hud-wink
your self first; for if I must ride behinde you, you must needs get up first in the
faddle.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and taking a hand-kerchief out of his pocket,
hee desired the Afflicted to hide his eyes close: and when it was done, hee uncovered
himself again, and said; As I remember, I have read in <hi>Virgill</hi> of the <hi>Palladium,</hi> that
horse of <hi>Troy,</hi> that was of wood, that the Grecians presented to the Goddesse <hi>Pallas,</hi>
with childe with armed Knights, which after were the totall ruine of all <hi>Troy;</hi> and so
it were sit first to try what <hi>Clavileno</hi> hath in his stomack.</p>
                     <p>You neede not (said shee) for I dare warrant you, and know that <hi>Malambruno</hi>
is neither traytor nor malicious, you may get up without any feare, and upon mee be it,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:225"/>
if you receive any hurt. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thought, that every thing thus spoken to
his safety, was a detriment of his valour: so, without more exchanging of words, up
hee got, and tried the pin that easily turned up and downe: so with his legs at length,
without stirrups, hee looked like an Image painted in a piece of <hi>Flanders Arras,</hi> or
woven in some <hi>Roman</hi> triumph. <hi>Sancho</hi> got up faire and softly, and with a very ill
will, and settling himselfe the best hee could upon the crupper, found it somewhat
hard, and nothing soft, and desired the Duke, that if it were possible, hee might have
a cushionet, or for failing, one of the Duchesses cushions of State, or a pillow from
one of the Pages beds; for that Horses crupper, hee sayd, was rather Marble then
Wood.</p>
                     <p>To this (quoth <hi>Trifaldi) Clavileno</hi> will suffer no kinde of furniture nor trapping
upon him: you may doe well for your ease, to sit on him woman-wayes, so you will not
feele his hardnesse so much. <hi>Sancho</hi> did so, and saying farewell, hee suffered himselfe
to bee bound about the eyes, and after uncovered himselfe againe, and looking pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
round about the Garden with teares in his eyes, hee desired that they would
in that dolefull trance joyne with him each in a <hi>Pater-noster,</hi> and an <hi>Ave Maria</hi> as
God might provide them some to doe them that charitable office when they should
bee in the like trance.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) Rascall, are you upon the Gallowes, trow? or
at the last gaspe, that you use these kinde of supplications? Art thou not, thou soule-lesse
cowardly creature, in the same place, where the faire <hi>Magalona</hi> sate, from whence
shee descended not to her grave, but to bee Queene of <hi>France,</hi> if Histories lye not?
and am not I by thee? cannot I compare with the valorous <hi>Pierrs,</hi> that pressed this
seat, that I now presse? Hudwinke, hudwinke thy selfe, thou dis-heartned Beast, and
let not thy feare come forth of thy mouth, at least in my presence. Hudwinke mee
(quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and since you will not have mee pray to God, nor recommend mee,
how can I chuse but bee afrayd, lest some legion of Devills bee here, that may carry us
headlong to destruction.</p>
                     <p>Now they were hudwinked, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiving that all was as it should
bee, layd hold on the pin, and scarce put his fingers to it, when all the Wayting-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and as many as were present, lifted up their voyces, saying; God bee thy speed,
Valorous Knight; God bee with thee, Vndaunted Squire: now, now you fly in the
aire, cutting it with more speede then an arrow: now you begin to suspend, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
as many as behold you from earth. Hold, hold, valorous <hi>Sancho;</hi> for now thou
goest waviug in the aire, take heede thou fall not; for thy fall will bee worse then the
bold Youths, that desired to governe his father, the Suns, charriot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> heard all this, and getting close to his Master, hee girt his armes about him,
and said; Sir why doe they say wee are so high, if wee can heare their voyces? and
me thinkes they talke here hard by us. Ne're stand upon that (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for
as these kindes of flyings are out of the ordinary course of thousa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ds of leagues, thou
mayst heare and see any thing, and doe not presse mee so hard, for thou wilt throw
mee downe: and verily, I know not why thou shouldest thus tremble and bee afrayd;
for I dare sweare, in all my life, I never rode upon an easier-paced horse, he goes as if
hee never mooved from the place: Friend, banish feare; for the businesse goes on
successefully, and wee have winde at will. Indeede 'tis true, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> for I
have a winde comes so forcibly on this side of mee, as if I were blowed upon by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
paire of bellowes: and it was true indeede, they were giving him aire, with a
very good paire of bellowes.</p>
                     <p>This Adventure was so well contrived by the Duke, the Duchesse, and the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that there was no requisite awanting, to make it perfect. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> too
feeling the breath, said: Vndoutedly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> wee are now come to the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
where Haile, Snow, Thunder and Lightning, and the Thunder-bolt are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in the third Region, and if wee mount long in this manner, wee shall quickly be in
the Region of fire, and I know not how to use this Pin, that wee mount not where
wee shall bee scorcht.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:54746:225"/>Now they heated their faces with flax set on fire, and easie to be quencht, in a Cave a
farre off: and <hi>Sancho,</hi> that felt the heate said<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Hang mee, if wee bee not now in that
place where the fire is; for a great part of my Beard is signed, I'le unblind-fold my self
Master, &amp; see where abouts we are. Doe not qd. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and remember that true
tale of the Scholler <hi>Toraina,</hi> whom the Devill hoysted up into the ayre a horse-back
on a Reede, with his eyes shut [<hi>A story beleeved in</hi> Spayne <hi>as Gospell,</hi>] and in twelve
houres he arived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and lighted at the Towre of <hi>Nona,</hi> which is one of the streets
of the City, and saw all the mis-chance, the assault and death of <hi>Borbon,</hi> and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
after returned back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> relating all hee had seene; and sayd; That
as hee went in the ayre, the Devill bid him open his eyes, which hee did, and saw himselfe
as hee thought so neere the body of the Moone, that hee might have touched her with
his hands, and that he durst not look toward the Earth, for fear to be made giddy. So that
<hi>Sancho,</hi> there is no uncovering us; for he that hath the charge of carrying us, will look to
us, and peradventure we goe doubling of points, and mounting on high to fall even with
the Kingdome of <hi>Candaya,</hi> as doth the Sacar or Hawke upon the Heron, to catch her,
mount she never so high; and though it seem to us not halfe an houre since we parted
from the Garden, beleeve me, we have travelled a great way.</p>
                     <p>I know not what belongs to it (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) but this I know, that if your Lady
<hi>Magallanes,</hi> or <hi>Magalona</hi> were pleased with my seat, she was not very tender breech'd.
All these discourses of the two most valiant were heard by the Duke and Duchesse, and
them in the Garden, which gave them extraordinary content; who willing to make an
end of this strange and well composed Adventure, clapt fire with some flax at <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno's</hi>
tayle; and straight, the horse being stuffed with Crackers, flew into the ayre,
making a strange noyse, and threw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> both on the ground, and
singed. And now all the bearded-Squadron of the Matrons vanished out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and <hi>Trifaldi</hi> too and all, and they that remained, counterfeited a dead swound,
and lay all along upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> ill-intreated, rose up, and looking round about, they
wondred to see themselves in the same Garden from whence they had parted, and to see
such a company of People laid upon the ground; and their admiration was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
when on one side of the Garden, they saw a great Launce fastned in the
ground, and a smoothe white peece of Parchment hanging at it, with two twisted
strings of greene silke, in which the following words were written with Letters
of Gold,</p>
                     <p>THE famous and valorous Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> finisht and ended
the Adventure of the Contesse <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> otherwise called, <hi>The Afflicted Matron,</hi> and
her Company, only with undertaking it,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Malambruno</hi> is satisfied and contented with all his heart, and now the Wayting-womens
chins are smoothe and cleane, and the Princes <hi>Don Clanixo</hi> and <hi>Aptonomasia</hi> are in their
pristine being, and when the Squires whipping shall bee accomplished, the white Pigeon shall
bee free from the pestiferous Ier-Falcons that persecute her, and in her loved Lullers armes:
for so it is ordained by the sage <hi>Merlin,</hi> proto-Enchanter of Enchanters.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>Quixote</hi> had read these Letters of the parchment, hee understood plainly
that they spoke of the disinchanting of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and giving many thanks to Heaven,
that with so little danger hee had ended so great an exploit, as reducing the faces of the
venerable Wayting-women to their former smoothnesse, that was now gone: he
went towards the Duke and the Duchesse, who were not as yet come to themselves;
and taking the Duke by the hand, hee said; Courage, courage, noble Sir, all's nothing,
the Adventure is now ended, without braking of barrs, as you may plainly see by the
writing there in that Register.</p>
                     <p>The Duke (like one that riseth out of a profound sleep) by little and little came to
himself, and in the same Tenor the Duchesse, and all they that were down in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
with such shews of marvell and wonderment, that they did even seem to perswade,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:226"/>
that those things had hapned to them in earnest, which they counterfeited in jest. The
Duke read the scrowle with his eyes half shut; and straight with open arme, hee went
to embrace <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> telling him, hee was the bravest Knight that ever was.
<hi>Sancho</hi> looked up and down for the Afflicted, to see what manner of face shee had, now
shee was dis-bearded, and if shee were so faire as her gallant presence made shew for:
But they told him, that as <hi>Clavileno</hi> came down burning in the aire, and lighted on
the ground, all the Squadron of Wayting-women with <hi>Trifaldi</hi> vanished, and now they
were shaved and unfeathered.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse asked <hi>Sancho,</hi> how hee did in that long voyage? To which hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
I, Madam, thought (as my Master told mee) wee passed by the Region of fire,
and I would have uncovered my self a little; but my Master (of whom I asked leave)
would not let mee: but I that have certaine curious itches, and a desire to know what
is forbidden mee, softly, without being perceived, drew up the Hankerchiffe that
blinded mee, a little above my nose, and there I saw the earth, and mee thoughts it was
no bigger then a graine of Mustard-seed, and the men that walked upon it, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bigger then Hazel-nuts that you may see how high wee were then. To this (said
the Duchesse) Take heede, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> what you say; for it seemes you saw not
the earth, but the men that walked on it: for it is plaine, that if the earth shewed no
bigger then a graine of Mustard-seede, and every man like a Hazel-nut, one man alone
would cover the whole earth.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeede (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) but I looked on one side of it, and saw it all.
Looke you, <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Duchesse) one cannot see all of a thing by one side.
I cannot tell what belongs to your seeing, Madam (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) but you must
thinke, that since wee flew by Enchantment; by Enchantment, I might see the whole
earth and all the men, which way soever I looked: and if you beleeve not this, neither
will you beleeve, that uncovering my selfe about my eye-browes, I saw my self so neer
heaven, that betwixt it and mee there was not a handfull and a halfe; and I dare swear
Madam, that 'tis a huge thing: and it happend that wee went that way where the seven
Shee-goat-starrs were; and in my soul and conscience, I having been a Goat-heard in
my youth, as soon as I saw them, I had a great desire to passe some time with them;
which had I not done, I thought I should have burst. Well, I come then, and I take;
What doe I doe? without giving notice to any body? no, not to my Master himself:
fair and softly I lighted from <hi>Clavileno,</hi> and played with the Goats that were like white
Violets, and such pretty flowers, some three quarters of an houre, and <hi>Clavileno</hi> moved
not a whit all this while.</p>
                     <p>And while <hi>Sancho</hi> was playing with the Goats all this while, quoth the Duke, What
did Signior <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> To which, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as all these things are quite
out of their naturall course, 'tis not much that <hi>Sancho</hi> hath said: only for me I say, I
neither perceived my self higher or lower; neither saw I Heaven or Earth, or Seas or
Sands: True it is, that I perceived I passed thorow the middle Region, and came to
the fire: But to think wee passed from thence, I cannot beleeve it; for the Region
of Fire being between the Moon and Heaven, and the latter Region of the Aire,
wee could not come to Heaven, where the seven Goats are, that <hi>Sancho</hi> talks
of, without burning our selves; which since wee did not, either <hi>Sancho</hi> lies or
dreams.</p>
                     <p>I neither lie nor dream, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for ask me the signes of those Goats, and
by them you shall see whether I tell true or no. Tell them <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Duchesse.
Two of them, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> are green, two blood-red, two blew, and one mixt-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured.
Here's a new kinde of Goats, quoth the Duke: in our Region of the earth
wee have no such coloured ones. Oh, you may bee sure, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between those and these. Tell me <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Duke, did you see amongst
those Shees any Hee-Goat? [<hi>An equivocall question; for in</hi> Spain <hi>they use to call Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolds,</hi>
Cabrones, <hi>hee-Goats.</hi>] No Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I heard say, that none passed the
hornes of the Moon.</p>
                     <p>They would ask him no more touching his voyage; for it seemed to them, that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54746:226"/>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> had a clew to carry him all Heaven over, and to tell all that passed there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stirring out of the Garden. In conclusion this was the end of the Adventure of the
Afflicted Matron that gave occasion of mirth to the Dukes, not only for the present,
but for their whole life time, and to <hi>Sancho</hi> to recount for many ages, if hee might live
so long. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> whispering <hi>Sancho</hi> in the eare, told him; <hi>Sancho,</hi> since you
will have us beleeve all that you have seen in Heaven, I pray beleeve all that I saw in
<hi>Montesinos</hi> Cave, and I say no more.</p>

the Adventure of <hi>The Afflicted,</hi> that they determined to goe on
with their jests, seeing the fit subject they had, to make them passe
for earnest; so having contrived and given order to their servants
and vassals, that they should obey <hi>Sancho</hi> in his Government of
the promised Island; the next day after the jest of <hi>Clavileno's</hi>
flight, the Duke bade <hi>Sancho</hi> prepare, and put himself in order
to goe to bee Governour; for that now his Islanders did as much
desire him, as showres in May.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> made an obeysance to him, and said; Since I came down from Heaven, and
since from on high I beheld the earth, and saw it so small, I was partly cooled in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to bee a Governour; for what greatnesse can there bee to command in a grain of
Mustard-seed? or what dignitie or power to govern half a dozen of men about the
bignesse of Hazel-nuts? for to my thinking, there were no more in all the earth. If it
would please your Lordship to give me never so little in Heaven, though 'twere but
half a league, I would take it more willingly then the biggest Island in the world. Look
you friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Duke) I can give no part of Heaven to any body, though
it bee no bigger then my naile; for these favors and graces are only in Gods disposing.
What is in my power I give you, that is, an Island, right and straight, round and well
proportioned, and extraordinary fertill and aboundant, where, if you have the Art, you
may with the riches of the earth, hoord up the treasure of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Well then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) give us this Island, and in spight of Rascalls I'le goe to
Heaven; and yet for no covetousnesse to leave my poor Cottage, or to get me into
any Palaces, but for the desire I have, to know what kinde of thing it is bee a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>If once you prove it <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Duke) you will bee in love with Governing;
so sweet a thing it is to command, and to bee obeyed: I warrant, when your Master
comes to bee an Emperour, for without doubt hee will bee one (according as his affairs
goe on) that hee will not bee drawn from it, and it will grieve him to the soul to have
been so long otherwise.</p>
                     <p>Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I suppose 'tis good to command, though it bee but a head of
Cattell.</p>
                     <p>Let me live and die with thee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Duke) for thou knowest all, and I
hope thou wilt bee such a Governour as thy discretion promiseth, and let this suffice;
&amp; note, that to morrow about this time thou shalt go to the Government of thy Island,
and this afternoon thou shallt bee fitted with convenient apparell to carry with thee,
and all things necessary for thy departure.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:227"/>Clad mee (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) how you will, for howsoever ye clad mee, I'le bee still

                     </p>
                     <p>You are in the right (quoth the Duke) but the Robes must bee suteable to the
Office or digitie which is professed; for it were not fit that a Lawyer should bee clad
like a Souldier, or a Souldier like a Priest. You <hi>Sancho,</hi> shall bee clad, partly like a
Lawyer, and partly like a Captaine; for in the Island that I give you, Armes are as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
as Learning.</p>
                     <p>I have little learning quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for as yet I scarce know my A. B. C. but 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that I have my Christs Crosse ready in my memory to be a good Governor. I'le
manage my weapon till I fall again, &amp; God help me. With so good a memory quoth the
Duke, <hi>Sancho</hi> cannot doe amisse.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came, and knowing what passed, and that <hi>Sancho</hi> was so
speedily to goe to his Government, with the Dukes leave, he took him by the hand, and
carried him aside, with a purpose to advise him how he should behave himself in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
When they came into <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> chamber, the doore being shut he forced <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
as it were, to sit down by him, and with a stayed voice said:</p>
                     <p>I give infinite thanks friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that before I have received any good fortune,
thou hast met with thine; I that thought to have rewarded thy service with some good
luck of mine to have saved that labour, and thou sodainly past all expectation hast thy
desires accomplished, others bribe, importune, sollicite, rise early, intreat, grow obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and obtain not what they sue for; and another comes hab-nab, and goes away
with the place or Office that many others sought for, and here the Proverb comes in
and joynes well; that Give a man luck and cast him into the Sea. Thou, that in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
art a very Goose, without early rysing, or late siting up, without any labor, only
the breath of Knight Errantry breathing on thee, without any more adoe art Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of an Island, a matter of nothing: All this I say, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that thou attribute
not this happinesse to thy Deserts, but that thou give God thankes, that sweetely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
things: Next, thou shalt impute them to the greatenesse of the profession of
Knight Errantry: (Thy heart then disposed to beleeve what I have said) bee attentive,
Oh my sonne, to this thy <hi>Cato,</hi> that will advise thee, bee thy North-starre, and guide
to direct and bring thee to a safe Port, out of this troublesome Sea where thou goest to
ingulfe thy selfe; for your Offices and great charges are nothing else but a profound
gulfe of confusions.</p>
                     <p>First of all, O son, thou must feare God, for to fear him is wisdom, and being wise,
thou canst erre in nothing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, thou must consider who thou art, and know thy self, which is the hardest
kinde of knowledge that may bee imagined: From this knowledge thou shalt learne
not to be swolne like the frogge that would equall himselfe with the Oxe, for if thou
doe this, thou shalt (falling downe the wheele of thy madnesse) come to know thou
wert but a hog-keeper.</p>
                     <p>That's true (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) but 'twas when I was a Boy; but after, when I grew
to bee somewhat manish, I kept Geese, and not Hogges; but this mee thinks is
nothing to the purpose, for all they that Governe come not from the Loynes of
Kings.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) therefore these that have no noble beginnings, must
mixe the gravitie of their Charge they exercise, with milde sweetenesse, which guided
with wisdome, may free them from malicious murmuring, from which no state or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is free.</p>
                     <p>Rejoyce, oh <hi>Sancho,</hi> in the humility of thy linage, and scorne not to say, thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
of labouring men, for when thou art not ashamed thy selfe, no body will seeke to
make thee so, and alwaies strive to be held meane and virtuous, rather then proud and
vicious; an infinite number from low beginnings have come to great risings, as Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
and Imperiall Dignities; and to confirm this, I could bring thee so many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as should weary thee.</p>
                     <p>Note, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that if you follow virtue for your meane, and strive to doe virtuous
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54746:227"/>
deeds, you need not envie those that are borne of Princes and great men; for Blood is
inherited, but Virtue is atchieved; Virtue is of worth by it self alone, so is not Birth.</p>
                     <p>Which being so, if perchance any of thy Kindred come to see thee when thou art in
thy Island, refuse him not, nor affront him; but entertain, welcome, and make much of
him, for with this God will bee pleased, that would have no body despise his making,
and thou shalt also in this correspond to good nature.</p>
                     <p>If thou bring thy Wife with thee (for it were not fit that those who are to govern
long, should bee without them) teach her, instruct her, refine her naturall rudenesse;
for many times all that a discreet Governour gets, a clownish woman spills and
loses.</p>
                     <p>If thou chance to bee a Widdower (a thing that may happen) and desire to marry
again, take not such a one as may serve thee for a bait and Fishing-rod to take bribes:
for let me tell thee, the Husband must give an account of all that (being a Judge) his
Wife receives, and at the generall Resurrection, shall pay fourfold what hee hath been
accused for in his life time.</p>
                     <p>Never pronounce judgement rash or willfully, which is very frequent with ignorant
Judges, that presume to bee skillfull.</p>
                     <p>Let the tears of the poor finde more compassion (but not more Justice) then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the rich.</p>
                     <p>Seek as well to discover the truth from out the promises and corruptions of the rich,
as the sobs and importunities of the poor.</p>
                     <p>When equity is to take place, lay not all the rigour of the law upon the Delinquent;
for the fame of the rigorous judge is not better then of the compassionate.</p>
                     <p>If thou slacken Justice, let it not bee with the weight of a bribe, but with the weight of
pitty.</p>
                     <p>When thou happenest to judge thine enemies case, forget thy injury, and respect
equity.</p>
                     <p>Let not proper passion blinde thee in another mans Cause; for the errors thou shalt
commit in that, most commonly are incurable, or if they be helped, it must be with thy
wealth and credit.</p>
                     <p>If any fair woman come to demand Justice of thee, turn thy eyes from her teares, and
thy ears from her lamentations, and consider at leisure the sum of her requests, except
thou mean that thy reason be drowned in her weeping, and thy goodnesse in her sighs.</p>
                     <p>Him that thou must punish with Deeds, revile not with Words; since to a
Wretch the punishment is sufficient, without adding ill language: [<hi>A good Item to our
Iudges of the Common-Law.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>For the Delinquent that is under thy jurisdiction, consider that the miserable man is
subject to the temptations of our depraved nature, and as much as thou canst, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grievance to the contrary party: shew thy self milde and gentle; for although
Gods attributes are equall, yet to our sight his mercy is more precious and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
then his Justice.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou follow these Rules and Precepts, thy dayes shall bee long, thy fame
eternall, thy rewards full, thy happinesse indelible, thou shalt marry thy Children how
thou wilt, thy shall have titles, and thy grand-children, thou shalt live in peace and
love of all men; and when thy life is ending, death shall take thee in a mature old age,
and thy Nephews shall close thy eyes with their tender and delicate hands.</p>
                     <p>Those I have told thee hitherto, are documents, concerning thy soul to adorn it;
hearken now to those that must serve for the adorning thy body.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the second advice that Don-Quixote gave Sancho Pança.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho could have heard this discourse, and not held <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> for a
most wise Personage, and most honest? But as it hath been often
told in the progresse of this large History, hee was only besotted,
when hee touched upon his Chivalry, and in the rest of his talk he
shewed a cleer and current apprehension: so that every foot his
works bewrayed his judgement, and his judgement his works: But
in these second documents hee g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve now to <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee shew'd a
great deal of lenity, and ballanced his judgement and his madnesse in an equall scale.
<hi>Sancho</hi> hearkened most attentively unto him, and strove to bear in minde his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as thinking to observe them, and by them to bee very well delivered of his big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swoln
Government. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> proceeded, saying:</p>
                     <p>Touching the governing thine owne Person and Houshold <hi>Sancho,</hi> the first thing I
enjoyn thee to, is, to bee cleanly, and to paire thy Nailes, not letting them grow as some
doe, whose ignorance hath made them think 'tis a fine thing to have long Nails, as if that
excrement and superfluity that they let grow, weare only their Nailes, rather the claws
of a Lizard-bearing Castrell, and a foule abuse it is.</p>
                     <p>Goe not ungirt or loose, for a slovenly Garment is the signe of a carelesse minde, if
so bee this kinde of slovenly loosenesse bee not to some cunning end, as it was judged to
bee in <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Consider with discreetion what thy Government may bee worth, and if it will afford
thee to bestow Liveries on thy Servants, give them decent and profitable ones, rather
then gawdie or sightly, and so give thy cloth amongst thy Servants and the poor; I
mean, that if thou have six Pages, give three of them Liveries, and three to the poor; so
shalt thou have Pages in earth, and in Heaven: and your vain-glorious have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to this kinde of giving liveries.</p>
                     <p>Eat not Garlick or Onions, that thy Pesantry may not be known by thy breath:
walk softly, and speak stayedly; but not so as if it appeared thou hearkenedst to thy self,
for all kinde of affectation is naught.</p>
                     <p>Eat little at dinner, but lesse at supper; for the health of the whole body is forged in
the forge of the stomack.</p>
                     <p>Be temperate in drinking; considering that too much Wine neither keeps secreet nor
fulfills promise.</p>
                     <p>Take heed <hi>Sancho</hi> of chewing on both sides, or to ruct before any body.</p>
                     <p>I understand not your ructing (quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi>) To ruct (quoth hee) is as much as
to belch; and this is one of the fowlest words our language hath, though it be very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant;
so your more neat people have goten the Latine word, and call belching ructing,
and belchers ructers: and though some perhaps understand not this; 'tis no great
matter, for use and custome will introduce them that they may easily bee understood,
and the power that the vulgar and custome hath, is the enriching of a language.</p>
                     <p>Truly, (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) one of your advices that I mean to remember, shall bee not to
belch, for I am used to doe it often. Ruct <hi>Sancho,</hi> not belch (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>)
Ruct I will say (quoth hee) hence forward, and not forget it.</p>
                     <p>Likewise <hi>Sancho,</hi> you must not intermixe your discourse with that multiplicity of
Proverbs you use; for though Proverbs bee witty short sentences, yet thou bringest
them in so by head and shoulders, that they are rather absurdities then sentences. This
(quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) God Almighty can only help; for I have more Proverbs then a Book
will hold, and when I speak, they come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strive one with another, who shall come out first: but my tongue casts out the first it

meets withall, though they bee nothing to the purpose, but I will have a care hereafter
to speak none but shall bee fitting to the gravity of my place; for where there is plenty,
the Guests are not empty; and hee that works, doth not care for play; and hee is in
safety that stands under the Bels; And h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s judgements rare, that can spend and spare.</p>
                     <p>Now, now (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) glue, thred, fasten thy Proverbs together, no body
comes; the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>thou art told a thing, the more thou dost it: I bid thee leave thy
Proverbs, and in an instant thou hast cast out a Letany of them, that are as much to the
purpose, as, To morrow I found a horse-shooe. Look thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> I finde not fault
with a Proverb brought in to some purpose; but to load and heap on Proverbs hudling
together, makes a discourse wearisome and base.</p>
                     <p>When thou ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st on horse-back, doe not goe casting thy body all upon the crupper,
nor carry thy leggs stiff down, and stradling from the horses belly, nor yet so loosly, as
if thou wert still riding on thy Dapple, for your horse-riding makes some appear Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
others Grooms.</p>
                     <p>Let thy sleep bee moderate; for hee that riseth not with the Sun, loseth the day:
And observe <hi>Sancho,</hi> That diligence is the Mother of good Fortune; and sloth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
that never could satisfie a good desire.</p>
                     <p>This last advice that I mean to give thee, though it bee not to the adorning of thy
body, yet I would have thee bear it in thy memory; for I beleeve it will bee of no lesse
use to thee, then those that I have hitherto given thee, and it is,</p>
                     <p>That thou never dispute of Linages, comparing them together, since of necessity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those that are compared, one must bee the better; and of him thou debasest,
thou shalt bee abhorred; and of him thou ennoblest, not a whit rewarded.</p>
                     <p>Let thy apparrell bee a painted Hose, and Stocking, a long-skirted Jacket, and a Cloke
of the longest; but long Hose by no means, for they become neither Gentlemen nor
Governours.</p>
                     <p>This is all <hi>Sancho,</hi> I will advise thee to for the present; as the time and occasion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

serve hereafter, so shall my instructions bee, so that thou bee carefull to let me know
how thou dost.</p>
                     <p>Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I see well that you have told me nothing but what is good, holy,
and profitable: but to what purpose, if I remember nothing? True it is, that of not
letting my nails grow, and to marry again if need bee, I shall not forget; but your
other slabb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r-sawces, your tricks and quillets, I cannot remember them, nor shall not,
no more then last yeers clouds: therefore I pray let me have them in writing; for
though I can neither write nor read, Ile give them to my Confessor, that hee may frame
them into me, and make me capable of them at time of need.</p>
                     <p>Wreth that I am (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) how ill it appears in a Governour, not to
write or read! for know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that for a man not to read, or to bee left-handed,
argues that either hee was a sonne of mean Parents, or so unhappie and untowardly
that no good would prevaile on him.</p>
                     <p>I can set to my name (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for when I was Constable of our Town, I learnt
to make certain Letters, such as are set to mark trusses of stuff, which they said spelt my
name: Besides, now Ile feign that my right hand is maimed, and so another shall firm
for me; for there's a remedy for every thing but death: and since I beare sway, I'le
doe what I list: for according to the Proverb, He that hath the Judge to his Father, &amp;c.
[<hi>a troop of absurd speeches still to</hi> Sancho's <hi>part:</hi>] and I am a Governour, which is more
then Judge. I, I, let um come and play at bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>-peep, let um back-bite me, let um come
for wooll, and I'le send them back shorne; whom God loves, his house is savory to
him; and every man bears with the rich mans follies; so I being rich, and a Governour,
and liberall too, as I mean to bee, I will bee without all faults. No, no, pray bee dainty,
and see what will become on't; have much, and thou shalt bee esteemed much, quoth a
Grandame of mine; And might overcomes right.</p>
                     <p>Oh, a plague on thee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) threescore thousand Sata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s take
thee and thy Proverbs; this houre thou hast been stringing them one upon another,
and giving me tormenting potions with each of them: I assure thee that one of these
<pb facs="tcp:54746:229"/>
dayes these Proverbs will carry thee to the Gallows; for them thy Vassalls will bereave
thee of thy Government, or there will bee a community amongst them. Tell me igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
where doest thou finde them all? Or how doest thou apply them, Ninny-ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
for, for me to speake one and appply it well, it makes me sweat and labour as if I
had digged.</p>
                     <p>Assuredly, Master mine, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> a small matter makes you angry: why the
Devill doe you pine that I make use of my owne goods? for I have no other, nor any
other stocke but Proverbs upon Proverbs: and now I have foure that fall out jump
to the purpose, like Peares for a working Basket: but I will say nothing, for now <hi>Sancho</hi>
shall bee called, Silence. Rather babling, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> or obstinacy it selfe;
yet I would faine know what four Proverbs they bee that came into thy minde, so to
the purpose; for I can think upon none, yet I have a good memory.</p>
                     <p>What better (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) then meddle not with a hollow tooth: And, Go from
my house, What will you have with my wife? Theres no answering, and, If the pot
fall upon the stone, or the stone on the pot, ill for the pot, ill for the stone; all which
are much to the purpose. That no body meddle with their Governour, nor with their
Superiour, lest they have the worst, as hee that puts his hand to his teeth (so they bee
not hollow, 'tis no matter if they bee teeth) Whatsoever the Governour saies, there
is no replying, as in saying. Get you from my house, and, What will you have of my
wife? and that of the pot and the stone, a blinde man may perceive it: so that hee
that sees the moate in another mans eye, let him see the beame in his owne, that it may
not bee said by him, The dead was afraid of her that was flayd. And you know,
Sir, that the foole knowes more in his owne house, then the wise man doth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers.</p>
                     <p>Not so, <hi>Sancho,</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) for the foole, neyther in his owne house
nor anothers, knowes ought, by reason that no wise edifice is seated upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of his folly: and let us leave this, <hi>Sancho</hi> for if thou governe ill, thou must bear
the fault, and mine must bee the shame; but it comforts mee that I have done my duty
in advising thee truly, and as discreetly as I could, and with this I have accomplisht
with my obligation, and God speed thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> and governe thee in thy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bring mee out of the scruple I am in, that thou wilt turne thy Government
with the heeles upwards, which I might prevent, by letting the Duke know thee better,
and telling him that all that fatnesse, and little corps of thine, is nothing but a sack of
Proverbs and knavery.</p>
                     <p>Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) if you thinke I am not fit for this Government, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
I lose it: I had rather have a poore little scrap of the naile of my soule, then
my whole body: and I can as well keepe my selfe with, pliane <hi>Sancho,</hi> a Loafe and an
Onyon, as a Governour with Capons and Patridges: and whilst wee are asleepe, all
are alike: great and small, poore and rich: and if you consider on't, you shall finde,
that you onely put mee into this veine of governing: for I know no more what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to governing of Islands then a Vulture, and rather, then in being a Governour,
the Divell shall fetch my soule; I had rather bee <hi>Sancho,</hi> and goe to heaven, then a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and go to hell. Truely, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for these last words
thou hast spoken, I deeme thee worthy to govern a thousand Islands: thou hast a good
naturall capacitie, without which no science is worth ought; serve God, and erre not
in thy maine intentions, I meane thou alwayes have a firme purpose and intent, to bee
sure in all businesses that shall occurre, because Heaven alwayes favours good desires,

                     <head type="sub">How Sancho Pança was carried to his Government, and of the
strange Adventure that befell Don-Quixote in the Castle.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is said, that in the originall of this History, it is read, that when <hi>Cid
Hamete</hi> came to write this Chapter, the Interpreter translated it
not as hee had written it, which was a kinde of complaint of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that hee undertook so dry and barren a story, as this of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
because it seemed that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were
the sole-speakers, and that hee durst not enlarge himselfe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
digressions, or graver accidents and more delightfull: and hee
said, That to have his invention, his hand and his quill, tyed to one sole subject, and
to speake by the mouthes of few, was a most insupportable labor, and of no benefit to
the Author: so that to avoyd this inconvenience, in the first part hee used the Art of
Novels, as one, of <hi>The Curious Impertinent,</hi> another of <hi>The captiv'd Captaine,</hi> which are
(as it were) separated from the History, though the rest that are there recounted, are
matters happened to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> which could not but bee set downe: hee was
of opinion likewise, as hee said, that many being carried away with attention to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
exployts, would not heed his Novels, and skip them, either for hast or irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse,
without noting the cunning worke-manship, and framing of them, which
would bee plainely shewn, if they might come to light by themselves alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> madnesse, or <hi>Sancho's</hi> simplicities; therefore in this second part,
hee would not engraffe loose Novels, or adjoyning to the Story, but certaine accidents
that might bee like unto them, sprung from the passages that the truth it selfe offers,
and these too sparingly, and with words only proper to declare them: and since, hee
is shut up and contained in the limits of this narration, having understanding, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
and ability to treat of all, his request is, that his labour bee not contemned, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that hee bee commended, not for what hee writes, but for what hee hath omitted
to write: so hee goes on with his History, saying;</p>
                     <p>That when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had dined, the same day that hee gave <hi>Sancho</hi> his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in the after-noone hee let him have them in writing, that hee might seeke some
body to read them to him: but as soone as ever hee had given him them, hee lost them,
and they came to the Dukes hands, who shewed them to the Duchesse; and both of
them afresh admired at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> madnesse, and his understanding together: and
so going forward with their jests, that afternoone they sent <hi>Sancho</hi> well accompanied
to the place, that to him seemed an Island.</p>
                     <p>It fell out then that the charge of this businesse was laid upon a Steward of the
Dukes, a good wise fellow, and very conceited; for there can bee no wit that is not
governed with discretion; hee it was that playd the Countesse <hi>Trifaldi's</hi> part, with the
cunning that hath beene related, with this and with his Masters instructions how hee
should behave himselfe towards <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee performed his taske marvellously. I say
then, that it hapned, that as <hi>Sancho</hi> saw the Steward, the very face of <hi>Trifaldi</hi> came into
his minde, and turning to his Master, hee said: Sir, the Devill beare mee from hence
just as I beleeve, if you doe not confesse, that this Steward of the Dukes here present,
hath the very countenance of the Afflicted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> earnestly beheld the Steward, and having thorowly seene him, said
to <hi>Sancho:</hi> There is no need of the Devils taking thee just as thou beleevest (for I know
not what thou meanest) for the Afflicteds face is just the same that the Stewards is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
but for all that, the Steward is not the afflicted: for to bee so, were a minifest contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and now 'tis no time to sift out these things, which were to enter into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
<pb facs="tcp:54746:230"/>
Labyrinth: beleeve mee, Friend; 'twere fit to pray to God very earnestly, to
deliver us from these damned Witches and Enchanters. 'Tis no jesting matter, quoth
<hi>Sancho,</hi> for I heard him speake before, and mee thought the very voice of <hi>Trifaldi</hi> soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in my eares.</p>
                     <p>Well, I will bee silent: but yet I will see henceforward, if I can discover any signe
to confirme or forgoe my jealousie. You may doe so, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
and you shall give mee notice of all that in this businesse you can discover, and of all
that shall befall you in your Government.</p>

                        <hi>Sancho</hi> in conclusion departed with a great troope, clad like a Lawyer, and upon his
backe hee had a goodly tawny riding Coat of watred Chamlet, and a Hunters Cap of

with trappings and Also-like ornaments all of silk: <hi>Sancho</hi> turned his head now and then
to looke upon his Asse, with whose company hee was so well pleased, that hee would
not have changed to have beene Emperour of <hi>Germany.</hi> At parting hee kissed the
Dukes hands, and received his Masters benediction, who gave it him with teares, and
<hi>Sancho</hi> received it with blubberings.</p>
                     <p>Now Reader let honest <hi>Sancho</hi> part in peace and in good time, and expect two
bushels of laughter, which his demeanor in his Government will minister to thee: and
in the mean time, mark what befell his Master that very night: for if it make thee not
laugh outright, yet it will cause thee shew thy teeth, and grin like an Ape: for <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xotes</hi>
affairs must either bee solemnized with admiration or laughter.</p>
                     <p>'Tis said then, that <hi>Sancho</hi> was scarce departed, when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> resented his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse,
and if it had been possible for him to have revoked his Commission or taken
away his Government, hee would have done it.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse knew his Melancholy, and asked him why hee was so sad: for if it
were for <hi>Sancho's</hi> absence, shee had Squires, and Waiting-women, and Damzells in hee
house that would doe him all service.</p>
                     <p>True it is Madam (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that I resent <hi>Sancho's</hi> absence: but that is
not the principall cause that makes me appear sad: And of those many kindenesses
that your Excellency offers me, I only accept and make choyse of the good will with
which they are offered; and for the rest, I humbly beseech your Excellency that you
give me leave in my Chamber to serve my self.</p>
                     <p>Truly Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (quoth the Duchesse) it must not bee so; for four of my
Damzells shall wait upon you, as fair as flowres. They shall bee no flowres to mee
(quoth hee) but very thrones that prick my soul. They shall fly as soon as enter into
my Chamber, or come neer mee. If your Greatnesse will continue in your favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, let this bee one; That I may serve my self within mine own doors, that I
may put a wall in midst of my desires and honesty; and I will not forgoe this custome
for all the liberality that your Highnesse will shew unto me. To conclude, I will rather
sleep in my clothes, then yeeld that any body shall help to undresse me.</p>
                     <p>Enough, enough, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (quoth the Duchesse) for my part, He give
order that not so much as a Flye shall come within your distance, much lesse a Damzel:
I am none of those that would make Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> transcend his decency; for
as I have a kinde of glimmerring, one of Signior <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> most eminent virtues is
his honestie. Undresse your self, and goe to bed alone, after your own fashion how
you will, and no body shall hinder you, and in your Chamber you shall have all things
necessary, and lock your door to you; your vessels shall bee ready, that no naturall cause
make you rise to open it.</p>
                     <p>Long live the Grand <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> and her name farre extended upon the
Globe of the Earth, since she deserved to be beloved of so honest and valiant a Knight;
and the gracious Heavens infuse into <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

finish the disciplining of himself quickly, that the world may re-enjoy the beauty of so
great a Lady.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) your Highnesse hath spoken like your self; for no ill

thing can proceed from the mouth of so good a Lady, and <hi>Dulcinea</hi> shall bee the more
happie, and more esteemed in the world, in that your Greatnesse hath praised her, then
if shee had had the praises of the best Rhetoricians in the world.</p>
                     <p>Well: goe too, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (quoth the Duchesse) 'tis now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time, and the Duke expects us; come Sir, let us sup and to bed betimes: For
your voyage yesterday from <hi>Candaya,</hi> was not so short, but it hath left some weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in you.</p>
                     <p>None at all, Lady quoth he, for I may sweare to your Excellency, that in my life time
I never rode upou a gentler nor better-paced Beast then <hi>Clavileno;</hi> and I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why <hi>Malambruno</hi> should lose so swift and so gentle a horse, and so burne him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more adoe.</p>
                     <p>You may imagine quoth she, that he repenting him of the hurt he had done <hi>Trifaldi</hi>
and her company, and many others; and of the wickednesse, that as a Witch and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter
he had committed, would destroy the instruments of his Office, and so burnt
<hi>Clavileno</hi> as the chiefest of them; and that which did most disquiet him, roving up and
down; and so with his burnt ashes, and the trophy of the scrole, <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> valour
is eternized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> againe gave fresh thanks to the Duchesse: and when he had supt, hee
retyred to his Chamber alone, without permitting any body to serve him, hee was so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to meet with occasions that might induce him to forget the honest decorum due to
his Lady <hi>Dulcinea, Amadis</hi> his goodness being alwaies in his imagination, the flowre and
Looking-glasse of Knights Errant.</p>
                     <p>The dore he shut after him, and undressed himselfe by the light of two waxe-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
as hee pulled off his stockins (Oh ill luck unworthy such a Personage) there
broke from him, not sighs or any such thing that might discredit his cleanly neatnesse,
but some foure and twenty stitches and a halfe, that made his stockins looke like a Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice-window:
The good Knight was extremely afflicted, and would have given for a
dram of greene silke, an ounce of silver: greene-silke, I say, for his stockins were
greene: and here <hi>Benengeli</hi> exclamed saying; Oh povertie, povertie, I know not
what moved that famous <hi>Cordovan</hi> Poet, to call thee holy thankless gift. For I that
am a Moore, know very well by the communication I have had with Christians, that
holinesse consists in Charitie, Humilitie, Faith, Obedience and Povertie: But yet a

thou, second povertie (of that kinde that I mean) why do'st thou mixe thy self with
Gentlemen, and those that bee well borne? Why doest thou make them cobble their
shooes; and that the buttons of their Jerkins bee some silk, others haire, others Glasse?
Why must their Ruffs for the most part bee unset Lettice wayes, and not set with the

Ruffs.) Hee proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him a pair of Boots which hee thought to put on the next day. Finally, to Bed he went
heavy and pensative, as well for want of <hi>Sancho's</hi> company, as for the irreparable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of his Stocking, whose stitches hee would have taken up, though it had been
with silk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signes of misery that may befall
a Gentleman in the progres of his prolixe necessitie. He put out the lights; 'twas hot, and
he could not sleep; so he rose from his Bed, and opened a little the lid of an Iron win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
that looked toward a faire Garden; and opening it, hee perceived and heard peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:54746:231"/>
stirring and talking in the Garden; they below raised their voyces, insomuch that
these speeches might bee heard.</p>
                     <p>Bee not so earnest with me, O <hi>Emerencia,</hi> to have mee sing; for thou knowest that
ever since this stranger hath been in the Castle, and that mine eyes beheld him, I cannot
sing but weep; besides my Ladies sleep is rather short then sound; and I would not
that she should know we were here for all the goods in the world; &amp; though she should
sleep, and not wake, my singing yet were in vain, if this new <hi>Aeneas</hi> sleep, and wake not
to give eare to it, this that is come into my kingdome to leave me scorned &amp; forsaken.</p>
                     <p>Think not of that, friend <hi>Altisidora</hi> (said they) for doubtlesse the Duchesse and every
body else in the house is asleep, except the Master of thy heart, and thy souls alarum;
for now I heard him open his window, and hee is certainly awake: sing poor grieved
Wretch, in a low and sweet tune, to the sound of thy Harp; and if the Duchesse should
perceive it: our excuse shall bee, that wee are here by reason 'tis so hot within doors.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not for our being here, O <hi>Emerencia,</hi> quoth <hi>Altisidora!</hi> but that I am not
willing my Song should discover my heart; and that I should bee held by those that
have no notice of the powerfull force of love, for a longing and light huswife: but
come what will on it, better shame in the face then a spot in the heart: and with this
shee heard a Harp most sweetly plaid on. Which when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> heard, it amazed
him; and in the instant an infinite number of Adventures came into his minde, of
Windows, Grates, Gardens, Musick, Courting, and Fopperies, that hee had read in
his sottish Books of Knighthood; and straight hee imagined that some Damzell of the
Duchesses was enamored on him, and that her honesty enforced her to conceal her
affection, hee was afraid lest hee should yeeld, but firmly purposed not to bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished;
so recommending himself, heart and soul, to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi>
hee determined to hearken to the Musick: and that they might know hee was
there, hee feigned a sneeze, which not a little pleased the Damzels, that desired nothing
else: so <hi>Altisidora</hi> running on, and tuning her Harpe, began this Song.

I proceed then thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> with all his troop came to a Town, which had in it about a thousand Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
which was one of the best the Duke had: They told him the Island was called
<hi>Barataria,</hi> eyther because the Town was called <hi>Baratario,</hi> or else because hee had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his Government so cheap. When hee came to the Town Gates (for it was wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54746:232"/>
the Officers came out to welcome him; the bells rung, and all the Inhabitants
made shew of a generall gladnesse, and they carried him in great pomp to the high
Church, to give God thanks: and straight, after some ridiculous ceremonies, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him the Keyes, &amp; admitted him for perpetuall Governour of the Island <hi>Barata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
His apparell, his beard, his fatnesse, and the shortnesse of this new Governour,
made all the people admire that knew not the jigg of the matter, and those also that
knew it, which were many.</p>
                     <p>Finally, when hee came out of the Church, they carried him to the Judgement seat,
and seated him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it, and the Dukes Steward told him; It is an old custome, Sir Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in this Island, that hee that comes to take possession of this famous Island, must
answer to a question that shall bee asked him, that must bee somewhat hard and intricate,
by whose answer the Town ghesseth and taketh the pulse of their new Governours
capacity, and accordingly, is either glad or sorry at his comming.</p>
                     <p>Whilest the Steward said this to <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee was looking upon certain great letters
that were written upon the wall over against his seat; and because hee himself could
not read, hee asked what painting that was in the wall? It was (answered him:) Sir,
the day is set down there in which your Honour took possession of this Island, and the
Epitaph saies thus; <hi>This day, such a day of the moneth and yeer, Signior</hi> Don Sancho
Pança <hi>took possession of this Island, long may hee enjoy it.</hi> And whom call they <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
Panca</hi> (said <hi>Sancho?</hi>) Your Honour (quoth the Steward;) for no other <hi>Panca</hi>
hath come into this Island, but hee that is seated in that seat. Well, mark you Brother
(quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) there belongs no <hi>Don</hi> to me, neither ever was there any in all my Linage;
I am plain <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Father was called <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Grandfather and all were <hi>Pansa's</hi>
without any additions of <hi>Dons</hi> or <hi>Donnaes,</hi> and I beleeve this Island is as full of <hi>Dons</hi>
as stones: but 'tis enough, God knows my meaning; and perhaps if my Government
last but four daies to an end, I'le weed out these <hi>Dons</hi> that with their multiplicity doe
weary and trouble like <hi>Mosquitos.</hi> On with your question, Master Steward, I'le an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you as well as I can, let the Town bee sorry or not sorry.</p>
                     <p>At this instant two men came into the Judgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the other like a Taylor, having sheeres in his hand; the Taylor said, Sir
Governour, I and this Husbandman are come before you for this cause: This honest
man came yesterday to my shop, and I, saving your reverence, am a Taylor, and a free
man, God bee thanked, and shewing mee a piece of cloth, asked mee; Sir, will there
bee enough here to make mee a Capouch? I measuring the cloth, answered him,
Yes: he thought as I did, and I thought true, that I would steale some of his cloth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
maliciously bent, and out of the ill opinion hee had of Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs: and hee replied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that I should tell if there were enough to make two: I smelt his drift, and told
him, I; and my Gallant in his first knavish intention, went adding more Capouches,
and I answered with more yesses, till wee came to five, and even now hee came for
them, I give them him, but hee will not pay mee for the making, rather hee demands
that I pay him, or returne him his cloth. Is it true this (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>)? Yes, said
the fellow; but pray, Sir, let him shew his five Capouches that hee hath made mee
With a very good will, (quoth the Taylor:) and continently taking his hand from
under his cloake, hee shewed five Capouches in it, upon each finger one, and said;
Behold here the five Capouches that this man would have mee make, and in my soul
and conscience I have not a jot of cloth left, as any workeman shall judge.</p>
                     <p>All the by standers laughed at the number of the Capouches, and the strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
<hi>Sancho,</hi> after a little consideration, said; Mee thinkes, in this suit there need
no delayes, but a quicke and plaine judgement; My sentence therefore is, that the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
lose his labour, and the Husbandman his cloth, and that the Capouches bee carried
to the poore in the prison, without any more adoe.</p>
                     <p>If the sentence that passed of the Grazier bred admiration in the by-stander, this
mov'd them to laughter; but what the Governour commanded, was fulfilled: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom, two ancient men were now presented; the one had a hollow Cane, in
stead of a staffe, the other had none: hee without the staffe, said, Sir, I lent this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb facs="tcp:54746:233"/>
man long since, tenne Crownes in good Gold, to doe him a kindnesse: I let him
alone a good while, without asking for them, because I would not put him to more
trouble to repay mee, then hee had to borrow them of mee; but because I saw him
carelesse of the payment, I have asked him more then once or twice for my money<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
which hee not onely doth not returne mee, but denies, and sayes, hee never received
the tenne Crownes I lent him or that if I did lend them him, hee hath payd mee: I
have no witnesses, neyther of the lending, or of the payment: I pray, Sir, will you take
his Oath? and if hee will sweare that hee hath payd mee, I give him an acquitance from
henceforth, and before God. What say you to this, honest old man with the staffe
(quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) Sir, I confesse that hee lent them mee, and hold downe your rod,
[<hi>The custome in Spaine being, that hee who is to sweare, makes a crosse over the rod of
Iustice,</hi>] and since hee will have mee sweare, I will, that I have payd him really and
truely. The Governour held out his rod, and in the meane time, hee with the staffe,
gave it to the other old man to hold, whilest hee was to sweare, as if it had hindred
him: so with his hand hee made a crosse over the rod of Justice, saying, 'Twas true
that hee had lent him the ten crownes that hee demanded; but that hee had truely
restored them to him againe, and that his forgetting of it, made him continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them. Which when the Grand Governour saw, hee asked the Creditor what
hee could say against his Adversary? Hee said, that surely his debter said true, for hee
held him to bee an honest man, and a good Christian, and that it might bee hee had
forgotten, how or when hee payd him, and that from henceforward hee would never
demand him ought. The debtor tooke his staffe again making an obeysance, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the judgement place: Which when <hi>Sancho</hi> saw, and that hee was going with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more adoe, and seeing likewise the others patience, hee nodded with his head
on his brest, and clapt the Index of his right hand, upon his nose and eye-browes, and
a pretty while was as it were considering, and by and by lifted up his head, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that the old man with the staffe should bee brought to him: and <hi>Sancho</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, said, Honest man, give mee that staffe; for I have use for it. With a very
good will, quoth the old man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>here 'tis, Sir, and gave it him. <hi>Sancho</hi> tooke it, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the other old man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ayd, Goe on Gods name, now you are payd. I Sir, said
the old man? why, can this Cane bee worth ten crownes? Yes, said the Grvernour,
or else I am the veriest block-head in the world: and now you shall see whether I have
a braine or no to governe a whole Kingdome: so hee commanded that before them
all the Cane should bee broken, which was done, and in the midst of it, they found
the ten crownes.</p>
                     <p>All of them admired at this and held their Governour for a second <hi>Salomon.</hi>
They asked him how hee gathered that the ten Crownes was in the Cane? He answered,
That because hee saw the old man that was to sweare, give his Adversary the staffe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
hee tooke his oath, and that hee swore hee had given him the money truly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and that when hee had ended his oath, hee demanded his staffe of him againe, it
came into his imagination, that within it the money was hidden; whereby it may bee
collected, That although many Governors are starke Asses, yet somtimes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God to direct them in their Judgements; for besides, hee had heard the Vicar of
his parish tell of such an Accident as this, and that hee had a speciall Memorie, for
if it were not for forgetting all hee desired to remember, there were not such a Memory
in the Island.</p>
                     <p>At last one of the old men ashamed, and the other payed his money, they departed,
and those that were present were astonish't; and hee that wrote down <hi>Sanchoes</hi> words,
deeds and behaviour, could not resolve, whether hee should set him dawn a foole or a
wise-man.</p>
                     <p>As soone as this sute was ended, there came a woman into the place of Judgement,
laying hold strongly on a man clad to see too, like a rich Grazier, who came crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
saying, Justice (Lord Governour) Justice; and if I have it not on Earth, I
will seeke it in Heaven. Sweete Governor this wicked man met mee on the high-way,
and hath abused my body, as if it had beene an un-washed ragge; and, unhappy that I

from Moores and Christians, from home-bred ones and strangers; I have beene as hard
as a Corke-tree, and kept my selfe as entire as the Salamander in the fire, or as the
wooll amongst the Bryars, and this man must come now with a washt hand and handle
mee. This is to bee tryed yet (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) whether this gallants hands bee washt
or no; and turning to the fellow hee said. What answere you to yonder womans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint?
Who all in a fright answered: Sir (quoth hee) I am a poor Grazier, and deal
in swine; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d this morning I went (with pardon bee it spoken) from this Town to sell
four Hoggs, and the tallage and other fees cost me little lesse then they were worth: as
I went homeward, by the way I met with this good Matron, and the Devill, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of all mischief, yoaked us together: I gave her sufficient pay, but shee not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
layd hold on me, and would not let me goe till shee had brought me hither: she
sayes I forced her, but I swear shee lies; and this is true every jot of it. Then the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
asked him, if hee had any money about him? Who answered him, Yes; that
hee had in a leathern purse in his bosome some twenty Crowns in silver. He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to take it out, and deliver it just as it was to the Plaintiff; which hee did trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
The woman received it, and making a thousand Moorish ducks to the company
and praying to God for the Governours life and health, that was so charitable to poor
Orphans and Maidens, shee went out from the place of Judgement, laying fast hold
with both her hands on the purse, though first shee looked whether 'twere silver within
or no. Shee was scarce gone, when <hi>Sancho</hi> said to the Grazier, that had tears standing
in his eyes, and his heart going after his purse; Honest fellow, run after yonder wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and take her purse from her whether shee will or no, and bring it me hither. Hee
spoke not to a fool or a deaf man, for straight hee parted like lightning, and went to
perform what was commanded him.</p>
                     <p>All that were present were in suspence and expectation of the end of that suit, and a
little after, both man and woman returned together, more fastened and clung together
then formerly, shee with her coat up and her purse in her lapp, and hee striving to get it
from her, which was not possible, she did so resist, crying out and saying, Justice of God
and the World: Look you, Sir Governour, mark the little shame or fear of this despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man, that in the midest of a congregation, and in the midest of a street, would take
away my purse that you commanded him to give me.</p>
                     <p>And hath hee got it (said the Governour?) Got it (said shee?) I had rather lose
my life then the purse: I were a pretty childe yfaith then; you must set other manner of
Colts upon me then this poor nasty sneak up: Pincers, Hammers, Beetles, scraping-Tools,
shall not get it out of my claws, out of my Lyons paws; they shall rather get one
half of my soul out of my flesh. Shee sayes right (quoth the fellow) I yeeld to her; I
have no more power, I confesse my force is not sufficient to take it away.</p>
                     <p>Then said the Governour to the woman; You, Honesty, Virago, give me that purse
hither; which shee did: and the Govenor restored it again to the man; and said to
the forcible woman, but not forced, Doe you heare, sister? if you had shewed but half
your valour and breath to defend your body, that you did for your purse, <hi>Hercules</hi> his
force could not have forced you: get you gon with a Pox; come not into this Island,
nor in six leagues round about it, on pain of two hundred lashes: get you gone straight
(I say) Make-bate, shamelesse Coozener. The woman was afrighted, and away shee
went like a Sheep-biter, and melancholy; and the Governour said to the man, Honest
fellow, get you home on Gods name with your Money; and henceforward if you
mean not to lose it, pray have no mind to yoak with any body. The man as clownishly
as hee could, thanked him, and went his way: The by-standers admired afresh at the
judgement and sentences of their new Governour. All which noted by his Chroniclist,
was straight written to the Duke, that with much desire expected it. And leave wee
honest <hi>Sancho</hi> here: for his Master hastens us now, that was all in a hurly-burly with

Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> get you gone; for as long as you are here, this poor Wench will
not come to her self.</p>
                     <p>To which said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> Get me, Mistris, a Lute into my Chamber soon at
night, and I'le comfort this afflicted Damzell as well as I can: for in amorous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
plain dealing is the most approved remedy; so hee went away, because they that
passed by should not note or observe him: hee was no sooner gone, when the dismayed
<hi>Altisidora</hi> comming to her self, said to her companion: By all means let him have the
Lute; for undoubtedly <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> will give us Musick, and being his, it cannot bee
bad.</p>
                     <p>Straight they went to let the Duchesse know what passed, and of the Lute that
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> required: and shee jocund above measure, plotted with the Duke and
her Damzells, to play a trick with him that should bee more pleasant then hurtfull; and
so with much longing they expected till it should bee night, which came on speedily as
the day had done, which the Dukes passed in savory discourse with <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> and
that day the Duchesse indeed dispatcht a Page of hers, that in the wood acted the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
<hi>Dulcinea's</hi> part, to <hi>Teresa Panca</hi> with her Husband <hi>Sancho's</hi> Letter, and with
the bundle of stuff that hee had left to bee sent her, charging him to bring her a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all that he passed with her.</p>
                     <p>This done, and it growing towards eleven of the clock at night, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> found
a Voyall in his Chamber: hee tuned it, opened the window, and heard people walk
in the Garden, and having runne over the frets of the Violl, and ordering it as well as
hee could, hee spit and cleared his breast, and straight with a voyce somewhat hoarceish,
though tunable, hee sung the ensuing Romant, which the same day hee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.

                     <p>Here <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ended his Song, which was hearkned to by the Duke, Duchesse,
<hi>Altisidora,</hi> and almost all the folke of the Castle; when suddaily from the top of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Turret, there fell heavily down upon <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> window, by the leting down
of a cord, a great sack of Cats with little Low-bels tyed at their tayles, the noyse of
which was so great, and the mewing of the Cats, that although the Dukes were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters
of the Jest, yet they themselves were even afrighted, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and amazed; and such was his ill-luck, that two or three of the Cats got in at
the window of his Cabin, and leaping up and down on every side, it seem'd to him that
there were a Region of Devils in his Chamber; they put out the Candles that were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
there, and now they sought how to get out: the rising and falling of the Cord,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:235"/>
at which the Low-bells were hanged, ceased not; and most of the people in the Castle,
that knew not the certaintie of the businesse, were astonisht.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> got him on his leggs, and laying hold on his sword, began to thrust and
flash at the window, crying out aloud; Avaunt yee wicked Enchanters, avaunt yee
haggish scum; for I am <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> against whom your wicked plots
cannot prevaile, or have any power: And turning to the Cats that were in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
hee strook many blows at them; they got the Iron window, and there got out:
but one of them that saw himself so baited with <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> slashes, leapt upon his
face, and with his nayles and teeth, laid hold on his nose with the paw. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
roared out as loud as he could: Which when the Duke and Duchesse heard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what it might bee, they ran up in all haste to his Chamber, and opening it with
a Master key, they found the poor Knight striving with all his might to unroot the Cat
from his face: they called for lights, and saw the unequall Combat: The Duke came
to part the fray, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> cryed aloud; Let him alone; leave me hand to
hand with this Devill, this Witch, this Enchanter; for I'le make him know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt mee and him; and who <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi> is: But the Cat
carelesse of these threats, purred and held fast.</p>
                     <p>But at length the Duke unloosed him, and flung him out of the window. <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
face was sifted over, and his nose was not very sound; yet hee was very angry
that they would not let him finish the battell, that was so long drawn out betwixt him
and that cursed Enchanter. They made some oyle of Aparice to bee brought, and
<hi>Altisidora</hi> her self, with her fair hands, bound up the wounds; and laying to the clothes
shee told him in his eare, All these mis-haps befell thee, flinty Knight, for the sinne of
thy hard-hearted obstinacy; and God grant that <hi>Sancho</hi> thy Squire may forget to whip
himself, that they beloved <hi>Dulcinea</hi> may still bee enchanted, neither mayest thou enjoy
her, or come to her bed, at least while I live, that adore thee.</p>
                     <p>To all this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered not a word, but fetcht a deep sigh, and straight
laid him down on his bed, thanking the Dukes for their courtesie; not for that hee
was afraid of that Cattish-Low-Belly Enchanting crue; but that hee was perswaded of
their good wills to come to retire him.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes left him to his rest, and went away sorrowfull for the ill successe of the
jest; for they thought that Adventure would not have lighted so heavily on <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
which cost him five dayes retirement and keeping his bed, where another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
befell him, more pleasing then the former, which the Historian will not recount
yet, because of repairing to <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that was very carefull and conceited in his
Government.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Story tells us, That <hi>Sancho</hi> from the Judgement Seat was carried
to a sumptuous Palace, where, in a great and spacious Hall was spread
a Royall and plentifull Table: The winde-Musick played, and
four Pages came in to minister water to him, which hee used with
much state: The winde instruments ceased, and <hi>Sancho</hi> sate him
down at the upper end of the Table, because there was no other seat,
nor no other Napkin laid but that.</p>
                     <p>At his elbow their stood a certain personage, that after shewed to bee a Physician,
with a Whale-bone rod in his hand: then they took off a rich white Towell, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
many sorts of Fruits, and a great varietie of severall dishes of meats: One that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54746:235"/>
served to bee a kinde of Student, said grace; and a Page put a laced Bib under <hi>Sancho's</hi>
chin; and another that plaid the Carvers part, set a dish of fruit before him: but hee
had no sooner eaten a bit, when hee with the rod touching the dish, it was very sodainly
taken from before him: but the Carver set another dish of meat before him. <hi>Sancho</hi>
would have tasted of it; but before he could touch it, hee with the rod was at it, and a
Page set it away with as much celerity as the fruit: which when <hi>Sancho</hi> saw, hee began
to bee in suspence, and beholding all that were by, asked if that meat were to bee eaten
like your Childrens Corall: [<hi>only to bee toucht, but not swollowed.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>To which hee with the rod made answer; It must bee eaten Sir Governour (quoth
hee) according to the use and custome of Governours in other Islands. I Sir, am a
Physician, and am Stipended in this Island to bee so to the Governours of it; and I am
much more carefull of their health then of mine own; studying night and day, and
weighing the complexion of the Governour, that I may hit the better upon the curing
him, whensoever hee falls sick: and the principall thing I doe, is, to bee present with
him at meats, and to let him eat what I think fit for him, and to take away what I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
may doe him hurt, or bee naught for his stomack; and therefore I now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the dish of fruit to bee taken away, because it is too moyst; and the other dish,
because it was too hot, and had much spice, that provoked thirst; and hee that drinks
much kills and consumes his <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> wherein life consists. So that (quoth
<hi>Sancho</hi>) you dish of Partridges there roasted, and in my opinion well seasoned, will doe
me no hurt at all.</p>
                     <p>To which (said the Physician) You shall not eat of them Sir, as long as I live.</p>
                     <p>Why so (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) the Physician answered, Because <hi>Hypocrates</hi> our Master,
North starre and light of Physick, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ayes in an Aphorisme of his; <hi>Omnis saturatio mala,
Perdicis autem pessima:</hi> the meanings is, All surfeit is ill, but that of a Partridge is worst
of all.</p>
                     <p>If it bee so (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) pray see, Master Docter, which of all these dishes will bee
most wholesome for me and doe me least hurt, and let me eat of that, without banging
of it with your Rod: for in good sadnesse I tell you plain, I am ready to dye with
hunger; and to deny mee my victuales, in spight of Master Doctor, let him say what
hee will, is rather to take away my life then to increase it.</p>
                     <p>You say true, Sir Governour (quoth the Physician) and therefore my opinion is,
that you touch not those boyled Conies, nor that Veal, for it is watrish meat: if it
were roasted or powdred? but 'twere much about one. Then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that
great dish that stands fuming there before, me thinks 'tis an <hi>Olla Podrida [a pot of all
kinde of flesh sod together,</hi>] and by reason of the diversities of things it hath in it, I cannot
but meet with something that will doe me good. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>sit,</hi> quoth the Physician, farre bee
such an ill thought from us, quoth the Physician: there is nothing in the world that
worse nourisheth then an <hi>Olla Podrida,</hi> fit only for your Prebends and Rectors of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
or for your Country Marriages: Let your Governours Tables bee without
them, and let them bee furnished with all prime dainties and quaintnesse: And the
reason is, because alwaies, and wheresoever, and by whomsoever, your simple Medicines
are in more request then your Compounds; because in Simples there can bee no
error; in Compounds there are many, astring the quantity of things, of which they are
composed; but that that I know is fit for the Governour to eat at present to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his health, and corroborate it, is, some hundred of little hollow Wafers, and some
pretty slice or two of Quince-Marmelade, that may settle his stomack, and help his
digestion.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> heard this, hee leaned himself to the back of his chaire, and by fits now
and then looked at the Physician, and with a grave voyce, asked him his name, and where
hee had studied.</p>
                     <p>To which hee answered my name, Sir Governour, is Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio de Agnero;</hi>

them as Divine persons. I say again, <hi>Pedro Rezio,</hi> get you gone, or else Ile take the
chaire I sit upon, and dash it upon your head, and let me be called in question for it,
when I give up my Office, for I can discharge my selfe, by saying that I did God

else take your Government again; for an Office that will not afford a man his victuals,
is not worth two Beanes.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor was in an uproare to see the Governour so chollerick, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>and would
have gone out of the Hall, but that at that instant a posting-Horne sounded in the
Streete, and the Carver peeping out of the Window, turned back saying; A Poste
is come from my Lord the Duke, that brings some important dispatch. The Poste
came straight in, sweating and amazed, and drawing a Pacquet out of his bosome, hee
delivered it to the Governour. <hi>Sancho</hi> gave it to the Steward, and bad him reade
the superscription, which was this. <hi>To Don Sancho Panca,</hi> Governour of the Island
<hi>Barataria,</hi> to his owne hands, or to his Secretary. Which when <hi>Sancho</hi> heard, hee
said, Who is here my Secretarie? And one that was by answered I Sir; for I can
Write and Reade; for I am a Biscayner. With that addition (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) you
may well bee Secretarie to the Emperour himself; open your Packet, and let's heare
the Contents.</p>
                     <p>The new-borne Secretarie did so; and having viewed the Contents, said, That
it was a businesse to bee imparted in private. <hi>Sancho</hi> commanded those in the
Presence to avoide, and only the Steward and the Carver to remaine, and the
rest, with the Physician went out, and presently the Secretarie read the Letter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was astonisht, and the standers by seemed to bee no otherwise; and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Steward he said, Ile tell you what is fit to bee done, and that presently;
Clap mee Doctor <hi>Rezio</hi> into dungeon; for if any body kill mee, it is hee, and with so
vile and triviall a death as hunger: Mee thinks too, said the Carver, you should doe
well to eat nothing of all this meat upon the Table; for this dinner was presented by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54746:236"/>
Nunnes, and it is an old saying, The neerer the Church the farther from God. I grant
yee so (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and therefore for the present give me only a peece of bread, and
some four pound of grapes; for in them there can bee no poyson, and indeed I cannot
live without eating: for if wee must provide our selves for these warrs that threaten
us, 'twere fit to bee well victualed; for the guts uphold the heart, and not the heart the
guts. And you Secretary, answer my Lord the Duke, tell him that his commands shall
be fullfilled most punctually; &amp; commend me to the Duchess, and say that I request her,
that she forget not to send my letter by a speciall Messenger, &amp; likewise the fardell to my
Wife <hi>Teresa, Panca,</hi> and in it shee shall doe me a particular favour, and I will bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to serve her to the uttermost of my power: And by the way you may clap in a
commendation to my Master, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> that hee may see
I am thankfull for his bread: And you like a good Secretary, and an honest Biscayner,
may in the rest add what you will, or shall think fitting. And take away here; and yet
leave me something to eat; and let these Spies, these Murderers and Enchanters come
upon my and my Island, Ile deal with them well enough.</p>
                     <p>And now a Page came in, saying; Here's a Husbandman, a suiter, that would speak
with your Honour in a businesse of importance, as hee sayes, 'Tis a strange thing of
these suiters (quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi>) Is it possible they should bee so foolish as not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that these bee not times for them to negotiate in? belike wee that Govern, wee
that are Judges, are not men of flesh and blood; and is it not fit that wee should ease
our selves, when necessity requires, except they think wee should bee made of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Verily, and in my Conscience, if my Government last (as I have a glimmering it
will not) Ile lay one of these fellows up for it. Well, bid this honest fellow come in
for this once; but see first that hee bee none of the Spies, or any of my murderers. No
Sir (quoth the Page) for hee is a very dull soul to see to: either I know little, or hee
hath no more harme then a piece of good bread. There's no fearing him (said the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
for wee all are here.</p>
                     <p>Carver (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) were it not possible, now that Doctor <hi>Rezio</hi> is not here, that
I might eat a bit of some substantiall meat though it were but a crust and an onion?
To night at Supper (quoth the Carver) your Dinner shall bee amended, and your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
shall bee satisfied. God grant it (quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi>) and now the Husbandman came
in, one of a very goodly presence, and that you might see a thousand miles off, was a
good hurtlesse soul. The first thing that he said was, Which is my Lord the Governor?
Who should it bee (quoth the Secretary) but hee that sits there in the Chair? I humble
my self to his presence then (quoth the Husbandman) and kneeling on his knees, desired
his hand to kiss. <hi>Sancho</hi> denied it, and commanded him to rise, and to say what hee
would have. The Husbandman did so, and said:</p>
                     <p>I Sir, am a Husbandman, born in <hi>Miguel Turra,</hi> a Town some two leagues from
<hi>Cindercall.</hi> Here's another <hi>Tirte a fuera,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> Say on Brother, for let me tell
you, I know the place very well, and it is not farre from my Town. The Businesse Sir,
is this, quoth the Husbandman; I by Gods blessing, and the full consent of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Romane Church, am Married, have two Sonnes that bee Students; the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
studies to bee Bachelor, and the eldest to bee Master. I am a widdower, for my
Wife dyed, or to say trulier, a wicked Physician killed her, that purged her when shee
was great with Childe: and if it had pleased God that shee had been delivered, and it
had been a Sonne. I would have set him to studie to have been Doctor, that hee might
not have envied his Brothers, the Bachelor and Master. So that (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) if
your Wife had not been dead, or if they had not killed her, you had not now been a
Widdower? No Sir, by no means (quoth the Husbandman.) Wee are much the
neerer (quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi>) forward brother, 'tis time to sleep, have you any more to say?
I say (quoth the Husbandman) that my Sonne that was to bee the Bachelor, fell in
love in the same Town with a Maiden, called <hi>Clara Perlerina,</hi> Daughter to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Perlerina</hi> a rich Farmer: and this name of <hi>Perlerina's</hi> comes not to them by any
off-spring, or discent, but that all of this race and name are <hi>Palsigiste;</hi> and to better
the name, they were called <hi>Perlerina's;</hi> and indeed the Maid is as fair as an Orientall
<pb facs="tcp:54746:237"/>
Pearl: and looking upon her right side, shee is like a flower in the field; but on her
left, otherwise; for there shee wants an eye, that flew out of her head with the
small-pox: and though shee have many holes left still in her face, many say that love her
well, that those are not holes, but graves where her Lovers souls are buried.</p>
                     <p>Shee is so cleanly, that because shee will not bewray her face, shee weares her nose
(as you would say) tucked up, as if it fledd from her mouth, and for all that, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
her passing well; for shee hath a wide mouth: and were it not that shee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
tenne or twelve teeth and her grinders, shee might passe, and set a marke for the
well-favouredst to come to. For her lippes, I say nothing, for they are so thinne and
delicate that if they did use to reele lippes, they might make a skeine of hers: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are of a more different colour then wee see ordinarily in lippes, they are
miraculous; for they are Jaspered with blue and greene, and <hi>Berengena</hi>-coloured, and
under correction, Sir Governour, since I paint out the parts of her that I meane to
make my daughter so exactly, it is a signe I love her, and that I doe not dislike her.</p>
                     <p>Paint what you will (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for I recreate my selfe with the painting: and
if I had dined, there were no better dish of fruit to me then your picture.</p>
                     <p>I humbly thanke you, sir, for that (quoth the Husbandman:) but time will come
that I may bee thankefull, if I bee not now, and if I should paint out to you her gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the height of her body, 'twould admire you: but that cannot bee, for shee
is crooked, her knees and her mouth meet, and for all that 'tis well seene, that if shee
could stand upright, shee would touch the roofe with her head, and long ere this, shee
would have given her hand to my sonne to bee his spouse, but that shee cannot stretch
it out, 'tis so knotted and crumpled up; for all that her goodnesse and good shape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in her long and guttured nailes.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very well (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and make account, Brother, that now you have pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her from head to foot. What would you now? come to the matter without
fetches, or lanes, or digressions, or additions. I would desire you (quoth the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman)
to give mee a Letter of favour to my brother by marriage, her father; to
desire him to consent that this marriage may goe forward, since our fortunes bee equall
and our births; for to say true, Sir Governour, my sonne is possessed with the Devill,
and there's not a day passeth, but the wicked spirits torment him, and once falling in
the fire, hath mad his face as wrinkled as a piece of parchment, and his eyes are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bleered and running, and hee is as soft conditioned as an Angell; for if it were
not for buffeting of himselfe now and then, hee were a very Saint.</p>
                     <p>Will you any thing else, honest friend, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> One thing more (quoth
hee) but that I dare not tell it; but let it out, it shall not rotte in my brest, speed how
it will. I desire, Sir, that you would give mee three hundred, or six hundred Dukats to
helpe my Bachelors portion, I meane to helpe him to furnish his house, for they will
live by themselves, without being subject to the impertinencies of fathers in Lawe.</p>
                     <p>Will you have any thing else (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) and bee not abashed or ashamed to
tell it. No truly (quoth the Husbandman:) and hee had scarce said this, when the
Governor rising up, layd hold on the chayre that hee sat on, saying; I vow to you good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
splay-foot, unmannerly clown, if you goe not strait and hide your selfe out of my
presence, Ile breake your head with this chayre here ye whoor-son Rascall, the Devills
painter: commest thou at this time of day to aske mee sixe hundred Ducats? And
where have I them, stinkard? and if I had them, why should I give them thee, sottish
knave? What a poxe care I for <hi>Miguel Turra,</hi> or all the linage of the <hi>Perlerinas!</hi>
Get thee out of my sight or I sweare by my Lord the Dukes life, that Ile doe as I
have said, Thou art not of <hi>Miguel Turra,</hi> but some crafty knave, sent from hell to
tempt mee. Tell mee, desperate man! 'tis not yet a day and a halfe since I came to
the Government: how wouldst thou have mee have sixe hundreth Ducats? The Carver
made signes to the Husbandman, to get him out of the Hall; who did so like a sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
and to see to very fearfull, lest the Governour should execute his choller on
him: for the cunning knave very well knew what belonged to his part: but leave wee
<hi>Sancho</hi> to his choller, and peace bee in the Quire, and returne we to <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:54746:237"/>
for we left his face bound up, and dressed for his Cattish wounds, of which hee was
not sound in eight dayes: in one of which this befell him, that <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> promiseth
to recount with all the punctualitie, and truth that hee usually doth in the most triviall
matters of this History.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ill-wounded <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was exceeding musty and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
with his face bound up, and scarred, not by the hand of
God, but by the nayles of a Cat (misfortunes annexed to Knight
Errantry) sixe dayes past ere hee came abroad: in one of which,
in a night, when hee was awake and watching, thinking upon his
mishaps, and his being persecuted by <hi>Altisidora,</hi> hee perceived
that some body opened his Chamber door with a Key; and
straight hee imagined that the inamored Damzell came to set
upon his honestie, and to put him to the hazzard of forgoing his loyalty due to his
Mistris <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso.</hi> No said hee, beleeving in his imagination, and this so lowd
that hee might easily bee heard, no beauty in the world shall make mee leave her that
is graved and stamped in the midst of my heart, and in my innermost entrailes: bee thou,
Mistris mine, either transformed into an Onion-like husband-woman, or into a Nimph
of the Golden <hi>Tagus,</hi> weaving webs made of silke and gold twist: bee thou in
<hi>Merlins</hi> power, or in <hi>Montesino's,</hi> where ere they will have thee: for wheresoever
thou art, thou art mine; and wheresoever I am, I will bee thine. His speech ended, and
the door opened both together.</p>
                     <p>Up hee stood upon the bed, wrapped from head to foot in a quilt of yellow Sattin,
a woollen cap upon his head, his face and Mustachos bound up: his face for his scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
his Mustachoes, because they should not dismay or fall down: in which posture,
hee lookt like the strangest aparition, that can bee imagined.</p>
                     <p>Hee nayled his very eyes upon the door: and whereas hee thought to have seen the
vanquished and pittifull <hi>Altisidora</hi> enter, hee saw that it was a most reverend Matron,
with a long white gathered Stole, so long that it did cover and bemantle her from
head to foot: betwixt her left hand fingers shee had halfe a Candle lighted, and with
her right hand shee shaddowed her selfe, to keep the light from her eyes, which where
hid with a great payre of spectacles: shee came treading softly, and moving her feet
gently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> from his Watch-towre beheld her: and when hee saw her furniture,
and noted her silence, hee thought it had beene some Hagge or Magician, which came
in that shape to doe him some shrewd turne; and hee beganne apace to blesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                     <p>The Vision came somewhat neeeer: but being in the midst of the Chamber, shee
lifted up her eyes, and saw with what haste <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was crossing himselfe; as if
hee were afraid to see such a shape; shee was no lesse affrighted with his: for seeing
him so lanke, and yellow in the quilt, and with the bends that dis-figured him, shee
cryed out, saying, Jesus, What's this? and with the sodaine fright, the Candle dropt
out of her hand, and being in the darke, shee turned her back to bee gone; but for feare
stumbled upon her Coats, and had a sound fall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:238"/>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> timorous, began to say, I conjure thee, Apparition! Or whatso'ere
thou art, to tell me who thou art, and what thou wilt have with mee: If thou bee'st
a soule in Purgatory, tell mee, and I will doe what I am able for thee: for I am a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Christian, and love to doe good to all the world: for, for this cause I tooke
upon mee the order of Knight Errant, which I professe (whose practice extends even
to doe good to the soules in Purgatorie.) The broken Matron that heard her selfe thus
conjured, by her feare ghessed at <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and with a low and pittifull voice shee
answered him, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> (if you bee hee I meane) I am no Apparition,
nor Vision, nor soule of Purgatory, as you have thought: but <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> my
Lady the Duchesses honour'd Matron, that come to you with a case of necessity of those
that you usually give redresse to.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) come you happily about some
peece of brokage? For let mee tell you, if you doe, there's no good to bee done with
mee for any body, thanks to the peerelesse Beauty of my Mistris <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso:</hi>
So that let me tell you, <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> setting aside all amorous messages, you may
goe light your candle again, and return and impart what you will command me, and
any thing you please, excepting, I say, all kinde of inciting nicities. I Sir, messages from
any body? You know not me yfaith: I am not so stale yet, that I should fall to those
triflles, for, God be praised, I have life and flesh, and all my teeth and my grinders in my
mouth, except some few that the Catarrs, which are so common in this Country of
<hi>Aragon,</hi> have usurped on: but stay a little Sir, Ile goe out and light my Candle and,
Ile come in an instant, and relate my griefs to you, as to the Redressor of all such like
in the world: And so without staying for an answer, shee left the rooms, where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
remained still and pensative expecting her: but straight a thousand imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
came into his minde, touching this new Adventure, and hee thought it would bee
very ill done, or worse imagined, to endanger the breach of his vowed loyalty to his
Mistris, and said to himself; Who knows whether the Devill, that is so subtil and
crafty, may deceive mee now with this Matron, which hee hath not been able to doe
with Empresses, Queens, Duchesses, Marquesses? and I have heard say often, by many
well experienced men, that hee will rather make a man sinne with a foul then a fair one:
and who knows whether this privacie, this oportunitie &amp; silence may not awake my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
now sleeping? and that now in my old age I may fall, where I never stumbled in
such like chances? 'tis better fly then try the combat: but sure I am out of my wits,
since I talk thus idlely; and sure it is not possible that a white-stoled lank-spectacled
Matron should moove or stirre up a lascivious thought in the ungodliest
brest in the world: Is there any Matron in the world that hath soft flesh?
Is there any that is not foolish, nice, and coy? Avaunt then, you Matronly troops, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
for mans delight.</p>
                     <p>How well did that Lady, of whom it was observed, that shee had two Matrons
Statue-wayes of wood, with their Spectacles and Pin-pillows at the end of her Seat of
State, as if they had been at work? and those Statues served as well to authorize her
room, as if they had been reall Matrons. And this said, hee flung from the Bed to have
shut the door, and not have let Mistris <hi>Rodriguez</hi> come in: but as hee was going to
doe it, shee was come back with her candle lighted of white wax: and when shee saw
<hi>Don Quixote</hi> neer her, wrapped in his Quilt, his Bends, his wollen Cap, and a thick
cloth about his neck, shee began to fear again: and stepping two or three steps back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
shee asked, Am I safe, Sir Knight? for I hold it not a very honest signe, that you
are up from your Bed. 'Twere fit I asked that question of you (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>) and
therefore let me know, whether I shall be free from ravishing. By whom (quoth she?)
By you (said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>) for neither am I of marble, or you of brasse; neither is it
now ten a clock at day time, but mid-night and something more, as I think: and wee
are in a more secret and close couch then the Cave, in which the bold trayterous <hi>Aeneas</hi>
enjoyed the fair and pitying <hi>Dido:</hi> but give me your hand Mistris, and Ile have no other
assurance then mine own continencie and warinesse: And in saying this, hee kissed her
right hand; and shee layd hold of his, which shee gave him with the same solemnitie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54746:238"/>Here <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> makes a parenthesis, and earnestly protesteth he would have given
the best coat he had, to have seen them both go so joyned and linked from the Chamber
dore to the bed.</p>
                     <p>In fine, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went to his Bed, and <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> sate downe in a
Chayre a pretty way from it, without taking off her spectacles, or setting downe the
Candle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> crowded up together, and covered himselfe all over, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his face uncovered: So both of them beeing quiet; the first that broke off
their silence was <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> saying. Now, Mistrisse <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rip
your selfe, and dis-mawe all that you have in your troubled Heart, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Entrailes, which shall bee heard by my chaste Eares, and relieved with my pious
Workes.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve no lesse said the Matron: for from your gentle and pleasing presence, there
could not be but a Christian answere expected.</p>
                     <p>Thus then it is, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that though you see mee set in this Chaire,
and in the midst of the Kingdome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> in the habit of a poore and way-beaten
Matron; I was borne in the <hi>Asturias [A barcen Mountainous countrey in Spaine, like
our Wales]</hi> and Kingdome of <hi>Oniedo,</hi> and of a linage allied to the best of that Province:
but my hard fortune, and my fathers lavishing, that grew to bee a Begger before his
time (God knowes how) brought mee to the Court at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where very quietly,
and to avoid other inconveniencies, my friends placed mee to serve as a Chamber-maid
to a worthy Ladie; and though I say it, that for white-worke, hemming and stitching,
I was never yet put downe in all my life. My friends left mee at service, and returned
homeward, and not long after went (in likelyhood) to heaven, for they were
wonderfull good Catholike Christians; thus was I an Orphan, and stinted to the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
wages and hard allowance that at Court is given to such kinde of servants: and at
that time (I not giving any occasion thereto) a Squire of the house fell in love with
mee, somewhat an elderly man, big-bearded and personable, and above all, as good a
Gentleman as the King, for hee was of the Mountaines; wee kept not our loves so
close but that they came to my Ladies eares; who without any more adoe, with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
our Holy Mother the Catholique Romane Church, caused us to bee married, by
sent which Matrimonie to end my good fortune, if I had any; I had a Daughter, if I had
any, I say it was ended, not that I dyed of Childe-bed, for I mis-carried not; but
that my Husband not long after dyed of a fright hee had, and had I now time to tell
you of it, 'twould admire you: And with this shee beganne to weepe most tenderly,
and said; Pardon mee, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I cannot doe withall; as often as
I remember my unfortunate Husband, the Teares trickle downe mine eyes. Lord
God! and how stately hee would carry my Lady behinde him, upon a lusty black Mule,
as black as Jeat: For then they used no Coaches nor hand-Chayres, as now (they
say they doe) and then Gentlewomen rode behinde their Squires: And I cannot
but tell you this Tale, that you may see the punctualnesse and good manners of my
Husband.</p>
                     <p>As hee was going in at Saint <hi>Iaques</hi> his streete in <hi>Madrid,</hi> which was somewhat
narrow, a Judge of the Court, with two Sargeants before him, was comming out;
and as soon as my honest Squire saw him, hee turned his Mules reins, making shew as if
hee would wait upon him: My Lady that rode behinde, asked him softly, What doest
thou knave? Do'st not see that I am here? The Judge very mannerly laid hold on
his rein, and said, Keep your way Sir: for it were fitter for me to wait upon my Lady
<hi>Casilda;</hi> (for that was my Ladies name.) Yet still my Husband was earnest with his
Cap in his hand, and would have waited on the Judge: which when my Lady saw,
full of wrath and anger, shee pulled out a great Pin; or rather, as I beleeve, a little
Bodkin out of her Estoises, and thrust him into the rump; insomuch that my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
cryed out, and wrigling his body, my Ladie and hee came to the ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>Two of her Lackies came to raise her; and the Judge and the Sergeants likewise:
<pb facs="tcp:54746:239"/>
the Gate of <hi>Guadalaxara</hi> was in an uproar, I mean the idle people up and down
there.</p>
                     <p>My Lady was faine to walk on foot, and my Husband got him to a Barbers house,
saying, that hee was runne quite thorow and thorow. This mannerlynesse of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
was bruted up and down; insomuch, that the very Boyes in the streets mocked
him: so that for this, and because too hee was somewhat pore-blinde, my Lady the
Duchesse turned him away; for grief of which, I verily beleeve hee dyed, and I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Widow, and succourlesse, with a childe to boot, that went on increasing in beauty
like the foam of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Finally, for as much as I had the report of an excellent Seamstresse, my Ladie the
Duchesse that was newly Married to my Lord the Duke, would needs bring me with
her here to this Kingdome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> together with my Daughter; where in processe
of time shee grew up, and with her all the prettinesse that could bee: shee sings like a
Larke; shee danceth in company as quick as thought; and alone like a cast-a-way;
shee writes and reads like a School-master; and casts Account like a Usurer: for her
cleanlinesse I say nothing; the water that runns is not cleaner: and shee is now (if I
forget not) about sixteen yeers old, five moneths, and three dayes, one or two more or
lesse. In fine, a rich Farmers Sonne fell in love with my Daughter, one that liveth in
one of my Lord the Dukes Villages, not farre from hence: In effect, I know not how,
but they met, and under colour of Marriage hee mocked my Daughter, and will not
keep his promise, and though the Duke know it: for I have complained to him often
of it, and beseeched him, to command the young Farmer to Marry my Daughter: but
hee hath a Trades-mans eares, and will not heare me: the reason is, because the cooz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
knaves father is rich, and lends him money, and lets him have credit every foot to
goe on with his jugling, and will by no means discontent or trouble him.</p>
                     <p>I beseech you Sir therefore, to take upon you the redressing of this wrong, either
by intreaties, or by force; since, as all the world sayes, you were borne to right wrongs,
and protect the needie: Consider that my Daughter is an Orphan; consider her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse,
her youth, and all the good parts that I have told you of; for in my soul and
conscience, amongst all the Damzells that my Lord hath, there is none worthy to untye
her shooe: and one of them they call <hi>Altisidora,</hi> which is the lustiest and gallantest,
in comparison of my Daughter is no body: For let me tell you Sir, all is not gold that
glisters; for this <hi>Altisidora</hi> is more bold then beauteous; more gamesome then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired:
besides, shee is not very sound; for shee hath a certain breath that anoyes, and
you cannot indure her to stand by you a moment: and my Ladie the Duchesse too: but
Mum; they say walls have eares.</p>
                     <p>What ayles my Ladie Duchesse, by your life, Mistris <hi>Rodriguez</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>)
By that (said shee) I cannot but answer you with all truth.</p>
                     <p>Doe you mark Sir (quoth shee) that beauty of my Ladies, that smoothnesse of her
face, that is like a polisht sword, those two cheeks of Milk and Vermilion, in one of
which shee hath the Sunne, in the other the Moon, and that state with which shee goes,
trampling and despising the ground, as if shee went dealing of health up and down?
Know Sir, that first shee may thank God for it, and next, two issues that shee hath in
both her legs, at which all the ill humour is let out, of which Physicians say shee is
full.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Mary</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and is it possible that my Lady the Duchesse
hath such out-lets? I should not have beleeved it if bare-foot Fryers had told me so:
but since <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> tells me, it is so: but from such issues, and such places, no
ill humour, but liquid Amber is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> distilled: I now verily beleeve that this making of
issues is a thing very necessarie for the health.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ended this speech, when at one pluck the Chamber door
was opened; and with the sodain fright <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> Candle fell out of her hand,
and the room was as dark as Pitch; straight the Matron felt that they layd hands upon
her throat so hard, that they gave her no time to yawle: and one of them very quickly
lifting up her coats, with a slipper (in likelihood) began to give her so many jerks, that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54746:239"/>
'twas pittie: and though <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had some compassion on her, yet hee stirred
not from his bed, and knew not what might bee the matter: quiet was hee, and silent,
fearing lest the whipping task and tawing might light upon him, and his fear was not
needlesse: for when the silent executioners had left the Matron well curried (who durst
not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y out) they came to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and unwrapping him from the Sheet and the
Quilt, they pinched him so hard and so often, that he could but goe to buffets to defend
himself: and all this passed in admirable silence; the combat lasted some half an hour;
the apparitions vanished; <hi>Donna Rodrignez</hi> tucked up her Coats, and bewailing her
mishap, got her out of the door, not speaking a word to <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> who heavy and
all to bee pinched, sad and pensative, remained alone; where wee will leave him desirous
to know who was the perverse Enchanter that had so drest him: But that shall be told
in due time; for <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> calls us, and the Decorum of this Historie.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee left the famous Governour moody &amp; angry with the knavish Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman-painter:
who, instructed by the Steward, and the Steward
by the Duke; all made sport with <hi>Sancho:</hi> but hee held them all
tack, though a Fool, a Dullard, and a Block; and said to those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and to Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio;</hi> for as soon as hee had
ended the secret of the Dukes Letter, hee came into the Hall
again.</p>
                     <p>Certainly (said hee) I think now Judges and Governours had need bee made of
Brasse, that they may have no feeling of the importunities of suitors, that would, that at
all hours and all times they should give them audience and dispatch them, intending
only their businesse; let them have never so much of their own: and if the poor Judge
hear them not, or dispatch them not; either because hee cannot, or because they come
not in a fit time to have audience; straight they back-bite and curse him, gnaw his bones,
and unbury his Ancestors. Oh foolish Suiter and idle, make not such haste; stay for a
fit season and conjuncture to negotiate in; come not at dinner time or bed time: for
Judges are flesh and blood, and must satisfie nature, except it bee I, that give my self
nothing to eat, thanks to Master Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio Tirte a fuera</hi> here present, that
would have me die for hunger, and yet stands in it, that this death is life; such a life
God grant him and all his profession; I mean such ill Physicians; for the good deserve
Lawrell and Palme.</p>
                     <p>All that knew <hi>Sancho,</hi> admired him, when they heard him speak so elegantly, and
knew not to what they should attribute it, except it were that Offices and great charges
doe eythet season the understanding, or altogether dull it.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio Agnero de Tirte a fuera,</hi> promised him hee should
sup that night, though hee exceeded all <hi>Hypocrates</hi> his Aphorismes.</p>
                     <p>With this the Governour was well pleased, and very greedily expected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the night and supper time, and though time (as hee thought) stood still, not
moving a jot from his place, yet at length it came, so longed for by him; and hee had
to supper a cold mince-meat of Beef and Onions, with a Calves foot somewhat stale,
and fell to as contentedly as if they had given him a God-wit of <hi>Milan,</hi> or a Pheasant
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Veale of <hi>Sorrentum,</hi> or Partridges of <hi>Moron,</hi> or Geese of <hi>Lanaxos:</hi> and
in the midest of his Supper, hee turned to the Doctor, and said, Look yee, Master
Doctor, hence-forward never care to give me dainties, or exquisite meats to eat; for
you will pluck my stomack quite off the hinges, which is used only to Goat, Beef and
<pb facs="tcp:54746:240"/>
Bacon, Pork and Turneps, and Onions: and if you come to me with your Court dishes,
they make my stomack squeamish, and many times I loath um.</p>
                     <p>Carver, let it bee your care to provide me a good <hi>Olla podrida,</hi> and the more <hi>podrida</hi>
it is, the better, and more favorie; and in your <hi>Olla's</hi> you may boil and ballast in what
you will, so it bee victuals, and I will bee mindefull of you, and make you amends one
day: and let no man play the fool with mee; for either wee are, or wee are not: Let's
bee merry and wife; when the Sunne shines, hee shines upon all: Ile Govern this
Island without looking my due, or taking Bribes; and therefore let all the world bee
watchfull, and look to their bolt, for I give um to understand, there's Rods in Pisse for
them; and if they put me to it, they shall see wonders: I, I, cover your selves with
Honey, and you shall see the Flies will eat you.</p>
                     <p>Truly, Sir Governour (quoth the Carver) you have reason in all you speak; and
let me promise you in the behalf of all the Islanders of this Island, that they will serve
you with all diligence, love, and good will; for the sweet and milde kinde of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that hitherto in the beginning you have used, makes them neither doe nor speak
ought that may redound to your contempt.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve it (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and they were very Asses if they did or thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
and therefore let me say again, Let there bee a care had for the maintenance of
my Person and Dapples, which is very important, and to the matter: And so when
'tis time to walk the Round, let us goe; for my purpose is, to cleanse this Island from
all kinde of filth, Vagamunds, lazie and masterlesse persons: for know friends, that
slothfull and idle people in a Common-wealth, are the same that Drones in Hives, that
eate the Honey which the labouring Bees make. I purpose to cherish the Husbandman,
and to grant the Gentlemen their preeminencies, to reward the Virtuous, and above all,
to have Religion in reverence, and to honour Religious persons.</p>
                     <p>What think yee of this friends? Say I ought? or doe I talk idlely? So well Sir
(said the Steward) that I wonder to see that a man so without learning as you (for I
think you cannot skill of a letter) should speak such sentences and instructions, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what was expected from your wit by all that sent you, and by all us that came
with you. Every day wee see novelties in the world, jests turn'd to earnest, and those
that mock are mocked at.</p>
                     <p>Well, it was night, and the Governour supped, with Master Doctor <hi>Rezio's</hi> licence.
They made ready to walk the Round, the Steward, the Secretary, and Carver went
with him, and the Chroniclist, that was carefull to keep a Register of his actions, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Constables and Notaries; so many, that they might well make a reasonable
Squadron. <hi>Sancho</hi> went in the midest of them with his Rod of Justice, which was the
only chief fight: and when they had walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> some few streets of the Town, they heard
a noyse of flashing, thither they made, and found that they were two men only that
were together by the eares; who seeing the Justice comming, stood still, and the one of
them said; Here for God and the King, shall I bee suffered to bee robbed in the midest
of a Town? and that the midest of the streets bee made the high-way?</p>
                     <p>Softly honest friend (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and tell me what's the reason of this fray, for I
am the Governour.</p>
                     <p>The other, his contrary, said, Sir Governour, Ile tell you briefly the matter. You
shall understand Sir, that this Gentleman even now at a Gaming-house here over the
way, got a thousand Ry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lls (God knows by what tricks) and I being present judged
many a doubtfull cast on his side, contrary to what my conscience told me: he came
away a winner, and when I thought hee would have given me a Pistolet at least for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
according to the use and custome of giving to men of my fashion, which
stand by upon all occasions, to order differences and to take up quarrells: [Barato <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
originally cheap; but amongst Gamesters</hi> dar Barato <hi>is when a Gamester by way of
courtesie gives something to a stander by: and this in</hi> Spain <hi>is so frequent, that from the
King to the Begger all both give and take this</hi> Barato:] hee pursed up the money and
got him out of the house: I came hastily after him, yet with courteous language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to give me only a matter of four shillings, since hee knew me to bee a good
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54746:240"/>
fellow, and that I had no other kinde of trade or living; for my friends brought mee
up to nothing, nor left me nothing; and this cunning skab, no more Thief then <hi>Cacus,</hi>
nor lesse Cheater then <hi>Andradilla</hi> [<hi>Some famous Cheater in</hi> Spain,] would give mee
but two shillings; so you may see Sir Governour how shamelesse and void of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
hee is: But yfaith if you had not come, I would have made him vomit
out his winning, and hee should have known how many pounds hee had had in the
scale.</p>
                     <p>What say you to this (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) And the other answered, That true it was
which his contrary had said, that hee would give him but two shillings, because hee had
often before given him; and they that expect what shall be given them in courtesie, must
bee mannerly, and take any thing that is given them, in good part, and without stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon termes with the winner, except they knew him to bee a Cheater, and that his
money was unlawfully gotten; and that it might bee seen that hee for his part was
honest, and not a Theef, as the other said, there was no greater signe then his giving
so little; for your Cheaters are alwaies large Tributaries to the lookers on that know
them.</p>
                     <p>Hee saies true (quoth the Steward) and therefore what is your pleasure, Sir, to doe
with these men?</p>
                     <p>Marry thus (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) You Sir, that have wonne, honest, or Knave, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
give your Hackster here presently a hundred Ryalls; besides, you shall disburse
thirty more for the poor of the prison. And you, Sir, that have neither Trade nor
Living, and live odly in this Island, take your hundred Ryalls, and by to morrow get
you out of the Island, and I banish you for tenn yeers, on pain, that if you break this
Order, you accomplish it in another life, by being hanged upon a Gybbet by me, or at
least, by the Hang-man, by my command.</p>
                     <p>The one disbursed, and the other received; this went out of the Island, and that
home to his house: And the Governour that remained, said, Well, it shall cost mee a
fall, but I will put down these Gaming-houses; for I have a kinde of glimpse that they
are very prejudiciall.</p>
                     <p>This at least (quoth one of the Notaries) you cannot remove, because it belongs to a
man of quality, and hee loseth a great deal more at the yeers end then hee gets by his
Cards, Against other petty Gamesters you may shew your authority; for they doe
more mischief, and conceal more abuses, then Gentlemen of qualities houses, where
your famous Cheaters dare not use their slights; and since the vice of play hath turned
to so common a practice, 'tis better to suffer it in houses of fashion, then in poor mens
where they catch a poor snake, and from midnight till morning flay him quick.</p>
                     <p>Well Notary (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) there's much to bee said in this case. And now one
of the Sergeants Yeomen came with a Youth which hee had laid fast hold on, and said;
Sir, this Youth came towards us, and as hee had a glimpse of the Justice, hee turned
his back, and began to scud away like a Dear, a signe hee is some Delinquent; I ranne
after him, and had it not been that hee stumbled and fell, I had never over-taken
him.</p>
                     <p>Why ranst thou fellow (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) To which the young man answered, Sir,
to avoid the many questions that your Constables use to ask. What trade are you of?
a Weaver (said hee.) And what weave you? Iron pegs for Launces, with your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
good leave. You are a pleasant companion Sir, and you presume to play the
Jester: 'tis very well. And whither went you now? To take the Ayre Sir. And
where in this Island would you have taken the Ayre? Where it blows. Good, you
answer to the purpose Youth; make account then that I am the Ayre, and that I blow
a stern on you, and steer you to the prison. Goe to, lay hold on him, carry him; for to
night Ile make him sleep without Ayre in the prison. I protest (quoth the Youth) you
shall as soon make me King, as make me sleep this night in Prison. Why (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>)
have not I power to apprehend thee, and free thee when I please? For all your power
(said the Youth) you shall not make me sleep this night in Prison. No? you shall see
(quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi>) Carry him presently where hee shall see his error; and lest the Jaylor
<pb facs="tcp:54746:241"/>
should for a bribe befriend him, Ile lay a penalty of two thousand Crownes upon him,
if he let thee stirre a foot out of the prison. All this is needlesse, said the Youth: the
businesse is, All the world shall not make me sleepe this night in prison. Tell mee,
fiend, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> hast thou some Angell to free thee, or take thy shackles off that
I meane to have clapped on thee? Well, Sir, (quoth the Youth very pleasantly) let's
come to reason, and to the matter. Suppose you command mee to bee carried to prison,
and that I have shackles and chaines put upon mee and that I bee put into a dungeon,
and that there bee extraordinary penalties inflicted upon the Jaylor if hee let mee out:
for all that, if I meane not to sleepe, or to joyne my eye-lids together all night; Can
you with all your Authority make mee sleepe against my will?</p>
                     <p>No indeed (said the Secretarie) the fellow is in the right: so that (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>)
your forbearing to sleepe, is onely to have your owne will, but not to contradict mine.
No otherwise, Sir, (quoth the Youth) not so much as in thought.</p>
                     <p>Well, God bee with you, (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) get you home to bed, and God send
you good rest, I meane not to disturbe you; but let mee advise you, that henceforward
you bee not so conceited with the Justice; for you may meet with one that will clap
your wit to your noddle.</p>
                     <p>The yong man went his way, and the Governour went on with his Rounding,
and a while after there came two Yeomen with a man in hold, and said, Sir, heres one
that seemes to bee a man, but is none, but a woman, and not ill-favoured, clad in a
mans habit. Then they set two or three Lanthornes to his face, and perceived a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
face, to look to, of about sixteen yeers of age; her haire plaited up with a cawle of
Gold and greene silke, as faire as a thousand Pearles: they beheld her all over, and saw
that shee had on her a paire of Carnation silke stockins, and white Taffata garters frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with gold, and embroidered with pearle; her long breeches were of cloth of gold,
and the ground-worke greene, with a loose Cassocke or Jerkin of the same, opened on
both sides, under which shee had also a Doublet of cloth of gold, the ground white:
her shooes were white mens shooes, shee had no sword, but a very faire hatched Dagger,
with many rings upon her fingers.</p>
                     <p>Finally, shee pleased them all very well, but none of them knew her. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the place said, they could not ghesse who shee should bee; and they that
were the contrivers of the trickes against <hi>Sancho,</hi> were those that most seemed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
because that accident and chance was not purposed by them: so they were in
suspence, to see what would bee the issue of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was amazed at the maidens beautie, and hee askt her who shee was, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shee would, and what occasion had mooved her to clad her selfe in that habit?</p>
                     <p>Shee, with her eyes fixt upon the earth, most shamefac'dly answered.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I cannot tell you in publike, what concerns mee so much to bee kept secret:
onely this let mee tell you; I am no theefe nor malefactor, but an unhappie maid, forced
by some jealousies to breake the <hi>Decorum</hi> due to my honesty. Which when the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heard, hee said to <hi>Sancho;</hi> Sir, command the company aside, that this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may tell her tale without being abashed. The Governour gave his command, and
all of them went a side, but the Steward, the Carver, and Secretary. Being thus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
the maid proceeded, saying;</p>
                     <p>I, Sirs, am daughter to <hi>Pedro Perez Mazorca,</hi> Farmer of this towns woolls, that
often useth to goe and come to my Fathers house, There's no likelihood in this, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
quoth the Steward; for I know <hi>Pedro Perez</hi> very well, and know that
hee hath never a childe, neither Male nor Female: besides, you say hee is your Father,
and by and by you add, that hee useth to goe often to your fathers house. I thought
upon that too (quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi>) Why alas (quoth shee) I am so frighted, that I know
not what I say: but true it is, that I am daughter to <hi>Diego de la Liana,</hi> whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
you all know. This may bee (said the Steward) for I know <hi>Diego de la Liana</hi>
to bee an honest and a wealthy Gentleman, and that hee hath a sonne and a daughter,
and since hee hath beene a widdower, there's none in this towne can say hee hath seene
his daughters face; for hee keepes her so close, that hee scarce gives the Sunn leave
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54746:241"/>
to look on her: and for all that, Fame sayes shee is wondrous faire.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (quoth the Maid) and I am that daughter, whether Fame lie or no, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
my beauty; now you are satisfied, since you have beheld mee; and with this
shee began to weep tenderly. Which when the Secretary saw, hee whispered the Carver
in the eare, and told him; Doubtlesse some matter of consequence hath befaln this
poore Virgin, since in this habit, and at this time of night, being so well borne, she is
from her home. There's no doubt of that (quoth the Carver) for her teares too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the suspition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> comforted her the best hee could, and bad her without feare, tell w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>at had
befalne her; for that all of them would strive to give her remedie with all possible
diligence.</p>
                     <p>The businesse, Sirs, quoth shee, is this: My Father hath kept mee close these tenne
yeeres; for so long it is since my Mother died: in the house wee have a Chappell, where
Masse is said, and I in all this time have seene nothing but the Sunne by day, and the
Moon and starres by night: neither know I what streets, or Market-places, or Churches
are, nor men, except my Father, a Brother of mine, and <hi>Pedro Perez</hi> the Farmer, who
because hee useth to come ordinarily to our house, it came into my minde to say hee
was my Father, because I would conceale the right. This keeping mee close, and denying
mee to stirre not so much as to the Church, hath this good while discomforted mee,
and I had a desire to see the world, at least, the towne where I was borne, as thinking
this longing of mine was not against the <hi>Decorum</hi> that Maidens of my birth ought to
observe: when I heard talke of Bull-baitings, running with Reedes, and representing
Comedies: I asked my Brother that is a yeere yonger then I, what kinde of things those
were, and many others, which I have not seene; and hee told mee as well as hee could:
but all was to enflame my desire the more to see.</p>
                     <p>Finally, to shorten my mis-fortune, I entreated my Brother, (I would I had never
done it:) and then shee renued her teares.</p>
                     <p>Then said the Steward, On, Gentlewoman, and make an end of telling us what
hath befalne you: for you hold us all in suspence, with your words, and your teares.</p>
                     <p>Few words have I to say (quoth shee) but many teares to weep: for they bee the
fruits of ill-placed desires.</p>
                     <p>The Maids beauty was now planted in the Carvers heart, and hee held up his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne
againe, to behold her afresh; and it seemed to him, that shee wept not teares
but seed-pearl, or morning dew: and hee thought higher, that they were liker orientall
Pearles; and his wish was, that her mis-fortune might not bee such, as the shewes of
her mone and sighing might promise.</p>
                     <p>The Governour was mad at the Wenches slownesse and delaying her Story; and
bade her, shee should make an end and hold them no longer in suspence, for that it
was late, and they had much of the towne to walke. Shee betwixt broken sobs, and
halfe-fetcht sighs, said, My misfortune is nothing else, but that I desired my Brother
that hee would cloath mee in mans apparell, in one of his Sutes; and that some night
or other hee would carry mee to see the towne, when my Father should bee asleepe; hee
importuned by my intreaties, condiscended to my request: and putting this Sute on
mee; and hee putting on another of mine, that sits him, as if it were made for him; for
hee hath never a haire upon his chin, and might bee taken for a most beautifull Maid:
this night somewhat above an houre agoe, wee went abroad; and rambling up and
downe, wee have gone thorowout the whole towne: and going homeward, wee saw a
great troope of people comming towards us; and my Brother said, Sister: this is the
Round, Take you to your heeles, and put wings to them, and follow mee, that wee
bee not knowne: for it will bee ill for us; and this said, hee turned his back, and began,
I say not, to runne, but flye: I within foure or five steppes fell downe for feare: and
then came this Officer that brought mee before you; where, for my vilde longing,
I am ashamed before so many people. So that, Gentlewoman, (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) no
other mishap hath befalne you; neither was it jealousie, as you said in the beginning of
your tale, that made you goe abroad? Nothing else (said shee) nor jealousies: but a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:242"/>
desire to see the world, and which exetended no further then to see this Towns streets:
And the comming now of two other Yeomen with her Brother, confirmed this to bee
true, whom one of them overtook when hee fled from his Sister: Hee had nothing on
but a rich Kirtle, and a half Mantle of blue Damask, edg'd with a broad gold Lace: his
head without any kinde of dressing or adornment, then his own locks; which by reason
of their colour and curling, seemed to bee rings of gold. Aside they went with the
Governour, the Steward, and the Carver; and not letting his Sister hear, they asked
why hee came in that habit? And hee with the same shamefac'd bashfullnesse told the
same Tale that his Sister had done; at which the enamoured Carver was wonderfully
pleased. But the Governour said to them, Truly hoe, this hath been a great childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in you; and you needed not so many sighs and tears to tell such a piece of foolish
boldnesse; for it had been enough if you had said, Wee, such and such a one, went out
of our Fathers house only for curiositie to walk up and down the Town, and there had
been an end, without your sighing and your whining on Gods name.</p>
                     <p>You say true Sir (quoth the Maid) but you may think that I was so troubled, that I
could not tell how to behave my self.</p>
                     <p>There's nothing lost (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) let's goe, and wee will leave you in your fathers
house; perhaps hee will not have missed you; and from hence-forward bee not such
children, and so longing to see the world; for the honest Maid better at home with a
bone broken, then a gadding: The Woman and the Hen are lost with stragling: and
let me tell you too; shee that desires to see, hath a desire likewise to bee seen, and
I say no more.</p>
                     <p>The Youth thanked the Governour for the favour hee did them, to let them goe
home; whither they went, for it was not farre from thence.</p>
                     <p>Home they came; and the Youth throwing a little stone at one of the Iron win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows;
straight there came a Maid-servant down, that sate up for them, and opened
them the door, and in they went, leaving those without as well to admire her gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and beauty, as the desire they had to see the world by night, without stirring out
of the Town: but they attributed all to their slander age.</p>
                     <p>The Carvers heart was strucken thorow; and hee purposed the next day to demand
her of her Father to Wife, assuring himself hee would not deny her him, because hee
was the Dukes servant: <hi>Sancho</hi> too had a certain longing and inkling to marry the
Youth with his Daughter <hi>Sanchica:</hi> and hee determined to put the matter in practice
betimes, as thinking that a Governours Daughter was fit for any Husband: and so the
Round was ended for that night; and some two dayes after his Government too, with
which all his designes were lopped off and blotted out, as hereafter shall bee said.</p>

true History, sayes, That when <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> went out of her
Chamber, to goe to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> lodging, another Wayting-woman
that lay with her, perceived her: and as all of them have
an itch to smell after novelties, shee went after so softly, that
the good <hi>Rodriguez</hi> perceived it not: and as soon as the Waiting-woman
saw her goe in to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that shee might not bee

to put this into the Duchesses head; and so told her that <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> was
in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Chamber; the Duchesse told the Duke, and asked his leave, that shee
and <hi>Altisidora</hi> might goe see what the Matron would have with <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> the

suffer it, nor <hi>Altisidora</hi> neither: so, full of rage and greedy to revenge, they entred the
Chamber so dainly, and stabbed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with their nails, and banged the Woman,
as hath been related: for affronts that are directly done against beauty, doe awaken
womens choller, and inflame in them a desire of revenge.</p>
                     <p>The Duchesse told the Duke what had passed, which made him passing merry: and
the Duchesse proceeding with her intention of mirth and pastime with <hi>Don Quixote,</hi>

it, being busied in his Government) to <hi>Teresa Panca</hi> with her Husbands Letter, and
and another from her self, and a chain of fair Corall for a token.</p>
                     <p>The Story too tells us, that the Page was very discreet and wittie, and with a desire
to serve his Lords, hee went with a very good will to <hi>Sancho's</hi> Town; and before hee
entred into it, hee saw a company of women washing in a brook; whom hee asked,
if they could tell him, if there lived in that Town a woman, whose name was <hi>Teresa
Panca,</hi> wife to one <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> Squire to a Knight called <hi>Don-Quixote de la
Mancha;</hi> to which question a little Girle that was washing there, stood up and said,
That <hi>Teresa Panca</hi> is my Mother, and that <hi>Sancho</hi> my Father, and that Knight our
Master.</p>
                     <p>Well then Damzell (quoth the Page) come and bring me to your Mother; for I
bring her a Letter and a Present from your said Father.</p>
                     <p>That I will with a very good will Sir, said the Wench, that seemed to bee about a
some fourteen yeers of age, more or lesse: and leaving the clothes that shee was wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to another companion of hers, without dressing her head or putting on stockings
and shooes (for shee was bare-legged, and with her haire about her eares) shee leaped
before the Pages Beast hee rode on, and said, Come Sir, for our house is just as you

                     <p>Well, I have so good news for her (quoth hee) that shee may thank God for it.</p>

Come out, come out: for here's a Gentleman hath Letters and other things from my
good Father: at which noise <hi>Teresa Panca</hi> her Mother came out, spinning a rowle
of Flax, with a Russet Petti-coat, and it seemed by the shortnesse of it, that it had been
cut off at the Placket; and shee had Russet bodies of the same, and shee was in her

but shee was strong, tough, sinowie, and raw-boned; who seeing her Daughter,
and the Page a horse-back, said, What's the matter, child? What Gentleman is this?
A servant of my Lady <hi>Teresa Panca's</hi> (quoth the Page:) so, doing and speaking, hee
flung himselfe from his horse, and with great humilitie went to prostrate himselfe
before the Lady <hi>Teresa,</hi> saying, My Lady <hi>Teresa,</hi> give mee your hands to kisse, as you
are lawfull and particular Wife to my Lord <hi>Don Sancho Panca,</hi> proper Governour
of the Island <hi>Barataria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ah good Sir, forbear I pray do not doe so, quoth <hi>Teresa:</hi> for I am no Court-noll, but
a poore Husband-woman, a Ploughmans daughter, and wife to a Squire Errant, and
not a Governour.</p>
                     <p>You are (quoth the Page) a most worthy wife, to an Arch-worthy Governour:
and for proofe of what I say I pray receive this Letter, and this token; when instantly
hee plucked out of his pocket a Corall string, with the lac'd Beads of gold, and put it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her neck, and said, This Letter is from the Governour; and another that I bring;
and these Corals are from my Lady the Duchesse that sends me to you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teresa</hi> was amazed, and her daughter also: and the Wench said, Hang mee, if our
Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> have not a hand in this businesse; and hee it is that hath given my
Father this Government or Earledome that he so often promised him.</p>
                     <p>You say true (quoth the Page) for, for Signior <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> sake, Signior <hi>Sancho
Panca</hi> is now Governour of the Island <hi>Barataria,</hi> as you shall see by this Letter.</p>
                     <p>Reade it, gentle Sir, said <hi>Teresa:</hi> for though I can spin, I cannot reade a jot; nor
I neither, added <hi>Sanchica:</hi> but stay a little and Ile call one that shall; either the Vicar
himselfe, or the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> who will both come hither with all their
hearts to heare newes of my Father.</p>
                     <p>You need not call any body, said hee: for though I cannot spin, yet I can reade,
and therefore I will reade it; so hee did thorowout: which, because it was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
it is not now set downe here and then hee drew out the Duchesses, which was
as followeth:</p>

I have sent you (my beloved) a string of Corall Beads, with the tens of

                     <p>Lord! quoth <hi>Teresa,</hi> when she heard the Letter, what a good plain meek-Lady 'tis!
God bury me with such Ladies, and not with your stately ones that are used in this town,
who think, because they are Jantle-folks, the winde must not touch them: and they
go so fantastically to Church, as if they were Queenes at least, and they think it a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to um to looke upon a poor Countrey Woman: But looke you, here's a good
Lady, that though she bee a Duchesse, calls mee friend, and useth mee as if I were her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall:

her Acorns, Signior mine, I will send her Ladyship a whole Pecke, that every body,
shall behold, and admire them for their bignesse: and now, <hi>Sanchica,</hi> doe thou see
that this Gentleman bee welcome: set his Horse up, and get some Egges out of the
Stable, and cut some Bacon: hee shall fare like a Prince, for the good newes hee hath
brought us, and his good face deserves it all: in the meane time I will goe tell my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of this good newes, and to our father Vicar, and Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, who
have beene, and still are so much thy fathers friends.</p>
                     <p>Yes marry will I (quoth <hi>Sanchica:</hi> but harke you: you must give mee half that
string, for I doe not thinke my Ladie Duchesse such a foole, that shee would send it
all to her.</p>
                     <p>'Tis all thine, Daughter, said <hi>Teresa:</hi> but let mee weare it a few dayes about my
neck: for verily, it glads mee to the heart.</p>
                     <p>You will bee glad (quoth the Page) when you see the bundle that I have in my

and hee that brings it too.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teresa</hi> went out with her chaine about her neck, and playd with her fingers upon
her Letters, as if they had been a <hi>Timbrel:</hi> and meeting by chance with the Vicar, and
<hi>Samson Carrasce,</hi> shee began to dance, and to say, yfaith now there is none poore of
the kinn, we have a little Government; No, no. Now let the proudest Gentlewoman
of um all meddle with mee, and Ile shew her a new tricke.</p>
                     <p>What madnesse is this, <hi>Teresa Panca,</hi> and what Papers are these? No madnesse
(quoth shee) but these are Letters from Duchesses and Governours: and these I weare
about my neck are fine Corals; the <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater-nosters</hi> are of beaten
gold, and I am a Governesse</p>
                     <p>Now God shield us <hi>Teresa:</hi> wee understand you not, neither know wee what you

                     <p>There you may see (quoth <hi>Teresa</hi>) and gave um the Letters.</p>
                     <p>The Vicar reads them that <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> might heare: so hee and the Vicar look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
one upon the other, wondring at what they had read.</p>
                     <p>And the Bachelor asked, Who brought those Letters? <hi>Teresa</hi> answered, that they
<pb facs="tcp:54746:244"/>
should goe home with her and they should see the Messenger; a young Youth as fair as
a golden Pine-Apple, and that hee brought her another Present twice as good.</p>
                     <p>The Vicar took the Corals from her neck and beheld them again and again, and
assuring himself that they were right, hee began to wonder afresh, and said; By my
Coat I swear, I know not what to say or think of these Letters and Tokens: for on the
one side, I see and touch the finenesse of these Corals; and on the other, that a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
sends to beg two dozen of Acornes. Come crack me that nut, quoth <hi>Carasco.</hi>
Well, let us goe see the Bearer of this Letter, and by him wee will bee informed of these
doubts that are offered. They did so, and <hi>Teresa</hi> went back with them: they found
the Page sifting a little Barley for his Beast, and <hi>Sanchica</hi> cutting a Rasher to* pave it
with Eggs for the Pages dinner, whose presence and attire much contented them both;
[*Para Empedarte. <hi>A pretty metaphor, for in</hi> Spain <hi>they use to fry their Collops and Egs
all together; not as wee doe, first Bacon, and then Eggs: and therefore the Author calls it
paving:</hi>] and after they had courteously saluted him, and hee them, <hi>Samson</hi> asked him
for news as well of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> as <hi>Sancho:</hi> for though they had read <hi>Sancho</hi> and the
Lady Duchesses Letters, yet they were troubled, and could not ghesse what <hi>Sancho's</hi>
Government should mean, especially of an Island, since all or the most that were in the
Mediterranean Sea, belonged to his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>To which the Page answered; That Signior <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> is Governour, 'tis not to be
doubted; but whether it be an Island or no that hee governs, I meddle not with it; 'tis
enough that is a place of above a thousand Inhabitants<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and concerning the Acornes
let mee tell you: My Lady the Duchesse is so plaine and humble, that her sending
for Acornes to this Countrey-woman is nothing. I have knowne when shee hath
sent to borrow a Combe of one of her neighbours, and let mee tell you; The Ladies of
Aragon, though they bee as Noble, yet they stand not so much upon their points, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are so lofty as your Castilians, and they are much plainer.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they were in the middest of this discourse, <hi>Sanchica</hi> came leaping with her
lap full of Egges, and asked the Page; Tell mee, Sir, doth my Father weare pained hose
since his being Governour? I never marked it, quoth the Page, but sure hee doth.
Oh God, quoth shee, what a sight it would bee, to see my Father in his linnen hose
first! how say you? that ever since I was borne I have had a desire to see my Father in
pain'd hose. With many of these you shall see him (quoth the Page) if you live. And
I protest, if his Government last him but two Moneths longer, hee will bee likely to
weare a Cap with a Beaver.</p>
                     <p>The Vicar and Bachelor perceived very well, that the Page played the Jack with
them; but the goodnesse of the Corall-Beads and the hunting suit that <hi>Sancho</hi> sent
made all straight again, for <hi>Teresa</hi> had shewed them the apparell, and they could not
but laugh at <hi>Sanchica's</hi> desire, and most when <hi>Teresa</hi> said, Master Vicar, pray will you
hearken out if there bee any body that goe toward <hi>Madrid</hi> or <hi>Toledo,</hi> that they
may buy me a Farthingale round and well made, just in the fashion, and of the best sort;
for in truth, in truth, I mean to credit my Husbands Government as much as I can;
and if I bee angry, Ile to Court my self too, and have my Coach as well as the
best: for shee that hath a Governour to her Husband may very well have it and
maintain it.</p>
                     <p>And why not Mother (quoth <hi>Sanchica?</hi>) and the sooner the better, though those
that see mee set with my Mother in the Coach should say, Look yee on Mistrisse <hi>Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi>
good-man Garlike-eaters daughter, how shee is set and stretcht at ease in the
Coach, as if shee were a Pope <hi>Ioane:</hi> but let them tread in the dirt, and let me goe
in my Coach: a pox on all back-biters; the Fox fares best when hee is cursed. Say I
well Mother mine? Very well (quoth shee) and my good <hi>Sancho</hi> foretold me of all
these blessings and many more; and thou shalt see Daughter. Ile never rest till I am a
Countesse; for all is but to begin well, and (as I have often heard thy good Father say,
who is likewise the father of Proverbs:) Look not a given horse in the mouth: when a
Government is given thee, take it; when an Earldome, gripe it; and when they hist, hist,
to thee with a reward [<hi>hiss, hiss, as if it were the calling of a dog to give him meat</hi>]
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54746:244"/>
take it up. No, no, be carelesse, and answer not good fortune when she knocks at your
doors. And what care I (quoth <hi>Sanchica</hi>) what hee sayes that sees me stately and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesticall:
there's a dog in a doublet and such like.</p>
                     <p>When the Vicar heard all this, hee said, I cannot beleeve but all the stock of the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's</hi>
were borne with a bushell of Proverbs in their bellies, I never saw any of them that
did not scatter them at all times, and upon all occasions. You say true (quoth the
Page) for Signior <hi>Sancho</hi> the Governour speaks them every foot; and though many of
them bee nothing to the purpose, yet they delight, and my Lady the Duchesse and the
Duke doe much celebrate them. That still you should affirm Sir, that this of <hi>Sancho's</hi>
Government is true, and that there can bee any Duchesse in the world that sends him
Presents, and writes to him; for wee, although wee see them, and have read the Letters,
yet we cannot beleeve it &amp; we think that this is one of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> our Country-man
his inventions, who thinks that all are by way of Enchantment: So that I am about to
desire to feel and touch you, to see whether you bee an ayrie Ambassador, or a man of
flesh and blood.</p>
                     <p>Sir (quoth the Page) all I know of my self, is, that I am a reall Ambassador, and that
Signior <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> is an effective Governour, and that my Lords the Duke and
Duchesse may give, and have given the said Government; and I have heard say that the
said <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> demeans himself most robustiously in it. If in this there bee any
Enchantment, you may dispute it amongst your selves, for I know no more, by an oath
I shall swear, which is, By the life of my Parents, who are alive, and I love them very
well.</p>
                     <p>It may very well bee (quoth the Bachelour) but <hi>dubitat Augustinus.</hi> Doubt it
who so will (quoth the Page) I have told you the truth, which shall alwaies prevaile
above lyes, as the oyle above the water: and if not <hi>operibus credite &amp; non verbis,</hi> one
of you goe with me, and you shall see with your eyes what you will not beleeve with
your ears. That journey will I goe (quoth <hi>Sanchica;</hi>) you shall carrie me Sir, at your
horses crupper, and Ile goe with a very good will to see my Father. Governours
Daughters (quoth hee) must not travell alone, but accompanied with Carroches and
Horse-Litters, and good store of Servants. Marry (quoth <hi>Sancha</hi>) I can goe as well
upon a young Asse-Colt, as upon a Coach; you have a daintie piece of mee no doubt.</p>
                     <p>Peace wench (said <hi>Teresa</hi>) thou knowest not what thou sayest, and this Gentleman
is in the right; the times are altered: When thy Father was <hi>Sancho,</hi> then mightest
thou bee <hi>Sancha;</hi> but now hee is Governour, Madam; and I know not whether I
have said ought. Mistris <hi>Teresa</hi> sayes more then shee is aware of (quoth the Page) and
now pray let me dine and bee quickly dispatcht, for I must return this afternoon. Then
(quoth the Vicar) you shall doe Penance with mee to day; for Mistris <hi>Teresa</hi> hath
more good will then good cheer to wellcome so good a guest. The Page refused, but
for his better fare, hee was forced to accept of the kindnesse; and the Vicar carried
him the more willingly, that hee might have time to ask at leisure after <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
exploits. The Bachelor offered <hi>Teresa</hi> to write the answers of her Letters, but shee
would not that hee should deal in her affairs; for shee held him to bee a Scoffer: and
so shee gave a little rowle of bread and a couple of eggs to a little Monk that could
write, who wrote her two Letters, one for her Husband, and the other for the Duchesse,
framed by her own pate, and are not the worst in all this grand History, as you may
see hereafter.</p>

good as touch.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He day appeared after the Governours Rounding night, in which
the Carver slept not a whit, being busied in thinking upon the
face, feature and beauty of the disguised Damzell: and the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
spent the remainder of it in writing to his Lords <hi>Sancho
Panca's</hi> words and actions, both which hee equally admired; for
both were mixt with certain appearances of Discreet and Fool.</p>
                     <p>The Governour in fine was gotten up, and by Doctor <hi>Pedro
Rezio's</hi> appointment, hee broke his fast with a little Conserve,
and some two or three spoonfulls of cold water, which <hi>Sancho</hi> would willingly have
changed for a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes; but seeing there was no remedy,
hee passed it over, though with much grief of minde and wearinesse of Stomack; for
<hi>Pedro Rezio</hi> made him beleeve, that few dishes, and those delicate, did quicken the wit,
which was the only thing for persons that bore Rule, and weighty Offices; where they
must benefit themselves, not only with corporall force, but strength of understanding
too.</p>
                     <p>With this Sophistry <hi>Sancho</hi> was almost starved, so that in secret he cursed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and also him that gave it him; but yet, with his hunger and his Conserve hee
sate in Judgement that day, and the first thing that came before him, was a doubt that a
stranger proposed unto him, the Steward and the rest of the fraternity being present,
and it was this.</p>
                     <p>Sir, a main River divided two parts of one Lordship (I pray mark, for it is a case of
great importance, and somewhat difficult:) I say then that upon this River there was
a Bridge, and at the end of it a Gallowes, and a kind of Judgement Hall, in which
there were ordinarily four Judges, that Judged according to the Law that the owner
of the River, Bridge, and Lordship had established, which was this: If any one bee to
passe from one side of this Bridge to the other, hee must first swear whether hee goes,
and what his businesse is: If hee swear true, let him passe; if hee lye let him bee hanged
upon the Gallowes that shews there without remission. This Law being divulged, and
the rigorous condition of it, many passed by, and presently by their oaths, it was seen
whether they said true, and the Judges let them passe freely. It fell out that they took
one mans oath, who swore and said, that hee went to bee hanged upon that Gallows,
and for nothing else.</p>
                     <p>The Judges were at a stand, and said, If wee let this man passe, hee lyed in his oath,
and according to the Law hee ought to die; and if wee hang him, hee swore hee went
to die upon the Gallows, and having sworn truly, by the same Law hee ought to be free.
It is now, Sir Governour, demanded of you, what should bee done with this man, for
the Judges are doubtfull and in suspence; and having had notice of your quick and
elevated understanding, they sent me to you, to desire you on their behalfs to give your
opinion in this intricate and doubtfull case.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) Truly these Judges that send you to me might have saved
a labour; for I am one that have as much wit as a Setting-dogg: but howsoever repeat
me you the businesse once again, that I may understand it, and perhaps I may hit the
mark.</p>
                     <p>The Demandant repeated again, and again, what hee had said before: And <hi>Sancho</hi>
said, In my opinion it is instantly resolved, as thus:</p>
                     <p>The man swears that hee goes to die upon the Gallows; and if hee dye so, hee swore
true; and so by the Law deserves to passe free: and yet if hee be not hanged, he swore
false, and by the same Law hee ought to be hanged. 'Tis just as Master Governour hath
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54746:245"/>
said (quoth the Messenger;) and concerning the understanding of the Case, there is no
more to bee required or doubted. I say then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) that they let that part of
the man passe that spoke truth, and that which told a lye, let them hang it, and so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Law shall bee litterally accomplished.</p>
                     <p>Why Sir (said the Demandant) then the man must bee divided into two parts, lying
and true; and if hee bee divided hee must needs dye, and so there is nothing of the Law
fulfilled, and it is expresly needfull, that the Law bee kept.</p>
                     <p>Come hither honest fellow (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) either I am a very Leek, or this Passenger
you speak of hath the same reason to dye, as to live and passe the Bridge; for if the
truth save him, the lye condemns him equally: which being so as it is, I am of opinion
that you tell the Judges that sent you to me, That since the reasons to save or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
him bee in one rank that they let him passe freely; for it is ever more praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to doe good, then to doe ill; and this would I give under my hand if I could
write: and in this Case I have not spoken from my self; but I remember one precept
amongst many others, that my Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> gave me the night before I came to
be Governour, which was; That when Justice might bee any thing doubtfull, I should
leave, and apply my self to pitty; and it hath pleased God I should remember it in this
Case, which hath falne out pat.</p>
                     <p>'Tis right (quoth the Steward;) and sure <hi>Licurgus</hi> Law-giver to the Lacedemonians,
could not have given a better sentence then that which the Grand <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> hath
given. And now this mornings audience may end, and I will give order that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
may dine plentifully. That I desire (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and let's have fair play: Let
me dine, and then let Cases and doubts rain upon me, and Ile snuff them apace.</p>
                     <p>The Steward was as good as his word, holding it to bee a matter of conscience to
starve so discreet a Governour: Besides, his purpose was to make an end with him
that night, performing the last jest, which hee had in Commission towards him. It
hapned then, that having eaten contrary to the prescriptions and orders of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Tirte fuera,</hi> when the cloth was taken away, there came in a Poste with a Letter
of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> to the Governour. <hi>Sancho</hi> commanded the Secretary to read it
to himself, and that if there came no secret in it, hee should read it aloud. The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
did so, and sodainly running it over, said, It may well bee read out, for this that
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> writes to you, deserves to bee stamped and written in golden Letters,
and thus it is.</p>

                           <head>Don-Quixotes Letter to Sancho Pança, Governour
of the Island Barataria.</head>
                           <p>WHen I thought (friend <hi>Sancho</hi>) to have heard news of
thy negligence and folly, I heard it of thy discretion, for
which I gave to God particular thanks. I hear thou Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernest
as if thou wert a man, and that thou art a man as if thou wert a
beast, such is thy humility thou usest; yet let me note unto thee, That it is
very necessary and convenient many times, for the Authority of a place
to goe against the humility of the heart; for the adornment of the person
that is in eminent Offices, must be according to their greatnesse, and
not according to the measure of the meek condition to which hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
Goe well clad; for a stake well dressed, seems not to bee so:
I say not to thee that thou weare toyes, or gawdy gay things; not that
<pb facs="tcp:54746:246"/>
being a Iudge thou goe like a Souldier, but that thou adorn thy self with
such a habit as thy place requires; so that it bee handsome and neat.</p>
                           <p>To get the good will of those thou Governest, amongst others, thou
must doe two things; the one, to bee courteous to all, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told thee of; and the other, to see that there bee plenty of suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
for there is nothing that doth more weary the hearts of the poor
then hunger and dearth.</p>
                           <p>Make not many Statute Laws, and those thou doest make, see they bee
good, but chiefly that they be observed and kept; for Statutes not kept,
are the same as if they were not made; and doth rather shew that the
Prince had Wisedome and Authority to make them, then valour to see that
they should bee kept: And Laws that only threaten, and are not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
become like the beam, King of Frogs, that at first scarred them, but
in time they despised, and gat up on the top of it.</p>
                           <p>Bee a Father of Virtue, but a Father-in-law of Vice.</p>
                           <p>Bee not alwaies cruell, nor alwaies mercifull, choose a mean betwixt.
these two extreams, for this is a point of discretion.</p>
                           <p>Visit the Prisons, the Shambles, and the Markets, for in such places
the Governours presence is of much importance.</p>
                           <p>Comfort the Prisoners that hope to be quickly dispatcht.</p>
                           <p>Be a Bull-begger to the Butchers, and a scar-Crow to the Huckster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
for the same reason.</p>
                           <p>Shew not thy selfe (though perhaps thou art, which yet I beleeve not)
Covetous, or a Whore-monger, or a Glutton; for when the Town, and
those that converse with thee, know which way thou art inclined, there
they will set upon thee, till they cast thee down head-long.</p>
                           <p>View and re-view, passe and re-passe thine eyes over the Instructions
I gave thee in writing, before thou wentest from hence to thy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thou shalt see how thou findest in them, if thou observe them,
an allowance to help thee to bear and passe over the troubles that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to Governours,</p>
                           <p>Write to my Lords, and shew thy self thankfull; for Ingratitude is
the Daughter of Pride, and one of the greatest sins that is: and hee
that is thankfull to those that have done him good, gives a testimony that
he will be so to God too, that hath done him so much good, and dayly doth
continue it</p>
                           <p>My Lady Duchesse dispatcht a Messenger a purpose with thy apparel;
and another present to thy Wife <hi>Teresa Pança;</hi> every minute we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

                              <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54746:246"/>I have been somewhat ill at ease of late with a certain Cat businesse that
hapned to me not very good for my nose, but 'twas nothing; for if there be
Enchanters that misuse me, others there be that defend me. Let me know
if the Steward that is with thee had any hand in <hi>Trifaldi's</hi> actions, as thou
suspectedst: and let me hear likewise of all that befalls thee, since the way
is so short; besides, I think to leave this idle life e're long, for I was not born
to it.</p>
                           <p>Here is a business at present, that I beleeve will bring me in disgrace
with these Nobles: but though it much concern me I care not; for indeed I
had rather comply with my Profession, then with their wills, according to
the saying; <hi>Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas.</hi> I write thee this

not given you notice of my well or ill being at this Governmeut; in which I
am now more hungry, then when you and I travelled in the Woods and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</p>
                           <p>My Lord the Duke wrote me the other day, by way of advice, that there
were certain Spies entred the Island, to kill me: but hitherto I have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
none but a certain Doctor, who is entertained in this Town, to kill
as many Governours as come to it: and his name is Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio</hi>
born in <hi>Tirte a fuera:</hi> that you may see what a name this is for me to fear
lest hee kill me.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb facs="tcp:54746:247"/>This aforesaid Doctor sayes of himself, that hee cures not infirmities
when they are in present being, but prevents them before they come:
and the Medicines he useth, are dyet upon dyet, till he makes a man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but bare bones; as if leannesse were not a greater sicknesse then a
Calenture.</p>
                           <p>Finally, he hath even starved me, and I am ready to dye for anger:
for when I thought to have comne to this Island to eate good warm
things and to drink cool, and to recreate my body in Holland sheets and
Feather-Beds; I am forced to doe penance as if I were an Hermite:
and because I doe it unwillingly, I beleeve at the upshot the Devill will
have me.</p>
                           <p>Hitherto have I neither had my due, nor taken bribe, and I know not
the reason: for here they tell me that the Governours that use to come to
this Island, before they come, they of the Town either give or lend them a
good sum of money: and this is the ordinary custome, not only in this
Town but in many others also.</p>
                           <p>Last night as I walked the Round, I met with a fair maid in mans
apparell, and a Brother of hers in womans: my Carver fell in love with
the Wench, and purposed to take her to Wife, as hee sayes; and I have
chosen the youth for my sonne in law; and to day both of us will put our
desires in practice with the Father of them both, which is one <hi>Diego de la Liana,</hi>
a Gentleman and an old Christian, as much as you would
desire. I visit the Market places (as you advised me) and yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
found a Huckster that sold new Hazel-nuts, and it was proved
against her, that shee had mingled the new with a bushell of old, that
were rotten and without kernels; I judged them all to bee given to the
Hospitall Boyes that could very well distinguish them; and gave sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
on her, That shee should not come into the Market-place in fifteen
dayes after: 'twas told me, that I did most valorously: All I can tell
you is, that it is the common report in this Town, That there is no worse
People in the world then these women of the Market-places; for all of
them are impudent, shamelesse, and ungodly; and I beleeve it to bee
so by those that I have seen in other Towns. That my Lady the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
hath written to my Wife <hi>Teresa Pança,</hi> and sent her a
Token, as you say, it pleaseth me very well, and I will endeavour at
fit time to shew my self thankfull: I pray doe you kisse her hands on my
behalf, and tell her, her kindenesse is not ill bestowed, as shall after
appear.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="233" facs="tcp:54746:247"/>I would not that you should have any thwart-reckonings of distaste
with those Lords; for if you be displeased with them, 'tis plain it must
needs redound to my dammage; and 'twere unfit that, since you advise
me not to be unthankfull, you should be so to them that have shewed you
so much kindenesse, and by whom you have been so well welcommed in
their Castle.</p>
                           <p>That of your Cat businesse I understand not; but I suppose 'tis some of
those ill feats that the wicked Enchanters are wont to use toward you; I
shall know of you when we meet. I would fain have sent you something
from hence, but I know not what, except it were some little Canes to
make Squirts, which with Bladders too they make very curiously in this
place: but if my Office last, Ile get something worth the sending.</p>
                           <p>If my Wife <hi>Teresa Pança</hi> write to me, pay the Portage, and send
me the Letter: for I have a wonderfull desire to know of the Estate of my
House, my Wife and Children: and so God keep you from ill-minded
Enchanters, and deliver me well and peaceably from this Government;
for I doubt it, and think to lay my bones here, according as the Doctor

brought in from whencesoever they would; only with this Proviso, To tell the place
from whence they came, to put prices to them according to their value and goodnesse:

                     <p>He ordained likewise, That no blinde-man should sing miracles in Verse, except they
brought authenticall testimonies of the truth of them: for he thought that the most
they sung, were false and prejudiciall to the true.</p>
                     <p>He created also a Constable for the poor, not that should persecute, but examine
them to know if they were so: for under colour of fained maimnesse, and false sores,
the Hands are Theeves, and Health is a Drunkard.</p>
                     <p>In conclusion, he ordered things so well, that to this day they are fam'd, and kept in
that place, and are called, <hi>The Ordinances of the Grand Governour Sancho Pança.</hi>

Donna Rodriguez.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ID Hamete</hi> tells us, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> being recovered of his scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
hee thought the life he had led in that Castle, was much against
the Order of Knighthood he profest: so he determined to crave
leave of the Dukes to part towards <hi>Saragoza,</hi> whose Justs drew
neer, where he thought to gain the Armour that useth to be obtained
in them. And being one day at the Table with the Dukes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to put his intention in execution, and to ask leave: Behold,
unlookt for, two women came in at the great Hall door, clad (as it after appeared) in
mourning from head to foot: and one of them comming to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> shee fell
down all along at his feet, with her mouth sowed to them; and she groaned so sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and so profoundly, that she put all that beheld her into a great confusion: and
though the Dukes thought it was some trick their servants would put upon <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>
notwithstanding, seeing with what earnestnesse the woman sighed, groaned
and wept, they were a little doubtfull and in suspence, till <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
raised her from the ground, and made her discover her self, and take her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
from her blubbered face. She did so, and appeared to bee (what could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined)
<hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> the Waiting-women of the house; and the other in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was her wronged Daughter, abused by a rich Farmers sonne. All were in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that knew her, especially the Dukes: for though they knew her to be foolish, and
of a good mould that way; yet not to be so neer mad.</p>
                     <p>Finally, <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> turning to the Lords, she said, May it please your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
to give me leave to impart a thing to this Knight; for it behooves me to
come out of a businesse, into which the boldnesse of a wicked Raskall hath thrust
me.</p>
                     <p>The Duke said, he gave her leave, and that she should impart what she would to Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> She directing her voice and gesture to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> said, Some
dayes since, valorous Knight, I related to you the wrong and trecherie that a wicked
Farmer hath done to my beloved Daughter, the unfortunate one here now present;
and you promised me to undertake for her to right this wrong that hath been done
her: and now it hath come to my notice, that you mean to part from this Castle in quest
of your Adventures (God send them) and therefore my request is, that before you
scowre the wayes, you would defie this untamed Rustick, and make him marry my
Daughter, according to the promise he gave her before he coupled with her: For to
think that my Lord the Duke will doe me Justice, is to seek Pears from the Elme; for
the reason, that I have plainly told you; and so God give you much health, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
not us.</p>
                     <p>To these reasons, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered with great gravity and <hi>Prosopopeia:</hi> Good
Matron, temper your tears, and save your sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and I am firmly resolved to engage
my self to right your Daughter; for whom it had been much better, not to have been
so easie of beleeving her Lovers promises, which for the most part are light in making,
but heavy in accomplishing: and therefore with my Lord the Dukes leave, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
part in search of this ungodly youg man, and finde and challenge him, and kill
him if he denie to accomplish his promise: For the chief ayme of my profession is, to
pardon the humble, and to chastize the proud; I mean, to succour the wretched, and
to destroy the cruell.</p>
                     <p>You need not (quoth the Duke) be at the pains of seeking the Clown, of whom
the good Matron complaines; neither neede you aske mee leave to defie him,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54746:248"/>
'tis enough, that I know you have done it; and let it bee my charge to give him notice
that he accept the challenge, and come to my Castle to answer for himself, where safe
lists shall bee set up for you both, observing the conditions that in such acts ought to bee
observed; and both your Justices equally, according as Princes are oblieged to doe,
that grant single combat to those that fight within their Dommions. Why, with this
securitie and your Greatnesses licence (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) here I say that for this
once I renounce my Gentry, and doe equalize my self to the meannesse of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;
and so qualifie him to combat with me: and so, though hee bee absent, I challenge
and defie him for that hee did ill to defraud this poor creature that was a Maid, and
now by his Villanie is none, and that he shall either fulfill his word he gave her to marry
her, or die in the demand.</p>
                     <p>And straight plucking off his Glove, he cast it into the midest of the Hall, &amp; the Duke
took it up, saying, That hee (as had been said) in his Vassals name accepted the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and appointed the prefix'd time six dayes after, and the Lists to bee in the Court
of that Castle, and the usuall Armes of Knights, as Launce and Shield, and laced Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with all other pieces without deceit, advantage, or superstition, seen and allowed
by the Judges of the Lists: But first of all 'tis requisite, that this honest Matron, and
this ill Maid commit the right of their cause into Signior <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha's</hi>
hands; for otherwise there will be nothing done; neither will the said challenge be put
in execution.</p>
                     <p>I doe (quoth the Matron:) and I too, said the Daughter, all blubbered and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd,
and in ill taking.</p>
                     <p>This agreement being made, and the Dukes imagining what was to be done in the businesse, the mourners went their wayes, and the Duchesse commanded they should
be used not as their Servants, but like Lady-Adventurers, that came to their house to
ask justice, and served as Strangers, to the wonderment of other servants that knew not
what would become of the madnesse and levity of <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> and her Errant Daughter.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they were in this businesse, to add more mirth to the Feast, and to end the
Comedy: behold where the Page comes in that carried the Letter and tokens to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resa Panca;</hi>
whose arrivall much pleased the Dukes, desirous to know what befell him
in his voyage, and asking him, The Page answered that he could not tell them in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, nor in few words; but that their excellencies would be pleased to reserve it for a
private time, and that in the mean time they would entertain themselves with those
Letters; and taking them out, he gave two to the Duchesse, the superscription of the
one was, <hi>To my Lady Duchesse,</hi> I know not whence: and the other, <hi>To my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
Sancho Pança, <hi>Governour of the Island</hi> Barataria, <hi>whom God prosper longer then mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Duchesse could not be quiet, till she had read her Letter; so openning it and
reading it to her self, and seeing that shee might read it aloud, she did so, that the Duke
and the by-standers might hear it, as followeth.</p>

                           <head>Teresa Pança's Letter to the Duchesse.</head>
                           <p>LLady mine: Your Greatnesses Letter you wrote me, did much
content mee; for I did very much desire it: Your string
of Corals was very good; and my Husbands Hunting-suit comes
not short of it: That your Honour hath made my Consort Governour,
all this Town rejoyceth at it, though there is none that will beleeve
it; especially, the Vicar, Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, and <hi>Samson
<pb facs="tcp:54746:249"/>
Carasco</hi> the Bachelor: but all is one to me, so it bee true, as it is;
let each one say what he will: but if you goe to the truth, had it not
been for the Corall and the Sute I should not have believed it neither;
for all in this Town hold my Husband for a very Leek; and taking
him from his governing a Flock of Goats, they cannot imagine for what
Government else hee should bee good; God make him so and direct him
as hee sees best, for his Children have need of it. I, Lady of my Life,
am determined, with your Worships good leave, to make use of this good
fortune in my house, and to goe to the Court to stretch my self in a Coach,
to make a thonsand envious persons blinde that look after me. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I request your Excellencie to command my Husband to send me some
stock of money to purpose, because I hear the Court expences are great;
that a Loaf is worth six-pence, and a pound of Mutton five-pence, that
'tis wonderfull: and that if hee mean not that I shall goe, hee let me
know in time; for my feet are dancing till I bee jogging upon the way;
for my friends and neighbours tell me, that if I and my Daughter goe
glistring and pompously in the Court, my Husband will bee known by me
more then I by him; for that of necessity many will ask, What Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
are these in the Coach? Then a servant of mine answers, The
Wife and Daughter of <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> Governour of the Island <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rataria;</hi>
and by this means <hi>Sancho</hi> shall be known, and I shall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed,
and to <hi>Rome</hi> for all: [<hi>A phrase used by her to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
but tis a usuall thing in</hi> Spain <hi>among ill livers to cry</hi>
a Roma per todo, there to get absolution for their Villanies,] I
am as sorry as sorrow may be, that this yeer we have gathered no Acorns;
for all that, I send your highnesse half a peck, which I culled out, and went
to the Mountain on purpose, and they were the bigest I could finde: I
could have wished they had been as big as Eastritch Eggs. Let not your
pompossity forget to write to me, and Ile have a care to answer and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you of my health, and all that passeth here where I remain, praying
to God to preserve your Greatnesse, and forget not me: my Daughter
<hi>Sancha</hi> and my Sonne kisse your hands. Shee that desires more to see,

                     <p>Great was the content that all received to hear <hi>Teresa Panca's</hi> Letter, principally
of the Dukes, and the Duchesse asked <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> advice, if it were fit to open

Sancho.</head>
                           <p>I Received thy Letter, my <hi>Sancho</hi> of my soul, and I promise and swear
to thee as I am a Catholike Christian, there wanted not two fingers
bredth of making me mad for joy: Look you Brother, when I came to
hear that thou art a Governour, I thought I should have faln down dead with
gladnesse; for thou knowest, that 'tis usually said, that sodain joy as soon
kills as excessive grief. The water ran down thy daughter <hi>Sanchica's</hi>
eyes without perceiving it, with pure content. The Suit thou sentest me I had
before me, and the Corals my Lady the Duchesse sent, and the Letters in my
hands and the bearer of them present, and for all this I beleeved and thought
that all I saw or felt was but a dream: For who could think that a Goat-heard
should come to be a Governour of Islands? and thou knowest friend, that
my Mother was used to say, That 'twas needfull to live long, to see much.
This I say, because I think to see more, if I live longer; for I hope I shall
not have done, till I see thee a Farmer or Customer, which are Offices, that
though the Devill carry away him that dischargeth them badly, yet in the end
good store of coyne goes thorow their hands. My Lady the Duchess will
let thee know what a desire I have to goe to the Court; consider of it, and let
me know they minde, and I will doe thee honour there, going in my Coach.
The Vicar, Barber, Bachelour, nor Sexton cannot beleeve that thou art a
Governour, and say, that 'tis all jugling or Enchantment, as all thy Master
<hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Affairs are; And <hi>Samson</hi> sayes, he will finde thee ous,
and put this Government out of thy noddle, and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> madness
out of his Coxcombe. I doe nothing but laugh at them and look upon my Coral
chain, and contrive how to make my Daughter a Gown of the Suit thou sent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
me. I sent my Lady the Duchess some Acornes, I would they had been
of gold: I prethee send me a string of Pearls, if they be used in that Island.</p>
                           <p>The news of this Town is, that <hi>Berneca</hi> married her Daughter to a
scurvy Painter that came to this Town to paint at random. The
Burgers of the Town willed him to paint the Kings Armes over the
Gate of the Town Hall; he demanded two Ducats, which they gave
<pb facs="tcp:54746:250"/>
him before-hand: hee wrought eight dayes, in the end painted nothing,
and said; he could not hit upon painting such a deal of Pedlery ware:
so he returned them their money; and for all this, he married under the
name of a good Workman: true it is, that he hath left his pencill, and
taken the Spade, and goes to the field most Gentleman like. <hi>Pedro de Lobo's</hi>
sonne hath taken Orders and shaved his head, with purpose to
be a priest. <hi>Mingimtsa Mingo Siluctos</hi> ne're knew of it, and she
hath put a Bill against him for promising her marriage: malicious
tongues will not stick to say, that shee is great by him, but hee denies it
stiffly.</p>
                           <p>This yeer we have had no Olives, neither is there a drop of Vinegar to
be had in all the Town. A Company of Souldiers passed by here, and by
the way they carried three Wenches from this Town with them; I will
not tell thee who they are, for perhaps they will return, and there will not
want some that will marry them for better for worse; <hi>Sanchica</hi> makes
bone-lace, and gets her three-half-pence a day cleer, which she puts in a
box with a slit to help to buy her Houshold-stuff; but now that she is a
Governours Daughter, thou wilt give her a portion, that shee needs not
work for it. The stone-Fountain in the Market-place is dryed up: a
Thunder-bolt fell upon the Pillory, there may they fall all. I expect an
answer of this, and thy resolution touching my going to the Court; and so
God keep thee longer then me, or as long; for I would not leave thee in
this world behinde me.</p>

matter, the Post came that brought one from <hi>Sancho</hi> to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
read aloud; which brought the Governours madnesse in question. The Duchesse
retired with the Page, to know what had befaln him in <hi>Sancho's</hi> Town, who told her
at large, without omitting circumstance: hee gave her the Acornes, and a Cheese too
which <hi>Teresa</hi> gave him for a very good one, much better then those of <hi>Tronion;</hi> the
Duchesse received it with great content; in which we will leave her, to tell the end

for it rather seems otherwise: The Summer follows the Spring,
after the Sumer the Fall, and the Fall the Winter, and so Time goes
on in a continuated wheele. Onely mans Life runns to a speedy
end, swifter then Time, without hope of being renewed, except it
be in another life, which hath no bounds to limit it.</p>
                     <p>This said <hi>Cid Hamete,</hi> a <hi>Mahometicall</hi> Philosopher; for many without the light of
Faith, only with a naturall instinct, have understood the swiftnesse and uncertainty of
this Life present, and the lasting of the eternall Life which is expected: But here the
Authour speaks it for the speedinesse with which <hi>Sancho's</hi> Government was ended,
consumed and undone, and vanished into a shade and smoak: who being a-bed the
seventh night after so many dayes of his Government, not cloyed with Bread or Wine,
but with Judging and giving Sentences, making Proclamations and Statutes, when
sleep maugre and in despight of hunger, shut his eye lids, he heard such a noyse of Bells
and Out-cries, as if the whole Island had been sunk: he sate up in his Bed, and was very
attentive, hearkning if he could ghesse at the cause of so great an Up-roar; but he was
so farre from knowing it, that a noyse of a world of Drumms and Trumpets added to
that of the Bells and Cries, made him more confused, and more full of fear and horror;
and rising up, he put on a pair of Slippers for the moystnesse of the ground, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any night-Gown upon him, or any thing like it, he went out at his Chamber door,
at such time, as he saw at least twenty persons come running thorow the Entries, with
Torches in their hands lighted, and Swords unsheathed, crying all out aloud; Arm,
Arm, Sir Governour, Arm; for a world of enemies are entred the Island, and we are
undone, if your skill and valour help us not.</p>
                     <p>With this Fury, Noyse, and Uproar, they came where Sancho was, astonisht and
embeseld with what he heard &amp; saw: and when they came to him, one of them said, Arm
your self strait Sir, if you mean not to be destroyed, and that all the Island be lost.</p>
                     <p>I Arm my self (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) Know I any thing what belongs to Arms or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours?
'twere better leave these things to my Master <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi>
he will dispatch and put them in safety in an instant; for I (sinner that I am) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
nothing of this quick service. Ha, Sir Governour, said another, what faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
is this? Arm your self, for here we bring you Arms offensive and defensive:
Martch to the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rket-place, and bee our Guide and Captain, since you ought (being
our Governour) to be so. Arm me on Gods name (quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi>) And strait they
brought him two Shields, of which they had good store, and they clapt them upon his
Shirt, without letting him take any other clothes; one they put before, and the other
behinde, and they drew out his arms at certain holes they had made, and bound him
very well with cords, so that hee was walled and boorded up straight like a spindle,
not able to bend his knees or to move a step: In his hands they put a Launce, on
which he leant to keep himself up. When they had him thus, they bade him martch
and guide them, and cheer them all; for that hee being their Lanthorne, North, and
Morning starre, their matters would be well ended. How should I (wretch that I
am) martch (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) for my knee bones will not move, since these
boords that are so sowed to my flesh doe hinder me: your only way is to carry
me in your armes, and to lay me a-thwart, or let me stand up at some Postern,
which I will make good either with my Launce or body. Fie Sir, said
<pb facs="tcp:54746:251"/>
another, 'tis more your fear then the boords that hinder your pace; make an end for
shame, and bestir your self; for it is late, and the enemies increase, the cries are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and the danger waxeth more and more. At whole perswasions and vitupery,
the poor Governour tryed if he could move himself; so he fell to the ground, and had
such a fall, that he thought he had broken himself to pieces; and now he lay like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toise,
shut in and covered with his shell, or like a Flitch of Bacon clapped between two
boords, or like a Boat overturned upon a flat; and for all his fall, those Scoffers had no
compassion at all on him, but rather putting out their Torches, they began to re enforce
their cryes, &amp; to reiterate their Arme, Arm, so fast, running over poor <hi>Sancho,</hi> giving him
an infinite company of flashes upon his Shields, that if he had not withdrawn himself,
and shrunk his head up into them, the poor Governour had been in wofull plight;
who being thus shrugged up in this straight, he was in a terrible sweat and berayed, and
recommended himself heartily to God Almighty to deliver him from that danger.
Some stumbled upon him, others fell, and another would get upon him for a good
while, and from thence, as from a watch-Tower, governed the Army, and cryed aloud,
Here on our side, here the enemies are thickest; Make this Breach good; keep that
Gate shut; down with those Ladders, Wilde-fire-Balls, Pitch and Rozin, and Kettles
of scalding Oyle: Trench the streets with Beds; in fine, he named all manner of Ware,
Instruments, and Furniture of Warre for the defence of a City assaulted: And the
bruised <hi>Sancho</hi> that heard and suffered all, said to himself; Oh that it would please the
Lord that this Island were once lost, or that I were dead or delivered from this strait!
Heaven heard his Petition, and when he least expected, he heard this cry, Victory,
Victory, the Foes are vanquished. Ho, Sir Governour, rise, rise, enjoy the conquest,
and divide the spoyles that are taken from the enemies, by the valour of your invincible
arme.</p>
                     <p>Raise me, quoth the grieved <hi>Sancho,</hi> with a pittyfull voyce. They helpt to raise him,
and being up, he said; Every enemie that I have vanquished, naile him in my fore-head:
Ile divide no spoils of enemies, but desire some friend, if I have any, to give me a draught
of Wine, that may dry up this sweat for I am all water. They wiped him, brought him
Wine, and unbound the Shields from him; he sate upon his Bed, and with the very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of the sodain fright, and his toyle, he fell into a swound; and they that plaid that
trick with him were sorry it fell out so heavily: but <hi>Sancho's</hi> comming straight to
himself tempered their sorrow.</p>
                     <p>Hee asked them what a clock it was? They answered him it grew to be day.</p>
                     <p>Hee held his peace, and without more words, began to cloath himself, all buried in
silence, and all beheld him, expecting what would bee the issue of his hasty dressing
himself.</p>
                     <p>Thus by little and little, he made himself ready, for by reason of his wearinesse hee
could not doe it very fast, and so went toward the Stable (all they that were there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him) and comming to Dapple he embraced and gave him a loving kisse on the
fore-head, and not without tears in his eyes, said:</p>
                     <p>Come thou hither, companion mine and friend, fellow-partner of my labours and
miseries; when I consorted with you, no other cares troubled me, then to mend thy
Furniture, and to sustein thy little corps: happy then were my hours, dayes and
yeers: but since I left thee, and mounted on the towers of Ambition and Pride, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
miseries, a thousand toyles, four thousand unquietnesses have entred my soul.
And as he was thus discoursing, he fitted on the Pack-saddle, no body saying ought
unto him. Dapple being thus Pack-saddled, with much adoe he got upon him, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
his speeches and reasons to the Stward, the Doctor and many others there
present, he said:</p>
                     <p>Give me room Sirs, and leave to return to my former liberty; let me seek my anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
life, to rise from this present death: I was not born to bee a Governour, not to
defend Islands nor Cities from enemies that would assault them: I can tell better
how to Plough, to Digg, to Prune, and Plant Vineyards, then to give Laws, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Provinces and Kingdomes: 'tis good sleeping in a whole skin: I mean 'tis fit
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54746:251"/>
that every man should exercise the Calling to which hee was borne: a Sickle is better
in my hand, then a Governours Scepter. I had rather fill my selfe with a good dish of
<hi>Gaspachos,</hi> then bee subject to the misery of an impertinent Physician, that would kill
mee with hunger: I had rather solace my selfe under the shade of an Oake in Summer,
and cover my selfe with a double sheepe skinne in Winter quietly, then lay mee downe
to the subjection of a Government in fine Holland sheetes, and bee clothed in Sables:
fare you well Sir, and tell my Lord the Duke, Naked was I borne, naked I am, I ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
winne nor lose: I meane, I came without crosse to this government, and I goe
from it without a crosse, contrary to what Governours of other Islands are used to
doe. Stand out of the way, and let mee goe, for I must seare-cloth my selfe; for I
beleeve all my ribs are bruised, I thanke the enemy that trampled over mee all this
night.</p>
                     <p>You shall not doe so, Sir Governour, quoth Doctor <hi>Rezio,</hi> for I will give you a
drinke good against falls and bruises, that shall straight recover you: and touching
your diet, I promise you to make amends, and you shall eat plentifully of what you
list. 'Tis too late (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) Ile as soon tarry as turne Turke: these jests are not
good the second time: you shall as soone get mee to stay here, or admit of any other
Government, (though it were presented in two platters to mee) as make mee flye to
heaven without wings. I am of the linage of the <hi>Panca's,</hi> and wee are all head-strong,
and if once wee cry odd, odde it must bee (though it be even) in spite of all the world.
Here in this Stable let my Ants wings remaine that lifted mee up in the ayre, to bee
devouted by Marrlets and other birds, and now let's goe a plaine pace on the ground:
and though wee weare no pinked Spanish-leather shoos, yet wee shall not want course
pack-thread Sandals. Like to like, quoth the Devill to the Collier, and let every man
cut his measure according to his cloth, and so let mee goe, for it is late.</p>
                     <p>To which quoth the Steward, With a very good will you should goe, though
wee shall bee very sorry to lose you: for your judgement and Christian proceeding
oblige us to desire your company: but you know, that all Governours are obliged,
before they depart from the place which they have governed, to render first an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their place, which you ought to doe for the tenne daies you have governed;
and so Gods peace bee with you.</p>
                     <p>No man can aske any account of mee, said hee, but hee whom my Lord the Duke
will appoint; to him I goe, and to him Ile give a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ting account: besides, I going
from hence so bare as I doe, there can bee no greater signe that I have governed like
an Angell.</p>
                     <p>I protest (quoth Doctor <hi>Rezio</hi>) the Grand <hi>Sancho</hi> hath a great deale of reason, and
I am of opinion that wee let him goe; for the Duke will bee infinitely glad to see him.
So all agreed, and let him goe, offering first to accompany him, and whatsoever hee had
need of for himselfe, or for the commodiousnesse of his Voyage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> told them, hee desired nothing but a little Barley for Dapple, and halfe a
Cheese and a Loafe for himselfe; for that by reason of the shortnesse of the way,
hee needed no other provision. All of them embraced him, and hee with teares em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
them, and left them astonished, as well at his discourse, as his most resolute and
discreet determination.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Duke and Duchesse were resolved that <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi> Challenge
that hee made against their Vassall for the aforesaid cause, should
goe forward; and though the young man were in Flanders, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee fled because hee would not have <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> to his
Mother in Law, yet they purposed to put a Gascoigne Lackey in
his stead, which was called <hi>Tosilos,</hi> instructing him first very well in
all that hee had to doe.</p>
                     <p>Some two daies after, the Duke said to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that within foure daies
his contrary would bee present, and present himselfe in the field like an armed Knight,
and maintaine that the Damzell lied in her throat, if shee affirmed that hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
her marriage. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was much pleased with this newes, and promised
to himselfe to worke miracles in this businesse, and hee held it to bee a speciall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to him, that occasion was offered, wherein those Nobles might see how far the
valor of his powerfull arme extended: and so with great jocundnesse and content,
hee expected the foure daies which in the reckoning of his desire, seemed to him to
bee foure hundred Ages. Let wee them passe (as wee let passe divers other matters)
and come to the Grand <hi>Sancho,</hi> to accompany him, who betwixt mirth and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
upon Dapple went to seeke out his Master, whose company pleased him more
then to bee Governour of all the Islands in the world.</p>
                     <p>It fell out so, that hee having not gone very farre from the Island of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(for hee never stood to averre whether it were Island, Citty, Village, or Towne
which hee governed) hee saw that by the way hee went, there came sixe Pilgrimes with
their walking staves, your strangers that use to beg almes singing, who when they came
neere, beset him round, and raising their voyces all together, began to sing in their
language, what Sancho could not understand, except it were one word, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signified Almes, which hee perceived they begged in their song. And hee (as saith
<hi>Cid Hamete</hi>) being very charitable, tooke halfe a Loafe, and halfe a Cheese out of his
wallet, of which hee was provided, and gave it them, telling them by singnes hee had
nothing else to give them: they received it very willingly, and said, <hi>Guelte, Guelte.</hi> I
understand you not what you would have (good people) quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Then one of
them tooke a purse out of his bosome, and shewed it to <hi>Sancho,</hi> whereby hee understood
they asked him for money; but hee putting his thumbe to his throat, and his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
gave them to understand hee had not a Denier; and spurting Dapple, hee broke
thorow them: and passing by one of them looking wishly upon him, layd hold on
him, and casting his armes about his middle, with a loud voyce, and very good spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
said, God defend mee, and what doe I see? is it possible I have my deare friend
in my armes, my honest neighbour <hi>Sancho Panca?</hi> Yes sure I have, for I neyther sleep,
nor am drunke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> wondred to heare himselfe so called by his name, and to see himselfe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by a Pilgrime-stranger, and after hee had beheld him a good while, without
speaking a word, and with much attention, yet hee could never call him to mind: but
the Pilgrime seeing his suspension, said:</p>
                     <p>How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ow, is it possible, Brother <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> thou knowest not thy neighhour
<hi>Ricote</hi> the <hi>Morisco</hi> Grocer of thy towne? Then <hi>Sancho,</hi> beheld him more earnestly,
and began to remember his favour, and finally knew him perfectly: and so without
alighting from his Asse, hee cast his armes about his neck, and said, Who the Devill,
<hi>Ricote,</hi> could know thee, in this vizardly disguize? What's the matter? who hath
made such a <hi>Franchote</hi> of thee? [<hi>A word of disgrace the Spaniard useth to all strangers,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54746:252"/>
but chiefly to the French:</hi>] and how darest thou return back again into Spain? where
if thou bee catcht or known, woe bee to thee? If thou reveal me not <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am safe,
quoth the Pilgrim; for in this disguise no body will know me: Come let's goe out of
the high-way into yonder Elme Grove, for there my companions mean to dine and
repose themselves, and thou shalt eat with them, for they are very good people, and
there I shall have leisure to tell thee what hath befaln me, since I departed from our
Town to obey his Majesties Edict, which so rigorously threatned those unfortunate
ones of our Natiou, as thou heardst.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> consented, and <hi>Ricote</hi> speaking to the rest of the Pilgrims, they went to the
Elme Grove that appear'd a pretty way distant from the high-way, they flung down
their staves, and cast off their Pilgrims weeds, and so remained in Hose and doublet; and
all of them were young and handsome fellows, except <hi>Ricote,</hi> who was well entred in
yeers: all of them had Wallets, which were (all to see to) well provided at least with
incitatives that provoked to drink two miles off.</p>
                     <p>They sate upon the ground, and making Table-clothes of the Grasse; they set upon
it Bread, Salt, Knives, Wall-nuts, slices of Cheese, and clean Gammon of Bacon-bones;
which though they would not let themselves bee gnawed, yet they forbade not to bee
sucked.</p>
                     <p>They set down likewise a kinde of black meat, called <hi>Caviary,</hi> made of Fishes Eggs;
a great Alarum to the bottle, there wanted no Olives, though they were dry without
any Pickle; yet savory, and made up a dish: but that which most flourisht in the field
of that Banquet was, six bottles of wine, which each of them drew out of his Wallet;
even honest <hi>Ricote</hi> too, who had transformed himself from a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>risco into a <hi>Germane</hi> or <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> hee drew out his that for quantitie might compare with the whole
five.</p>
                     <p>Thus they began to eat with great content, and very leisurely relishing every bit which
they took, upon a Knives point, and very little of every thing; and straight all of them
together would lift their armes and Bottles up into the aire, putting their own mouthes
to the Bottles mouthes, their eyes nailed in Heaven, as if they had shot at it: and in this
fashion moving their heads from one side to the other, signes of their good liking of the
Wine, they remained a good while, straining the entrails of the Vessells in their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> marked all, and was grieved at nothing; rather to fulfill the Proverb, that
hee very well knew, [<hi>Cum sueris Romae, &amp;c</hi>] When thou goest to <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Bottle of <hi>Ricote,</hi> and so took his ayme as well as the rest, and with no lesse
delight then they: thus the Bottles suffered themselves to be hoisted on end four times:
but it was not possible the fift: for they were now as soakt and dry as a Matteresse, which
made their joy hitherto shewn, now very muddy: now and then one of them would
take <hi>Sancho</hi> by the right hand, and say, Spaniard and Dutchman all one, <hi>bon compagno.</hi>
And <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, <hi>Bon compagno, juro a di: [Swears in a broken language:]</hi> and
with that discharged such a laughter as lasted a long houre, not remembring as then
ought that had befaln him in his Government; for cares are wont to have little juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
upon leisure and idlenesse, whilest men are eating and drinking.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the ending of their Wine, was the beginning of a drowsinesse that seized
upon them all, so they even fell to sleep where they sate; only <hi>Ricote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it out, for they had eaten more and drunk lesse: so <hi>Ricote</hi> taking <hi>Sancho</hi> apart, they
sate at the foot of a Beech, leaving the Pilgrims buried in sweet sleep, and <hi>Ricote</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stumbling a jot into his <hi>Morisco</hi> tongue, in pure <hi>Castillian</hi> language, uttered to
him this ensuing discourse.</p>
                     <p>Thou well knowest, O <hi>Sancho</hi> Panca, friend and neighbour mine, how the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Edict that his Majesty commanded to bee published against those of my
Nation, put us all into a feare and fright, at least me it did: and mee thought, that
before the time that was limited us for our departure from <hi>Spain;</hi> the very rigor of the
penalty was executed upon me and my children.</p>
                     <p>I provided therefore (in my judgement wisely) as hee which knows that by such a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:253"/>
time the house hee lives in shall bee taken from him, and so provides himself another
against hee is to change: I provided, I say, to leave our Town, all alone without my
Family, and to seek some place whither I might Commodiously carry them, and not in
such a hurry as the rest that went: For I well saw, and so did all our graver sort, that
those Proclamations were not only threats, as some said, but true Laws to bee put in
execution at their due time: and I was enforced to beleeve this truth; because I knew
the Villanous, but foolish attempts of our Nation; such, as me thought it was a divine
inspiration that moved his Majestie, to put so brave a resolution in effect: not because
wee are all faulty; for some there were firm and true Christians; but they were so few,
they could not bee opposed to those that were otherwise: and it was not fit to nourish
a Serpent in his bosome, and to have enemies within doors.</p>
                     <p>Finally, wee were justly punished with the penalty of Banishment, which seemed to
some soft and sweet; but to us the terriblest that could bee inflicted: whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
wee are, wee weep to think on <hi>Spain;</hi> for indeed here wee were borne, and it is
our naturall Country; wee no where finde the entertainment that our misfortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and all parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> where we thought to have been received,
entertained, and cherished; there it is where wee are most offended and misused: wee
knew not our happinesse till wee lost it, and the desire wee all have to return to <hi>Spain</hi>
is so great, that the most part of such (which are many) who speak the language, as I
doe, return hither again, and leave their Wives and Children there forsaken, so great is
the love they bear their Country, and now I know and finde by experience that the
saying is true, Sweet is the love of ones Country.</p>
                     <p>I went (as I say) out of our. Town and came into <hi>France,</hi> and though there wee
were well entertained, yet I would see it all; and so passed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and arrived in
Germany; and there I found we might live with more freedome; for the Inhabitants doe
not look much into niceties, every one lives as hee pleaseth; for in the greatest part of
it there is liberty of Conscience.</p>
                     <p>There I took a house in a Town neer <hi>Augusta,</hi> and so joyned with these Pilgrims
that usually come for spain, many of them every yeer to visit the Devotions here, which
are their <hi>Indies,</hi> and certain gain, they travell all the Kingdom over; and there is no
Town from whence they goe not away with meat and drink (as you would say) at least,
and six-pence in money; and when they have ended their Voyage, they goe away with a
hundred Crowns over-plus, which changed into gold either in the hollows of their
Staves, or the patches of their weeds, or by some other slight they can, they carry out of
the Kingdome, and passe into other Countries, in spight of the Searchers of the dry
Ports, where the money ought to bee registred. And now <hi>Sancho,</hi> my purpose is to
carry away the treasure that I left buryed; for, because it is without the Town, I may
doe it without danger, and write from <hi>Valencia</hi> to my Wife and Daughter that I know
are in <hi>Argiers,</hi> and contrive how I may bring them to some Port of <hi>France,</hi> and from
thence carry them into <hi>Germany,</hi> where wee will expect how God will please to dispose
of us; for indeed <hi>Sancho,</hi> I know certainly that <hi>Ricota</hi> my Daughter, and <hi>Francisca
Ricota</hi> my Wife, are Catholike Christians: and though I bee not altogether so, yet I am
more Christian then Moor; and my desire to God alwaies is, to open the eyes of my
understanding, and to let me know how I may serve him.</p>
                     <p>And all I admire, is, that my Wife and Daughter should rather goe into <hi>Barbarie</hi>
then into <hi>France,</hi> where they mgiht have lived as Christians.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Sancho</hi> said, Look you <hi>Ricote,</hi> perhaps they could not doe withall; for
<hi>Iohn Tyopeio</hi> your Wives Brother carried them: and he, belike, as hee was a rank Moor,
would goe where hee thought best: and I can tell you more, I think 'tis in vain for
you to seek what you left hidden; for wee had news that your Brother in law, and
your Wife had many Pearls taken from them, and a great deal of gold which was not
registred.</p>
                     <p>That may very well bee <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Ricote</hi>) but I know they touched not my
Treasure. For I would not tell them where it was hidden, as fearing some mishap; and
therefore if thou wilt come with me <hi>Sancho,</hi> and help me to take it out, and conceal it,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54746:253"/>
Ile give thee two hundreth Crownes to the reliefe of thy necessities, for thou knowest,
I know thou hast many.</p>
                     <p>Were I covetous (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I would yeeld to this; and were I so, this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I left an Office, which had I kept, I might have made my house walles of Gold,
and within one sixe moneths have eaten in silver dishes: so that partly for this, and
partly not to bee a Traitour to my King, in favouring his enemies, I will not goe with
thee, though thou wouldst give me four hundreth Crownes.</p>
                     <p>And what Office was that thou leftest <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Ricote?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I left to bee Governour of an Island (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and such a one, that yfaith in
three Bow-shootes again you shall scarce meet with such another.</p>
                     <p>And where is this Island, said hee? Where, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Why, two Leagues off,
and it is called the Island <hi>Barataria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Peace, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Ricote:</hi> for your Islands are out in the Sea, you have no Islands
in the <hi>Terra Firma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> I tell you, friend, <hi>Ricote,</hi> this morning I left it; and yesterday
I governed in it at my pleasure like a <hi>Sagittarius:</hi> but yet I left it, as thinking the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
Office to bee dangerous.</p>
                     <p>And what have you gotten by it, quoth <hi>Ricote?</hi> I have gotten (said hee) this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that I am not fit to governe ought but a Herd of Cattell, and that in those
kind of Governments there is no wealth gotteo, but with labour, toyle, losse of sleep
and sustenance: for in your Islands your Governours fare very ill; especially if they
have Physitians that looke to their health.</p>
                     <p>I understand thee not, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Ricote:</hi> but me thinkes thou talkest without
sense: for who would give thee Islands to govern? want there in the world more
able men then thou to bee Governours? Peace, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and returne to thy wits, and
see if thou wilt goe with mee, as I have said, and help mee take out the Treasure that
I have hidden, for it may very well bee called a Treasure; and I will give thee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to maintaine thee.</p>
                     <p>I have told thee, <hi>Ricote,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I will not: let it suffice, I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
thee, and goe on thy way, on Gods name, and leave mee to mine: for I know
that what is well gotten, is lost; but what is ill gotten, it and the Owner too.</p>
                     <p>I will not bee too earnest with thee, said hee: but tell mee, wast thou in our town,
when my Wife, my Daughter, and my Brother in law departed? Marry was I (quoth
<hi>Sancho</hi>) and I can tell you, your Daughter shewed so beautifull, that all the Towne
went out to see her: and every one said shee was the fairest creature in the world: shee
went weeping, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances, and as many as came
to see her, and intreated all to recommend her to God, and this so feelingly, that shee
made mee weep, that am no Bel-weather: and yfaith many had a good minde to have
concealed her, and to take her away upon the way: but feare of resisting the Kings
commandement, made them abstaine: hee that shewed himselfe most enamoured,
was <hi>Don Pedro Gregorio,</hi> that Youth, the rich heyre that you know very well; hee, they
say, loved her very much, and since shee went, was never seene more in our Towne,
and wee all thought hee followed to steale her away: but hitherto there is nothing
knowne.</p>
                     <p>I alwayes suspected (quoth <hi>Ricote</hi>) that this Gentleman loved my Daughter: but
being confident in <hi>Ricota's</hi> worth, is never troubled mee, to know that hee loved her
well: for I am sure <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou hast heard say, that <hi>Morisco</hi> women seldome or never
for love married with old Christians: and so my Daughter, who, as I beleeve, rather
tended her soules health then to bee enamoured, cared little for this rich heires sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ANCHO'S</hi> long stay with Ricote was the cause that hee reached
not that day to the Dukes Castle, though hee came within half a
league of it, where the night took him, somewhat dark and close
but being Summer time, it troubled him not much, and therefore
hee went out of the way, purposing to rest till the morning: but
as ill luck would have it, seeking a place where he might best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
himself, hee and Dapple fell into a most dark and
deep pit, which was amongst certain ruinous buildings; and as he
was falling, hee recommended himself withall his heart to God, thinking hee should not
stop till hee came to Hell, but it fell out otherwise; for within a little more then three
fathoms length, Dapple felt ground, and hee sate still upon him without any hurt or
dammage received.</p>
                     <p>Hee felt all his body over, and held in his breath to see if hee were sound or pierced
any where: but seeing himself well and whole, and in catholike health, hee thought hee
could never praise God sufficiently for the favour he had done him: for hee thought
verily hee had been beaten into a thousand pieces: hee went likewise groping with his
hands about the walls of the pit, to see if it were possible to get out without help; but
hee found them all smooth, without any place to lay hold on, which grieved him very
much, especially when he heard Dapple cry out tenderly and dolefully, and no marvell:
for it was not for wantonnes, he saw himself in a pittifull taking.</p>
                     <p>Alas (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>) and what sodain and unthought of accidents befall men
that live in this miserable world? who would have supposed that hee, who yesterday
saw himself inthronized Governour of an Island, commanding Servants and Vassals,
should to day be buried in a Pit, without any bodies help, without Servant or Vassall
comming to succour him?</p>
                     <p>Here I and my Asse are like to perish with hunger, if so bee that first wee dye not;
hee with his bruise, I with grief and anguish: at least I shall not bee so happie as my
Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was when hee descended and went down into that enchanted
Cave of <hi>Montesinos,</hi> where hee found better welcome then if hee had been at his own
house; and it seemed hee found the cloth ready layd, and his bed made; there saw hee
goodly and pleasant Visions: and here (I beleeve) I shall see nothing but Toads and
Snakes: unfortuuate that I am; what is my madnesse and folly come to? My bones
will be fetcht out from hence (when it shall please Heaven that I am found) white and
smooth, the flesh pickt off, and my trustie Dapples with them; whereupon peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it shall bee known who wee are, at least by those that shall take notice that <hi>Sancho</hi>
and the Asse never parted, nor the Asse from <hi>Sancho.</hi> Again, I say, Unhappy we! our
ill fortune would not that wee should dye in our Country and amongst our friends,
where, though our misfortune had found no redresse; yet wee should not have wanted
pittie, and at last gasp we should have had our eyes closed. Oh companion mine and
friend! how ill have I rewarded thy honest service? Pardon me; and desire Fortune
in the best manner thou canst, to deliver us from this miserable toyle in which wee are
both put; and I here promise to set a Crown of Lawrel on thy head, that thou shalt
look like a Poet Lawreat; and I will double thy Provander allowance.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Sancho</hi> lamented, and his Asse hearkned to him, without answering a word;
such was the strait and anguish in which the poor Scab found himself.</p>
                     <p>Finally, having passed over the whole night in complaints and lamentations, the day
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54746:254"/>
came on, with whose cleernes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e and splendor <hi>Sancho</hi> saw that there was no manner of
possibility to get out of that well without help, and he began again to lament and make
a noyse, to see if any body heard him: but all his crying out was as in a Desart; for in
all the Country round about, there was none to hearken to him: and then Dapple lay
with his mouth open, and <hi>Sancho</hi> thought hee had been dead: yet hee so handled the
matter, that hee set him upon his leggs; and taking a piece of bread out of his Wallets
(which had runne the same fortune with them) hee gave it his Asse, which came not
amisse to him; and <hi>Sancho</hi> said to him, as if hee had understood it, Sorrows great are
lessened with meat.</p>
                     <p>By this hee discovered on the one side of the Pit a great hole, whereat a man might
passe thorow, crooking and stooping a little. <hi>Sancho</hi> drew to it, and squatting down,
entred in, and saw that within it was large and spacious, and hee might well discerne it;
for by a place that you might call the roof, the Sun-beam entred in, that discovered it
all: hee saw likewise that it was enlarged by another spacious concavitie: which when
hee saw, he turned back again to his Asse, and with a stone began to pull down the earth
of the hole, and in a little while made way for his Asse to goe out, which hee did, and
<hi>Sancho</hi> leading him by the halter went forward along the Cave, to see if he could finde
any egresse on the other side; sometimes he went dark long and without light; but
never without fear. Lord God! said hee, this that to me is a misfortuue, were to my
Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> a famous Adventure; hee would think these profundities and
Dungeons were flowery Gardens, and <hi>Galiana's</hi> Palaces, and hee would hope to get
out of this straightnesse and darknesse into some flowry Field: but I unfortunate, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised,
and faint-hearred! think that every moment I shall fall into a deeper profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
then this former, that will swallow me down-right: 'tis a good ill that comes alone.
In this mannar, and in this imagination hee thought he had gone somewhat more then
half a league; and at last he discovered a kinde of twy-light, as if it had been day, and,
came in at some open place, which seemed to open an entrance to another world.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Cid Hamete Benengeli</hi> leaves him, and turns again to treat of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
who, jocund and contented expected the prefixed time, for the Combate hee was to
performe with the dishonourer of <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> Daughter, and thought to rectifie
the wrong and uncouth turn she had done her.</p>
                     <p>It fell out then that going out one morning to exercise and practise against the
Traunce in which e're long hee was to see himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> fetching up <hi>Rozinante</hi> with a full
Career, he came close to a Caves mouth; that had hee not reined him in hard, it had
been impossible but hee must have fallen into it.</p>
                     <p>Well he stopt him, and fell not in: and comming somewhat neerer, without alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
lookt into that depth, and beholding of it, heard a great noyse within, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
attentively, he might perceive and understand that he that made it, cryed out,
Ho, above there, is there any Christian that hears me? or any charitable Gentleman
that will take pittie of a sinner buried alive? of an unhappy ungovern'd Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thought he heard <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi> voice, at which he was in suspence
and affrighted: but raising his voyce as high as he could, he said, Who is below there?
Who is that cryes out? Who should be here? or who should cry out, they answered,
but the weather-beaten <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> Governour with a Pox to him, for his ill-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of the Island Barataria, Squire sometime to the famous Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> heard this, his admiration was doubled, and his astonishment
increased, as thinking <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> might be dead, and that his soul was there doing
penance: and carried with this imagination, he said, I conjure thee by all I may, as I
am a Catholike Christian, that thou tell me who thou art: and if thou beest a soul in
penalty, tell me what thou wilt have me do for thee; for since my profession is to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and help the needy of this world, it shall alwaies be so to help and ayd the needie in
another world, that cannot help themselves.</p>
                     <p>Then, said they below, Belike you that speak to mee are my Master <hi>Don-Quixote
<pb facs="tcp:54746:255"/>
de la Mancha,</hi> and by the Organ of your voice can bee no other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> I am, quoth hee, that both ayde the living and dead in their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.
Therefore tell mee, who thou art, for thou amazest mee: for if thou bee <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
my Squire, and that being dead, the Divell have not seyzed on thee, and by Gods
mercy thou bee in Purgatory, our holy Mother the Catholike Romane Church hath
sufficient suffrages, to deliver thee from the paine thou endurest, and I with my wealth
will sollicite all that I can: and therefore make an end, and tell mee who thou art.</p>

                        </gap>e I am your Squire <hi>Sancho panca,</hi> and I never dyed in all my life; but that having left my
Government for matters and causes that must bee told more at leisure; over-night I
fell into this Pit, where I lye and Dapple too, who will prove mee to bee no lyar: for
hee is here with mee: Will you any more? And it seemed, the Asse understood what
<hi>Sancho</hi> said: for at the instant, hee began to bray so loud, that all the Cave resounded.</p>
                     <p>A famous witnesse, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I know this Bray, as if I had brought it
forth, and I heare thy voice, my <hi>Sancho:</hi> Stay, and Ile goe to the Dukes Castle that is
here hard by: and I will get some to help thee out of this Pit, into which thy sins have
cast thee.</p>
                     <p>Goe, Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for Gods love, and returne quickly: for I can no longer
endure to bee buried here alive, and I dye for feare. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> left him, and went
to the Castle to let the Dukes know <hi>Sancho's</hi> mis-hap: at which they marvelled not a
little, though they knew well enough how hee might fall in for the knowledge they
had, time out of minde of that Vault: but they could not imagine how hee had left
his Government, they knowing nothing of his comming. Finally, they caused Ropes
and Cables to bee sent, and with much cost and labour of people, <hi>Sancho</hi> and Dapple
were drawne out of that dismanesse to the sunns light. A Scholler saw him, and said,
Thus should all bad Governors come out of their Governments, as this sinner doth out
of this profound Abisme, pale dead for hunger, and (as I beleeve) without a crosse
to blesse him with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> heard him, and said, 'Tis eight or ten dayes, Good-man Murmurer, since
I began to governe the Island; in all which I never eat bread that kept mee from hunger
one houre; in all that time Physicians have persecuted mee, and enemies have bruised
my bones: neither have I had leisure to take bribes, or to recover my due; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, I deserved not (in my opinion) to come out in this manner: but man purposeth,
and God disposeth: and God best knowes what each man needeth: and let every man
fit himselfe to the times, and no man say, Ile drink no more of such a drink: for where
wee thinke to fare well, there is oft ill usage, God Almighty knowes my minde, 'tis
enough and I say no more, though I could. Bee not angry, <hi>Sancho,</hi> nor vext with
what thou hearest, for so thou shalt never bee in quiet: come with a good conscience,
let them say what they will; for to bridle malicious tongues, is as much as to set Gates
in the High-way.</p>
                     <p>If a Governour come rich from his Government, they say hee hath played the Thief:
and if poor, that he hath been a weak unable Cox-comb.</p>
                     <p>I warrant you (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) this bout, they shall rather hold mee to bee a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bombe then a Thief. With this discourase they went toward the Castle hemmed in
with many boyes, and other people; where the Duke and Duchesse were in certaine
running Galleries, expecting <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho:</hi> who, before hee would goe
up to see the Duke, would first accommodate Dapple in the Stable: for hee said hee
had had a marvellous ill night on't at their lodging; and so straight hee went up to see
his Lords, before whom upon his knees, he said; I, my Lords, because your Greatnesses
would needs have it so, without any desert of mine, went to govern your Island, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rataria;</hi> into which, naked I entred, and naked come I out, I neither win nor lose,
whether I governed well or ill, here bee witnesses present to say what they please: I
have resolved Doubts; sentenced Causes, and have been ready to bee starved: because

                        </gap>ry, by the valour of
my arme; such health God send them, as they tell truth herein.</p>
                     <p>In fine, I have summed up all the burdens and the cares that this governing brings
with it, and finde by my account, that my shoulders cannot beare them; neither are
they a weight for my ribbes, nor Arrowes for my quiver: and therefore, left I should
bee cast away in my Government, I have cast it away, and since yesterday morning I
left the Island as I found it, with the same streets, houses, and roofes that it had when
I came into it.</p>
                     <p>I have borrowed nothing of no body, nor hoorded up any thing: and though I
thought to have made some profitable Ordinances, yet I did not, as fearing they would
not be kept, which is as much as if they had never been made.</p>
                     <p>I left the Island (as I say) without any bodies accompanying mee, but Dapple: I
fell into a Pit, went forward in it, untill this morning by the Sunnes light I got out: but
not so easily; for if heaven had not provided mee my Master <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> there I
had stucke till the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>So that my Lords, Duke and Duchesse, here is <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> your Governour,
that hath onely learnt to know in these ten daies that hee hath govern'd, that hee cares
not for governing, not an Island, nay were it the whole world: this presupposed, kissing
your Honours hands, imitating boyes play, that cry, Leape thou, and then let mee
leape; [<hi>Like our Trusse or Faile:</hi>] So I leape from the Government, and passe again
to my Master <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> service: for in fine, though with him I eate my victuals
sometimes in fear, yet I have my belly full; and so that be, alls one to mee, that it bee
with Carrets, or with Partridge. With this, <hi>Sancho</hi> ended his tedious discourse: Don-Quixote
searing alwayes that hee would blunder out a thousand fopperies: but feeing
him end with so few, hee thanked Heaven in his heart: and the Duke embraced <hi>Sancho,</hi>
and said, Hee was sorry in his soule that hee left the Government so quickly: but that
hee would cause some Office of lesse trouble, and more profit in his estate to bee given
him: the Duchesse likewise embraced him, and commanded hee should bee made much
of, for he seemed to be much wearied, and to be worse entreated.</p>

all the words and actions, that <hi>Sancho</hi> both did and said in
that time: and finally, so describ'd the assault of the Island, and
so set out <hi>Sancho's</hi> feare, and sallie, that they received no small
delight.</p>
                     <p>After this, the History tels us, that the day of the prefixed
battaile came, and the Duke having oft instructed his Lackey <hi>Tosilos</hi> how hee should
behave himselfe with Don-Quixote to overcome him, without killing or wounding
him: hee gave order that their Pikes should bee taken from their Launces, telling
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that Christianitie (which hee preferred) permitted not, that that battell
should bee with so much hazzard and danger of their lives: and that it was enough that
hee granted him free. Lists in his Countrey, though it were against the Decree of the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:256"/>
holy Councell, that prohibites such challenges; yet hee would not put that matter so
strictly in execution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> bade his Excellency dispose of that businesse as hee pleased, and that
hee would obey him in all.</p>
                     <p>The fearefull day being come, the Duke commanded that there should bee a spacious
scaffold set up in the place where the Judges of the Lists might stand; and the Matron
and her daughter the Plaintiffs.</p>
                     <p>There repaired a world of people, from all the townes, and neighbouring Villages,
to see the noveltie of that battaile, who never saw, nor ever heard tell of the like in
that Countrey; neither the living, nor those that where dead. The first that entred
the field and Lists, was, the Master of the Ceremonies, who measured out the ground,
and passed all over it, that there might bee no deceit, nor any hidden thing to make
them stumble or fall: by and by the women entred, and sate downe in their seates, with
their mantles over their eyes and brests, with shews of no small resenting; <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
present in the Lists.</p>
                     <p>A while after, the Grand Lackey <hi>Tosilos,</hi> appear'd on one side of the large place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with many Trumpets, and upon a lusty Courser, sinking the very ground
under him: his Visor was drawn, and hee was all arraied in strong and shining Armor,
his horse was Frizeland, well spred, of colour flea-bitten, each set-locke having nine
and twenty pound of wooll upon it. The valiant Combatant came, well instructed by
his Master, how hee should demeane himselfe with the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote de la
Mancha,</hi> advertized that hee should by no meanes kill him, but that hee should strive
to shunne the first encounter, to 'excuse the danger of his death which was certaine, if
hee met him full butt. Hee paced over the place, and comming where the Matron was,
hee stayd a while to behold her that demanded him for her husband. The Master of
the Lists called <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that had now presented himselfe in the place, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Tosilos: he spoke to the women, asking them, if they agreed that <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi> should undertake their cause. They said, I, and that they allowed of all
hee should in that case performe, for firm and available.</p>
                     <p>By this the Duke and Duchesse were set in a Gallery, which looked just to the Lists
all which was covered with aboundance of people, that expected to see the rigorous
trance never seene.</p>
                     <p>The conditions of the Combatant was, That if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> overcame his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
hee should marry with <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> daughter; and that if he were overcome,
his Contendor was freed from his promise given, and not tyed to any satisfaction.
The Master of the Ceremonies divided the Sunne betweene them, and set each of them
in their places. The Drums strooke up, and the sound of Trumpets filled the ayre,
the earth shooke under them, and the hearts of the spectator troope, were in suspence,

                     <p>Finally, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> recommending himselfe heartily to God and his Mistris
<hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> stood looking when the precise signe of the encounter should bee
given: but our Lackey was in another mind, hee thought upon what now I will tell you
It seemes, that as hee stood looking upon his enemy, shee seemed to him to bee the
fairest, woman in the world, and the little blinde boy, whom up and downe the streets
folk call <hi>Love,</hi> would not lose the occasion offered, to triumph upon a Lackeyan soule, &amp;
to put it in the list of his Trophies: and so comming to him, faire and softly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any body perceiving him, hee clapped a flight two yards long into his left side,
and strooke his heart thorow and thorow, and hee might safely doe it; for love is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,

against his enemy, and his good squire <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> seeing him depart, cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
God guide thee, Creame and Flower of Knights Errant, God give thee the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54746:256"/>
seeing thou hast right on thy side: And though <hi>Tosilus</hi> saw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
come toward him, yet hee moved not a whit from his place, but rather aloude
called the Master of the Lists, who comming to see what hee would have, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silos</hi>
said.</p>
                     <p>Sir, doth not this Battell consist in my marrying or not marrying with that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman?
Yes, it was answered him. Well then (quoth the Lackey) I am scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
of Conscience, which would much be burthened if this Battell should proceede:
And therefore I say, I yeeld my self vanquished, and will marry this Gentlewoman
presently.</p>
                     <p>The Master of the Lists wondred at <hi>Tosilos</hi> reasons; and as he was one of those that
knew of the contriving that businesse, could not answere him a word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stopped in the middest of his Careere, seeing his Enemy met
not.</p>
                     <p>The Duke knew nothing why the Combat should not goe forward; but the Master
of the Lists went to tell him what <hi>Tosilos</hi> said, at which he was in suspence, and extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chollerick.</p>
                     <p>Whilest this happened, <hi>Tosilos</hi> came where <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> was, and cried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude,
Mistresse, I will marry your Daughter, and therefore will never strive for
that with Suites and Contentions, which I may have Peaceably, and without danger of
Death.</p>
                     <p>The valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> heard this, and said; Seeing 'tis so and that I am loosed and
free from my promise, let them marry on Gods name, and since God hath given her
him, <hi>S. Peter</hi> blesse her.</p>
                     <p>The Duke now came down into the Place, and coming to <hi>Tosilos</hi> said; Is it true,
Knight, that you yield your selfe vanquished, and that instigated by your timorous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
you will marry that Maid? I Sir, quoth <hi>Tosilos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He doth very well, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> then, for that thou wouldst give the Mouse, give
the Cat, and he will free thee from trouble.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tosilos</hi> began now to unlace his Helmet, and desired them to helpe him apace, for his
spirits and his breath failed him, and he could not endure to see himselfe so long shut up
in that norrow Chamber. They undid it apace, and now the Lackies face was plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
Which when <hi>Donna Rrdriguez</hi> and her Daughter saw, they cryed out saying;
This is coozenage, this is coozenage: They have put <hi>Tosilos</hi> my Lord the Dukes Lackey
in stead of our true Husband: Justice from God and the King, for such malice, not
to say, villany.</p>
                     <p>Grieve not your selves Ladies, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for this is neyther malice nor
villany, and if it bee, the Duke is not in fault, but vilde Enchanters that persecute mee;
who envying that I should get the glory of this Conquest, have converted the face of
your Husband into this, which you say is the Dukes Lackey: take my Councell, and in
spight of the malice of my Enemies, marry him, for doubtlesse, tis he that you desire to
have to Husband.</p>
                     <p>The Duke that heard this, was ready to burst all his choller into laughter, and said;
The things that happen to Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> are so extraordinary, that it makes mee
beleeve this is not my Lackey; but let us use this sleight and device, let us defer the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
only one fifteen dayes, and keep this personage that holds us in doubt, locked up,
in which perhaps he will return to his pristine shape; for the rancor that Enchanters
beare Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> will not laste so long, they gayning so little by these coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
and transformations they use.</p>
                     <p>O Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> these wicked Elves doe usually change one thing into another
in my Masters affaires: not long since they changed a Knight hee conquered, called
<hi>The Knight of the Looking-glasses,</hi> into the shape of the Bachelor Samson Carrasco,
borne in our town, and our speciall friend, and they turned my Mistrisse <hi>Dulcinea del
Toboso</hi>
into a Rustick Clowne: and so I imagine this Lackie will live and die so, all daies
of his life.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth <hi>Rodriguez</hi> Daughter) let him bee who hee will that demands
mee to Wife (I thanke him) I had rather bee lawfull wife to a Lackey, then a
<pb facs="tcp:54746:257"/>
Paramour to bee mocked by a Gentleman, though besides hee that abused mee is
none.</p>
                     <p>The upshot of all was, that <hi>Tosilos</hi> should bee kept up, till they saw what became
of his transformation. All cryed, <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi> was the Victorie, and the most were
sad and Melancholy, to see that the expected Combatants had not beaten one another
to peeces; as boyes are sad, when the party they looke for comes not out to be hanged,
when eyther the contrary, or the Justice pardons him.</p>
                     <p>The people departed, and the Duke and the Duchesse returned, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
with them to the Castle, <hi>Tosilos</hi> was shut up, <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> and her Daughter were
most happy, to see that one way or other, that businesse should end in marriage, and
<hi>Tosilos</hi> hoped no lesse.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it seemed good to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to leave the idle life hee had in
the Castle, thinking it a great wrong to his person, to bee shut up,
and lazy amongst so many delights and dainties as were offered to
him as a Knight Errant by those Nobles, and hee thought hee was
to give a strict account to Heaven for that idlenesse and retirement,
and so asked licence one day of the Dukes to depart: which they
gave him, but seemed to bee very sorrowfull that hee would leave
them. The Duchesse gave <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his wives Letters, who wept in them, and said,
Who would have thought that such great hopes as the newes of my Government, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
in my Wife <hi>Teresa Panca's</hi> brest, should stop in this, that I must return to my
Master <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi> dragged Adventures? For all that, I am glad to see that my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resa
was like her selfe, by sending the Acorns to the Duchesse, which if shee had not sent,
I being sorry shee had shewed her selfe ungratefull: my comfort is, that this kinde of
Present could not bee called a bribe; for I had my Government before shee sent it,
and 'tis very fit that they who receive a benefit, though it bee but in tristes, shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thankfull. In effect, naked I came into the Government, and naked I goe out of
it, and therefore I may say (which is no small matter) with a safe Conscience, Naked
was I borne, naked I am I neyther win nor lose. This <hi>Sancho</hi> discoursed with himselfe
at the time when he was to depart and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> going out, (having taken his leave
the night before of the Dukes) one morning hee presented himselfe all armed in the
Castle Court, all the people of the house beheld him from the Galleries, and the Dukes
too went out to see him. <hi>Sancho</hi> was upon his Dapple, with his Wallets, his Cloak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagge,
and his Sumpter-provision most frollike; for the Dukes Steward, hee that had
been <hi>Trifaldis,</hi> gave him a purse with two hundred crownes in gold, to supply his wants
by the way, and yet <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> knew nothing of this.</p>
                     <p>Whilest all were thus beholding him, unlookt for, amongst other Matrons and
Damzells of the Duchesses, the witty and wanton <hi>Altisidora</hi> beheld him, and with a

my Damzels Garters, 'tis a signe of a false heart, not sutable to your Honour; and

I will restore; for <hi>Sancho</hi> sayes he hath them: the Garters 'tis impossible; for neither
her nor I received them: and if this your Damzel will look into her corners, I warrant
her she findes them. I, my Lord, was never Thief, nor never think I shall as long as I live,
if God forsake me not. This Damzell speaks (as shee pleaseth) as being enamoured on
what I am not faulty of: and therefore I have no reason to ask forgivenesse, neither of

the longer you stay, the more you increase the flames in the Damzels hearts that behold

her self in look or action. Hear me then but a word, oh valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (quoth <hi>Altisidora</hi>) which is, That I cry thee mercy for the theft of my Garters; for in my soul and conscience I have them on; and I have faln into the same carelessnesse of his that
looked for his Asle when hee rode upon him.</p>
                     <p>Did not I not tell you (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I am a fit Youth to conceal Thefts? for had
I been so, I had in two bouts fit occasions in my Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> inclined his head, and made an obeysance to the Dukes and by-standers,
and turning <hi>Rozinantes</hi> reins, <hi>Sancho</hi> following him on Dapple, hee went out of the
Castle, taking his way towards <hi>Saragosa.</hi>

from <hi>Altisidora's</hi> wooing, hee thought himself in his Center, and
that his spirits were renewed to prosecute his new project of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie;
and turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> said:</p>
                     <p>Liberty, <hi>Sancho,</hi> is one of the preciousest Gifts that Heaven hath
given men; the treasure that the earth encloseth and the Sea hides,
cannot be equalized to it. Life ought to be hazarded as well for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as for a mans Honour; and by the contrary Captivity is the greatest evill that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54746:258"/>
can befall men. This I tell thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> because, thou hast well observed the cheer and
plenty we have had in the Castle we left. Well, in the midest of those savoury Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
and those drinks cooled with snow, me thought I was straightned with hunger;
for I enjoyed nothing with the liberty I should have done, had it been mine own; for
the obligations of recompencing benefits and favours received, are tyes that curb a free
minde. Happy that man to whom Heaven hath given a piece of bread, without obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to thank any else but Heaven alone.</p>
                     <p>For all that (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) 'tis not fit for us to be unthankfull for two hundred
Crowns that wee have received in gold, which the Dukes Steward gave me in a purse,
which I carry as comforting Cordial next my heart, for what may fall out; for wee
shall not alwaies finde Castles where we shall be much made on; sometimes wee shall
meet with Inns, where we shall be cudgelled.</p>
                     <p>In these and such like discourses went the Errants on, Knight and Squire, when they saw (having gone about half a league upon the grasse of a green Medow, some dozen
men with their Cloaks spread at dinner, clad like Husbandmen; somewhat neer them
they had, as it were, white sheets, with which they covered something underneath: they
were set upright and stretch at length, and put a pretty distance one from another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came to those that were eating, and saluting them first courteously,
hee asked them what was under that linnen? One of them answered him, Sir, under
this linnen there bee certain Images of Embossed work in wood, which must serve in a
shew wee make in our Village: wee carry them covered, that they may not bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ullied
and on our shoulders that they bee not broken. If you please (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
I should be glad to see them; for Images carried so charily doubtlesse are good ones.
Good (quoth one?) if they bee not, let their price speak; for there is none of them but
cost fifty Ducats; and that you may see 'tis true, pray stay, and you shall see it with your
eyes: and rising hee left his dinner, and went to uncover the first Image, which shewed
to bee Saint <hi>George</hi> on horse back, with a winding Serpent at his feet, and his Launce
runne thorow the throat of it, with the fiercenesse he useth to be painted with: all the
Images seemed to bee of pure gold. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing it, said, This Knight
was one of the best Errants that the divine War-fare had, his name was Saint <hi>George,</hi>
and he was a wonderfull defender of Damzels. Let's see this next. The man disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it, and it seemed to see Saint <hi>Martin</hi> on Horse-back, that divided his cloak with
the poor man; and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> no sooner saw it, but he said, This Knight also was
one of our Christian Advent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rers, and I beleeve he was more liberall then valiant, as
thou mayest see <hi>Sancho</hi> by his dividing his cloak, and giving the poor man half; and
doubtlesse it was then Winter; for had it been Summer, he would have given him all,
he was so charitable.</p>
                     <p>Not so (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) but he stuck to the Proverb, To give and to have doth a brain
crave.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laughed, and desired them to take away another peece of linnen, under
which was the Image of the Patron of <hi>Spain</hi> on Horse-back, his sword bloodied, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
on Moors, and treading on heads: and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing it, said, I marry Sir,
here's a Knight indeed, one of Christs Squadrons, this is called <hi>Don-Saint Diego,</hi> Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killer,
one of the Valientest Saints and Knights in the world then, or in heaven now.
Then they discovered another peece, which shewed Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his falling from his Horse,
with all the circumstances usually painted in the Table of his Conversion: when hee
saw him so lively, as if you would say, Christ were then speaking to him, and <hi>Paul</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
hee said, This was the greatest enemie that the Church of God had in a long
time, and the greatest Defender that ever it shall have, a Knight Errant in his life time,
and a quiet Saint in his death, a restless Laboror in the Vineyard of the Lord, a Doctor of
Nations, whose School was Heaven, and Christ himself his Reader and Instructer. Now
there were no more Images: and so <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> commanded them to cover them
again, and said to those that carried them, I hold it for a propitious signe Brethen, to
have seen what I have seen; for those Saints and Knights were of my Profession, which
is, to exercise Armes; onely the difference between them and me is, that they were
<pb facs="tcp:54746:259"/>
Saints, and fought Divinely; I am a sinner, and fight humanely. They conquer'd hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by force of their Armes (for heaven suffers force) and hitherto I know not what I
conquer by the force of my sufferings: but if my <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> be once free
from hers, my Fortune bettering it self, and my judgement repaired, perhaps I might
take a better course then I doe.</p>
                     <p>God grant, and Sin be deaf, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> straight.</p>
                     <p>The men wondred as well at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> shape, as at his discourse, and understood
not one half what it meant. They ended their dinner and got up their Images, and
taking leave of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they went on their way. <hi>Sancho</hi> admired afresh, as if hee
had never known his Master, at his knowledge, thinking there was no Historyin the
world, or Accident, that hee had not ciphered upon his nayle, and nayled in his memory,
and said, Truly (Master mine) if this that hath befaln us to day may be called an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
it hath been one of the most delicious sweetest, that in all our peregrination
hath befaln us; for wee are come out of it without blows or affrightment, or laying
hands to our swords, or without beating the earth with our bodies, or being hungry:
God be thanked that hee hath let me see this with these eyes of mine.</p>
                     <p>Thou sayest well <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but thou must know, the times are
not alwaies alike, nor run on in one fashion, and that which the vulgar commonly call
Bodings, which are not grounded upon any naturall reason, ought to bee held, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
and judged by a wise man for good luck. One of your Wizards riseth in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
goes out of his house, meets with a Frier of the blessed Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and
as if hee had met with a Griffin, turns his back and runs home again. Tother <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi>
hee spils the salt on the Table, and straight hath a melancholy sprinkled all over his
heart, as if Nature were bound to shew signes of ensuing mischances, with things of so
small moment as the aforesaid: The discreet Christians ought not to stand upon points,
or to look into the doings of Heaven. <hi>Scipio</hi> comes into <hi>Africa,</hi> and leaping on shore,
hee stumbles; his Souldiers hold it for an ill signe: but hee embracing the ground, said,
Thou canst not flye from me <hi>Africa,</hi> for I have fast hold on thee in mine Armes.
So that <hi>Sancho,</hi> the meeting with these Images hath been a most happie successe to mee.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve you (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and pray tell me the cause why wee Spainiards cry
Saint <hi>Iaques,</hi> and shut <hi>Spain?</hi> is <hi>Spain</hi> open troe, so that it needed bee shut? or what
ceremonie is this?</p>
                     <p>Thou art most simple <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) and look; This Grand Knight
with the red Crosse, God hath given him to <hi>Spain</hi> for a Patron and Protector, especially
in the hard conflicts that the Moors and wee had together; and therefore they invoke
and call on him as their Protector in all their battels they give, and many times they have
visibly seen him in them, overthrowing, trampling, destroying and killing Agaren Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons.
Many examples could I produce to confirm this, out of the true Spanish Histories.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> changed his discourse, and said to his Master, Sir, I doe wonder at the loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Altisidora, the Duchesses, Damzell; that same fellow called Love, hath bravely
wounded and runne her thorow; they say, hee is a little blinde boy, that though hee bee
blear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pierceth it with his Flight from one side to the other. I have also heard say, that in the
modesty and warinesse of Damzells, his amorous Arrows are headlesse and dull: but in
this Altisidora, it seems they are rather whetted then dull. Look you <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth
Don-Quixote). Love hath no respect or limit in his dealing, and hath the same condition
with Death, that as well sets upon the high Palaces of Kings, as the low Cottages of
Sheepheards, and when he takes entire possession of a soul, the first thing hee does, is to
banish shame, without which Altisidora declared her desires, that rather engendred in
my brest confusion then pitty.</p>
                     <p>Notable cruelty (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) unheard of thanklesnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> I know for my part,
that the least amorous reason of hers would have humbled and made me her Vassall;
ah whoreson, what a heart of marble, entrails of brasse, and soul of rough-cast had you?
but I cannot imagine what this Damzel saw in you, that should so vanquish her? What
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54746:259"/>
Gallantry? What Courage? What Conceit? What Countenance? which of these
alone, or all together enamoured her? for truly, I behold you many times from
head to foot, and I see more in you to affright then to enamour: and having also heard
say; that Beauty is the first and principall part that doth enamour, you having none, I
know not on what the poor soul was enamoured.</p>
                     <p>Marke <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) there bee two kinds of beauty, one of the
mind, the other of the body; that of the mind doth march and is seen in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
in honesty, in good proceeding, in Liberalitie, in being well bred; and all these
qualities are untamed, and may be in an ill-favored-man; and when the choyce is set
upon this beauty, and not upon that of the body, it causeth Love with more force and
advantage. I see <hi>Sancho</hi> that I am not lovely, and yet I know too that I am not defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and it is enough for an honest man, if he be not a Monster, to bee beloved, so I
have the Portions of the mind I have told thee of.</p>
                     <p>In these Reasons and Discourses they went entring in at a Wood that was out of the
way, and suddainly, before they were aware, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> found himselfe entangled
in nets of greene thread, that were set from one Tree to another; and not imagining
what it might be, he said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o <hi>Sancho,</hi> Mee thinks <hi>Sancho,</hi> this Adventure of these Netts
is one of the strangest that may bee imagined; hang me if the Enchanters that persecute
me, mean not to intangle me in them, and to stop my way, in revenge of the rigour I
have used toward <hi>Altisidora.</hi> Well, let them know that these Nets, were they of
hardest Diamonds as they are of green thred, or stronger then that the jealous God of
the Black-Smiths entangled <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> with, I would break it as if it were Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rushes
or Yarn: and striving to get forward, suddainly two most beautifull Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesses
comming from out the Thicket, appeard before him, two at least attired like
Sheepheardesses, only their loose Jackets and Coats were of fine cloth of Gold, I say,
their Kirtles were of Tissue; their hairs hung loose over their shoulders, that for gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
might compare with the Sunnebeams: they were crowned with two Garlands
woven with green Bayes, and red-flower gentle: their ages seemed to bee not under
fifteen, nor past eighteen.</p>
                     <p>This was a sight that astonisht <hi>Sancho,</hi> suspended <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> made the Sunne stop
in his Career to behold them, and held all the four in marvellous silence. In fine, the
first that spake was one of the Sheepheardesses, that said to Don-Quixote, Hold Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and break not our Nets that are spred there, not to your hurt, but for our recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
and because I know you will ask us why they are so put, and who wee are I will
tell you briefly.</p>
                     <p>In a Village some two leagues hence, where there are many Gentlemen of quality
and rich; amongst many acquaintances and Kindred it was agreed, that the Wives,
Sonnes and Daughters, Neighbours, Friends and Kinsfolk, should joyn to make merry
in this place, which is one of the pleasantest here round about, forming as it were
amongst us a new and pastorall Arcadia, clothing the Maids like Sheepheardesses, and
the Young men like Sheepheards: two Eglogues wee have studied, one of the famous
Poet <hi>Garsilasso,</hi> and the other of that most excellent Poet <hi>Camoes</hi> in his own Mother
<hi>Portugall</hi> Tongue, which hitherto wee have not repeated. Yesterday was the
first day wee came hither; wee have our Tents, called Field-Tents, pitche
amongst these Trees, close by the brink of a goodly running Brook, which fructifies all
these Medows: last night wee did spread our Nets on these Trees to catch the poor
Birds that being allured with our call should fall into them. If you please Sir, to bee
our Guest, you shall bee entertained liberally and courteously; for now into this
place comes neither Sorrow not Melancholy. With this shee was silent and said no
more.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered; Truly (fairest Lady) Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me: for my Profession is this, To shew my self thankfull, and a Doer of good
<pb facs="tcp:54746:260"/>
to all sorts of people, especially of the rank that your person shews you to bee; and if
those Nets, as they take up but a little peece of ground, should take up the whole World,
I would seek out new worlds to passe thorow, rather then break them: and that you
may give credit to this my exaggeration, behold, at least hee that promiseth you this, is
<hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> if haply this name hath come to your hearing.</p>
                     <p>Ah sweet friend (quoth the other Sheepheardesse) what good luck is this? Seest
thou this Gentleman before us? Well let me tell thee, hee is the valiantest, the most
enamoured, and the most courteous in the world, if the History lye not and deceive us,
which is in print, of his famous exploits, which I have read: I hold a wager this honest
fellow here with him, is (what call yee him?) <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his Squire, that hath no
fellow for his mirth.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I am that merry fellow, and that Squire you speak of,
and this Gentleman is my Master, the very self same <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> aforesaid and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storified.</p>
                     <p>Ah (quoth the other) let us intreat him friend, to stay with us, for our Friends and
Kindred will bee infinitely glad of it, and I have heard tell as well as thou of his worth
and wit; and above all, they say of him, that he is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

known, and that his Mistris is one <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> that bears the prize from all the
Beauties in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With just reason she doth (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) if so be your matchlesse beauties
put it not in controvesie: Weary not your selves Ladies in deteining me; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
ties of my Profession will let me rest no where.</p>
                     <p>By this there came a Brother of one of the Sheepheardesses, where the four were as
brave and gallant as they: they told him that hee which was with them, was the valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> and the other <hi>Sancho</hi> his Squire, of whom he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
as having read his History.</p>
                     <p>The gallant Sheepheard saluted him, desiring him to come with him to their Tents.
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was forced to consent, which hee did. And now the Nets were drawn
and filled with divers little Birds, who deceived with the colour of them, fell into the
danger they shun'd: There met in that place above thirty persons, all gallantly clad
like Sheepheards and Sheepheardesses; and instantly they were made to know who
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was, and his Squire; at which they were not a little contented; for they
had notice of him by his History: They came to the Tents, and found the Tables co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
rich, aboundant, and neat: they honour'd <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with the chief seat; all
of them beheld him, and admir'd to see him.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the cloth being taken away, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> very gravely lifted up his voyce,
and said, Amongst the greatest sins there are committed (though some say Pride) yet I
say Ingratitude is one, holding my self to the usuall saying, That Hell is full of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull.
This sinne, as much as possible I could, I have sought to avoid ever since I
had reason: and if I cannot repay one good turn with another, in stead of that, my
desires are not wanting, and when they suffice not I publish them: for hee that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
and publisheth good turns received, would also recompence them with
others, if he could; for, the most part, they that receive, are inferior to those that
give, and so God is above all; because hee is giver above all, and the gifts of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee equall to Gods for the infinite difference betwixt them: and this straightnesse
and barenesse doth in some measure supply a thankfullnesse: I therefore being thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the kindenesse I have here received, and not able to correspond in the same
proportion, containing my self in the narrow limits of my abilitie, offer what I may and
what I have from my Harvest: and therefore I say, that I will for two long dayes,
maintain in the midst of the Kings high-way toward <hi>Saragosa,</hi> that these Ladies,
counterfeit Sheepheardesses here present, are the fairest and most courteous Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels
in the world, excepting only the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> sole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
of my thoughts, with peace bee it spoken to as many, both hees and shees, as
heare mee.</p>
                     <p>Which when <hi>Sancho</hi> heard, that had attentively listned, crying out, hee said, Is it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54746:260"/>
possible there can bee any body in the world, that dares say or sweare that this Master
of mine is mad? Pray speake: You Gentlemen Shepheards, is there any Countrey
Vicar, bee hee never so wise, or never so good a Scholler, that can say what my Master
hath said? or is there any Knight Errant, let him bee never so much fam'd for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that can offer what my Master hath here offered?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turned to <hi>Sancho</hi> and all enflamed and cholericke, said, Is it possible,
O <hi>Sancho,</hi> that there is any body in the world that will say, Thou are not a Coxcomb,
lined with the same, and hemmed with I know not what malice or knavery? Who
bids thee meddle with my matters, in sifting out, whether I bee wise or a jolt-head?
Peace and not a word, but saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> if hee bee unsaddled, and let's put my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in execution: for with the justice that I have on my side, thou maist presume, as
many as I meet withall are vanquisht: and so with great fury, and in a terrible huffe
hee rose from his Chayre, leaving all the by-standers in admiration, and in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they should hold him mad, or wise. Finally, they perswaded him, hee should not
thrust himselfe into such an engagement: for they acknowledged his thankfull good
will, and that there needed no new demonstrations to know his valourous minde: for
his exploits mentioned in his History were sufficient.</p>
                     <p>For all that, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> proceeded in his purpose, and mounted on <hi>Rozinante,</hi>
buckling his shield to him, and taking his Launce, hee got to the High-way, not farr
from the greene Meddow. <hi>Sancho</hi> followed him upon Dapple, with all the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
flocke, desirous to see what might be the issue of that arrogant, and never seen offer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> being (as I have said) upon the way, hee wounded the ayre with
these words: Oh you Passengers, and way-faring Knights, Squires on foot, or on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
that either now passe this way, or are to passe in these two ensuing dayes, know,
that <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> Knight Errant, is here ready to maintaine, that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the beauty of the Mistris of my soule aside, <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> the Nymphs that
inhabit these Meddowes and Groves, are the fairest that may bee: and hee that is of a
contrary opinion, let him come; for here I expect him.</p>
                     <p>Twice hee repeated these selfe-same words, and twice they were not heard by any
Adventurer: but his good lucke that directed his affaires better and better, so ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that a pretty while after, they might see a troope of horse-men upon the way,
and many of them with Launces in their hands, all of them going in a heape together,
and apace: they that were with <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> as soone as ever they saw them, turn'd
their backs, and got farre enough out of the way: for they knew if they stayed, they
might bee in some danger, onely <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with an undaunted heart stood still;
and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> warded himselfe with <hi>Rozinante's</hi> buttocks.</p>
                     <p>The troope of the Launces came on, and one that was formost cryed out aloud
to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> saying, out of the way, madman: for these Buls will beat thee to
pieces.</p>
                     <p>Goe to, yee skoundrels, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> your Buls shall not prevaile with mee,
though they were the fiercest that <hi>Xarama</hi> hath feeding on his Bankes: Confesse, yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Elves, all in one, that what I have proclaimed here, is a truth, or else come and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

                     <p>The Heards-man had no leisure to answere, nor <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to get out of the
way, though hee would: and so the troope of wilde Buls, together with the tame Kine,
and the multitude of Heards-men, and others, that carried them to be kept up in a town,
where they were the next day to bee baited, trampled over <hi>Don-Quixote, Sancho, Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi>
and Dapple, tumbling them all down upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was bruised, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> astonisht, Dapple banged, and <hi>Rozinante</hi> not
very Catholike: but in fine all of them gate up, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in all haste, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
stumbling, other whiles falling, began to runne after the whole Heard, crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
Hold, Stay, yee Elvish crue; for one onely Knight expects you, who is not of
that minde or opinion of those that say, to a flying enemy a Silver bridge. But the
hasty runners stayed never a whit the more for this; nor made any reckoning of his
threats more then of last yeers clouds.</p>

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> being weary stayed him. So, fuller of anger then revenge, hee sate in
the way, expecting when <hi>Sancho, Rozinante,</hi> and Dapple should arrive. At length
they came, and Master and man gat up; and without leave taking of the fained or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<hi>Arcadia,</hi> with more shame then delight, they went onward their way.</p>

leaving <hi>Rozinante</hi> and Dapple lose without a Briddle or Halter,
the two way-beaten, Master and Man sate down. <hi>Sancho</hi> repaired
to the Cup-boord of his Wallets, and tooke out of them that which

well nurtured in mine. Actions, respected by Princes, courted by Damzells: now at the

                     <p>So that, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> (not leaving his fast chewing) you will not allow of that
Proverbe that sayes, Let <hi>Martha</hi> dye, so she dye not empty: at least, I will not because
of my death. I meane rather to doe as the Shoo-maker doth, that streacheth the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it come to the end that Heaven hath allotted it: and know Sir, there is no greater
madnesse in the world, then to despaire as you doe: and beleeve mee, and after you
have eaten, rest your selfe a little upon the Downe-beds of this green Grasse, and you
shall see, that when you wake, you shall finde your selfe somewhat lightned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke his councell, taking his reasons to bee rather Philosophicall,
then senselesse, and said, If thou, O <hi>Sancho,</hi> wouldest doe, what I shall now tell thee
for mee, my lightsomnesse would bee certaine, and my sorrowes not so great; which
is that whil'st I (obeying thy counsell) sleepe, thou goe out of the way a little, and
with <hi>Rozinantes</hi> reines, turning thy flesh to the ayre, give thy selfe three or foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
lashes upon account of the three thousand, and so many that thou art to give for
the dis-enchanting <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> which is no small pitty, that that poor Lady should bee
enchanted by thy carelesnesse and negligence.</p>
                     <p>There is much to bee said in this businesse (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) let's both sleepe now, and

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> giving him thankes, eate somthing, and <hi>Sancho</hi> a great deale,
leaving the two continuall friends and companions, <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple</hi> to their
<hi>Liberum Arbitrium,</hi> disorderly feeding upon the Pasture that was plentifull in that
Meddow.</p>
                     <p>They awaked somewhat late, and up they got againe, and went on their way, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
haste to come to an Inne, which seemed to bee about a league off: I say an Inn,
for <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> called it so; contrary to his ordinarie custome of calling all Innes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
Well, to it they come, they asked mine Host if there were any Lodging? Hee
answered, Yes, with all the commodiousnesse and provision that they might have in the
Towne of <hi>Saragosa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They alighted, and <hi>Sancho</hi> retyred with his Sumptry into a Chamber, of which the
Host gave him the Key: the Beasts hee carried to the Stable, and gave them their
stint, and so went to see what <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (who sate by upon a Bench) would
command him, giving God particular thankes, that that Inne had not appeared to him, a Castle,</p>
                     <p>Supper time came on: So to their resting place they got.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> asked mine Host what hee had for supper? To which quoth hee, Your
mouth shall have measure, aske what you will? [<hi>a good character of a lying, beggerly,
vain-glorious Spanish-Host in generall.</hi>] For from the Byrds of the ayre, to the Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the earth, and the fishes of the sea, that Inne was provided.</p>
                     <p>Not so much quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for so wee may have a couple of roasted Chickens,
'twill bee enough: For my Master is weake somack'd, and eates little, and I am no
very greedy-gut.</p>
                     <p>Mine Host answered him, hee had no Chickens, for the Kytes had devoured them, Why then let's have a tender Pullet roasted, quoth hee, A Pullet! My Father as soon;
trust mee, trust me; I sent above fifty yesterday to the City to sell: saving Pullets, ask what
you will.</p>
                     <p>Why then (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) you wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t no Veale, or Kidde? Wee have none
in the House now, said mine Host, for it is all spent; but by next weeke wee shall have
to spare.</p>
                     <p>The matter is mended (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I hold a wager all these wants are supplied
with Egs and Bacon.</p>
                     <p>Assuredly (quoth mine Hoast) here's fine doings with my guest; I have told him we
have neyther Pullet nor Hens, and yet he would have Egs. Run, if you will, to other
dainties, and leave these gluttonies.</p>
                     <p>Resolve us (Body of mee, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and tell mee what wee shall have, and
leave you your running mine Host. The Host said, The very truth is, I have two
Neates-feete, like Calves-feet; or two Calves-feet, like Neates-feet, they are sod with
their Pease, Bacon and Onyons, and just at this instant cry Come eat me, Come eat me.</p>
                     <p>For mine I mark them hence forward, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and let no man touch them; for
Ile pay more for them then any body else, and there could have beene no better meat
for mee in the world.</p>
                     <p>No man shall touch them (said mine Host:) for other Guests, I have out of pure
Gentilitie, bring their Cook, Cater, and Butler with them. If it goe by Gentle (quoth
<hi>Sancho</hi>) none more gentle then my Master: but his Calling permits no Landers or
Butteries: wee clap us down in the midest of a field, and fill our selves with Acorns
and Medlars.</p>
                     <p>This discourse passed between <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Host, without <hi>Sancho's</hi> answering him,
who asked what Calling his Master was of. Supper was ready, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went to
his Chamber; mine Host brought the pot of meat just as it was, and sate him fair and well
down to supper: it seemed that in another Chamber next <hi>Don-Quixotes,</hi> divided only
<pb facs="tcp:54746:262"/>
by a thin Lath wall, hee might heare one say, By your life Signior <hi>Don Ieronimo,</hi>
whilest supper is to come in let us read another Chapter in the second part of
<hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> scarce heard himself named, when up hee stood, and watchfully gave
care to their discourse concerning him; and hee heard that the aforesaid <hi>Don Ieronimo</hi> answered, Signior <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> why should wee read these fopperies? hee that hath read
the first part of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> it is impossible hee should take any pleasure in reading
the second.</p>
                     <p>For all that (quoth <hi>Don Iohn</hi>) 'twere good reading it: for there is no book so ill,
that hath not some good thing in it.</p>
                     <p>That which most displeaseth me in this is, thet hee makes <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> disenamoured
of <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> heard, full of wrath and despight hee lifted up his voyce
saying, Whosoever saith <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha</hi> hath forgotten, or can forget <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea
del Toboso,</hi> I will make him know with equall Armes, that he is farre from the truth:
for the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> cannot bee forgotten; neither can forgetfullnesse
bee contained in <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> his Scutchion is Loyalty; his Profession sweetly to
keep it, without doing it any violence.</p>
                     <p>Who is that answers us, said they in the next room? Who should it bee (quoth
<hi>Sancho</hi>) but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himself, that will make good all hee hath said, or as much as
hee shall say; for a good Pay-master cares not for his pawnes.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had <hi>Sancho</hi> said this, when the two Gentlemen came in at the Chamber
door;
for they seemed no lesse to them: and one of them casting his Armes about <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xotes</hi>
neck, said, neither can your presence belye your name, or your name credit your
presence. Doubtlesse you Sir, are the right <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> North-starre,
and Morning-starre of Knight Errantry, in spight of him that hath usurped your name,
and annihilated your exploits, as the Author of this Book, I here deliver hath done: and
giving him the Book that his companion had, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took it, and without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
a word, began, to turne the leaves, and a while after returned it, saying, In this
little that I have seen, I have found three things in this Authour worthy of reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
[<hi>This the Authour of this Book brings in by way of invective against an Aragonian
Scholer, that wrote a second part of</hi> Don Quixote <hi>before this was published.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The first is, some words I have read in this Prologue.</p>
                     <p>The second, that his language is <hi>Arragonian:</hi> for sometimes hee writes without
Articles. And the third, which doth most confirm his ignorance, is, That hee errs and
strayes from the truth in the chiefest of the History: for here hee sayes that <hi>Sancho
Panca</hi> my Squires Wifes name was <hi>Mary Gutierrez,</hi> which is not so; but shee is
called <hi>Teresa Panca:</hi> and therefore hee that errs in so main a matter, it may well bee
feared he will erre in all the rest of the History.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Sancho</hi> said, prettily done indeed of the Historian; hee knows very well sure
what belongs to our Affaires, since he calls my Wife <hi>Teresa Panca, Mary Gutierrez.</hi>
Pray take the Book again Sir, and see whether I be there, and whether he have chang'd
my name. By your speech friend (quoth <hi>Don Ieronimo</hi>) you should be <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
Signior <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Squire. I am (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) and I am proud of it.</p>
                     <p>Well, in faith (said the Gentleman) this modern Authour doth not treat of you so
neatly, as your person makes shew for: hee paints you out for a Glutton, and Ideot,
and nothing witty, and farre different from the <hi>Sancho</hi> that is described in the first part
of your Masters History.</p>
                     <p>God forgive him (said <hi>Sancho;</hi>) hee should have left me in my corner, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
me; for every man in his ability, and 'tis good sleeping in a whole skin.</p>
                     <p>The two Gentlemen entreated <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to goe to their chamber, and Sup
with them; for they knew well that in that Inne hee found not things fitting to his
person.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who was ever courteous, condescended to their requests, and supped
with them: <hi>Sancho</hi> remained with his flesh-pot sole Lord and Governour. <hi>Sancho</hi> sate
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54746:262"/>
at the upper end of the Table, and with him the Inn-keeper, that was no lesse affectioned
to his Neats-feet, then <hi>Sancho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the midst of supper <hi>Don Iohn</hi> asked <hi>Don Quixote</hi> what news hee had of his Lady
<hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> whether shee were married, or brought a Bed, or great with child;
or being entire, whether (respecting her honesty and good <hi>decorum</hi>) she were mindefull
of Signior <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> amorous desires? To which he answered; <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and my desires as firm as ever; our correspondency in the ancient barrennsse; her
beauty transformed into the complexion of a base Milk-wench: and straight hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
unto them every tittle of her Enchantment, and what had befaln him in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesinos</hi>
Cave, with the order that the sage <hi>Merlin</hi> had given for her dis-enchanting, which
was by <hi>Sancho's</hi> stripes.</p>
                     <p>Great was the delight the two Gentlemen received to heare <hi>Don Quixote</hi> tell the
strange passages of his History, and so they wondered at his fopperies, as also his elegant
manner of delivering them; here they held him to be wise, there he slipped from
them by the fool: so they know not what <hi>medium</hi> to give him, betwixtn wisedome and
folly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> ended his Supper, and leaving the Inn-keeper, passed to the Chamber where
his Master was; and entring, said, Hang me Sirs, if the Authour of this Book that your
Worships have, would that wee should eat a good meale together; pray God, as hee
calls me Glutton, hee say not that I am a Drunkard too.</p>
                     <p>Yes marry doth hee (said <hi>Don Ieronimo;</hi>) but I know not how directly, though I
know his reasons doe not hang together, and are very erroneous, as I see by <hi>Sancho's</hi>
Phisiognomy here present. Believe me (quoth <hi>Sancho) Sancho</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> are
differing in this History, from what they are in that <hi>Cid Hamete Benengeli</hi> composed;
for wee are, my Master valiant, discreet and amorous: I simple and conceited; but
neither Glutton nor Drunkard.</p>
                     <p>I believe it (said <hi>Don Iohn</hi>) and were it possible, it should bee commanded, that
none should dare to treat of the Grand <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> Affairs, but <hi>Cid Hamete,</hi> his
first Authour: as <hi>Alexander</hi> commanded that none but Apelles should dare to draw him.</p>
                     <p>Let whose will draw me (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi>) but let him not abuse me; for of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
times patience falls when injuries over-load. None (quoth <hi>Don Iohn</hi>) can be done
Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that hee will not bee revenged of, if he ward it not with the
Shield of his patience, which in my opinion is strong and great.</p>
                     <p>In these and other discourses they passed a great part of the night, and though <hi>Don
Iohn</hi> would that <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> should have read more in the Book, to see what it did
descant on, yet hee could not prevaile with him, saying, Hee made account he had read
it, and concluded it to bee but an idle Pamphlet, and that hee would not (if it should
come to the Authours knowledge that hee had medled with it) hee should make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
merry to think he had read it; for our thoughts must not be busied in filthy and obscene things, much lesse our eyes.</p>
                     <p>They asked him whither hee purposed his voyage? Hee answered to <hi>Saragosa,</hi> to be
at the Justs in Harnesse, that use to be there yeerly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Iohn</hi> told him, that there was one thing in that new History, which was, That
hee should bee at a Running at the Ring in that City, as short of Invention, as poor in
Mottos, but most poor in Liveries, and rich in nothing but Simplicities.</p>
                     <p>For this matter only (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) I will not set foot in <hi>Saragosa:</hi> and

left the Inn, informing himself first, which was the ready
way to <hi>Barselona,</hi> without comming to <hi>Saragosa;</hi> such was the
desire hee had to prove the new Historian a lyar, who (they said)
dispraised him so much. It fell out so, that in six dayes there fell
out nothing worth writing to him; at the end of which hee was
be-nighted, going out of his way, in a thicket of Oakes or
Cork-Trees; for in this <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> is not so punctuall, as in other matters hee useth to bee.</p>
                     <p>The Masters and man alighted from their Beasts, and setting themselves at the Trees
roots, <hi>Sancho</hi> that had had his beaver that day entred roundly the gates of sleep: but
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whom imaginations kept awake much more then hunger, could not joyn
his eyes, but rather was busying his thoughts in a thousand severall places: Sometimes
hee thought hee found himself in <hi>Montesinos</hi> Cave: aud that hee saw
<hi>Dulcinea</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into a country Wench, leap upon her Asse-Colt: now the sage <hi>Merlin's</hi>
words rang in his eares, repeating unto him the conditions that were to bee observed for
her dis-enchanting: hee was stark mad to see <hi>Sancho's</hi> Lazinesse, and want of Charity;
for, as hee thought, hee had only given himself five stripes, a poor and unequall number
to those behinde; and hee was so griev'd and enraged with this, that he framed this
discourse to himself:</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Alexander</hi> the Greate did cut the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, saying, Cutting and undoing
is all one, and yet for all that, was Lord of all <hi>Asia;</hi> no other wise may it happen in
the dis-enchanting: of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> if I should whip <hi>Sancho, volens nolens;</hi> for if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this remedy be, that <hi>Sancho</hi> receive three thousand and so many jerks, what care
I whether hee give them, or that another doe, since the substance is in him that gives
them, come they by what means they will?</p>
                     <p>With this imagination he came to <hi>Sancho,</hi> having first taken <hi>Rozinante's</hi> Reines, and
so fitted them, that he might lash him with them, he began to untrusse his points: The

was no sooner approached, when <hi>Sancho</hi> awaked, and came to himself, and said, Who
is that? Who is it toucheth and untrusseth me? 'Tis I (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that
come to supply thy defects, and to remedy my troubles; I come to whip thee <hi>Sancho,</hi>
and to discharge the Debt in part thou standest oblieged in, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> perisheth; thou
livest carelesly; I dye desiring: and therefore untrusse thy self willingly; for I have a
minde, in these Desarts, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.</p>
                     <p>Not so (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) pray be quiet; and if not, I protest deaf men shall hear us; the
stripes in which I engaged my self must bee voluntary, and not enforc'd, and at this time
I have no minde to whip my self; 'tis enough that I give you my word to beat my self;
and fly-flap me when I have a disposition to it.</p>

                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:54746:263"/>There's no leaving of it to thy coutesie, <hi>Sancho,</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for thou
art hard hearted, and though a Clowne, yet tender of flesh; and so hee contended and
strove to unlace him: which when <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> saw, hee stood to it, and setting upon
his Master, closed with him, and tripping up his heeles, cast him upon his back on the
ground, hee put his right knee upon his brest, and with his hands held his, so that hee
neyther let him stirr nor breathe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> cryed out, How now, Traitor, rebellest thou against thy naturall

nor depose King (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) I onely helpe my selfe that am mine owne Lord: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

and Ile set you loose and free; and If not, here thou diest, Traitor, enemy to <hi>Donna

not touch so much as a hayre of his head, and that hee would leave his whipping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to his owne free-will and choice when hee would.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> gate up, and went a pretty way from him, and going to leane to another
tree, hee perceived something touch him upon the head, and lifting up his hands, hee
lighted on two feet of a man, with Hose and Shooes on; hee quak'd for feare, and went
to another tree, and the like befell him; so he cried out, calling to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to help
him; <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did so, and asking him what had befaln him? and why he was afraid?
<hi>Sancho</hi> answered, That all those trees were full of mens feet and legges. Don-Quixote
felt them, and fell strait into the account of what they might be, and said to <hi>Sancho,</hi> Thou
needest not feare; for these fect and legges thou feelest and feest not, doubtlesse are of some free-booters and robbers in troopes, that are hanged in these trees; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Justice hangs them by twenty and thirty at a clap, by which I understand that I am
neere <hi>Barcelona:</hi> and true it was as hee supposed. They lifted up their eyes, and to see
to, the free-booters bodies hung as if they had beene clusters upon those trees: and by
this it waxed day; and if the dead men feared them, no lesse were they in tribulation
with the sight of at least forty live <hi>Shanditi,</hi> who hemmed them in upon a sodain, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them in the <hi>Catalan</hi> tongue, they should bee quiet, and stand till their captaine
came.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was on foot, his horse unbridled, his Launce set up against a tree, finally,
void of all defence, and therefore hee deemed it best to crosse his hands, and hold down
his head, reserving himself for a better occasion and conjuncture.</p>
                     <p>The Theeves came to flea Dapple, and began to leave him nothing hee had, either
in his Wallets or Cloke-bage; and it fell out well for <hi>Sancho,</hi> for the Dukes Crownes
were in a hollow girdle girt to him, and those likewise that hee brought from home
with him, and for all that, those good fellowes would have weeded and searched him
to the very entrailes, if their Captaine had not come in the <hi>Interim,</hi> who seemed to
bee about thirty yeeres of age, strongly made, and somewhat of a tall stature; his looke
was solemne, and his complexion swarthy: hee was mounted upon a powerfull Horse,
with his Steele coat on, and foure Petronels (called in that Country <hi>Pedrenales</hi>) which
hee wore two at each side: and now his squires (for so they call those that are in that
vocation) came to make spoyle of <hi>Sancho:</hi> hee commanded them they should not,
and hee was strait obeyed, and so the Girdle escaped hee wondred to see a Launce
reared up on a tree, a Shield on the ground, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> armed and pensative,
with the saddest Melancholiest visage, that sadnesse it selfe could frame. Hee came to
him, saying, Bee not sad, honest man; for you have not falne into the hands of any
cruell <hi>Osiris,</hi> but into <hi>Roque Guinarts,</hi> that have more compassion then cruelty in
them.</p>
                     <p>My sadnesse is not, quoth, <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to have falne into thy power, oh valorous

have caught mee without bridle, I being obliged (according to the order of Knight
Errantry, which I professe, to keepe watch and ward, and at all houses, to bee my owne

                        <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> hee, of whose exploits all the world is full. Straight
<hi>Roque Guinarte</hi> perceived that <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi> infirmity proceeded rather of Madnesse
then Valour, and though hee had sometimes heard tell of him, yet he never could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
his deeds to bee true, neither could hee bee perswaded that such a humour should
raigne in any mans heart, and hee was wonderfully glad to have met with him, to see by
experience what hee had heard say of him; and therefore hee said, Valorous Knight,
vexe not your self, neither take this Fortune of yours to bee sinister; for it may be,
that in these stumbling blocks your crooked Lot may bee straightned; for heaven doth
usually raise up those that fall, and enrich the poor by strange and unseen waies (by men
not imagined.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was about to have rendred him thanks, when as they perceived a noyse
behinde them, as if there had been some troop of Horse, but there was but one only, upon
which there came with full speed a Youth, to see to, about some twenty yeers of age,
clad in green Damask; his Hose and loose Jerkin were laid on with gold lace, with a
Hat turned up from his band, with close fit Boots, Sword and Dagger gilt, and a little
Birding-Peece in his hand, and two Pistols at his sides. <hi>Roque</hi> turned his head to the
noyse and saw this beautifull shape, who comming neer him, said, In quest of thee I
came, oh valorous <hi>Roque,</hi> to finde in thee, if not redresse, at least some lightsomnesse
in this my misfortune: And to hold thee no longer in suspence, because I know thou
knowest me not, I will tell thee who I am, that is, <hi>Clandia seronima</hi> daughter to <hi>Simon

being one of thy contrary Faction; and thou knowest that this <hi>Torellas</hi> hath a Sonne
called <hi>Don Vincente Torellas,</hi> or at least was so called not two hours since: He then, to
shorten my unfortunate Tale, I will tell thee in few words what hath befallen me: He

hath time enough to put in execution and effect her hasty longing.</p>
                     <p>Finally, hee promised me marriage, and I gave him my word, to bee his, so no more
passed really: Yesterday I came to know, that, forgetfull of his obligation, he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to another, and that this morning hee went to bee married; a news that troubled
my brain, and made an end of my patience: and by reason my Father was not at home
I had oportunity to put my self in this apparell thou seest, and making speed with this
horse, I overtook <hi>Don Vincente</hi> about a league from hence, and without making any
complaint, or hearing his discharge, I discharged this Piece, and to boot, these Pistols,
and I beleeve I sent two bullets into his body, making way, thorow which my honour,
enwrapped in his blood, might sally out: therefore I left him to his servants, who not
durst, nor could put themselves in his defence. I came to seek thee, that thou mightest
help me to passe me into <hi>France,</hi> where I have kindred, with whom I may live; and
withall, to desire thee to defend my Father, that the number of <hi>Don Vincentes</hi> Friends

                        <hi>Roque Guinarte</hi> found his Squires where hee had willed them to bee; and <hi>Don-Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi>
amongst them upon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> making a large discourse to them, in which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them to leave that kinde of life, dangerous as well for their soules as bodies:
but the most of them being Gascoignes, a wilde and unruly people, <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
prevailed nothing with them.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Roque</hi> was come, hee asked <hi>Sancho,</hi> if they had restored his implements to
him, and the Prize which his Souldiers had taken from Dapple. <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, Yes,
onely that hee wanted three Night-caps, that were worth three Citties. What say
you fellow? Quoth one of them: I have them, and they were not worth eighteene
pence.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) but my Squire esteemes them in what hee hath said, for
the parties sake that gave them mee,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roque Guinart</hi> straight commanded they should bee restored, and commanding
his people to stand round, hee willed them to set before them, all the apparell, Jewels,
and money, and all that since their last sharing they had robbed: and casting up the
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dount
briefely, returning that that was not to bee reparted; reducing it into money,
hee divided it amongst all his company, so legally, and wisely, that hee neither added
nor diminished, from an equall distributive justice</p>
                     <p>This done, and all contented, satisfied, and payd, <hi>Roque</hi> said to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> If
I should not bee thus punctuall with these fellowes, there were no living with them:
To which said <hi>Sancho,</hi> By what I have here seene, Justice is so good, that it is fit and
necessary, even amongst theeves themselves.</p>
                     <p>One of the Squires heard him, and lifted up the snap-haunce of his Piece, with which
hee had opened his Mazer, if <hi>Roque Guinart</hi> had not cryed out to bid him hold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was amazed, and purposed, not to unsow his lips, as long as hee was in that
company.</p>
                     <p>Now there came one or more of the Squires, that were put in Centinell, upon the
wayes, to see who passed by, and to give notice to their Chiefe, what passed; who said,
Sir, not far hence, by the way that goes to <hi>Barcolona,</hi> there comes a great Troope of
people. To which quoth <hi>Roque,</hi> Hast thou markt whether they bee of those that seeke
us, or those wee seeke? Of the latter, said the Squire.</p>
                     <p>Well, get you out all quoth <hi>Roque,</hi> and bring them me hither straight, and let not
a man scapt. They did so, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Roque,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> stay'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to see what the Squires brought: and in the <hi>Interim, Roque,</hi> said to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
Our life will seeme to bee a strange kinde of one to Signior <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> strange Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,

safe harbour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> admired to heare from <hi>Roque</hi> such good and sound reasons: for hee
thought, that amongst those of this profession of robbing, killing, and High-way-laying,
there could bee none so well spoken, and answered him:</p>
                     <p>Signior <hi>Roque,</hi> the beginning of health consists, in knowing the infirmity and that
the sick man bee willing to take the Medicines that the Physician ordaines. You are
sick: you know your griefe, and heaven, or (to say truer) God who is our Physician,
will apply Medicines that may cure you, which doe heal by degrees, but not suddenly,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54746:266"/>
and by miracle: Besides, sinners that have knowledge, are neerer amendment then those
that are without it: and since you, by your discourse, have shew'd your discretion,
there is no more to bee done, but bee of good courage, and despair not of the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
your sick conscience; and if you will save a labour, and facilitate the way of your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
come with me and I will teach you to bee a Knight Errant, and how you shall
undergoe so many labours and mis-adventures, that taking them by way of penance, you
shall climbe Heaven in an instant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roque</hi> laughed at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> counsail, to whom (changing their discourse) hee
recounted the Tragicall successe of <hi>Claudia Ieronimo;</hi> at which <hi>Sancho</hi> wept excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
for the Beauty, Spirit and Buck-somenesse of the Wench, misliked him
not.</p>
                     <p>By this the Squires returned with their Prize, bringing with them, two Gentlemen
on horse-back, and two Pilgrims on foot, and a Coach full of Women, and some half
a dozen of Servants, that, on horse-back and on foot, waited on them, with two Mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that belonged to the two Gentlemen. The Squires brought them in triumph, the
Conquerors and Conquered being all silent, and expecting what the Grand <hi>Roque</hi>
should determine: who asked the Gentlemen, who they were? whither they would?
and what money they carried? One of them answered him, Sir, We two are Captains of
Spanish Foot, and have companies in <hi>Naples,</hi> and are going to imbarke our selves in
four Gallies, that wee hear are bound for <hi>Silicia:</hi> we carry with us two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns, which wee think is sufficient, as being the largest treasure incident to the
ordinary penury of Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roque</hi> asked the Pilgrims the same questions; who answered him likewise, That
they were to be imbarqued towards <hi>Rome;</hi> and that they carried a matter of thirty
shillings between them both. The same he likewise desired to know of those that went
in the Coach, and one of them on Horse-back answered;</p>
                     <p>My Lady <hi>Donna Guiomar de Quinnones,</hi> Wife to a Judge of <hi>Naples,</hi>
with a little
Gyrle and her Maids, are they that goe in the Coach; and some six servants of us wait
on her: and wee carry six hundred Pistolets in gold. So that (said <hi>Roque Guinarte</hi>)
wee have here in all nine hundreth Crowns, and sixty Ryals; my Souldiers are about a
sixtie; let us see what comes to each mans share; for I am a bad Arithmetician.</p>
                     <p>When the Theeves heard this, they cryed alowd, Long live <hi>Roque Guinarte,</hi> in spight
of the <hi>Cullions</hi> that seek to deltory him.</p>
                     <p>The Captains were afflicted, the Lady was sorrowfull, and the Pilgrims never a whit
glad, to see their goods thus confiscated. <hi>Roque</hi> a while held them in this suspence: but
hee would no longer detein them in this sadnesse, which hee might see a gun-shoot off
in their faces: and turning to the Captains, said, Captains, you shall doe me the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as to lend me threescore Ducats; and you Madam, fourscore, to content my Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
that follows me; for herein consists my Revenue: and so you may passe on
freely, only with a safe conduct that I shall give you; that if you meet with any
other Squadrons of mine, which are divided upon these Downs, they doe
you no hurt: for my intent is not to wrong Souldiers, or any woman, especially
Noble.</p>
                     <p>The Captains infinitely extolled <hi>Roques</hi> courteous liberality, for leaving them their
money. The Lady would have cast her self out of the Coach to kisse the Grand <hi>Roques</hi>
feet and hands: but hee would by no means yeeld to it; rather asked pardon that hee
had presumed so farre, which was only to comply with the obligation of his ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>The Lady commanded a Servant of hers, to give him straight fourscore Ducats, which
were allotted him: the Captains too disbursed their sixty; and the Pilgrims tendered
their Povertie: but <hi>Roque</hi> bade them bee still: and turning to his people, said, Out of
these Crowns, there are to each man two due; and there remain twenty: let the poor
Pilgrims have ten of them, and the other ten, this honest Squire, that hee may speak well
of this Adventure: and so bringing him necessaries to write, of which he ever went
provided, hee gave them a safe conduct to the heads of his Squadrons; and taking leave
<pb facs="tcp:54746:267"/>
of them, let them passe free: and wondring at the noblenesse of his brave and strange
condition, holding him rather for a great <hi>Alexander,</hi> then an open Robber: One of
the Theeves said in his <hi>Catalan</hi> language, This Captain of ours were fitter to bee a Frier
then a Robber: and if hee mean henceforward to bee so liberall, let it bee with his own
goods, and not with ours.</p>
                     <p>This the Wretch spoke not so softly, but <hi>Roque</hi> might over hear him; who catching
his Sword in hand, almost clove his pate in two, saying, This is the punishment I use
to sawcy Knaves: All the rest were amazed, and durst not reply a word; such was
the awe in which they stood of him. <hi>Roque</hi> then retired aside, and wrote a Letter to a
friend of his to <hi>Barselona,</hi> advising him how the famous <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi>
was with him, that Knight Errant so notorious: and hee gave him to understand, that
hee was the most conceited understanding fellow in the world: and that about some
four dayes after, which was Mid-summer day, hee should have him upon the City
Wharf, Armed at all points, upon his Horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and his Squire likewise upon his
Asse: And that hee should let the <hi>Niarros</hi> his friends know so much, that they might
solace themselves with him: But hee could wish the <hi>Cadels</hi> his Adversaries might want
the pastime that the madnesse of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and his conceited Squire would make.
Hee delivered the Letter to one of his Squires; who changing his Theeves habit for a
Country-mans, went to the Citie, and delivered it to whom it was directed.</p>

another, there they dine: Sometimes they flye from I know not

                     <p>They sleep standing, a broken sleep, changing from place to place:
all waies setting of Spies, listening of Sentinels, blowing Musquet
matches, though of such shot they had but few; most of them carrying Petronels.
<hi>Roque</hi> himself slept apart from the rest, not letting them know where he lodged, because
the many Proclamations which the Vice-Roy of <hi>Barselona</hi> had caused to be made to
take him, made him unquiet and fearfull, and so hee durst trust no body, fearing his own
people would either kill or deliver him to the Justice: a life indeed wretched and irksome:
at length, by by-waies and cross-paths <hi>Roque</hi> &amp; <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> got to the Wharf of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selona,</hi>
where <hi>Roque</hi> gave <hi>Sancho</hi> the ten Crowns hee promised him; and so they parted
with many complements on both parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roque</hi> returned, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stayed there, expecting the day just as he was on
horse-back: and a while after, the face of the, white <hi>Aurora,</hi> began to peep thorow the
Bay-windows of the East, cheering the Hearbs and Flowers, in stead of delighting the
eare, and yet at the same instant a noise of Ho-boyes and Drums delighted their ears, and
a noise of Morris-bels, with the Pat a pat of horse-men running, to see too, out of the
City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurora</hi> now gave the Sunne leave to rise out of the lowest part of the East, with his

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> spred their eyes round about, and they might see the Sea,
which till that time they had never seen: it seemed unto them most large and spacious,
more by farre then the Lake of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54746:267"/>
the Gallies in the Wharf, who clapping down their Tilts, discovered themselves full of
Flaggs and Streamers that waved in the winde, and kissed and swept the water: within
the <hi>Clarines,</hi> Trumpets and Ho-boyes sounded that farre and neer filled the Ayre with sweet and warlike accents: they began to move and make shew of skirmish upon the
gentle water, a world of Gallants answering them on land, which came out of the Citie
upon goodly Horses, and brave in their Liveries.</p>
                     <p>The Souldiers of the Gallies discharged an infinite of shot, which were answered
from the Walls and Forts of the Citie, and the great shot with fearfull noyse cut the
Ayre, which were answered with the Gallies fore-Castle Canons: the Sea was cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the Land jocund, the sky cleer, only somewhat dimmed with the smoak of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
it seemed to infuse and engender a sodain delight in all men. <hi>Sancho</hi> could not
imagine how those Bulks that moved upon the Sea, could have so many feet. By this
they a-shore in the rich Liveries began to run on with their Moorish out cries, even to
the very place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was wondring and amazed: and one of them, he
who had the Letter from <hi>Roque,</hi> said to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thus, alowd; Welcome to our
City is the Looking-glasse, the Lanthorne and North-starre of all Knight Errantry,
where it is most in practice. Welcome, I say, is the Valorous <hi>Don Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha:</hi>
not the false, fictitious, or Apocryphall, that hath been demonstrated to us of late
in false Histories; but the true, legall, and faithfull Hee, which <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> the flower
of Historians describes unto us. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered not a word, neither did the
Gentlemen expect hee should; but turning in and out with the rest, they wheeled
about <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> who turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> said, These men know us well; Ile lay a
wager they have read our History, and that too of the Aragonians lately printed. The
Gentlemen that spoke to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came back again, and said to him; Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
come with us, I beseech you; for we are all your Servants, and <hi>Roque Guinarte's</hi>
dear Friends. To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replyed: If edurtesies engender courtesies, then
yours, Sir Knight, is daughter or neer kindred to <hi>Roques:</hi> carry me whither you will,
for I am wholly yours, and at your service, if you please to command me. In the like
Courtly strain, the Gentleman answered him: and so locking him in the midest of
them, with sound of Drumms and Ho-boyes, they carried him towards the City, where
at his entrance, as ill luck would have it, and the Boyes, that are the worst of all ill, two of
them, bold Crack-ropes, came among the thrust, and one of them lifting up Dapples
tail, and the other <hi>Rozinantes,</hi> they fastned each their handfull of Nettles. The poor
Beasts felt the new spurs, and clapping their tails close, augmented their pains; so that
after a thousand winces, they cast down their Masters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> all abashed and disgraced, went to take this Plumage from his Coursets
tail, and <hi>Sancho</hi> from Dapples. Those that guided <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> would have punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Boyes for their sawcinesse; but it was not possible, for they got themselves into
the thickest of a thousand others that followed. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> returned to
their seats, and with the same applause and Musick, they came to their Guides house,
which was fair and large, indeed, as was fit for a Gentleman of means; where wee will
leave him for the present, because <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> will have it so.</p>

                        <hi>DOn-Quixotes</hi> Hosts name was <hi>Don Antonio Morino,</hi> a rich Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and a discreet, and one that loved to bee honestly and affably
merry; who having <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> now at home, began to invent
how, without prejudice to him, he might divulge his madnesse; for
Jests ought not to bee too bitter, nor pastimes in detriment of a
third person.</p>
                     <p>The first thing hee did then, was to cause <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
and to make him appear in that straight Chamois apparel of his (as heretofore
wee have painted and described him:) so hee brought him to a Bay-window which
looked toward one of the chiefest streets in the City, to bee publikely seen by all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and the Boyes that beheld him as if hee had been a Monkey. They in the Liveries
began a-fresh to fetch Careers before him, as if for him only (and not to solemnize that
Festivall-day) their Liveries had been put on: And <hi>Sancho</hi> was most jocund, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had found out, hee knew not how nor which way, a new <hi>Camacho's</hi> marriage,
or another house like <hi>Don Diego</hi> and <hi>Miranda's,</hi> or the Dukes Castle.</p>
                     <p>That day some of <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> friends dined with him, all honouring <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi>
and observing him as a Knight Errant; with which being most vain-glorious, hee
could scarce contain himself in his happinesse. <hi>Sancho's</hi> conceits were such, and so
many, that all the Servants of the house hung upon his lipps, and as many also as heard
him.</p>
                     <p>Being at Table <hi>Don Antonio</hi> said to <hi>Sancho:</hi> Wee have heard here, honest <hi>Sancho,</hi>
that thou lovest Leech and roasted Olives so well, that when thou canst eat no more,
thou keepest the rest in thy bosome till another time. No Sir, '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>is not so (said <hi>Sancho</hi>)
for I am more cleanly then so, and my Master <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> here present knows well,
that wee are wont both of us to live eight dayes with a handfull of Acorns or Walnuts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
true it is, that now I look not a given horse in the mouth (I mean) I eat what is given
me, and make use of the time present; and whosoever hath said that I am an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
eater, and not cleanly, let him know hee doth me wrong; and I should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proceed
farther, were it not for the company here at Table.</p>
                     <p>Truly (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) the parsimony and cleanlinesse with which <hi>Sancho</hi> feeds,
may bee written and graved in sheets of brass, that it may bee eternally remembred by
ensuing Ages: True it is, that when hee is hungry, hee is somewhat Ravenous,
eats a-pace, and chews on both sides; but for cleanliness, that hee hath punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:
and when hee was a Governour, hee learnt to eat most neatly; for hee would
eat you Grapes, nay, Pomgranat seeds with his fork. How (quoth <hi>Don Antonio</hi>)
hath <hi>Sancho</hi> been a Governour? I (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and of an Island called <hi>Barataria:</hi>
ten dayes I governed to my will, in them I lost my rest, and learnt to contemn all the
Governments in the world. From thence I came flying, and fell into a Pit, where I
thought I should have dyed, from whence I escaped miraculously.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> recounted all the particulars of <hi>Sancho's</hi> Government, with which the
hearers were much delighted. The cloth now taken away, and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> taking
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> by the hand, carried him into a private chamber, in which there was no
other kinde of furniture but a Table that seemed to bee of Jasper, born up with feet of
the same upon which there was set a Head, as if it had been of brasse, just as your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Emperours are used to bee, from the brest upward: <hi>Don Antonio</hi> walked with
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> up and down the chamber, and having gone a good many turns about the
Table, at last hee said: Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> now that I am fully perswaded no body

it; for let mee tell you, Signior <hi>Don Antonio</hi> (for now hee knew his name) you
converse with one, that though hee have eares to heare, yet he hath no tongue to tell: so
that what is in your brest, you may freely translate it into mine, and rest assured, that
you have flung it into the <hi>Abissus</hi> of silence.</p>
                     <p>In confidence of this promise (answered <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) I will make you admire at
what you shall heare and see, and so you shall somewhat ease mee of the trouble I am
in, in not finding one that I may communicate my secrets with; with which, every one
is not to bee trusted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was in great suspence, expecting what would bee the issue of all these
circumstances; so <hi>Don Antonio</hi> taking him by the hand, hee made him feele all over
the brazen head and the Table, and Jasper feet, and then said, This head, Signior, was
made by one of the greatest Enchanters or Magicians that hath beene in the world, and
I beleeve, by Nation hee was a Polander, and one of that famous <hi>Scotus</hi> his disciples,
of whom so many wonders are related, who was here in my house, and for a thousand
Crownes I gave him, framed mee this head, that hath the property and quallity to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to any thing that it is asked in your eare: hee had his trickes and devices, his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Characters, his observing of Starres, look't to every tittle, and finally, brought
this head to the perfection that to morrow you shall see, for on the Fridayes still it
is mute, which being this day, wee must expect till to morrow; and so in the meane
time you may bethinke you what you will demand; for I know by experience, this head
answers truly to all that is asked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> admired at the vertue and property of the head, and could scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<hi>Don Antonio,</hi> but seeing how short a time there was to the triall, hee would not
gain-say him, but thanked him for discovering so great a secret: So out of the roome
they went: <hi>Don Antonio</hi> locked the dore after him, and they came into a Hall where
the rest of the Gentlemen were: in this <hi>Interim, Sancho</hi> had related to them many of
the Adventures and successes that befell his Master. That after-noone they carryed
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> abroad, not armed, but clad in the Citty garbe, with a loose coat of taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cloth, that in that season might have made frost it selfe sweat: they gave order to their
servants to entertaine <hi>Sancho,</hi> and not let him stirre out of dores. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rode
not upon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> but on a goodly trotting Mule, with good furniture, they put
his coat upon him, and at his back (hee not perceiving it) they sowed a piece of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein was written in Text letters, <hi>This is Don-Quixote de la Mancha:</hi> as
they began their walke, the scrowle drew all mens eyes to looke on it, and as they read,
<hi>This is Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> hee admired to see what a number beheld and
named him, and knew him; and turning to <hi>Don Antonio</hi> that went by him, said, Great
is the Prerogative due to Knight Errantry, since over all the world, it makes its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
knowne and renowned; for looke you, Signior <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> even the very
boyes of this Citty having never seene mee before, know mee. Tis true, Signior, quoth
<hi>Don Antonio:</hi> for as fire cannot bee hidden nor bounded, no more can vertue but it
must bee knowne; and that which is gotten by the Profession of Armes, doth most
flourish and triumph above the rest.</p>
                     <p>It hapned, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> riding with this applause, a Castillian that read the
scrowle at his backe, raised his voyce, saying. The Devill take thee for <hi>Don-Quixote de
la Mancha:</hi> and art thou gotten hither without being killed with those infinite ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings
thou hast borne upon thy shoulders? Thou art a mad-man, and wert thou so
in private, and within thy house 'twere lesse evill; but thy property is, to make all that
converse or treat with thee, mad-men and Cox-combes, as may appeare by these that
accompany thee: get thee home, Ideot, and looke to thy Estate, Wife, and Children,
and leave these vanities that Worme eate thy braines, and defile thy Intellect. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
said <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> follow your way, and give no counsell to those that need it not,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:269"/>
Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is wise, and wee that doe accompaine him, are no fools: Virtue
is worthy to bee honoured wheresoever shee is; and so bee gone with a pox to you,
and meddle not where you have nothing to doe. I vow (quoth the Castilian) you have
reason; for to give counsail to this man, is to strive against the stream: but for all that,
it pitties me very much, that the good understanding they say this block-head hath in all
things else, should be let out at the pipe of his Knight Erranty, and a pox light on me
(as you wish Sir) and all my Posterity, if from hence-forward, though I should live to
the yeers of <hi>Methusalem,</hi> I give consail to any, though it bee desired.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Counseller went by, and the shew went on: but the Boyes and all manner
of people pressed so thick to read the scrowl, that <hi>Don-Antonio</hi> was forced to take it off
from him, as if hee had done something else.</p>
                     <p>The night came on, and they returned home, where was a Revels of women; for
<hi>Don Antonio's</hi> Wife, that was well-bred, mirthfull, fair, and discreet, invited other
shee-friends of hers, to come and welcome her new Guest, and to make merry with his
strange madnesse. Some of them came, and they had a Royall supper, and the Revels
began about ten a clock at night. Among these Dames, there were two of a notable
waggish disposition, and great scoffers; and though honest, yet they strained their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that their tricks might the better delight without irksomenesse; these were so
eager to take <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> out to Dance, that they wearied not only his body, but his
minde likewise: 'twas a goodly sight to see his shape, long, lank, lean, his visage pale,
the whole man shut up in his apparel, ungraceful &amp; unweildy. The Damzels wooed him
as it were by stealth, and he by stealth disdained them as fast: but seeing himself much
pressed by their courtings, he lifed up his voyce, and said, <hi>Fugite partes adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rsae,</hi> and leave
me, oh unwelcome imaginations, to my quiet: Get you farther off with your wishes
Ladies; for shee that is the Ladie of mine, the peerlesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> will have
none but hers subject and conquer me: and so saying, hee sate him down in the midest
of the Hall upon the ground, bruised and broken with his dancing exercise. <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi>
made him bee taken up in mens armes, and carried to Bed: the first that laid hold on
him was <hi>Sancho,</hi> saying, In the name of God, what meant you, Master mine to Dance?
Think you that all that are valiant, must bee Dancers? and all Knights Errant Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacks?
I say, if you think so, you are deceived; you have some that will rather kill
Gyants then fetch a caper: if you were to frisk, I would save you that labour; for I
can doe it like a <hi>Ier-Falcon;</hi> but in your dancing, I cannot work a stitch.</p>
                     <p>With this, and such like discourse <hi>Sancho</hi> made the Revellers laugh, and laid his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to Bed, laying clothes enough on him, that hee might sweat out the cold hee had
taken by dancing.</p>
                     <p>The next day <hi>Don Antonio</hi> thought fit to try the enchanted Head; and so, with <hi>Don Quixote, Sancho,</hi>
and others his friends, and the two Gentlewomen that had so labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in the Dance, that staid all night with <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> Wife, hee locked
himself in the Room where the head was; hee told them its propertie, enjoyhing them
to silence; and hee said to them, That this was the first time in which hee meant to
make proof of the virtue of the Enchanted head, and, except his two friends, no living
creature else knew the trick of that Enchantment; and if <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it to them, they also would have faln into the same admiration that the
rest did; for it was not otherwise possible; the fabrick of it being so curious and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>The first that came to the Heads hearing, was <hi>Don Antonio</hi> himself, who spoke softly,
but so that hee might be heard by all: Tell me Head, by the virtue that is contained in
thee, What think I now? And the Head answered (not moving the lips, with a lowd
and distinct voyce, that all the by-standers might hear this reason) I judge not of
thoughts. Which when they all heard, they were astonisht, and the more, seeing neither
in all the Roome, nor any where about the Table, there was not any humane creature
to answer. How many here be there of us (quoth <hi>Don Antonio</hi> again?) And answer was
made him in the same tenour voyce: There are thou and thy Wife, with two of thy
hee-friends, and two of her shee-friends, and a famous Knight called <hi>Don-Quixote
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54746:269"/>
de la Mancha,</hi> and a Squire of his that hight <hi>Sancho Panca.</hi> I marry Sir, here was the
wondring a-fresh; here was every ones hair standing on end with pure horror! And
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> getting him aside from the Head, said, 'Tis enough now for me to know
that I was not deceived by him that sold thee me, sage Head, talking Head, answering
Head, admired Head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Come another now, and ask what hee will: and as your wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for the most part are hastiest, and most inquisitive, the first that came, was one of
<hi>Don Antonio's</hi> Wives friends, and her demand was this: Tell me Head, What shall I
doe to make my self fair? The answer was, Bee honest. I have done, said shee. Straight
came her other companion, and said, I would fain know Head, whether my Husband
love me or no. And the answer was, Thou shalt know by his usage. The Married
woman stood by, saying; The question might have been spared; for good usage is the
best signe of affection. Then came one of <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> friends, and asked, Who am I?
The answere was, Thou knowest. I aske thee not that, said the Gentleman, but
whether thou know me? I doe, it was answered; Thou art <hi>Don Pedro Noris.</hi> No
more, O Head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> let this suffice to make me know thou knowest all. And so stepping
aside, the other friend came and asked, Tell me Head, What desires hath my eldest son?
I have told you (it was answered) That I judge not of thoughts; yet let me tell you,
your sonne desires to bury you: That (quoth the Gentleman) I know well, and dayly
perceive: but I have done. <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> Wife came next, and said, Head, I know
not what to ask thee, I would only fain know of thee, If I shall long enjoy my dear
Husband. And the answer was, Thou shalt, for his health and spare dyet promise him
many yeers, which many shorten by distempers.</p>
                     <p>Now came <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and said, Tell me, thou that answerest, Was it true or a
dream, that (as I recount) befell me in <hi>Montesino's</hi> Cave? Shall <hi>Sancho</hi> my Squires
whipping bee accomplisht? Shall <hi>Dulcinea</hi> bee dis-enchanted? For that of the Cave
(quoth the Answerer) there is much to bee said; it partakes of all: <hi>Sancho's</hi> whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
shall bee prolonged: but <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> dis-enchanting shall come to a reall end.
I desire no more (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for so <hi>Dulcinea</hi> bee disenchanted, I make account
all my good fortunes come upon me at a clap.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> was the last Demander, and his question was this: Head, shall I haply have
another Government? Shall I bee free from this penurious Squires life? Shall I see
my Wife and Children again? To which it was answered him: In thy house thou
shalt Govern; whither, if thou return, thou shalt see thy Wife and Children; and
leaving thy Service, thou shalt leave being a Squire. Very good (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) this
I could have told before, my self, and my Fathers Horse could have said no more. Beast
(quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) what answer wouldest thou have? Is it not enough, that the
answers this Head gives thee, are correspondent to thy questions? 'Tis true (said <hi>Sancho</hi>)
but I would have known more.</p>
                     <p>And now the questions and answers were ended: but not the admiration, in which
all remained, but <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> friends that knew the conceit. Which <hi>Cid Hamete Benehgeli</hi>
would forthwith declare, not to hold the world in suspence, to think that
some Witch or extraordinary mysterie was enclosed in the said Head: And thus saith
hee, That <hi>Don Antonio Moreno,</hi> in imitation of another Head which hee saw in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
framed by a Carver, caused this to bee made in his house, to entertain the simple,
and make them wonder at it; and the Fabrick was in this manner:</p>
                     <p>The Table it self was of wood, painted and varnished over like Jasper, and the foot,
on which it stood, was of the same, with four Eagles claws standing out to uphold it the
better.</p>
                     <p>The Head that shewed like the Medall, or picture of a Romane Emperour and of
brasse colour, was all hollow, and so was the Table too; to which it was so cunningly
joyned, that there was no appearance of it: the foot of the Table was likewise hollow,
that answered to the brest and neck of the head: and all this answered to another
Chamber, that was under the Room where the Head was: and thorow all this hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse
of the foot, the table, brest and neck of the Medall, there went a tinne pipe,
made fit to them, that could not bee perceived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:270"/>
Hee that was to Answere, set his Mouth to the Pipe, in the Chamber underneathe,
Answering to this upper Roome; so that the Voice ascended and descended, as through
a Trunke, so cleerely and distinctly, as it was hardly possible to make discovery of the
juggling.</p>
                     <p>A Nephew of <hi>Don Antonio's,</hi> a Scholler, a good witty and discreet youth was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer;
who having notice from his Uncle of those that were to enter the Roome, it
was easie for him to answer suddenly and punctually, to their first questions, and to the
rest he answered by discreet conjectures.</p>
                     <p>Moreover <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> saies, that this marvelous Engine lasted for some ten or twelve
daies; but when it was divulged up and downe the Citie, that <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had an
Enchanted Head in his House that answered to all questions; fearing lest it should
come to the notice of the waking Centinels of our Faith: Having acquainted those
Inquisitors with the businesse, they commanded him to make away with it, lest it
should scandalize the ignorant vulgar: But yet in <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sanchoes</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Head was still Encha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ted and answering; but indeed not altogether so much to
<hi>Sanchoes</hi> satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>The gallants of the City, to please <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> and for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> better ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalitie,
and on purpose that his madnesse might make the more generall sport, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a runing at the Ring, about a sixe dayes after, which was broken off upon an
occasion that after hapned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had a minde to walke round about the City on foote, fearing that if
hee went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Horsehack, the Boyes would persecute him: So hee and <hi>Sancho,</hi> with
two servants of <hi>Don Antonioes</hi> went a walking. It happened, that as they passed
through one Streete, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> looked up and saw written upon a Doore in
great Letters, <hi>Here are Bookes printed,</hi> which did please him very wonderfully,
for till then hee had never seene any Presse; and hee much desired to know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it.</p>
                     <p>In he went with all his retinue, where he saw in one place drawing of sheets, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Correcting, in this Composing, in that mending: Finaly, all the Machine that is
usuall in great Presses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came to one of the Boxes, and asked what they had in hand there?
the workemen told him; he wondred and passed farther. To another he came, and
asked one that was in it, what he was doing? The workman answered Sir, This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
you see (and he shewed him a good comely proper man and somewhat ancient)
hath translated an Italian Booke into Spanish; and I am composing of it here to bee
Printed.</p>
                     <p>What is the name of it (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>) To which said the Author, Sir, it is
called <hi>Le Bagatele,</hi> to wit, in Spanish, The <hi>Trifle,</hi> and though it beare but a mean name,
yet it contains in it many great and substantiall matters.</p>
                     <p>I understand a little Italian, said <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and dare venter upon a <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
of <hi>Ariostoes:</hi> But tell mee Signior mine (not that I would examine your
skill, but only for Curiositie:) Have you ever found set downe in all your writing
the word <hi>Pinnata?</hi> Yes, often quoth the Author; and how translate you it, said <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How should I translate it said the Author, but in saying <hi>Potage pot?</hi> Body of me said
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and how forward are you in the Italian Idiome? Ile lay a good wager
that where the Italian sayes, <hi>Piaccie,</hi> you translate it <hi>Please;</hi> and where <hi>Pin,</hi> you say
<hi>more;</hi> and <hi>Su</hi> is <hi>above;</hi> and <hi>Giu, beneath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yes indeed doe I said the Author; for these be their proper significations.</p>
                     <p>I dare sweare (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) you are not knowne to the world, which is
alwaies backward in rewarding flourishing wits, and laudable industrie: Oh what a
company of rare abilities are lost in the world! What witts cubbed up? What Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues contemned; but for all that mee thinkes, this translating from one language into
another (except it be out of the Queenes of Tongues, Greeke and Latine) is just like
looking upon the wrong side of Arras hangings; that although the Pictures bee seene,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54746:270"/>
yet they are full of thred-ends that darken them, and they are not seene with the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and smoothnesse, as on the other side; and the translating out of easie languages,
argues neither wit, nor elocution, no more then doth the coppying from out of one
Paper into another: yet I inferr not from this, that translating is not a laudable exercise:
for a man may bee far worse employed, and in things lesse profitable.</p>
                     <p>I except amongst Translators our two famous ones: the one, Doctor <hi>Christoval de
Figneroa</hi> in his <hi>Pastor fido,</hi> and the other, <hi>Don Iohn de Xaurigni,</hi> in his <hi>Amyntas,</hi> where
they haply leave it doubtfull, which is the Translation or Originall. But tell mee, Sir,
Print you this Book upon your owne charge, or sell you your licence to some Booke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binder?
Vpon mine owne, said the Author, and I thinke to get a thousand crownes
by it at least, with this first impression: for there will bee two thousand Copies, and
they will vent at three shillings apiece roundly.</p>
                     <p>You understand the matter well, said <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> it seemes you know not the
passages of Printers, and the correspondencies they have betwixt one and the other:
I promise you, that when you have two thousand Copies lying by you, you'le bee so
troubled, as passeth; and the rather, if the booke bee but a little dull, and not conceited
all thorow.</p>
                     <p>Why, would you have mee (quoth the Author) let a Booke-seller have my Licence,
that would give mee but a halfe-penny a Sheet, and that thinkes hee doth mee a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in it too? I print not my workes to get fame in the world: for I am by them well
known in it, I must have profit; for without that, fame is not worth a rush.</p>
                     <p>God send you good lucke, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> so hee passed to another Box, where
hee saw some correcting a sheet of a Book, Intituled, <hi>The light of the Soule:</hi> and in
seeing it, hee said, Such Bookes as these (though there bee many of them) ought to bee
imprinted: for there bee many sinners, and many lights are needfull, for so many bee
darkned.</p>
                     <p>Hee went on, and saw them correcting another Booke; and enquiring the Title,
they answered him, that it was called, The second part of the Ingenious Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi>
made by such a one, an Inhabitant of <hi>Tordesillas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have notice of this Book, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and in my conscience, I thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now, it had beene burnt and turned to ashes for an idle Pamphlet: but it will not,
like Hogs, want it's Saint <hi>Martin:</hi> [<hi>Against that Saints day is Hogs searing:</hi>] for
your fained Histories are so much the more good and delightfull, by how much they
come neere the truth, or the likenesse of it: and the true ones are so much the better,
by how much the truer; and saying thus, with some shewes of distaste, hee left the
Presse: and that very day <hi>Don Antonio</hi> purposed to carry him to the Gallies, that
were in the Wharfe: at which <hi>Sancho</hi> much rejoyced; for hee had never in his life
seene any.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Antonio</hi> gave notice to the Generall of the Gallies, that in the afternoone hee
would bring his guest, the famous <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> to see them: of whom
all the Citty by this time had notice. And in the next Chapter, what hapned to him,
shall bee declared.</p>

the Imposture, and all concluded in the promise, which hee held for
certaine, of the dis-enchantment of <hi>Dulcinea:</hi> there his blood flowed
within him, and hee rejoyced within himself, beleeving hee should
soon see the accomplishment of it: And <hi>Sancho,</hi> though (as hath
been said) hee abhorred to bee a Governour, yet hee desired to
beare sway again, and to bee obeyed: for such is the desire of Rule though it bee but
in jest.</p>
                     <p>In conclusion, that afternoon <hi>Don Antonio Moreno</hi> their Host, with his two friends,
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> went to the Gallies. The Generall, who had notice of their
comming, as soon as they were come neer the Sea side, made all the Gallies strike their
Tilt-sayles, and the Ho-boyes sounded, and they lanched a Cock-boat to the water,
which was all covered with rich clothes, and Cushions of Crimson-Velvet: and just as
<hi>Don Quixote</hi> entred into it, the Admirall Gally discharged her fore-Castle peece; and
the rest of the Gallies likewise did the same: and as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> mounted at the right
side Ladder, all the fry of the Slaves, as the custome is, when any man of quality enters
the Gally, cryed, <hi>Hu, Hu, Hu,</hi> thrise a-row.</p>
                     <p>The Generall, who was a man of qualitie, a <hi>Valencian</hi> Gentleman, gave him his
hand: and being entred, embraced him, saying, This day will I mark with a white stone,
for one of the best that shall have befaln me in all my life time; having seene Signior
<hi>Don-Quixote de la Manca;</hi> the time and signes that appear in him, shewing that all
the worth of a Knight Errant, is contained and summed up in him. With the like cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous phrase replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> jocund above measure, to see himself so Lord-like
treated withall.</p>
                     <p>They all went a-Stern, which was very well drest up, and they sate upon the Railes.
The Boat-Swain got him to the fore-Castle, and gave warning with his whistle to the
Slaves, to dis-robe themselves; which was done in an instant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> that saw so many naked men, was astonisht; and the more, when hee saw
them hoyst up their Tilt so speedily, that he thought all the Devills in Hell laboured
there. <hi>Sancho</hi> sate upon the Pilots seat, neer the hindermost Rower, on the right hand;
who being instructed what hee should doe, laid hold on <hi>Sancho;</hi> and so lifting him up
passed him to another; and the second to a third: so the whole rabble of the Slaves,
beginning at the right side, passed and made him vault from one seat to another so
violently, that poor <hi>Sancho</hi> lost his sight, and undoubtedly believed, that the Fiends of
Hell carried him; and they gave him not over, till they had pasted him over all the left
fide too, and then set him again on the Stern: so the poor soul was sore bruised and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauled,
and scarce imagined what had hapned to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that saw this slight of <hi>Sancho's</hi> without wings, asked the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
if those were Ceremonies, that were used to such as came newly into the Gallie?
for if they were, that hee who intended not to professe in them, liked no such pastime:
and hee vowed to God, that if any came to lay hold on him, to make him tumble, hee
would kick out his soule: and in so saying, hee stood up, and grasped his sword.</p>
                     <p>At this instant they let down the Tilt again, and with a terrible noyse, let fall the
Main-yard, so that <hi>Sancho</hi> thought Heaven was off the hinges, and fell upon his head,
which hee crouched together, and clapped it for fear betwixt his leggs. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Quixote</hi>
was not altogether as hee should bee; for he began to quake and shrink up his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54746:271"/>
and grew pale. The Slaves hoysted the Main-yard with the same fury and noyse
that they had formerly strook it with, and all with such silence, as if they had had
neither voyce nor breath. The Boat-Swain made signes to them to weigh Anchor:
and leaping toward the fore-Castle, in the midest of them, with his whip or Bulls-pizzle,
hee began to fly-flap their shoulders.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> saw such a companie of red feet move at once (for such he ghessed the
Oars to bee) hee said to himself, I marry, here bee things truly Enchanted, and not
those my Master speaks of. What have these unhappy souls committed, that they are
thus lashed? And how dares this fellow that goes whistling up and down alone, whip
so many? Well, I say this is Hell, or Purgatorie at least.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that saw with what attention <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld all that passed, said, Ah
friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> how speedily, and with how little cost might you, if you would, take off
your doublet, and clap your self amongst these fellows, and make an end of dis-enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dulcinea?</hi> for having so many companions in misery, you would not bee so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of pain: and besides, it might bee, that the sage <hi>Merlin</hi> might take every one of
these lashes, being well laid on, for ten.</p>
                     <p>The Generall would have asked what lashes those were, and what dis-enchatment of
<hi>Dulcinea's?</hi> when a Marriner cryed out, <hi>Momiri</hi> makes signes that there is a Vessell
with Oars towards the west side of the Coast. (Which said) The Generall leapt upon
the fore-Castle, and cryed out, Goe to, my hearts, let her not scape; this Boat that our
watch-towre discovers, is some Frigot of <hi>Argiers</hi> Pirates.</p>
                     <p>And now the three other Gallies came to their Admirall to know what they should
doe. The Generall commanded that two of them should lanch to the Sea; and hee
with the other would goe betwixt Land and Land, that so the Vessell might not escape
them.</p>
                     <p>The Slaves rowed hard, and so furiously drave on the Gallies, as if they had flown;
and those that lanched first into the Sea, about two miles off discovered a Vessell, which
in sight they marked to have about a fourteen or fifteen Oares, as it fell out to bee
true: which Vessell, when shee discovered the Gallies, shee put her self in chase;
hoping by her swiftnesse to scape: but it prevailed nothing; for the Admirall Gally
was one of the swiftest Vessells that sayled in the Sea, and so got of the other so much,
that they in the Frigot plainly saw, that they could not escape: and so the Master of
her would have had them forsaken their Oares and yeelded, for fear of offending our
Generall: but fate that would have it otherwise, so disposed the matter, that as the
Admirall came on so nigh, that they in the Barke might heare a cry from the Gally
that they should yeeld: two <hi>Toraquis,</hi> that is, two drunken Turks that were in the
Frigot with twelve others, discharged two Calievers, with which they killed two Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that stood abaft our Gally. Which when our Generall saw, hee vowed not to
leave a man alive in the Vessell: and comming in great fury to grapple with her, shee
escaped under the Gallies Oares: the Gally passed forward a pretty way: they in the
Vessell saw themselves gone, and began to set sail, and to fly afresh as they saw the Gally
comming on them: but their industry did them not so much good, as their presumption
hurt: for the Admirall overtaking them within one half mile, clapped his Oares in the
Vessell, and so took her and every man alive in her.</p>
                     <p>By this the two other Gallies came; and all four returned to the Wharf with their
Prize, where a world of People expected them, desirous to see what they brought: the
Generall cast Anchor neer land, and perceived that the Vice-Roy of the City was on
the shore; hee commanded that a Cock-boat should bee lanched to bring him; and
that they should strike the Main yard to hang presently the Master of the Frigot, and
the rest of the Turks that they had taken in her, which were about six and thirty persons,
all goodly men, and most of them Turkish shot.</p>
                     <p>The Generall asked who was Master of the Barke? and answer was made him by
one of the Captives in Spanish (who appeared after to be a Runagate Spainiard;) This
Youth you see here is our Master; and he shewed him one of the goodliest comly Youths
that could bee deciphered by humane imagination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:272"/>
He was not to see to, above twenty yeers of age: The Generall asked; Tell mee
ill-advised Dogg, what moved thee to kill my Souldiers, since thou sawst it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for to escape? is this the respect due to Admiralls? Knowest not thou that rashnesse
is not valour? doubtfull hopes may make men bold, but not desperate.</p>
                     <p>The Master would have replyed, but the Generall could not as yet give him the
hearing, by reason of his going to welcome the Vice-roy aboord, who entred now the
Gally with some servants of his, and others of the City.</p>
                     <p>You have had a pretty chase on't, my Lord Generall (said the Vice-roy.) So pretty
(said the Generall) that your excellency shall see it hanged up at the Main-yard. How so
(quoth the Vice-roy?) Why, they have killed me (said he) against all Law of Arms, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Custome of Warrs, two of the best Souldiers I had in my Gallies, &amp; I have sworn
to hang them all, especially this Youth, the Master of the Frigot; and hee shewed him
one that had his hands bound, and the halter about his neck, expecting his death. The
Vice-roy beheld him, and seeing him so comely, handsome, and humble withall, his
beauty giving him in that instant, as it were, a Letter of recommendation: the Vice-roy
had a minde to save him; and therefore asked; Tell me Master, Art thou a Turk born,
or a Moor, or a Runagate?</p>
                     <p>To which the Youth answered him in his own language: Neither of all. Why,
what art thou (quoth the Vice-roy?) A Christian woman (said the young man.)
A Woman and a Christian in this habit, in these employments? a thing rather to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at then believed. My Lords, I beseech you (quoth the Youth) let my execution
bee a little deferred, whilest I recount my life. What heart so hard that would not bee
softned with that reason, at least to heare the sad and grieved Youth to tell his story?
The Generall bade him proceed, but that there was no hope for him of pardon for his
notorious offence. So the Youth began in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Of that Linage, more unhappie then wise, on which a Sea of misfortunes in these
latter times have rained, am I; born of Moriscan Parents; and in the current of their
misery, was carried by two of my Uncles into <hi>Barbary;</hi> it nothing availing me to say
I was a Christian, as I am indeed, and not seeming so, as many of us, but truly Catholike:
but this truth prevailed nothing with the Officers that had charge given them to look to
our banishment, neither would my Uncles believe I was a Christian, but that it was a
trick of mine to stay in my native Country; and so rather forcibly then by my consent
they carried me with them. My Mother was a Christian, and my Father discreet, and
so likewise I sucked the Catholike Faith in my Milk: I was well brought up, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my language or fashion, made shew to bee a Morisca. With these Virtues my
beauty (if so bee I have any) increased also; and though my restraint and retirement
was great, yet it was not such, but that a young Gentleman, called <hi>Don Gasper Gregorio</hi>
had gotten a sight of me: This Gentleman was Sonne and Heir to a Knight that lived
neer to our Town: hee saw me, and we had some speech; and seeing himself lost to me,
but I not won by him, 'twere large to sell, especially fearing that as I am speaking, this
halter must throttle me: yet I say, that <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> would needs accompanie me in
my banishment: and so mingling himself with Moriscos that came out of other places
(for hee understood the language well) in our Voyage hee got acquainted with my two
Uncles that went with me; for my Father wisely when hee heard the Edict of
our banishment, went out of our Town, and went to seek some place in a Forraign
Country, where wee might be entertained; and hee left many Pearls, precious Stones,
and some money in double Pistolets hidden in a secret place (which I only know of)
but hee commanded me by no means to meddle with it, if wee were banish'd before his
return. I did so, and with my Unkles and others of our Kindred, passed into <hi>Babary,</hi>
and our resting place was <hi>Argiers,</hi> I might have said Hell. The King there had notice
of my beauty, and likewise that I was rich, which partly fell out to bee my happinesse.
Hee sent for me, and asked me of what part of <hi>Spain</hi> I was, and what money and jewels
I brought? I told him the place; but that my Jewels and Monies were buried: but
that they might easily bee had, if I might but goe thither for them. All this I said, hoping
his own covetousnesse would more blinde him then my beauty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:54746:272"/>Whilest wee were in this discourse, they told him there came one of the goodliest
faire Youths with mee that could bee imagined. I thought presently it was <hi>Don Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorio</hi>
they meant, whose comelinesse is not to bee paralell'd. It troubled me to think in
what danger hee would bee; for those Barbarous Turkes do more esteeme a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Boy, then a Woman, bee shee never so faire. The King commanded straight, that
he should be brought before him, that he might see him, and asked me if it were true they
said of the Youth. I told him Yes (and it seemed Heaven put it into my head) but
that hee was no man, but a woman as I was, and I desired him hee would give me leave
to cloath her in her naturall habit, that her beauty might appear to the full, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
too, shee would bee too shamefast befoe him. Hee bad mee doe so, and that
on the morrow hee would give order for my returne to <hi>Spaine</hi> to seeke the hidden
Treasure. I spoke with <hi>Don Gaspar,</hi> and told him what danger hee had been in by being
a man: so I clad him like a Moorish woman, and that afternoon brought him to the
Kings presence, who seeing him, admired at her beauty, and thought to reserve him, and
to send him for a Present to the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> and so to avoid the danger in his <hi>Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi>
of women if hee put her there; hee commanded her to bee kept in a house of certain
Moorish Gentlewomen, whither hee was carryed. How this troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> as both (for I
cannot deny that I love him) let them consider that have been absent from their Loves.
The King gave order then, that I should come for <hi>Spaine</hi> in this Frigot, and that these
two Turks that killed your Souldiers, should accompany mee, and this Renegate
Spaniard, pointing to him that had first spoken, who I know is in heart a Christian, and
hath a greater desire to remaine here, then to returne into <hi>Barbary,</hi> the rest are Moors
and Turkes that onely serve for Rowers. The two covetous and insolent Turkes,
not respecting the order wee had, that they should set mee and this Runnagate Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
on the first shore, in the habits of Christians (of which we were provided) would
needs first scowre the coast, and take some prize, if they could, fearing that if they first
should set us on land, by some mischance wee might discover, the Frigot to bee upon the
coast: so that they might be taken by the Gallies, and overnight we described this wharf,
and not knowing of these foure Gallies, wee were discovered, and this hath befalne
us that you have seene. In fine, <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> remaines in his womans habit amonst
Women in manyfest danger of his destruction, and I am here Prisoner, expecting, or
to say truer; fearing the losing of my life, which notwithstanding wearies mee. This,
Sirs, is the conclusion of my lamentable History, as true as unfortunate: my request is,
that I may die a Christian, since (as I have said) I am not guilty of that crime into
which the rest of my Nation have fallen: and with this she broke off; her eyes pregnant
with teares, which were accompanied with many from the standers by also.</p>
                     <p>The Viceroy, all tender and compassionate, came to her and undid the Cord that
bound the Moores faire hands. In the meane time, whilest this Christian Morisca re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
her Story, an ancient Pilgrim that entred the Gally had his eyes fastned upon her;
and shee had no sooner ended her discourse, when hee cast himselfe at her feet, and
embracing them with interrupted words, Sighs, and Sobs, said, Oh my unfortunate
Daughter <hi>Ana Felix,</hi> I am <hi>Ricote</hi> thy Father, that have returned to seeke thee, as
not being able to live without thee; for thou art my very soule. At these words
<hi>Sancho</hi> opend his eyes, and lifted up his head (which hee held downe, thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ill-favoured tossing in the Gally) and beholding the Pilgrim, knew him to bee
the same <hi>Ricote</hi> that hee met the same day hee left his Government, and it appear'd
shee was his Daughter, when being unbound shee embraced her Father, mingling
her teares with his. Then said hee to the Generall and Viceroy, This, my Lords, is my
Daughter, more unhappy in her successe, then in her name, as famous for beauty, as
I for Wealth. I left my Country, to finde a resting-place in some strange Country, and
having found one in <hi>Germany,</hi> returned in this Pilgrimes weed in company of other
Germanes to seek my Daughter, and to dig out my hidden Treasure, but found not
her, and the Treasure I bring with mee, and now by strange chance have lighted on my
greatest Treasure, that is, my beloved Daughter: if so be our small offence, and her tears
and mine together, with the integrity of your Justice, may open the gates of mercy,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:273"/>
shew it us that never had so much as a thought once to offend you, nor conspired with
those of our own linage, who were justly banished. Then said <hi>Sancho,</hi> I know <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote</hi>
well, and know all is true hee saith, concerning that <hi>Ana Felix</hi> is his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but for other flim-flams, whether hee had a good or bad intention, I intermeddle
not.</p>
                     <p>The by-standers wondring all at this accident, the Generall said, Well, your tears will
not let me accomplish my vow: live, faire <hi>Ana Felix,</hi> as long as Heaven will give thee
leave, and let those rash Slaves dye that committed the fault: So hee commanded that
the two Turks that had killed his two Souldiers, should presently bee hanged upon the
Main-yard: but the Vice-roy desired him earnestly not to hang them, since they had
shewed more madness then valour. The Generall condescended, for revenge is not good
in cold blood; and straight they contrived how to get <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> free. <hi>Ricote</hi> offered
two thousand Ducats hee had in Pearls and Jewels towards it: Many means were
thought on, but none so good as that of the <hi>Renegado</hi> Spanyard that was mentioned,
who offered to return to <hi>Argiers</hi> in some small Bark, only with some six Christian
Oares; for hee knew where, how, and when to dis-embarke himself, and the house also
where <hi>Don Gasper</hi> was. The Generall and Vice-roy were in some doubt of him, or to
trust him with the Christians that should row with him. But <hi>Ana Felix</hi> undertook
for him, and <hi>Ricote</hi> offered to ransome the Christians if they were taken. And being
agreed, the Vice-roy went a-shore, and <hi>Don Antonio Moreno</hi> carried the Morisca and
her Father with him: the Vice-roy enjoyning him to use them as well as possibly he
might, and offered him the command of any thing in his house toward it. Such was the
charity and benevolence that the beauty of <hi>Ana Felix</hi> had infused into his brest.</p>

hitherto befell him.</head>
                     <p>THe History saies that <hi>Don Antonio Moreno's</hi> Wife took great delight to
see <hi>Ana Felix</hi> in her house: shee welcommed her most kindely, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured
as well on her goodnesse, as beauty and discretion; for in
all the Morisca was exquisite, and all the City came (as if by a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bell) to see her. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> told <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> that they took
a wrong course for the freeing of <hi>Don Gregorio,</hi> which was more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then convenient; and that it had been better, that hee were
set on shore in <hi>Barbary</hi> with his Horse and Armes; for that hee would deliver
him in spight of the whole Moorisme there, as <hi>Don Gayseros</hi> had done his Spouse
<hi>Melisendra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Look you Sir, said <hi>Sancho</hi> (when hee heard this) <hi>Don Gayferos</hi> brought his Spouse
through firm land, and so carried her into <hi>France:</hi> but here, though wee should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<hi>Don Gregorio,</hi> wee have no means to bring him into <hi>Spain,</hi> the Sea being betwixt us
and home.</p>
                     <p>There is a remedy for every thing but death (said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>) for 'tis but
having a Bark ready at the Sea side, and in spight of all the world wee may embarke our
selves.</p>
                     <p>You doe prettily facilitate the matter (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) but 'tis one thing to say, and
another to doe: and I like the Runnagate; for me thinks hee is a good honest plain
fellow. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> said, That if the Runnagate performed not the husinesse, that
then the Grand <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> should passe over into <hi>Barbary.</hi> Some two daies after
the Runnagate embark'd in a little Boat with six Oares on a side, manned with lusty
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54746:273"/>
tall fellows, and two dayes after that, the Gallies were Eastward bound; the Generall
having requested the Vice-roy, that hee would bee pleased to let him know the successe
of <hi>Don Gregorio's</hi> liberty, and likewise <hi>Ana Felix.</hi> The Vice-roy promised to fulfill his
request.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> going out one morning to take the ayre upon the Wharf, armed
at all points; for as hee often used to say, his Armes were his Ornaments, and to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish his delight; and so hee was never without them; hee saw a Knight come toward
him, armed from top to toe, carrying upon his shield a bright shining Moon painted,
who comming within distance of hearing, directing his voyce to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> aloud,
said: Famous Knight, and never sufficiently extolled <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi>
I am the Knight of the white Moon, whose renowned Deeds perhaps thou hast heard
of; I am come to combat with thee, and by force of Armes to make thee know and
confesse, that my Mistris, bee shee whom shee will, is without comparison, fairer then
thy <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso;</hi> which truth, if thou plainly confesse, thou shalt save thy life,
and me a labour in taking it: and if thou fight, and that I vanquish thee, all the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I will have, is, that thou forsake thy Armes, and leave seeking Adventures,
and retire thy self to thy home for the space of one whole yeer, where thou shale
live peaceably and quietly, without laying hand to thy Sword, which befits thy estate,
and also thy souls health: And if thou vanquish me, my head shall bee at thy
mercy; and the spoyles of my Horse and Armour shall bee thine, and also the same of
my exploits shall passe from me to thee: Consider what is best to be done, and answer
me quickly; for I have only this dayes respit to dispatch this businesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was ashonisht and in suspence, as well at the <hi>Knight of the White Moon</hi>
his arrogance, as the cause of it, for which hee challenged him: and so with a quiet and
staid demeanour answered him:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Knight of the white Moon,</hi> whose exploits hitherto I have not heard of, I dare swear
thou never sawst the famous <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for if thou hadest, I know thou wouldest not
have entred into this demand: for her sight would have confirmed, that their neither
hath been, nor can be a beauty to be compared with hers: &amp; therefore not to say you lye,
but that you erre in your proposition, I accept of your challenge with the aforesaid
conditions; and strait because your limited day shall not passe, and I only except against
one of your conditions, which is, That the fame of your exploits passe to me; for I
know not what kind of ones yours be, and I am content with mine own such as they be:
beginn you then your Career when you will, and I will doe the like, and God and
<hi>S. George.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Vice-roy had notice of this, and thought it had been some new Adventure plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Don Antonio Moreno,</hi> or some other Gentleman: and so out of the Citie hee
went with <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> and many other Gentlemen that accompanied him to the
Wharf, just as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was turning <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Reins to take up as much ground
as was sit for him. When the Vice-roy saw in both of them signes to encounter, hee
put himself betwixt them, and asked, what was the cause of their single Combat? The
<hi>Knight of the white Moon</hi> answered him, that it was about a precedency in beauty, and
briefly repeated what hee had formerly done to <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> together with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
accepted by both Parties.</p>
                     <p>The Vice-roy came to <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> and asked him in his care, if hee knew that
<hi>Knight of the white Moon,</hi> or if it were some trick they meant to put upon <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Antonio</hi> made answer, that hee neither knew the Knight, or whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
were in jest or earnest.</p>
                     <p>This answer made the Vice-roy doubt whether hee should let them proceed to the
Combat; but being perswaded that it could not bee but a jest, he removed, saying: Sir
Knights, if there be no remedy but to confesse or dye, and that Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
be obstinate, and you <hi>Knight of the white Moon</hi> more so then he, God have mercy on
you, and to 't.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of the white Moon</hi> most courteously thanked the Vice-roy for the licence
<pb facs="tcp:54746:274"/>
hee gave them, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> too did the like; who heartily recommending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to Heaven, and his Mistris <hi>Dulcinea</hi> (as hee used upon all such occasions) hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about to begin his Careere, as his enemy had done, and without Trumpets sound,
or of any other warlike instrument that might give them signall for the onset: they
both of them set Spurres to thir Horses, and the <hi>Knight of the White-Moones</hi> being
the swifter, met <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ere hee had ranne a quarter of his Careere so forcibly
(without touching him with his Launce, for it seemed hee carried it aloft on purpose)
that hee tumbled Horse and Man both to the ground, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fall: so hee got straight on the top of him; and clapping his Launces point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Visor, said, You are vanquished, Knight, and a dead man, if you confesse not, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the conditions of our combate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> all bruised and amazed, without heaving up his Visor, as if hee had
spoken out of a Toombe, with a faint and weake voyce, said, <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> is the
fairest Woman in the world, and I the unfortunatest Knight on earth; and it is
not fit that my weaknesse defraud this truth: thrust your Launce into mee, Knight,
and kill mee, since you have bereaved mee of my honour. Not so truly, quoth hee of
the White-Moone, let the same of my Lady <hi>Dulcinea's</hi> beauty live in her entirenesse:
I am onely contented that the Grand <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> retire home for a yeer, or till such
time as I please, as wee agreed, before wee began the battell.</p>
                     <p>All this, the Vice-Roy with <hi>Don Antonio</hi> and many others standing by heard;
and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, that so nothing were required of him in prejudice
of his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> hee would accomplish all the rest, like a true and punctuall
Knight.</p>
                     <p>This Confession ended, the Knight of the white-Moone turned his Horse, and
making a low obeysance on Horse-back to the Vice-Roy, hee rode a false gallop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Citty. The Vice-Roy willed <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to follow him, and to know by all
meanes who hee was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was lifted up, and they discovered his face, and found him discolour'd
and in a cold sweat. <hi>Rozinante</hi> out of pure hard handling, could not as yet stirr.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> all sad and sorrowfull knew not what to doe or say, and all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to him seemed but a dreame: and all that Machine, a matter of Enchantment:
hee saw his Master was vanquished, and bound not to take Armes for a yeer. Now he
thought the light of his glory was Eclipsed, the hopes of his late promises were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and parted as smoke with winde: hee feared lest <hi>Rozinante's</hi> bones were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and his Masters out of joynt: Finally, in a Chaire, which the Vice-Roy commanded
to bee brought, hee was carryed to the Citty, whither the Vice-Roy too returned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to know who the Knight of the White-Moone was, that had left <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
in so bad a taking.</p>

a lower Roome, and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> with him, who stood upon
Thornes, till hee knew who hee was.</p>
                     <p>Hee of the White-Moone, seeing then that the Gentleman would

and since there is no reason to deny you this, I will tell you, whilest my man is unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and am one of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Town; whose wilde madnesse hath moved
as many of us as know him to compassion; and mee amongst the rest most: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
that the best means to procure his health, is to keep him quiet: And so to have him
in his own house, I thought upon this device: and so about a three moneths since I
met him upon the way, calling my self by the name of <hi>The Knight of the Looking-glasses,</hi>
with a purpose to fight with him, and vanquish him, without doing him any hurt, and
making this the condition of our Combat, That the vanquished should bee left to the
discretion of the vanquisher: and that which I would enjoyne him (for I held him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
conquered) was, That hee should ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rn home, and not abroad again in a whole
yeer; in which time hee might haply have been cured: but fortune would have it
otherwise; for he vanquished me, and unhorsed me, and so my project took no effect:
hee went on his way, and I returned conquered, ashamed, and bruised with my fall,
that was very dangerous: but for all that, I had still a desire to finde him again, and to
conquer him, as now you have seen.</p>
                     <p>And hee being so punctuall in observing the Orders of Knight Errantry, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
keep his promise made to me.</p>
                     <p>This Sir is all I can tell you, and I beseech you conceale me from <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that
my desires may take effect; and that the man who hath otherwise a good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
may recover it if his madnesse leave him.</p>
                     <p>Oh Sir (said <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) God forgive you the wrong you doe the whole world,
in seeking to recover the pleasantest mad-man in the world.</p>
                     <p>Perceive you not that this recovery cannot be so much worth, as the delight that his
fopperies cause? but I imagine, Sir Bachelor, that all your Art will not make a man so
irrecoverably mad, wise again: and if it were not uncharitable, I would say, Never
may he recover: for in his health wee lose not only his own conceits, but <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>
his Squires too, each of which would turn melancholy it self into mirth: for all that
I will hold my peace, I will say nothing, and see whether I ghesse right, that Signior
<hi>Carrasco's</hi> pains will bee to no purpose. Who answered, that as yet the businesse was
brought to a good passe, and hee hoped for a happy successe: and so offering <hi>Don Antonio</hi>
his service, hee took leave of him: And causing his Armour to hee packed
upon a great hee Mule, at the instant hee got himself upon the Horse, with which hee
entred the Lists; and the same day hee went out of the Citie homeward, where by the
way nothing hapned to him worth the relating in this true Historie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Antonio</hi> told the Vice-roy all that <hi>Carrasco</hi> said; at which hee received not
much content, for in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> retirement, was theirs also that ever had notice of
his mad pranks.</p>
                     <p>Six dayes was <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in his bed, all muddy, sad &amp; sorrowfull, and wayward, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scanting
in his thoughts upon his ill fortune to bee vanquished. <hi>Sancho</hi> comforted him,
and amongst other reasons, told him, Signior mine, cheer up, bee lively, if you can,
give Heaven thanks, that though you came with a tumbling cast to the ground, yet you
have never a rib broken; and since you know that sweet meat must have sowre sawce,
&amp; that there is not alwaies good cheer where there is a smoaking Chimney, cry, A fig for

my desire of being an Earle, which will never bee effected, if you leave to bee a

                     <p>Peace <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) my retirement shall bee but for a yeer, and then

                     <p>God grant it (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) and let sinne bee deaf; for I have alwaies heard that a

good hope is better then a bad possession. In this discourse they were, when as <hi>Don-Antonio</hi>
entred, with shews of great content, saying, My reward Signior <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
for the news I bring; for <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> and the Runnagate Spainiard with him, are
upon the Wharf: the Wharf, quoth I? in the Vice-roys house, and will bee here
presently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was somewhat revived, and said, Truly I was about to have said, I
would it had been otherwise, that I might have gone into <hi>Barbary,</hi> and with the
strength and vigor of this Arme, not only have given liberty to <hi>Don Gregorio,</hi> but to
all the Christian Captives in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what say I, wretch that I am? Am not I vanquished? Am not I overthrown?
Am not I hee that must not touch Armes this twelve moneths? What then doe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising?
Why doe I praise my self, since it were fitter for me to use a Distaff then a
Sword? No more of that Sir (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) a man is a man, though hee have but a
hose on his head. To day for thee, and to morrow for me: and for these thumps and
encounters, there is no heed to bee taken; for hee that falls to day may rise to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
except it bee that hee mean to lye a-bed; I mean, to dismay and not take heart
to fresh skirmishes: and therefore raise you your self now to welcome <hi>Don Gregorio;</hi> for
me thinks the people of the house are in an uproar, and by this hee is come: and hee
said true; for <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> having given the Vice-roy account of his going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
desirous to see <hi>Ana Felix,</hi> he came with the Runnagate to <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> house:
and though <hi>Don Gregorio,</hi> when they brought him out of <hi>Argiers</hi> were in a womans
habit, yet by the way in the Boat he changed it with a Captive that came with him: but
whatsoever habit hee had been in, hee would have seemed a personage worthy to bee
coveted, sought after, and served; for hee was extraordinary comely, and about some
seventeen or eighteen yeers of age. <hi>Ricote</hi> and his Daughter went out to welcome him,
the Father with tears, and the Daughter with honesty.</p>
                     <p>They did not embrace each other; for where there is Love, there is never much
loosenesse.</p>
                     <p>The two joynt Beauties of <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> and <hi>Ana Felix</hi> astonished all the by-standers.</p>
                     <p>Silence there spoke for the two Lovers, and their eyes were tongues that discovered
their joyfull, but honest thoughts: The Runagate told them the means and slight hee
had used to get <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> away. <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> told his dangers and straits hee was
put to amongst the women with whom hee remained, not in tedions manner, but with
much brevity; where hee shewed that his discretion was above his yeers.</p>
                     <p>Finally, <hi>Ricote</hi> paid and royally satisfied as well the Runagate, as those that had
rowed with him. The Runagate was reduc't and re-encorporated with the Church,
and of a rotten member became clean and sound by penance and repentance.</p>
                     <p>Some two dayes after the Vice-roy treated with <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> about means, that
<hi>Ricote</hi> and his Daughter might remain in <hi>Spain,</hi> thinking it to bee no inconvenience,
that so Christianly a Father and a Daughter should remain, and, to see too, so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Antonio</hi> offered to negotiate it amongst other businesse, for which hee was to
goe to the Court of necessitie, letting them know, that there by favour and bribes, many
difficult matters are ended.</p>
                     <p>There is no trust in favours or bribes (said <hi>Ricote</hi> then present) for with the Grand
<hi>Don Bernardine de Volasco,</hi> Counte <hi>Salazar,</hi> to whom his Majestie hath given in charge
our expulsion, neither entreaties, promises, bribes or compassion can prevail; for
though true it bee, that he mixeth his Justice with Mercy, yet because hee sees the whole
body of our Nation is putrid and contaminated, hee useth rather cauterizing that burns
it, then oyntment that softens it: and so with prudence, skill, diligence, and terror,
hee hath born upon his strong shoulders, and brought to due execution, the waight of
this great Machine; our industries, tricks, slights, and frauds, not being able to blinde
his watchfull eyes of <hi>Argus,</hi> which wake continually, to the end that none of ours may
remain; that like a hidden root, may in time sprout up, and scatter venemous fruit
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54746:275"/>
throughout all <hi>Spain,</hi> now cleansed and free from the fear, into which their multitude
put her, a heroick resolution of the Grand <hi>Philip</hi> the third, and unheard of wisedome,
to have committed it to <hi>Don Bernardino</hi> and <hi>Velasco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well, when I come thither (said <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) I will use the best means I can, and
let Heaven dispose what shall bee fittest. <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> shall goe with me, to comfort
the affliction of his Parents for his absence: <hi>Ana Felix</hi> shall stay with my Wife here, or
in a Monastery: and I know the Vice-roy will bee glad to have honest <hi>Ricote</hi> stay
with him, till hee sees how I can negotiate.</p>
                     <p>The Vice-roy yeelded to all that was proposed: but <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> knowing what
passed, said, that by no means hee could or would leave <hi>Ana Felix:</hi> but intending to
see his friends, and to contrive how hee might return for her, at length hee agreed. <hi>Ana Felix</hi>
remained with <hi>Don Antonio's</hi> Wife, and <hi>Ricote</hi> in the Vice-roy his house.</p>
                     <p>The time came that <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was to depart, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> which
was some two dayes after; for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> fall would not suffer him to travell
sooner. When <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> parted from <hi>Ana Felix,</hi> all was tears, swounding, sighs,
and sobs. <hi>Ricote</hi> offered <hi>Don Gregorio</hi> a thousand Crowns: but hee refused them, and
borrowed only five of <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> to pay him at the Court again: With this they
both departed, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> next (as hath been said) <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
and <hi>Sancho</hi> on foot, because Dapple was laden with the Armour.</p>

wisely, I know not who hath taught thee. All I can tell thee, is, that in the world
there is no such thing as Fortune; neither doe things that happen in it, good or evill,
fall out by chance, but by the particular providence of Heaven: hence 'tis said, That
every man is the Artificer of his own Fortune, which I have been of mine, but not with
the discretion that might have been fitting; and so my rashnesse hath been requited:
for I might have thought that it was not possible for <hi>Rozinante's</hi> weaknesse, to have
resisted the powerfull greatnesse of the <hi>Knight of the white-Moon's</hi> Horse. In fine, I was
hardy, I did what I could: down I came; and though I lost my honour, yet I lost not,
nor can lose my virtue, to accomplish my promise. When I was a Knight Errant, bold
and valiant, with my works and hands I ennobled my deeds: and now that I am a foot
Squire, I will credit my works with the accomplishment of my promise: jog on then
<hi>Sancho,</hi> and let us get home, there to passe the yeer of our Probationership: in which
retirednesse we will recover new Virtue, to return to the never forgotten exercise of
Armes.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:276"/>Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'Tis no great pleasure to travell great journeys on foot: let us
leave your Armour hanged up upon some tree, instead of a hanged man: and then I
may get upon Dapple, and rid as fast as you will: for to thinke that I will walke great

                     <p>All this (mee thinkes, said <hi>Sancho</hi>) is precious: and if it were not that wee should

the fault of the Asse must not be layd upon the Pack-saddle: &amp; since in this last businesse
you your selfe were in fault, punish your selfe, and let not your fury burst upon the
hacked and bloody Armour, or the mildnesse of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> or the tendernesse of my feet,
making me walke more then is fitting.</p>
                     <p>All that day and foure more they passed in these reasons and discourses: and the
fift after, as they entred a Towne, they saw a great many of People at an Inn dore, that
by reason of the heat were there shading themselves.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> approached, a Husbandman cried aloud, Some of these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
that know not the parties, shall decide the businesse of our wager. That will
I (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) with all uprightnesse, if I may understand it. Well, good Sir,
said the Husbandman, this is the matter; Here's one dwells in this towne so fatt, that
hee weighs eleven Arrobaes, [Arroba, <hi>measure of twenty five pound waight,</hi>] and hee
challenged another to run with him that weighes but five: the wager was to run one
hundred paces with equall weight, and the Challenger being asked how thy should
make equall weight, said, That the other that weighed but five Arrobas, should carry
six of Iron, and so they should both weigh equally.</p>
                     <p>No, no, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> before <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could answer, It concernes mee (that
not long since left being a Governour and a Judge as all the world knowes) to decide
doubts, and to sentence this businesse. Answer on Gods name, friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (said
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for I am not in the humor to play at Boyes-play, since I am so troubled
and tormented in minde.</p>
                     <p>With this licence, <hi>Sancho</hi> said to the Husbandmen that were gaping round about
him, expecting his sentence, Brothers, the fat mans demand is unreasonable, and hath
no appearance of equity; for if hee that is challenged may choose his weapons, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought not to chuse such as may make his contrary unweldy and unable to bee
Victor: and therefore my opinion is, that the fat Challenger doe pick, and cleanse,
and With-draw, and Pollish, and Nibble, and pull away six Arrobaes of his flesh,
some-where or other from his body (as hee thinkes best) and so having but five re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
hee will bee made equall with his opposite, and so they may runne upon equall
termes.</p>
                     <p>I vow by mee, said the Husbandman that heard <hi>Sancho's</hi> sentence, this Gentleman
hath spoken blessedly, and sentenced like a Canon: but I warrant, the fat man will not
lose an ounce of his flesh, much lesse six Arrobaes.</p>
                     <p>The best is, said another, not to runne, that the leane man straine not himselfe
with too much weight, nor the fat man dis-flesh himselfe, and let halfe the wager bee
spent in Wine, and let us carry these Gentlemen to the Taverne that hath the best, and
give mee the cloke when it raines; [<hi>A good Wish, as if hee would have said, Let the
burden light upon him.</hi>]</p>

                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:54746:276"/>
I thanke you Sir, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but I cannot stay a jot: for my sad thoughts
make mee seeme unmannerly, and travell more then ordinarily. And so spurring <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante,</hi>
hee passed forward, leaving them to admire and note, as well his strange shape
as his mans discretion; for such they judged <hi>Sancho.</hi> And another of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
said; If the man bee so wise, what thinke yee of the Master? I hold a wager, that if
they went to study at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> they would bee made Judges of the Court in a trice,
for all is foppery to your studying: study hard, and with a little favour and good
lucke, when a man least thinkes of it, hee shall have a Rod of Justice in his hand, or a
Miter upon his head.</p>
                     <p>That night the Master and Man passed in the open field: and the next day being
upon their way, they saw a foot-man comming towards them with a paire of Wallets
about his necke, and a Javelin or Dart in his hand, just like a foot-man, who comming
neere <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> mended his pace, and beginning to runn, came and tooke him
by the right thigh; for hee could reach no higher, and said with a great deale of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
Oh my Signior <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> and how glad my Lord Duke will
bee, when hee knowes you will returne to his Castle? for hee is there still with my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Duchesse.</p>
                     <p>I know you not, friend, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who you are, except you tell me.</p>
                     <p>I, Signior <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> said the foot-man, am <hi>Tosilos</hi> the Dukes Lackey, that would
not fight with your Worship about the marriage of <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> daughter.</p>
                     <p>God defend mee, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and is it possible? and are you hee, into whom
the Enchanters my enemies transformed my contrary, to defraud mee of the honour
of that combat?</p>
                     <p>Peace, Sir, quoth the Letter foot-post, there was no Enchantment, nor changing
of my face, I was as much <hi>Tosilos</hi> the Lackey, when I went into the Lists, as when I
came out: I thought to have married without fighting, because I liked the wench well;
but it fell out otherwise. My Lord Duke caused mee to bee well banged, because I did
not according as I was instructed before the battell was to begin: and the conclusion
is, the wench is turned Nun, and <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> is gone backe againe into Castlle, and
I am going now to <hi>Barselona</hi> to carry a Packet of Letters to the Vice-Roy which my
Lord sends, him: and if it please you to drinke a sup (though it bee hot, yet pure) I
have a little Gourd here full of the best Wine, with some slices of excellent Cheese, that
shall serve for a provoker and Alarum to thirst if it bee asleepe.</p>
                     <p>I see the Vy, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> and set the rest of your courtesie, and therefore skink, honest
<hi>Tosilos,</hi> in spight of all the Enchanters in the Indies.</p>
                     <p>Well <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou art the onely Glutton in the world, and
the onely Asse alive, since thou canst not bee perswaded that this foot man is Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and this <hi>Tosilos</hi> counterfeit; stay thou with him and fill thy selfe, Ile goe on faire
and softly before, and expect thee.</p>
                     <p>The Lackey laughed, and unsheathed his Bottle, and drawing out his Bread and
Cheese, hee and <hi>Sancho</hi> set upon the greene Grasse, and like good fellowes they cast
Anchor upon all the Wallets provant so hungerly, that all being gone, they licked the
very Letter-Packet because it smelt of Cheese.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tosilos</hi> said to <hi>Sancho;</hi> Doubtlesse thy Master, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> is a very mad-man.
Hee owes no man nothing in that kinde, said <hi>Sancho;</hi> for if the money hee were to
pay, bee in madnesse, hee hath enough to pay all men. I see it well enough, and tell him
of it, but tis to no purpose; for hee is now even past recovery, since hee hath beene
vanquished by the <hi>Knight of the White-Moone. Tosilos</hi> desired him to tell him what
had befalne him: but <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, it was a discourtesie to let his Master stay for
him; but at some other time when they met, hee should know: and so rising up after
hee had well dusted himselfe, and shaked the crums from his beard, hee caught hold
of Dapple before, and crying farewell, left <hi>Tosilos,</hi> and overtooke his Master that stayed
for him under the shade of a tree.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> were much troubled in minde before his fall, hee was
so much more after it: He stood shading himselfe under the tree
(as you heard) and there his thoughts set upon him, as Flies upon
Hony; some tending to the disenchantment of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> others to
the life that he meant to lead in the time of his forced retirement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> now drew neere, and extolled the liberality of <hi>Tosilos.</hi>

                     <p>Is it possible, <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that still thou thinkest

and transformed into a Countrey-wench, and the Knight of the Looking-glasses,

did shee lament my absence, or hath shee forgotten her amorous passions, that
when I was present troubled her?</p>

                        </gap> (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) neyther had I leysure to aske after such fooleries.
Body of mee, Sir, you are now in a humour of asking after other folkes thoughts, and
amorous ones too.</p>
                     <p>Look thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> there is a great deale of difference betwixt love and gratefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
it may well bee that a Gentleman may not be amorous: but it cannot bee (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all rigour) that hee should be ungratefull: <hi>Altisidora</hi> in likelihood loved me very
well, shee gave mee the three Night-caps thou wotest of, shee cried at my departure,
cursed mee, reviled me, and without modesty railed publikely, all signes that she adored
me; for the anger of Lovers often ends in maledictions. I could give her no comfort,
nor no treasure, all I have being dedicated to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and the treasure of Knights
Errant is like that of Fairies, false and apparant onely, and all I can doe, is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
her, and this I may doe without prejudice to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> whom thou wrongest
with thy slacknesse in whipping thy selfe, and in chastising that flesh of thine, that I
wish I might see devoured by Wolves, that had rather preserve it selfe for Wormes,
then for the remedy of that poore Lady.</p>
                     <p>Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> if you will have the truth, I cannot perswade my selfe that the
lashing of my posteriors can have any reference to the dis-enchanting of the Enchanted,
which is as much as if you should say, If your head grive you, anoynt your knees, at
least, I dare sweare, that in as many Histories as you have read of Knight Errantry,
you never saw whipping dis-enchant any body: but howsoever, I will take it when I
am in the humour, and when time serves Ile chastise my selfe.</p>
                     <p>God grant thou dost, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and heaven give thee grace to fall into
the reckoning and obligation thou hast to help my Lady, who is thy Lady too, since
thou art mine.</p>
                     <p>With this discourse they held on their way, till they came just to the place where
the Bulls had over-runne them: and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> called it to minde, and said to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi>
In this field wee met the brave shepheardesses, and the lusty Swaines, that would
here have imitated and renued the Pastorall Arcadia: an invention as strange as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
in imitation of which, if thou thinkest fit, <hi>Sancho,</hi> wee will turne Shepheards for
the time that wee are to live retired: Ile buy Sheep, and all things fit for our Pastorall
vocation, and calling my selfe by the name of the Shepheard <hi>Quixote,</hi> and thou the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54746:277"/>
Sheepheard <hi>Pansino,</hi> wee will walke up and down the Hills, thorow Woods and
Medowes, singing and versifying, and drinking the liquid Cristall of the fountaines
sometimes out of the cleere Springs, and then out of the swift running Rivers; The
Oakes shall afford us plentifull of their most sweet fruit, and the Bodies of hardest,
Corke-trees shall bee our seates, the Willowes shall give us shade, the Roses their
Perfume, and the wide Meadowes Carpets of a thousand Flourished colours: the
Ayre shall give us a free and pure breath: the Moon and Starres in spight of Nights
darknesse shall give us light, our Songs shall afford us delight, and our wailing Mirth,
<hi>Apollo</hi> verses, and Love-conceits, with which wee may bee eternallized and famous,
not onely in this present Age, but Ages to come also. By ten, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> this kind of
life is very sutable to my desires, and I beleeve the Bachelor <hi>Samson</hi> and Master <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
the Barber will no sooner have seene it, but they will turn Sheepheards with us:
and pray God the Vicar have not a minde to enter into the sheep-coat too, for hee is a
merry Lad and jolly. Thou hast said very well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and the Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
<hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> if so bee hee enter the Pastorall lap (as doubtlesse hee will) may
call himselfe the Sheepheard <hi>Samsonmo,</hi> or <hi>Carrascon.</hi> Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> may call himself
<hi>Niculoso,</hi> as the ancient <hi>Boscan</hi> called himselfe, <hi>Nemoroso;</hi> [<hi>Alluding to the word</hi> Bosque
<hi>for a Wood.</hi>] I know not what name wee should bestow upon the Vicar, except it
were some derivative from his own, calling him the Sheepheard <hi>Curiambro.</hi> The Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesses
on whom wee must bee enamoured, wee may chuse their names as amongst
Peares: and since my Ladies name serves as well for a Sheepheardesse as for a Princesse,
I need not trouble my selfe to get her another better, give thou thine what name thou
wilt.</p>
                     <p>Mine, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> shall have no other name but <hi>Teresona,</hi> which will fit her fatnesse
well, and it is taken from her Christian name, which is <hi>Teresa,</hi> and the rather I cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
her in my verses, doe discover my chaste thoughts, since I seeke not in other
mens houses better bread then is made of Wheat: 'twere not fit that the Vicar had
his sheepheardesse, to give good example, but if the Bachelor will have any, 'tis in his
owne free choice.</p>
                     <p>Lord blesse mee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and what a life shall wee have on 't?
What a world of Horne-pipes, and <hi>Zamora</hi> Bag-pipes shall wee heare? What Tabour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall wee have? What janggling of Bells and playing on the <hi>Rebocke?</hi> And if to
these different Musicks wee have the <hi>Albogne</hi> too, wee shall have all kinde of pastorall
instruments.</p>
                     <p>What is <hi>Albogne</hi> (quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi>) It is, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> a certaine plate made
like a Candlesticke, and being hollow, gives, if not a very pleasing or harmonious
sound, yet it displeaseth not altogether, and agrees well with the rusticke Tabor and
Bag-pipe; and this word <hi>Albogne</hi> is Moorish, as all those in our Castilian tongue are,
that begin with <hi>Al,</hi> to wit, <hi>Almoasa, Almorzar, Alhombra, Alguazil, Alucena, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazon, Alsancia</hi> and the like, with some few more; and our language hath onely three
Moorish words that end in <hi>I,</hi> which are <hi>Borcegni, Zaguicami,</hi> and <hi>Meravedi: Albeli</hi>
and <hi>Alfaqui</hi> are as well knowne to bee Arabick by their beginning with <hi>Al,</hi> as their
ending in <hi>I.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I have told thee by the way, the word <hi>Albogne</hi> having brought it into my head,
and one maine help we shall have for the perfection of this calling, that I, thou knowest,
am somewhat Poeticall, and the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> is a most exquisit one, for
the Vicar I say nothing, but I lay a wager hee hath his smacke, and so hath Master <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
too: for all these, or the most of them play upon a Gittern, and are Rimers, I will
complain of absence: thou shalt praise thy selfe for a constant Lover, the Sheepheard
<hi>Carrascon</hi> shell mourn for being disdain'd, and let the Vicar <hi>Curiambro</hi> doe what hee
pleaseth, and so there is no more to bee desired.</p>
                     <p>To which (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) Sir, I am so unlucky, that I feare I shall not see the day,
in which I may see my selfe in that happy life: oh what neat Spoones shall I make when
I am Sheepheard! What Hodg-potches and Creame! What Garlands and other
pastorall trumperies? that though they get mee not a fame of being wise, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> they shall,
<pb facs="tcp:54746:278"/>
that I am witty. My little Daughter <hi>Sanchica</hi> shall bring our dinner to the Flock: but
soft, she is handsome, and you have Sheepheards more Knaves then Fooles, and I would
not have her come for Wooll, and returne shorn: and your loose desires are as incident
to the fields as to Citties, and as well in Sheepheards Cotages, as Princes Palaces, and
the cause being removed, the sin will bee saved, and the heart dreames not of what the
eye sees not, and better a fair pair of Heels, then die at the Gallows.</p>
                     <p>No more Proverbs, <hi>Sancho,</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) since each of these is enough to
make us know thy meaning, and I have often advised thee, not to bee so prodigall of
thy Proverbs, but more sparing: but 'tis in vaine to bid thee; for the more thou art bid,
the more thou wilt doe it. Mee thinkes, Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> you are like what is said,
that the Frying-pan, said to the Kettle, Avant, Blacke-browes; you reprehend mee
for speaking of Proverbs, and you thred up yours by two and two.</p>
                     <p>Look you, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I use mine to purpose, and when I speak
them, they fit as well as a little Ring to the Finger: but thou bringest in thine so by
head and shoulders, that thou rather draggest then guidest them: and if I forget not, I
told thee heretofore, that Proverbs are briefe sentences, drawne from the experience
and speculation of our An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ient Sages, and a Proverb ill applyed, is rather a foppery
then a sentence: but leave we this now; and since night comes on us, let's retire a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
out of the High-way, where wee will passe this night, and God knowes what may
befall us to Morrow. So they retired, and made a short supper, much against <hi>Sancho's</hi>
will, who now began to thinke of the hard life of Knight Errantry in Woods and
Mountaines, especially calling to his remembrance, the Castles and houses as well of
<hi>Don Diego de Miranda,</hi> and where the rich <hi>Camacho's</hi> marriage was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Antonio Moreno's:</hi> but hee considered with himselfe, that nothing could last ever: and
so he slept away the rest of that night, which his Master passed watching.</p>

my whipping, I may proceed to Musick. Pray Sir let me sleep, and doe not presse me
so to this whipping; for you will make me vow never to touch so much as a haire of

sell, with whom they travelled by night; and the noyse they made with their grunting
and squeaking, was so great, that it deased <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho's</hi> eares, that never
marked what it might bee. It fell out that the goodly grunting Herd were all in a troop
together, and without respect to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> or <hi>Sancho's</hi> person, they trampled over
them both, spoyling <hi>Sancho's</hi> Trenches, and overthrowing not only <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, Let them alone friend, for this affront is a penalty for my fault,

the night, and 'twill bee day, and wee shall have better luck.</p>
                     <p>Sleep thou <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) for thou wast born to sleep, and I was borne
to wake: betwixt this and day-break, I will give reins to my thoughts, and vent them
out in some Madrigall, that without thy knowledge I composed this night.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks (said <hi>Sancho</hi>) that thoughts that give way to verses, are not very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
and therefore versifie you as much as you list, and Ile sleep as much as I can:
and so taking up as much of the ground as hee would, hee crowched up together and
slept liberally: Debts, nor suretiship, nor any other affliction disturbing him.</p>

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> leaning to the body of a Beech or Cork-tree (for <hi>Cid Hamete Benen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli</hi> distinguisheth not what Tree it was) to the Musick of his own sighs, sung as sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:

                     <p>Now day came on, and Sir <hi>Sol</hi> with his beams played in <hi>Sancho's</hi> eyes; who awoke
and lazed himself, shaking and stretching out his lither limbs; hee beheld the havock the
Swine had made in his Sumpterie, and hee cursed and re-cursed the Herd.</p>
                     <p>Finally, both of them returned to their commenced Journey; and toward Sun-set,
they saw some ten Horse-men comming toward them, and four or five foot-men. <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was agast at heart, and <hi>Sancho</hi> shivered, for the troop drew neerer to them,
who had their Spears and Shields all in war like array.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turned to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and said: If, <hi>Sancho,</hi> it were lawfull for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
Armes, and that my promise had not bound my hands, I should think this were
an Adventure of Cake-bread: but perhaps it may bee otherwise then wee think for.</p>
                     <p>By this the Horse men came, and lifting up their Launces without a word speaking,
they compassed in <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> before and behinde; one of the foot-men threatning
him with death, and clapping his finger to his mouth, in signe he should not cry out; and
so hee laid hold on <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Bridle, and led him out of the way: and the rest of the
foot-men catching <hi>Sancho's</hi> Dapple, all of them most silently followed after those that
carried <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> who twice or thrice would have asked, whither they carried?
and what they would with him? But hee no sooner began to move his lips, when they
were ready to close them with their Launces points: And the same hapned to <hi>Sancho,</hi>
when one of the foot-men pricked him with a Goad, hee offering but to speak; and
Dapple they punched too, as if hee would have spoken: It now began to grow dark,
so they mended their pace; the two prisoners fears increased; especially when they
might hear that sometimetimes they were cried out on, Oa, on, yee <hi>Troclodites;</hi> peace,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> said within himself, Wee <hi>Tortelites?</hi> Wee Barbers Slaves? Wee Popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyes?
Wee little Bitches to whom they cry Hist, Hist? [Sancho's <hi>mistakes:</hi>] I doe
not like these names, this winde winnows no Corne, all our ill comes together, like a

                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was embeseld; neither in all his discourse could hee finde what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull

                     <p>Within an hour of night they came the to Castle; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> well perceived
to be the Dukes, where but a while before they had been. Now God defend (said he) as
soon as hee knew the place: what have wee here? Why in this house all is courtesie
and good usage: but for the vanquished, all goes from good to bad, and from bad
to worse.</p>
                     <p>They entred the chief Court of the Castle, and they saw it so dressed and ordered,
that their admiration increased, and their fear redoubled; as you shall see in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Horsemen all alighted, and the Foot-men taking <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and <hi>Sancho</hi> forcibly in their Armes, they set them in the Court,
where round about were burning a hundred Torches in their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of purpose; and about the Turrets above five hundred lights;
so that in spight of dark night, they might there see day.</p>
                     <p>In the midest of the Court there was a Hearse raised some two
yards from the ground, covered with a Cloth of State of black
Velvet, and round about it there burned a hundred Virgin Wax
Candles in silver Candle-sticks; on the top of it there lay a fair Damzell that shewed
to bee dead, that with her beauty made death her self seem faire: her head was laid
upon a Pillow-bear of Cloth of gold, crowned with a Garland, woven with divers odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous
Flowers: her hands was crosted upon her brest, and betwixt them was a bough
of flourishing yellow Palme.</p>
                     <p>On one side of the Court there was a kinde of Theater set up, and two personages in
their Chaires, who with their Crowns on their heads and Scepters in their hands, seemed
to bee eyther reall or feigned Kings: at the side of this Theater where they went up by
steps there were two other Chaires, where they that brought the prisoners set <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
and <hi>Sancho;</hi> and all this with silence, and signes to them that they should bee
silent too: but without that they held their peace; for the admiration of what they
there saw, tyed their tongues: After this two other principall personages came up,
whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> straight knew to bee the Duke and Duchesse, his Host and Hostess,
who sate down in two rich Chairs, neer the two seeming Kings. Whom would not this
admire? especially having seen that the body upon the Hearse was the fair <hi>Altisidora?</hi>
When the Duke and Duchesse mounted, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> bowed to them, and
the Dukes did the like, nodding their heads a little: And now an Officer entred athwart
them; and comming to <hi>Sancho,</hi> clapt a Coat of black Buckram on him, all painted
with flames of fire: and taking his Cap off, hee set a Miter on his head, just such a one
as the Inquisition causes to bee set upon Heretiques, and bade him in his eare, hee should
not unsow his lips, for they would clap a gagg in his mouth, or kill him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld himself all over, and saw himself burning in flames; but since they
burned not indeed, hee cared not a rush for them: hee took off his Miter and saw it
painted with Devills; hee put it on again, and said within himself: Well, yet neither
the one burns nor the other carries me away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beheld him also, and though fear suspended his sences, hee could not
but laugh at <hi>Sancho's</hi> Picture: and now from under the Hearse there seemed to sound
a low and pleasant sound of Flutes, which being un-interrupted by any mans voyce (for
there it seemed silence it self kept silence) was soft and amorous.</p>
                     <p>Straight there appeared suddainly on the Pillow of the Hearse, a Carkeise of a goodly
Youth clad like a Romane, who to the sound of a Harp himself plaid on, with a most
sweet and cleer voyce, sung these two <hi>Stanza's</hi> following; [Which I likewise omit, as
being basely made on purpose, and so not worth the translation.] Enough, said one of the
two that seemed to bee Kings; Enough, divine singer: for it were to proceed in insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum
to paint unto us the misfortunes and graces of the peerlesse Altisidora, not dead,
as the simple world surmizeth; but living in the tongues of Fame, and in the penance
that <hi>Sancho</hi> is to passe, to return her to the lost fight: and therefore thou, oh <hi>Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus!</hi>
that judgest with me in the darksome Caves of <hi>Dis,</hi> since thou knowest all
that is determining in the inscrutable Fates, touching the restoring of this Damzel, tell
<pb facs="tcp:54746:280"/>
and declare it forthwith, that the happinesse wee expect from her returne, may not be
deferred.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had Judge <hi>Minos</hi> said this, when <hi>Radamanthus</hi> standing up, said, Goe too,
Ministers of this house, high and low, great and small, come one after another, and seal
<hi>Sancho's</hi> Chin with four and twenty Tuckes, twelve Pinches, and with Pins prick his
Armes and Buttocks six times, in which Altisidora's health consists.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> heard this, hee broke off silence, and said, I vow, you shall as
soone Tuck mee, or handle my face, as make mee turne Moor. Body of mee, what
hath the handling my face to doe with this Damozells Resurrection? The old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
tasted the Spinage, &amp;c. Dulcinea is enchanted, and I must bee whipped to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enchant
her: <hi>Altisidora</hi> dyes of some sicknesse it pleased God to send her; and her
raising must bee with foure and twenty Tucks given mee, and with grinding my body
with Pins thrusts, and Pinching my Armes black and Blue: away with your tricks to
some other, I am an old Dogg, and there's no Histing to mee.</p>
                     <p>Thou dyest, quoth <hi>Radamanthus</hi> aloud: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Nembroth,</hi> suffer and bee silent, since no impossibilities are required of thee; and stand
not upon difficulties in this businesse: thou shalt bee Tuckt, and see thy selfe grinded,
thou shalt grone with Pinching. Goe too, I say, Ministers, fulfill my command; if not,
as I am honest man, you shall rue the time that ever you were born.</p>
                     <p>Now there came thorow the Court, six like old Waiting-women, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Procession; foure with Spectacles, and all with their right hands lifted aloft,
with foure fingers breadths of their wrists discovered, to make their hands seeme larger
(as the fashion is.)</p>
                     <p>No sooner had <hi>Sancho</hi> seene them, when bellowing like a Bull, hee said, Well
might I suffer all the world else to handle mee, but that Waiting-women touch mee,
I will never consent: Let um Cat-scratch my face, as my Master was served in this
Castle: let um thrust mee thorow with Bodkin-pointed Daggers: let um pull off
my flesh with hot burning Pincers, and I will beareit patiently and serve these Nobles:
but that Waiting-women touch me let the Divell take me, I will not consent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> then interrupted him saying, Have patience soone: and please these
Lordings, and thanke God, that hee hath given such vitrue to thy person; that with the
Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tyrdome of it thou mayst disenchant the enchanted, and raise up the dead!</p>
                     <p>And now the Waiting-women drew neere <hi>Sancho;</hi> who being wonne and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
settled in his Chaire, offered his face and Chin to the first that came, who gave
him a well-sealed Tuck, and so made him a courtsie. Lesse courtsie, and lesse Slabber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauces,
good Mistris <hi>Mumpsimus,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> for, I protest your hands smell of
Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>At length all the Waiting-women sealed him, and others Pinched him: but that
which hee could not suffer, was the Pins-pricking; and therefore hee rose out of his
Chaire very moody, and laying hold of a lighted Torch that was neere him, hee ran
after the women, and his executioners, saying, Avant, infernall Ministers, for I am not
made of Brasse, not to be sensible of such extraordinary martyrdome.</p>
                     <p>By this <hi>Altisidora</hi> that was weary with lying so long upon her backe, turned on
one side: which when the by-standers saw, all of them cryed out joyntly, <hi>Altisidora</hi>
lives, <hi>Altisidora</hi> lives,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Radamanthus</hi> commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to lay aside his choller, since now his intent was
obtained.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw <hi>Altisidora</hi> stirre, he went to kneel down to <hi>Sancho,</hi> saying,
Sonne of my entrailes; 'Tis now high time, that thou give thy selfe some of the lashes
to which thou art obliged, for the disenchanting of <hi>Dulcinea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, I say, is the time, wherein thy virtue may be seasoned, and thou mayst with
efficacy effect the good that is expected from thee.</p>
                     <p>To which (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) Heida: this is lowre upon sowre: 'twere good after these
Pinchings, Tucks and Pins-prickings, that lashes should follow; there's no more to be
done, but even take a good Stone, and tye it to my Neck, and cast mee into a Well: for
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54746:280"/>
which I should not grieve much; if so bee that to cure other folks ills, I must bee the
Pack-horse; let me alone, if not, I shall marre all: And now <hi>Altisidora</hi> sate up in the
Hearse, and the Ho-boyes, accompanied with Flutes and Voyces, began to sound, and
all cryed out, Live <hi>Altisidora, Altisidora</hi> live. The Dukes rose up, and with them
<hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> and altogether with <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Altisidora,</hi> and to help her out of the Herse, who feigning a kinde of dismaying,
bowed down to her Lords, and to the two Kings, and looking askonce on <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
said: God pardon thee, discourteous Knight, since by thy cruelty I have remained in
another world, me thinks at least this thousand yeers: And thee I thank, the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
Squire in the world; I thank thee for the life I possesse: And now dispose
of six of my Smocks, which I give thee to make six shirts; and if they be not all whole, yet
they are clean at least.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> kissed her hands with his Miter off and his knees on the ground, and the Duke
commanded they should return him his Cap, and instead of his Gown with the flames,
they should return him his Gaberdine. <hi>Sancho</hi> desired the Duke, that they would leave
him both, which hee would carry into his Country, in memory of that unheard of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
The Duchesse answered they should, and that hee knew how much shee was his
friend. The Duke commanded all to avoid the Court, and to retire to their lodgings,
and that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> should bee carried to theirs they knew of old.</p>

own Chamber which he would faine have avoided, had it been in
his power; for hee knew full well that his Master would hardly
let him sleep all night, by reason of the many questions hee would
demand of him, to which hee must of necessity make answer.
Now was hee in no good humour to talk much; for hee felt yet
the smart of his fore-passed torments, which were an hindrance
to his tongue: And without doubt hee would rather have layn
alone in any poor Shed, then with company in that goodly house: So true was his fear,
and so certain his doubt, as hee was scarce laid in his Bed, but his Master began this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> what thinkest thou of this nights successe? Needs must a man confesse that
great and powerfull is the force of disdain, since as thou thy self hast seen with thine
own eyes <hi>Altisidora</hi> had surely dyed, &amp; that by no other arrows, nor by any other sword,
nor other instrument of War, no, nor by the force of poyson, but by the apprehension
of the churlish rigor, and the disdain wherewith I have ever used her.</p>
                     <p>Shee might (answerrd <hi>Sancho</hi>) have died in good time, and at her choyse and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
so shee would have let me alone in mine own house, since I was never the
cause that shee became a Lover, nor did I ever in all my life scorn or disdain her. But I
wot not, nor can I imagine how it may bee, that the health or welfare of <hi>Altisidora,</hi>
a Gentlewoman more fantasticall then discreet, hath any reflection (as I have said here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
upon the afflictions of <hi>Sancho Panca.</hi> Now I plainly and distinctly perceive,
that there bee both Enchanters and Enchantments in the world, from whom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

Sleep my friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) unlesse the nipping scoffs and bitter
frumps which thou hast received will not permit thee so to doe.</p>
                     <p>There is no grief (answered <hi>Sancho</hi>) comparable unto the affront of scoffing frumps,
and so much the more sensible am I of such affronts, as that I have received them by old
women; a mischief take them: I beseech you once more that you will suffer me to sleep,
since that sleep is an easing of all miseries. Bee it as thou sayest (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>)
and God accompanie thee.</p>
                     <p>So they both fell a-sleep, aud whilest they slept, <hi>Cid Hamete,</hi> Authour of this great
History, would needs write and relate, why the Duke and the Duchesse had caused this
monument to bee built and invented, all that you have seen above.</p>
                     <p>Hee writes then, That the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> having not forgotten what had
hapned to him, at what time, under the name of the <hi>Knight of the Looking-glasses,</hi> hee
was vanquished and overthrown by <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and therewithall how all his designs
and purposes were vanished into smoak; yet neverthelesse would hee (hoping for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
successe) attempt the combat again: Therefore is it, that being informed by the
Page who brought the Letter, and with it the present unto <hi>Teresa Panca,</hi> the Wife of
<hi>Sancho,</hi> from the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made his residence, hee recovered new Arms
and a Horse.</p>
                     <p>Then caused hee the white Moon to bee painted in his Shield: A Mulet carried all
this equipage, and a Lob or Swain led the same, and not <hi>Thomas Ceciall</hi> his ancient
Esquire, for fear hee should bee known of <hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee so well bestirred himself in his journies, that at last hee came to the Dukes Castle,
who taught him the way or tract that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had taken, and how hee had a great
desire to bee present at the Tiltings and Turnaments of <hi>Saragosa.</hi> Hee likewise related
unto him the gullings or gudgeons that hee had given him, with the invention of <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea's</hi>
dis-enchantment, which should bee accomplished at the charges of <hi>Sancho's</hi> but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks.
In summe, hee understood from him the fob or jest that <hi>Sancho</hi> had used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his Master, in making him beleeve that <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was Enchanted and transformed
into a Country Lasse, and how the Duchesse his Wife had given <hi>Sancho</hi> to understand,
that himself was the man that received himself, for so much as <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was verily En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted.</p>
                     <p>The Bachelour could not contain himself from laughing, and therewithall to bee
amazed, considering the quaint subtilty, and plain simplicity of <hi>Sancho,</hi> equall unto the
extream folly of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> The Duke desired him, that if hee met with him, and
either vanquished him or not, hee would bee pleased to come that way again, to the
end hee might advertise him of it.</p>
                     <p>The Bachelor promised him to doe it, and so took his leave of the Duke, to goe and
see whether hee could finde <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Hee found him not at <hi>Saragosa,</hi> but went
farther: and then befell him what you have already heard.</p>
                     <p>Hee came afterward to the Dukes Castle, and there made report of all, together
with the conditions of the Combat: Hee moreover told them, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came
again to accomplish, as a perfect Knight Errant, the promise which he had made, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
himself to his own Village, and there to abide the full space of one whole yeer. And
that during the said time, it might peradventure bee brought to passe (said the Bachelor)
that hee might bee cured of his folly. That hee never had other intention, and that
for this only cause hee had thus disguised himself; for it was great pitty that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
so well skilled and versed in all things as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was, should become a
foole.</p>
                     <p>With that hee took leave of the Duke, and went to his Burrough, where hee staid
for <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who was comming after him. Whereupon the Duke took occasion
to put this trick upon him; for hee took a wondrous pleasure of what succeeded unto
<hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> and therefore hee caused all the approaches and high-wayes
about his Castle to bee laid and watched, especially where hee imagined our Knight might
come. And for the said cause he placed divers of his servants, as well on foot as on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
to the end that if they met with him, willed he or nilled he, they should bring him to
the Castle</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:54746:281"/>
Now it fortuned that they met with him, and forthwith they gave the Duke know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, who was already resolved what hee would doe. As soon then as hee knew
of his comming, hee caused all the Torches and lights that were in the Court to bee
lighted, and <hi>Altisidora</hi> to bee placed upon the Tombe with all the preparation that you
have seen before; and that so lively represented, as one would have found very little
difference between the truth and that which was counterfeit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cid Hamete</hi> goeth yet farther: for hee saith, that hee asturedly beleeveth, that the
mockers were as foolish as the mocked: and that there wanted not two inches of the
Dukes and Duchesses utter privation of common understanding, since they took so
much pains to mock two fools, whereof the one was then sound asleep; and the other
broad awake, transported with his raving and ranging thoughts.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the day surprized them, and they desired to rise; for the sluggish
feathers were never pleasing unto <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> were hee conquered or conqueror.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Altisidora,</hi> who, as <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> supposed, being risen from death to life, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
her self to her Master and Mistrisses humour, being crowned with the very same
Garland which shee had in the tombe, attired in a loose Gown of white Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ata, all
beset with flowres of gold; her haire loose and dangling down her shoulders, leaning
upon a staff of fine Ebony wood, shee entred into <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Chamber, who so
soon as hee saw her, was so amazed and confounded at her presence, as hee shrunk down
into his Bed, all covered with the clothes and hid with the sheets and counterpoint,
that hee neither spake word, nor used any manner of gesture towards her, as might
witnesse that hee desired to shew her any courtesie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Altisidora</hi> sat down in a chaire, which was neer unto <hi>Don-Quixote's</hi> head, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fetching a deep deep sigh, with a low sweet and milde voyce, shee thus bespake
him.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> whensoever women of quality, or maidens of discretion trample
their honour under their feet, and give their tongue free liberty and scope to exceed the
bounds of conveniency or modesty, publishing the secreets lurking in their hearts, they
then shall finde themselves brought to extream misery and distresse.</p>
                     <p>Now am I one of those pressed, vanquished, and also enamoured: All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
I suffer patiently, and continue honest. So that having been so, too much
silence was the cause that my soul went out of my body, and I lost my life. It is now
two daies since, that the consideration and remembrance of the rigor, (which thou oh
more stony-minded then any marble, and inexorable Knight, so to reject my plaints)
which you have used towards me, brought me to my lives end, or at least I have been
deemed and taken for dead by all those that saw me. And had it not been that Love,
who taking pitty of me, deposed my recovery among the grievous torments of this good
Esquire, I should for ever have remained in the other world. Love might well depose
it (replyed <hi>Sancho</hi>) in those of my Asse, and I would have been very glad of it: But tell me
I pray you good Damzel, even as Heaven may provide you of another more kind loving-Lover
then my Master, what is it that you have seen in the other world? What is there in
Hell that he who dyeth desperate must necessarily undergoe? I must needs (quoth <hi>Altisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>)
tell you the plain truth of all. So it is, that I was not wholly or thorowly dead,
since I came not into Hell: for had I once been therein, there is no question, but I had
never been able to come out of it at my pleasure.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that I came even unto the gate thereof, where I met with a dozen of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
who in their hosen and doublets were playing at Tennis-ball; they did weare
Falling-bands set with peaks of Flemmish bone-lace, with Cuffs of the very same, so
deep, as they appeared four good inches longer then the arme, to the end their hands
might seem the greater: Their Battledors or Rackets were of fire. But that which made
me wonder most, was, that they used Books in stead of Balls, which Books were full
stuft with winde and stifning, a thing both wondrous and newly-strange, yet did not
that so much astonie me: for as it is proper unto those, that win at any Game, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and bee glad; whereas those that lose, are ever sad and discontent: there all grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
chafed, fretted, and bitterly cursed one another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:282"/>
That's no wonder (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) since the Divels, whether they play, or play not;
whether they winn, or winn not at that play, they can never be content.</p>
                     <p>Belike it is even so (replyed <hi>Altisidora:</hi>) but there is also another thing, which
likewise bred some amazement in mee; that is to say, brought mee into admiration.
Which is, that the Ball, that was but once tossed or strucken, could not serve another
time, so that at every stroke, they were forced to change Books whether they were old
or new which was a marvellous thing to behold.</p>
                     <p>Now it hapned, that they gave so violent a stroake unto a moderne Booke, and very
fairely bound, that it made the very Guts to fly out of it, and scattered the Leaves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
up and down.</p>
                     <p>Then said one Divell unto another, I prethee looke what that Booke treateth of.
It is (answed the other Divell) the Second part of the History of <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi>
not composed by <hi>Cid Hamete,</hi> it's first Authour, but by an <hi>Aragonis,</hi> who
braggeth to bee born at <hi>Tordesillas.</hi> Now fye upon it (quoth the other Divell) out
of my sight with it, and let it bee cast into the very lowest pit of Hell, so deep as mine
eyes may never see it againe. But why (said the other Divell?) is it so bad a Booke?
It is so vile a Booke (replied the first Divell) that had I my selfe expressely composed
it, I could never have encountred worse.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time they followed on their game, tossing other Bookes to and fro
but having heard the name of <hi>Don-Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ixote,</hi> hee whom I love so passionately, I have
laboured to engrave that vision in my memory.</p>
                     <p>Now without doubt then (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) it was a right vision: for, there
is no other Man of that name in the whole World but my selfe: And that History doth
already goe from Hand to hand thorow all parts of the Universe: and yet stayes in
no place, for so much as every one will have a kicke at it. Now I have not beene
angry or vexed, when I have heard that I wander up and downe like a fantasticke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
amidst the Pitchy shades of Hell, and not in the light of the earth; since I am not
the man that History speaketh of. If it bee true and faithfully compiled, it will live
many ages; but if it be nothing worth it will dye even at it's birth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Altisidora</hi> would have continued her plaints, accusing <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of rigour and
unkindnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e; but hee said thus unto her, Madame, I have often told you, that I am
very angry, that you have settled your thoughts on mee; since you can draw nothing
from mee but bare thanks, and no remedy at all. I was onely borne for <hi>Dulcinea</hi>
of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and to her onely have the Destinies (if there bee any) wholly dedicated
mee. To thinke, that any other beauty can possesse or usurpe the place, which shee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
in my soule, were to beleeve an impossibility. And this should suffice to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuse
you, and to make you to retire your selfe within the bounds of your honesty, since
no creature is tyde unto impossibilities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Altisidora</hi> hearing these words, made a semblance to bee very angry: so that, as it
were in a great anger, shee thus bespake him, I sweare by the Prince of the Mumps,
the soul of a Morter, and stone of a Date; more obstinate and hard-hearted, thena
rude and base Pesant when one sueth unto him, and when hee addresseth his levell
to the Butt or Marke: if I take you in hand, I will plucke your very Eyes out of your
head.</p>
                     <p>Doe you haply suppose, Sir vanquished, and <hi>Don</hi> Knockt downe with Bats and
Cudgels, that I would have dyed for you? No, no, Sir, whatsoever you have seene
this night, hath been nothing but a fiction, or thing fained. I am not a Maiden, that
would suffer so much as the least-least pain at the tip of my Nailes for such a Camell as
you are; much lesse that I would dye for such a grosse Animall.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve it well (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> then) for all these Lovers deaths are but to cause
sport and laughter. Well may they say, that they dye: but that they will hasten their
deaths, <hi>Iudas</hi> may beleeve it if hee list.</p>
                     <p>As they were in these discourses, the Musician and Poet, who had sung the
fore-going <hi>Stanza's,</hi> entred into the Chamber, and making a very low reverence unto
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hee thus said unto him, Sir, Knight, I beseech you to hold mee in the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54746:282"/>
number of your humblest servants. I have long since been most affectionate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, as well by reason of your farre-bruited renown, as for your high-raised fears
of Armes.</p>
                     <p>Tell me (answered <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) who you are, that my courtesie may answer your
merit.</p>
                     <p>The Young man gave him to understand, that hee was the Musician and the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girick
of the fore-passed night.</p>
                     <p>In good sooth (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) you have a very good voyce: Neverthelesse
mee seems, that what you sung was not greatly to the purpose: for what have the
Stanza's of <hi>Garsilasse</hi> to doe with the death of this Damzell? My fair Sir, said the
Musician, you ought not to wonder at that; the best and choisest Poets of our age doe
practice it: so that every man writes as best pleaseth his fantasie, and stealeth what, and
from whom he lists, whether it cohere with the purpose or not: By reason whereof all
the follies, absurdities, or fopperies that they sing, indite, or write, they ascribe unto a
Poeticall licence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would have answered, but hee was hindred by the Duke and Duchesse,
who both entred the Chamber to see him. Amongst whom there passed so long a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and pleasant a conference, in which <hi>Sancho</hi> alledged so many ready quips, witty
conceits, merry Proverbs, and therewithall so many wyly shifts and subtill knaveries, as
the Duke and the Duchesse were all astonished again, as well by reason of his simplicity,
as of his subtiltie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> besought them to give him leave to depart the very same day; since
that Knights subdued, as hee was, ought rather to dwell in an homely Cottage or sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Shed, then in Kingly Palaces; which they most willingly granted him: And the
Duchesse demanded of him whether <hi>Altisidora</hi> was in his good favour, or no. Madame
(answered <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) you are to understand, that all the infirmitie of this Damzell
takes its beginning and being from idlenesse, and that an honest occupation &amp; continuall
exercise is the only remedy for it: Shee was even now telling me, that in Hell they are
working Tapistry work, and that there are made Tyrings and Net works.</p>
                     <p>I think that shee is skillfull in such works, and that's the reason shee therein imployes
her self, never ceasing to handle small Spindles or Spooles: and thus the Images of him
shee loveth will never be removed in her imagination.</p>
                     <p>What I tell you is most certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> It is my opinion, it is my consell.</p>
                     <p>And mine also (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) since I never saw any workman that applyed or
busied himself about such works, that dyed for love. The Maidens, I say, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
about such works think more on the accomplishing of their task, then on that of
their Loves. I judge of it by my self, whilest I am digging or delving, I never think
on my Pinkany at all; I speak of my <hi>Teresa Panca,</hi> whom I love better a thousand
times then my very eye lids.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> you speak very well (said the Duchesse) and I will take such order, as my
<hi>Altisidora</hi> shall henceforward occupie her self about such works; for shee can work
them excellently well.</p>
                     <p>Madame (quoth <hi>Altisidora</hi>) I shall not need to use such a remedy, since the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
or consideration of the cruelties and unkindnesses which this Robber and roving
Thief hath used towards me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> will be of force, without any other device or artifice to
blot and deface them out of my memory. In the mean while, with your Highnesses per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
I will bee gone from hence, that so mine eyes may not behold, not only his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and gastly shape, but his ugly and abhominable countenance.</p>
                     <p>The words (replyed the Duke) which you utter, make me remember the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
which teacheth us, that hee who sharply chides is ready to pardon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Altisidora</hi> made a shew to dry up the tears from her eyes with a Handkerchief; and
then making a very low courtesie unto her Master and Mistris, she went out of the
Chamber.</p>
                     <p>Alas poor Damzel (said then <hi>Sancho</hi>) I send thee ill luck, since thou hast already met
with it, in lighting upon a soul made of a Skuttle, and a heart of Oake. Hadst thou had
<pb facs="tcp:54746:283"/>
to doe with me, thou shouldest have found a Cock of me that would have crowed after
another fashion.</p>
                     <p>Thus their discourse brake off; <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> took his clothes, dined with the Duke
and Duchesse, and in the afternoon went his way.</p>

musing and pondring on them, hee said to his Master: By my faith Sir, I am the
most unfortunate Physician that may bee found in the world: There bee some Leaches
that kill a sick man whom they have under cure, and will neverthelesse bee well paid for
their pains. Now all they doe, is but to write a short Bill of certain Medicines, which
the Apothecary, and not they, doth afterward compound: Whereas I, clean contrary,
to whom the recovery and health of others doth cost many a clod of blood, many a first

as one poor farthing.</p>

that in learning and studying it, thou hast not been at a penny charge: neverthelesse the

that thou shouldest give thy self for the dis-enchanting of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> thou hast already
fully received it: Yet know I not whether the wages or hire will answer the Cure, or
recovery; and I would not have it bee an hindrance to the remedy. Mee seems not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that one shall lose nothing in the tryall. Consider <hi>Sancho,</hi> what thou
wilt have, and forthwith whip thy self, &amp; with thine own hands pay thy self down-right,
since thou hast money of mine in thy keeping.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> presently opened his eyes and eares a foot wide at these kinde offers, and took
a resolution with a cheerfull heart to whip and lash himself: and therefore said unto
his Master: Now is the time my Noble Sir, that I will wholly dispose my self to give
you satisfaction, since I shall reap some bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it by it. The love of my Children and my
Wife induceth me to have no regard at all unto the harm or ill that may thereby come
unto me.</p>

                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:54746:283"/>
Tell me then, what will you give me for every stripe or lash? If I were bound to pay
thee (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) equivalent to the greatnesse and qualitie of the remedy,
the treasure of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the rich Mines of <hi>Peru</hi> would not suffice to recompence thee.
Look well thy self what thou hast of mine, and value every lash as thou wilt. The whip
lashes (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> are in number three thousand three hundred and odd: I have
already given my self five, the other remain behinde: Let the five serve to deduct the
odd number remaining, and let all bee reduced to three thousand and three hundred:
My meaning is, to have for every lash a piece of three blanks (and lesse I will not have
should all the world command me the contrary) so that they will amount to three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and three hundred pieces of three blanks. The three thousand, make a thousand
and five hundred half Ryalls, and they make seven hundred and fifty whole Ryalls;
and the three hundred make one hundred and fifty half Ryalls, which amount unto
the summe of threescore and fifteen Ryalls, which added unto the seven hundred
and fifty, the whole summe amounteth unto eight hundred and five and twenty
Ryalls.</p>
                     <p>I will reckon this summe, and deduct it from that I have of yours in my keeping,
and by this means shall enter into my house both rich and well satisfied, albeit well
whipt and scourged: for trouts are not caught with nothing; and I say no
more.</p>
                     <p>Oh thrice happy <hi>Sancho!</hi> oh amiable <hi>Sancho!</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> how am I and
<hi>Dulcinea</hi> bound to serve thee, so long as the Heavens shall bee pleased to give us life?

thee one hundred Ryalls over and above, that so I may binde thee to begin betimes.
When (replyed <hi>Sancho?)</hi> Even this very night. Bee you but pleased, that this night
wee meet in the open field, and you shall see mee open, gash, and flay my self.</p>
                     <p>To bee short, the night came, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had with all manner of impatience
long looked for; to whom it seemed that the wheels of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Chariot had been
broken, and that the day grew longer then it was wont, even as it happeneth unto Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who think that they shall never come to obtain the accomplishment of their desires.
At last they entred a grove of delight some Trees, which was somewhat remote, and out
of the high-way. After they had taken off the saddle and Pack-saddle of <hi>Rozinante</hi> and
Dapple, they sate down upon the green grasse, and supped with such Victuals as <hi>Sancho</hi>
had in his Wallets.</p>
                     <p>This good Squire having made of Dapples halter or head-stall a good big whip or
scourage, hee went about twenty paces from his Master, and thrust himself among bushes
and hedges.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing him martch thus all naked and with so good a courage, began
thus to discourse unto him: Take heed, good friend, that thou hack not thy self in
pieces, and that the stripes and lashes stay the one anothers leisure; thou must not make
such haste in thy Career, that thy winde or breath fail in thy couse. My meaning is, that
thou must not lash thy self so hard and fast, that thy life faint before thou come to thy
desired number: But to the end that thou lose not thy self for want of a paire of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Tables,
more or lesse, I will stand aloof off, and upon these my prayer-beads will
number the lashes that thou shalt give thy self. Now the heavens favour thee, as thy good
meaning well deserveth.</p>
                     <p>A good Pay-master (answered <hi>Sancho)</hi> will never grudge to give wages; I think to
curry or so belabour my self, that without endangering my life, my lashes shall bee sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
unto me, and therein must the substance of this miracle consist. And immediately
<hi>Sancho</hi> stripped himself bare from the gyndle upward, and taking the whip in his hand
began to rib-baste and lash himself roundly; and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to number the strokes.
When <hi>Sancho</hi> had given himself seven or eight stripes, hee thought hee had killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
so that pawsing a while, hee said to his Master, that hee was very much deceived,
&amp; would therefore appeale, for so much as every whip-lash did in lieu of a peece of three
Blanks, deserve half a Ryall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54746:284"/>
Make an end my friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and bee not dismaid; for I
will re-double thy pay.</p>
                     <p>Now by my life then (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> blows shall shore upon me as thick as haile:
but the Mountebank and cheating companion, in stead of lashing his shoulders, hee
whipped the Trees, and so sighingly groaned at every stroake, that you would have
thought his soul had flown out of his body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who was now full of compassion fearing hee would kill himself, and
that, through the folly of <hi>Sancho,</hi> his desires should not bee accomqlished, began thus
to say unto him: Friend, I conjure thee, let this businesse end here; this remedy seems
to me very hard and sharpe. It shall not bee amisse, that we give time unto Time; for
<hi>Rome</hi> was never built in one day. If I have told right, thou hast already given thy self
more then a thousand lashes: it now sufficeth; let me use a homely pharse, That the
Asse endure his charge, but not the sur-charge.</p>
                     <p>No, no, my good Sir (answered <hi>Sancho)</hi> it shall never bee said of me, Mony well
paid, and the Armes broken. I pray you goe but a little aside, and permit me to give my
self one thousand stripes more, and then we shall quickly make an end; yea, and wee
shall have more left behinde. Since thou art so well disposed (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi>
I will then withdraw my self, may the heavens assist and recompence thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> returned to his task, with such an earnest passion, that the bark of many
a Tree fell off, so great was the rigor and fury wherewith hee scourged himself.
Now in giving such an exceeding and outragious lash upon a hedge, hee cryed
out alowd, Here is the place where <hi>Samson</hi> shall dye, with all those that are with
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ran presently at the sound of that wofull voyce, and at the noyse of that
horrible whip-stroak. Then laying fast hold on the halter, which served <hi>Sancho</hi> in lieu
of an Oxe-pizle, he said to him: Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> let Fortune never permit that thou,
to give me contentment, hazard the losse of thy life, which must serve for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy Wife and Children, I will contain my self within the bounds of the next
hope, and will stay untill thou have recovered new strength, to the end, this businesse
may be ended to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>
                     <p>My good Sir (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> since you will needs have it so, in good time bee it. In
the mean while, I beseech you Sir, cast your Cloak upon my shoulders: I am all in
a sweat, and I would bee loth to take cold. Our new disciplinants runne the like
danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did so, and leaving himself in his doublet, he covered <hi>Sancho,</hi> who
fell a-sleep, and slept untill the Sunne awakned him. They kept on their way
so long, that at last they arrived to a place three leagues off, and at last staid at
an Inne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> knew it to bee an Inn, and not a Castle round environed with ditches
or trenches, fortified with Towres, with Port-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>llices, and strong Draw-bridges: for
since his last defeature, he discerned and distinguished of all things that presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto him with better judgement, as we shall presently declare.</p>
                     <p>He was lodged in a low chamber, to which certain old-worn curtains of painted
Serge served in lieu of Tapistry hangings, as commonly they use in Country Villages.
In one of the peeces might bee seen painted by a bungling and unskillfull hand, the rape
of <hi>Helen,</hi> at what time her fond-hardy guest stole her from <hi>Menelaus.</hi> In another was
the History of <hi>Dido,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas;</hi> Shee on an high Turret with a sheet, making signe
unto her fugitive guest, who on the Sea, carried in a Ship, was running away from
her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> observed in these two stories, that <hi>Helen</hi> seemed not to bee discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with her rape, for so much as shee leared and smiled underhand; whereas beauteous
<hi>Dido</hi> seemed to trickle down tears from her eyes as big as Wall-nuts. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> in
beholding this painted work, said; These two Ladies were exceedingly unfortunate
that they were not borne in this age, and I most of all thrice unhappy, that I was not
born in theirs; In faith I would so have spoken to these Lordly gallants, as <hi>Troy</hi> should
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54746:284"/>
not have been burned, nor <hi>Carthage</hi> destroyed, since that only by putting <hi>Parts</hi> to
death, I should have been the occasion that so many mischiefs would never have
hapned.</p>
                     <p>I hold a wager (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> that e're long there shall bee never a Tipling-house,
Tavern, Inne, Hostory, or Barbers Shop, but in them all wee shall see the History of our
famous Acts painted: neverthelesse I would with with all my heart, that they might
bee drawn by a more cunning and skillfull hand, then by that which hath pourtraid these
figures.</p>
                     <p>Thou hast reason <hi>Sancho</hi> (answered <hi>Don-Quixote:)</hi> for this Painter is like unto <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banegia,</hi>
who dwelled at <hi>Vbeda,</hi> who when hee was demanded what he was Painting,
made this answer, That which shall come forth to light: And if perchance hee
drew a Cock, hee would write above it, <hi>This is a Cock,</hi> lest any man should think it to
bee a Fox. Now me thinks <hi>Sancho,</hi> that such ought to bee the Painter or the writer:
(for all is one same thing) who hath set forth the History of this new <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
because hee hath painted or written that which may come forth to the open light. Hee
hath imitated a certain Poet named <hi>Mauleon,</hi> who the last yeer was at the Court, who
sodainly would make answer to whatsoever was demanded him. And as one asked him
one day, what these words <hi>Deum de Deo</hi> signified? Hee answered in Spanish, <hi>De donde diere.</hi> But omitting all this, tell me <hi>Sancho,</hi> Hast thou a minde to give thy selfanother
touch this night, and wilt thou have it to bee under the roof of a house, or else in the
open ayre?</p>
                     <p>Now I assure you (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> for the stripes and lashes that I intend to give my
self, I love them as well in the house as in the open fields: yet with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> That
I would have it to bee amongst Trees; for me thinks that they keepe mee
good company, and doe exceedingly help mee to indure and undergoe my travell and
pains.</p>
                     <p>Friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) that shall not bee: rather reserve them, that you
may exercise them when wee shall bee arrived at our Village, whither at the farthest we
shall reach the next day after to morrow; and in the mean time thou shalt have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
new strength.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, that hee might doe what best pleased him; but notwithstanding
hee desired to dispatch this businesse in hot blood, and whilest the Mill was going; for
dangers consist often in lingring and expectation, and that with prayers unto God, a
man must strike with his Mallet; That one, take it, is more worth then two; thou shalt
have it: And better is one Sparrow in the hand, then a Vulture flying in the ayre.</p>
                     <p>Now for Gods sake <hi>Sancho</hi> (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) let us not alledge so many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs;
me thinks thou art still returning unto <hi>Sicut erat.</hi> I prethee speak plainly, cleerly,
and goe not so about the bush with such embroyled speeches, as I have often told thee:
and thou shalt see, that one loaf of bread will yeeld thee more then an hundred.</p>
                     <p>I am so unluckie (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> that I cannot discourse without Proverbs, nor can
I alleage a Proverb, that seems not to bee a reason unto me: Neverthelesse, if I can,
I will correct my self: and with that they gave over their enterparlie at that time.</p>

which time a Gentleman on horse-back, followed by three or
four Servants, came to the Gate of the Inne, to whom one of his
attendants said thus: My Lord <hi>Don Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> you may here
rest your self, and passe the great heat of the day: This Inne seemeth
to bee very cleanly and cool.</p>
                     <p>Which speech <hi>Don Quixote</hi> hearing, he said unto <hi>Sancho;</hi> Thou oughtest to know, that
when I turned over the Book of the second part of my History, me thought that in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same, I met with this name of <hi>Don Alvaro Tarfe.</hi>

                     <p>That may very well bee (said <hi>Sancho)</hi> but first let us lee him alight from his horse, and

                     <p>The Knight alighted, and the Hostesse appointed him a low Chamber, neer unto
that of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and which was furnished with like figures of painted Serge. The
new-come Knight did forthwith put off his heavy clothes; and now going out of the
Inne Porch which was somewhat spacious and fresh, under which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was
walking, hee demanded of him: Whither goe you, my good Sir Gentleman? I am
going (answered <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> unto a certain Village, not farre off, where I was born.
And you, my Lord, whither goe you? I travell (said the Knight) towards <hi>Granada,</hi>
which is my native Country. Sir, you were born (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> in a very
good Country; in the mean time I pray you in courtesie tell me your name; for it
stands me very much upon to know it, yea, more then can well bee imagined. I am

friend.</p>
                     <p>It was even I that drew him first out of his Village, or at least that perswaded him to
be at the Justs and Tiltings which were then kept at <hi>Saragosa,</hi> and whither I was going:
and in good truth I did him a great favour; for I was the cause that the hang-man did

hee was over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But tell me, I beseech you then (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> my Lord, <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> doe
I in any thing resemble the said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of whom you speak? Nothing at all (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the other.) And did that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (replyed our Knight) conduct with him
a Squire named <hi>Sancho Panca?</hi> Yes verily (quoth <hi>Don Alvaro)</hi> And the report went,
that this Squire was very blithe, pleasant, aad gamesome; but yet I never heard him
speak any thing with a good garbe or grace, nor any one word that might cause
laughter.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve it well (said <hi>Sancho</hi> then) for it suits not with all the world to bee pleasant
and jesting: and the very same <hi>Sancho</hi> of whom you speak (my Lord the Gentleman)
must bee some notorious Rogue, some Greedy-gut, and notable Theef. It is I that am
the right <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that can tell many fine Tales; yea, more then there are drops
of water when it raineth: If so you please, my Lord, you may make experience of it:
and follow me at least one yeer, and you shall then see, that at every step I shall speak
so many unpleasant things, that very often, without knowing what I utter, I make all
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54746:285"/>
them to laugh that listen unto me. In good sooth, <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the
farre renowned, the valiant, the discreet, the amorous; he who is the redresser of wrongs,
the revenger of outrages, the Tutor of Infants, the Gardian of Orphanes, the Rampire
of Fortres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his only Mistris, the matchlesse <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> is the very same Lord whom you see
here present, and who is my good Master. All other <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and all other <hi>Sancho
Panca's</hi> are but dreams fopperies and fables.</p>
                     <p>Now by my Holydam I beleeve as much (answered <hi>Don Alvaro;)</hi> for in those few
words by you even now uttered, you have shewed more grace then ever did the other
<hi>Sancho Panca</hi> in all the long and tatling discourses that I have heard come from him. He
savoured more of the Gormand, then of a well-spoken man; more of a Coxcombe, then
of a pleasant. Without doubt I beleeve that the Enchanters which persecute the good
<hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> have also gone about to persecute me, in making me to know the other
<hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who is of no worth or merit at all. Neverthelesse I wot not well what to
say of it, since I durst swear that I left him at <hi>Toledo</hi> in the Nuncio his house, to the end
he might bee cured and healed, and behold here another <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but far different
from mine.</p>
                     <p>As for me (quoth <hi>Don Quixote)</hi> I know not whether I bee good or no, but
well I wot I am not the bad: And for a manifest tryall of my saying, my Lord <hi>Don
Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> if you please, you shall understand, that in all my life-time I was never
at <hi>Saragosa.</hi> And having of late understood, that the imaginary <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had been
present at the Turnaments and Tiltings in that City, I would by no means come or goe
into it, that in view of all the world I might manifest his false Tale; Which was the
reason that I went strait vnto <hi>Barselona,</hi> the treasury or store-house of all Courtesie,
the retreat and refuge of all Strangers, the relieving harborough of the poor and needy,
the native home of valourous men, where such as be wronged or offended are avenged;
and where true friendships are reciprocall, and in summe, a City that hath no peer, bee
it either for beauty, or for the fair situation of it.</p>
                     <p>And albeit what hath befaln me bring me no great content, I doe notwithstanding
somewhat allay the grief with the pleasure, which by the sight thereof I have received
and felt.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, my Lord <hi>Don Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> I am <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> and
the very same man of whom Fame speaketh, and not hee, that unhappy wretch, who to
honour himself with my Designes, hath gone about to usurp my name.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while I humbly beseech you, by the profession which you make to bee a
Noble Knight, that before the ordinary Judge of this place, you will bee pleased to make
mee a Declaration and Certificate, how, so long as you have lived, even untill this present
houre, you never saw me, &amp; that I am not the said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> imprinted in this second

have known.</p>
                     <p>I shall doe it with all my heart (quoth the Knight <hi>Don Alvaro)</hi> although I bee very
much amazed to see two <hi>Don Quixotes,</hi> and behold two <hi>Sancho's</hi> at one very instant,
so conformable in name, and so different in actions. But I tell you again and again, and
I assuredly beleeve that I have not viewed what I have seen, and that what hath hapned
unto me concerning this subject, hath not befaln at all.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt, my Lord (then said <hi>Sancho</hi>) it is very likely that you are Enchanted,
even as my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> is: would to God that your dis-enchanting
might bee brought to passe with giving other three thousand and odd whip lashes,
as I doe for her; I would most willingly give them unto my self, without any interest
at all.</p>
                     <p>I know not what you mean (quoth <hi>Don Alvaro</hi>) by these whip-lashes. To whom
<hi>Sancho</hi> said, it would be too long a discourse to relate; but yet hee would make him
acquainted with the whole story, if peradventure they should both travell one same
way.</p>
                     <p>By this time the hour of dinner was at hand, and they fed and ate together. At the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:286"/>
very same time the Judge of the place came into the Inne, attended on by a Clerk or
Notary, whom <hi>Don Quixote</hi> required that hee would take a Certificat or declaration,
which this Knight <hi>Don Alvaro Tarfe</hi> would declare unto him; for so much as it did
highly concern his honour and reputation.</p>
                     <p>Now the Tenor of the Declaration was, that the said Gentleman did in no sort know
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> who was there present, and that hee was not the man, whose name they
had lately imprinted in an History entituled, <hi>The second part of Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi>
composed by Abellaneda, born at <hi>Tordesillas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Judge ingrossed all according to the form of Law. The Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was made in form and manner as all Notaries are accustomed to bee, in
such and the like cases. By which means <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> rested very glad,
and well appaid, as if such a Declaration had been of very great moment and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
unto them, and as if their actions and speeches had not apparently shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the difference, and odds that was between the two <hi>Don-Quixotes,</hi> and the two
<hi>Sancho's</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Divers complements, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> many offices and offers of courtesie did mutually enterpasse
between <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> wherein our heroik Knight <hi>de la Mancha</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so much wisedome and such discretion, that he resolved <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> of the doubt
wherein he was: for hee perswaded himself that hee was Enchanted, since with his own
hands he felt and touched two <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> so different and contrary one to another.</p>
                     <p>Mid-day being past, and the heat allayed, they departed from that place all together.
They had not gone above half a league, but they met with two severall paths, the
one led to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Village, and the other to the place where <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was
going.</p>
                     <p>During which little space, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> related at large unto him, the disaster of his
over-throw, the enchantment and the remedy of <hi>Dulcinia.</hi> All which things bred and
caused a new admiration in the minde of <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who kept on his way, and
<hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his.</p>
                     <p>Our Knight passed that night among the Trees, to the end hee might give <hi>Sancho</hi>
means and leisure to fulfill his penance, which hee accomplished even as hee had done
the fore-passed night, more at the charges of the hedges, shrubs, and trees there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then of his back and shoulders: For hee kept them so safe and well, that the lashes
which hee gave himself would not have caused a fly to stir, had shee taken up her stand
there</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thus abused, lost not one stroke with mis-reckoning, and found that
those of the foregoing night, joyned unto these, were just the summe of three thousand
nine and twenty.</p>
                     <p>It seemed the Sunne rose that morning earlier then his wont, to behold this sacrifice,
and they perceiving that it was bright day, went on their Journey, discoursing of the
error wherein <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was, and how they had done very well in taking a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the Judge, and that so authentically.</p>
                     <p>They wandred all that day, and the night succeeding, without encountring any
thing worthy the relation, unlesse it bee, that the very same night <hi>Sancho</hi> finished his
whipping task, to the great contentment of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who greedily longed for
peep of day, to see if in their travels they might meet with his sweet Mistris <hi>Dulcinea,</hi>
who was now dis-enchanted.</p>
                     <p>Thus wandring, they met no woman, but they would approach and close with her,
to take perfect view of her, and to discern whether it were <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently assuring themselves, as of an infallible truth, that the promises of the Prophet
<hi>Merlin</hi> could not possibly prove false.</p>
                     <p>Whilest they were musing on these things, and their longings increasing, they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
ascended a little hillock, whence they discovered their Village. Which <hi>Sancho</hi>
had no sooner perceived, but hee prostrated himself on his knees, and uttered these
words:</p>
                     <p>Oh my dear-dearly-beloved, and long desired native Country, open thine eyes, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54746:286"/>
behold how they Sonne <hi>Sancho</hi> returns at last to thee again; who, if hee bee not very
rich, yet is hee at least very well whipt and lashed. Open thine armes likewise, and
friendly receive thy Son <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> And if he return to thee vanquished by the force
of a strange Arme; hee yet at least returneth conqueror of himself. And as himself
hath often told me, it is the greatest victory that any man can desire or wish for. I have
good store of money; for if they gave me sound whip-lashes, I found much good in
being a worthy Knight.</p>
                     <p>Let us leave these fooleries (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> and forthwith wend unto our Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
where wee will give free passage unto our imaginations and prescribe unto our
selves the form and method that wee are to keep and observe in the rurall or pastorall
life, which wee intend to put in practise. Thus reasoning together, they fair and gently
descended the hillock, and approached to their Village.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ID Hamete</hi> reporteth, That as they were come neer unto the entrance
into their Village <hi>Don Quixote</hi> perceived how in the Commons
thereof there were two yong Lads, who in great anger contested and
disputed together. The one said to the other: <hi>Pierrot,</hi> thou must
not chafe or be angry at it; for, as long as thou livest thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
set thine eyes upon her. Which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> hearing, hee began
this speech unto <hi>Sancho:</hi> Friend (said hee) doest not thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what yonder yong Lad saith? So long as thou livest thou shalt never let eyes
upon her.</p>
                     <p>And what imports (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) what the yong Lad hath spoken? What (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Don Quixote?)</hi> seest thou not, how that applying the words unto mine inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
his meaning is, that I shall never see my <hi>Dulcinea. Sancho</hi> was about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
him, but hee was hindred by an Hare, which chased, crossed their way. Shee was
eagerly pursued by divers Gray-hounds and Hunts-men; so that fearfully amazed shee
squatted down between the feet of Dapple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancho</hi> boldly took her up and presented the same unto <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who cryed
out alowd, <hi>Malum signum, malum signum:</hi> A Hare runnes away, Gray-hounds pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
her, and <hi>Dulcinea</hi> appears not. You are a strange man (then quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> let us
imagine that this Hare is <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and the Gray-hounds which pursue her, the wicked
Enchanters that have transformed her into a Country-Lasse: Shee runnes away, I take
her up and deliver her into your own hands: You hold her in your armes, you hug and
make much of her: What ill-boading may this be? and what misfortune can bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
upon this?</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, the two yong Boyes came neer unto them, to see the Hare: and
<hi>Sancho</hi> demanded of one of them the cause or ground of their brabling controversie?
Then hee who had uttered the words, So long as thou livest, thou shalt never set eyes
upon her, related unto <hi>Sancho,</hi> how that he had taken from the other boy a little cage full
of Crickets, and that hee never purposed to let him have it again. Then <hi>Sancho</hi>
pul'd out of his pocket a peece of six Blanks, and gave it to the other Boy for his Cage,
which hee put into <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> hands, saying thus unto him, Behold, good Sir, all
<pb facs="tcp:54746:287"/>
these fond Sooth-sayings and ill-presages are dasht and overthrown, and have now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe with our Adventures (according to my understanding, although I bee but
a silly gull) no more then with the last yeers snow. And, if my memory fail me not, I
think I have heard the Curate of our Village say, That it fits not good Christians and
wise folks to stand upon such fopperies.</p>
                     <p>It is not long since you told me so your self, vnd gave me to understand, That all
such Christians as plodded and amused themselves upon Augures or Divinations, were
very fools: And therefore let us no longer trouble our selves with them, but let us goe
on and enter into our Village. There whilest the Hunters came in, they demanded to
have their Hare, and <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>Quixote</hi> delivered the same unto them.</p>
                     <p>Then hee and <hi>Sancho</hi> kept on their way; and at the entrance into the Village, in a
little Medow, they met with the Curate and the Bachelor <hi>Carrasco,</hi> who with their Beads
in their hands were saying their prayers.</p>
                     <p>It is to bee understood, that <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> had placed upon Dapple, and upon the
fardell of their weapons, the Jacket or Gaberdine of <hi>Boccasin,</hi> all painted over with
fierie flames, which was upon him in the Dukes Castle, the night that <hi>Altisidora</hi> rose
again from death to life; which Jubb or Jacket served them instead of a Carpet or
Sumpter-cloth.</p>
                     <p>They had likewise placed upon the Asses head, the Miter, whereof wee have spoken
before. It was the newest kinde of transformation, and the fittest decking or array,
that ever Asse did put upon his head.</p>
                     <p>The Curate and the Bachelor knew them incontinently, and with wide-open armes
ranne towards them.</p>

                           </gap>Quixote</hi> alighted presently and very kindely embraced them. But the little
Children who are as sharp-sighted as any Linx, having eyed the Asses Myter, flocked
sodainly about them to see the same, saying the one to the other, Come, come, and run
all you <hi>Camarados,</hi> and you shall see <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi> Asse more brave and gallant then

                     <p>Finally, being environed with a many yong Children, and attended on by the Curate
and Bachelor, they entred the Village, and went directly unto <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>Quixotes</hi> house: At
the dore whereof they met with his Maid-servant, and with his Neece, who had already
heard the news of their comming.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teresa Panca,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Sancho,</hi> had likewise been advertised thereof. She ranne
all dishevelled and half naked to see her Husband, leading her Daughter <hi>Sanchica</hi> by
the hand. But when shee saw that hee was not so richly attired as shee imagined, and
in that equipage a Governor should bee, shee thus began to discourse with him:
My Husband, after what fashion doest thou come home? Me thinks thou
commest on foot, and with toylesome travelling all tyred and faint-hearted:
Thou rather bearest the countenance of a miserable wretch, then of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>Hold thy peace <hi>Teresa</hi> (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) for oftentimes when there bee Boots, there
bee no Spurs: Let us goe unto our house, and there thou shalt heare wonders. So it
is, that I have Money, which is of more consequence, and I have gotten it by mine own
industrie, without doing wrong to any body.</p>
                     <p>Why then you have Money, my good Husband (replyed <hi>Teresa?</hi>) That's very
well. It is no matter how you came by it, bee it by hook or crook: For, after what
manner soever you have laid hands on it, you bring no new custome into the world.
<hi>Sanchica</hi> embraced her Father, and asked him whether hee had brought her any
thing; and that she had as earnestly looked for him, as men doe for dew in the moneth
of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus his Wife holding him by the one hand, and his Daughter by the one side of his
Girdle, and with the other hand leading Dapple, they entred into their Cottage, leaving

                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> without longer delay, at that very instant drew the Bachelour and the
Curate aside, and in few words related his being defeated unto them, and the Vow
which hee had been forced to make, Not to goe out of his Village during the space of
one whole yeere: how his purpose was fully to keep the same, without transgressing
it one jot or attome; since that by the rules of Knight Errantry, and as he was a true
Knight Errant, hee was strictly oblieged to performe it: Which was the reason that
hee had resolved, during the time of that yeer, to become a Sheepheard, and entertain
himself among the Desarts and solitarie places of that Country, where hee might freely
vent out and give scope to his amorous passions, by exercising himself in commendable
and pastorall exercises: And now besought them, if they had no greater affairs in hand,
and were not imployed in matters of more importance, they would both bee pleased to
become his companions and fellow Sheepheards: For hee would buy store of sheep,
and get so sufficient a Flock together, as they might well take upon them the name of
Sheepheards.</p>
                     <p>And in the mean time hee gave them to understand, that the chiefest point of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
was already effected: for hee had already appointed them so proper and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
names, as if they had been cast in a mould.</p>
                     <p>The Curate would needs know these names. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> told him, that himself
would bee called the Sheepheard <hi>Quixotis;</hi> the Bachelor, the Sheepheard <hi>Carrascon;</hi>
and the Curate, the Sheepheard <hi>Curambro;</hi> and as for <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> hee should bee
stiled <hi>Pansino.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were all astonisht at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> new folly: Neverthelesse, that hee might
not another time goe out of his Village, and return to his Kinghthoods and Cavaliers
tricks: and therewithall supposing, that in the space of this yeer hee might bee cured and
recovered; they allowed of his designe and new invention, and in that rurall exercise
offered to become his companions.</p>
                     <p>Wee shall lead a pleasant life (said <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi>) since, as all the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
I am an excellent Poet, and shall every hand-while be composing of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall
Ditties and Eglogues, or else some Verses of the Court, as best shall agree
to our purpose. Thus shall wee entertain our selves by the wayes wee shall passe
and goe.</p>
                     <p>But good Sirs, the thing that is most necessary is, that every one make choyse of the
name of the Sheepheardesse whom hee intendeth to celebrate in his Verses: and that
there bee no Tree, how hard or knurry soever but therein wee shall write, carve, or
engrave her name, even as amorous Sheepheards are accustomed to doe.</p>
                     <p>In good sooth, that will doe passing well (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) albeit I need not go farr to finde out an imaginary Sheepheardesse, since I have the never matched or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled

how hyperbolicall soever it be.</p>
                     <p>It is most true (said the Curate:) But for us, wee must seek out some barren Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesses,

may stead us, if not in the main, yet in the by. Although wee have none (quoth <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Carrasco</hi>)
yet will wee give them those very names as wee see in print, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the world is full. For wee will call them <hi>Phillis, Amarillis, Diana, Florinda, Galathea,</hi>
and <hi>Belisarda.</hi> Since they are publiquely to bee sold in the open Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place,
wee may very well buy them; and lawfully appropriate them unto our

                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> burst out a laughing at the application of these names, whilest the
<pb facs="tcp:54746:288"/>
Curate did infinitely commend and extoll his honourable resolution, and again offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to keep him company all the time that hee could spare, having acquitted himself of
the charge unto which hee was bound.</p>
                     <p>With that they took leave of him, perswading, and intreating him to have a care of
his health, and indevour to bee merry.</p>
                     <p>So it hapned, that his Neece and his Maid-servant heard all the speeches, which
they three had together: And when the Bachelour and the Curate were gone
from him, they both came neer unto <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him.</p>
                     <p>What means this (my Lord, mine Uncle?) Now when we imagined that you would
have continued in your own house, &amp; there live a quiet, a reposed, &amp; honourable life, you
goe about to cast your self head-long into new Labyrinths and troubles, with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Swain or Sheepheard: Verily the corne is already over-hard to make Oaten
pipes of it.</p>
                     <p>But how (quoth the Maid-servant) can you indure and undergoe in the opon fields
the scorching heat of Summer, and the cold and frost of winter nights, and heare the
howlings of Wolves, without quaking for very fear? No truely, for so much as that
belongs only to such as are of a robust and surly complexion, of a hard and rugged skin,
and that from their Cradles are bred and enured to such a Trade and occupation.
If the worst come to the worst, it were better to bee still a Knight Errant, then a
Sheepheard.</p>
                     <p>I beseech you, good my Lord, follow my counsell which I give you, not as being full
of Wine and Bread, but rather fasting, and as one that have fifty yeers upon my head:
Abide still in your house, think on your domestick Affairs, confesse your self often, serve
God, doe good unto the poor, and if any harme come to you of it, let me take it upon
my soul.</p>
                     <p>Good Wenches hold your peace (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi>) for I know what
I have to doe: In the mean while, let me be had to bed; me thinks I am not very
well: yet assure your selves, that whether I bee an Errant Knight, or a Sheepheard,
I will carefully provide for all that you may stand in need of, and you shall see the effects
of it.</p>
                     <p>The Neece and the Maid-servant who without doubt were two merry good Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
laid him in his bed, and attended and lookt so well unto him, as they could not
possibly have done better.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S all humane things being transitory, and not eternall, are ever decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from their beginnings, untill they come unto their last end and
period; but more especially, the lives of men. And as that of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
had no priviledge from Heaven to continue in one estate,
and keep it's course, his end surprized him, at what time hee least
thought of it, I wot not whether it proceeded of the melancholy
which the sad remembrance of his being vanquished caused in him;
or whether the disposition of the Heavens had so decreed: So it is, that a burning Fever
seized upon him, which forced him to keep his bed six dayes. During which time, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
the Bachelor, and the Barber, who were all his good friends, did very often visit
him: and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his good Squire never went from his bed-side.</p>
                     <p>They supposing, that the vexation and fretting which hee felt for having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered;
as also because hee saw not the accomplishment of his desires, touching the
dis-enchantment of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> caused this sicknesse in him, endevoured by all possible
means to make him merry.</p>
                     <p>The Bachelor desired him to bee of good courage, and to rise, that they might begin
their Pastorall exercise, and how hee had already composed an Eglogue, which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
behinde those that <hi>Sanazaro</hi> had compiled: That for the same purpose hee had
bought two goodly and fair Doggs, and of great renown, for to keep their Flock,
whereof the one was called <hi>Barcino</hi> and the other <hi>Butron;</hi> and how a Sheepheard of
<hi>Quintanar</hi> had sold them to him.</p>
                     <p>But for all this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> quitted not his sorrow, nor left off his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>His friends called for a Physician, who was nothing well pleased with his pulse which
hee felt. And therefore hee told him, that whatsoever might happen, hee should not
doe amisse to begin to think on the salvation of his soul; for the health of his body was
in very great danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> without being any whit amazed, did very quietly listen unto this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which neither his Neece, his Maid, nor his Squire did; for they were so deeply
plunged in tears and weeping, as had they seen gastly death in the face, they could have
done no more.</p>
                     <p>The Physician told them plainly, That only melancholy, and his troublesome cares
were the cause of his death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> intreated the company to leave him alone, because hee had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to sleep a while. They did so, and hee had a sound nap (as they say) of six hours,
so that the Maid and his Neece thought hee would never have waked again. Well, hee
waked at last, and with a lowd and audible voyce hee uttered these words: The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God bee for ever blessed, that hath done so much good for me. To bee short,
his mercies have no bounds, they are neither shortned nor hindred by the sinnes of
man.</p>
                     <p>The Neece listned with heedy attention unto her Uncles words, and perceiving that
they were better couched, and wiser disposed then those hee was accustomed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
in all his sicknesses, shee proposed this question unto him: My Lord and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
what is that you say? Is there any new matter befaln? What mercies doe you
speak of? Or what sinnes of men? My good Neece (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
I talk of, are those which God of his goodnesse hath at this instant conferred upon
<pb facs="tcp:54746:289"/>
me wretched sinner, and my sinnes have been no stop or let unto them. I possesse now
a free and cleer judgement, and nothing over-shadowed with the misty clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which the continuall reading and plodding on books of Chivalry had over-cast
me withall.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge all these extravagancies, and confesse them to bee but coozening
tricks; and am agrieved that this disabuse hath hapned so late unto me, as it affords
me no leisure to make amends for my over-sight, by reading of other good books, and
which might serve and tend to the enlightning of my soul. My deer Neece, I feel my
self neer unto death, but I would not have it to bee such, as the sirname of Fool should
rest upon me; for although I have been foolish in my life, I desire not to confirm the
truth of it in my death: And therefore, my dear friend, goe and cause the Curate,
the Bachelor <hi>Samson Carrasco,</hi> and Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber to come immediately
unto me: I desire to confesse my self, and to make my last Will and Testament.
His Neece was eased of this labour, by the comming of them all three, who even
then entred the Chamber, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> no sooner saw them, but said thus unto
them.</p>
                     <p>My good Sirs, give me some new yeers gift, I am no more <hi>Don Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi>
but rather <hi>Alonso Quixano,</hi> unto whom my honest life and civill conversation
hath heretofore appropriated the surname of <hi>Good.</hi> I am now a professed enemy to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis de Gaule,</hi>
&amp; of all the infinite rabble of his race. Now are all the prophane Histories
of Errant Chivalrie hatefull unto me; I now acknowledge my folly, and perceive the
danger whereinto the reading of them hath brought me. But now, by the meer mercy of
my God, become wise at my own proper cost and charges, I utterly abhorr them. When
these three friends heard him speak so, they beleeved undoubtedly that hee was possessed
with some new kinde of foolishnesse. My Lord <hi>Don Quixote</hi> (said <hi>Samson</hi> unto him)
now that the news are come unto us, that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso</hi> is dis-enchanted,
doe you speak in this manner? And now that wee are so neer hand to become Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
that so wee may in singing mirth and jollity lead a kinde of Princely life, doe
you intend to become a Hermite?</p>
                     <p>Hold your peace, I pray you (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) recollect your wits together,
and let us leave all these discourses: That which hitherto served me to my hurt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,
my death, by the assistance of Heaven, shall turn to my good, and redound to
my profit. Good Sirs, I perceive and feel death to follow me at my heels: Let us leave
off and quit all merriments and jesting, and let me have a confessor to shrift me, and
a Notary to draw my last Will and Testament. In the extremity whereunto I
now finde and feel my self, a man must not make a jest of his soule: and therefore
whilest Master Curate is taking of my Confession, let mee have a Scrivener
fetch'd.</p>
                     <p>They stood all gazing one upon another, wondring at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> found reasons,
although they made some doubt to beleeve them. One of the signes which induced them
to conjecture that hee was neer unto deaths door, was, that with such facility hee was
from a stark fool become a wise man: For to the words already alleaged, hee added
many more so significant, so Christian-like, and so well couched, that without doubt
they confidently believed that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was become a right wise man. The Curate
made all those who were in the Chamber to avoid, and being left alone with him, took
his Confession. The Bachelor <hi>Carrasco</hi> went to finde out a Notary, who not long
after came with him, and with <hi>Sancho Panca.</hi> This good Squire having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
from the mouth of the Bachelour, that his Master was in a very bad estate,
and finding his Maid-servant and his Neece weeping very bitterly, began like a
mad-man, with his own fists, to thump and beat himself, and to shead brackish
tears.</p>
                     <p>The Confession being ended, the Curate came forth, and was heard to utter these
words: Verily, verily, hee is at his last gasp, and verily the good <hi>Alonso Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xano</hi>
is become wise, and it is high time for him to make his last will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:54746:289"/>These heavy news opened the sluces of the tears-full and swoln-blubbering eyes of
the Maid, of the Neeces, and of his good Squire <hi>Sancho Pansa;</hi> so that they showred
forth whole fountains of tears, and fetched from the very bottome of their aggrieved
hearts a thousand groaning sighs: For, in effect (as we have already declared else-where)
whilest <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was simply the good <hi>Alonso Quixano,</hi> and likewise when hee
was <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> hee was ever of a milde and affable disposition, and
of a kinde and pleasing conversation: and therefore was hee not only beloved of all
his Houshold, but also of all those that knew him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean space the Notary came, who, after hee had written the beginning of his
Will, and that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had disposed of his soul, with all the circumstances requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and necessary in a true Christian: and that hee was come unto the Legacies, hee
caused this to bee written. <hi>Item,</hi> concerning a certain summe of money which <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi>
who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> I made my Squire, whilest my folly possessed me, hath yet in his custody:
For so much is between him and me there remain certain odd reckonings and accounts
to bee made up, of what hee hath received and laid out: My will and pleasure is, That
hee bee not ty'd to yeeld any account at all, nor bee in any Bond for it: Nay, rather
if any over-plus remain in his hands, having first fully paid and satisfied him of what I
owe and am indebted to him (which is no great matter) my purpose is, That it bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
his own, and much good may it doe him.</p>
                     <p>And as, being then a fool, I was the cause that hee had the Government of an Island
given him, I would to God (now I am wise and in my perfect sences) it were in my
power to give him a Kingdome: for the sincerity of his minde, and the fidelity of his
comportments doe well deserve it. Then addressing himself unto <hi>Sancho,</hi> hee made
this speech unto him: My dear friend, pardon me, that I have given thee occasion to
seem a fool as I was, in making thee to fall into the same error wherein I was faln, that
the world there have been, and still are Errant Knights.</p>
                     <p>Alas and wellady! my good Sir (answered <hi>Sancho</hi> throbbing and weeping) yeeld
not unto death I pray you, but rather follow my counsell, which is, That you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to live many fair yeeres. The greatest folly that any man can commit in
this world, is to give himself over unto death without apparent cause, except
hee bee wilfully slain, or that no other hand bring him to his end but that of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                     <p>Once more I beseech you, suffer not remisnesse or faint-heartednesse to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
you. Rather rise out of your Bed, and let us goe into the fields attired
like Sheepheards, as wee were once resolved to doe. It may come to passe that wee
behinde some Bush or Shrub shall finde the Lady Madame <hi>Dulcinea</hi> dis-enchanted,
so that wee shall have no more businesse. If the vexation or irksomenesse you
feele to have beene vanquished attempt to bring you unto death, let mee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the blame, who will stoutly maintain in all places, and before all men, That
you were overthrown and quelled, because I had not well gyrt your Palfrey <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And you have seen and read in your Books of Chivalry, that it is an ordinary thing
for one Knight to thrust another out of his saddle; And that hee who is to day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
is to morrow a conqueror.</p>
                     <p>It is most true (quoth <hi>Samson</hi>) and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> relates the very truth of such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                     <p>My Sirs (replyed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>) I pray you goe not on so fast, since that in the Nests
of the last yeer there are no Birds of this yeer: Whilome I was a fool, but now I am
wise: Sometimes I was <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> but am now (as I have already
told you) the good <hi>Alonso Quixano.</hi> Let my unfained repentance, and the truth of
what I say, obtain this favour at your courteous hands, that you will have the same
estimation of me now, which you have had heretofore. And so let Master Notary
proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I make and institute my Neece <hi>Antoinette Quixana</hi> (who is here present)
generall Heir of all my goods whatsoever, having first deducted out of them, all that
<pb facs="tcp:54746:290"/>
shall be necessary for the full accomplishment of the Legacies which I have bequeathed:
And the first thing I would have discharged, I purpose, shall bee the wages which I owe
unto my Maid-servant; and that over and besides, shee have twenty Ducats delivered
unto her, to buy her some good clothes withall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I appoint and institute Master Curate, and Master <hi>Samson Carrasco</hi> the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelour

                     <p>

that it bee a man of whom diligent enquiry shall first bee made, that hee is utterly
ignorant of Books of Chivalrie, and that hee never heard speech of them. And if it
should happen, that hee have read them, and that notwithstanding my Neece will, or
take him to her Husband, That shee utterly lose, and never have any thing that I have
bequeathed her as an inheritance, all which my Executors and Assigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> may at their
pleasure as shall seem good unto them, imploy and distribute in pious uses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I intreat the said Executors and Over-seers of my Will, that if by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
they come to the knowledge of the Authour, who is said to have composed an
History which goes from hand to hand, under the Title of <hi>The second part of the heroike
feats of Armes of Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> they shall in my behalf most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
desire him to pardon me; for that I have unawares given them occasion to write
so infinite a number of great extravagancies and idle impertinencies; for so much as I
depart out of this life with this scruple upon my conscience, to have given him subject
and cause to publish them to the world.</p>
                     <p>Hee had no sooner ended his discourse, and signed and sealed his Will and
Testament, but a swouning and faintnesse surprizing him, hee stretched himself
the full length of his Bed. All the company were much distracted and moved
thereat, and ranne presently to help him. And during the space of three dayes, that
hee lived after hee had made his Will, hee did Swoun and fall into Trances almost every
hour.</p>
                     <p>All the house was in a confusion and uproare: All which notwithstanding, the
Neece ceased not to feed very devoutly; the Maid-servant to drink profoundly, and
<hi>Sancho</hi> to live merrily. For when a man is in hope to inherit any thing, that hope doth
deface, or at least moderate in the minde of the inheritor the remembrance or feeling
of the sorrow and grief, which of reason hee should have a feeling of the Testators
death.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the last day of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> came, after hee had received all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and had by many and Godly reasons made demonstration to abhorr all the
Books of Errant Chivalry.</p>
                     <p>The Notary was present at his death, and reporteth how hee had never read or found
in any Book of Chivalrie, that any Errant Knight dyed in his Bed so mildly, so quietly, &amp;
so Christianly, as did <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amidst the wailfull plaints and blubbering tears of the by-standers hee yeelded up
the ghost, that is to say, hee dyed; which the Curate perceiving, hee desired the Notary
to make him an Attestation or Certificate, how <hi>Alonso Quixano,</hi> surnamed the good,
and who was commonly called <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> hee was deceased out
of this life unto another, and dyed of a naturall death: Which Testificate hee
desired, to remove all occasions from some Authors, except <hi>Cid Hamete Benen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli</hi>
falsly to raise him from death again, and write endlesse Histories of his famous
Acts.</p>
                     <p>This was the end of the ingenious Gentleman <hi>de la Mancha,</hi> of whose birth-place
<hi>Cid Hamete</hi> hath not been pleased to declare manifestly the situation unto us, to the end
that all Villages, Towns, Boroughs &amp; Hamlets of <hi>la Mancha</hi> should contest, quarrell, &amp;
dispute among themselves the honour to have produced him, as did the seven Cities of
<hi>Greece</hi> for the love of <hi>Homer:</hi> we have not been willing to make mention and relate in

except some rash, fond-hardy and lewd Historian take thee downe to profane thee.

of my valorous Knight.</p>
                     <p>This fardle is too-too heavy for his weake shoulders, and his dull wit over-cold
and frozen for such an enterprize. And if peradventure thou know him, thou shalt
also advise him to suffer the weary and already rotten bones of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to rest
in his Sepulchre: For, it would bee too great a cruelty, if contrary to all Orders
and Decrees of Death, hee should goe about to make shew of him in Castila the olde,
where in good sooth hee lyeth within a Sepulchre, layd all along, and unable to make
a third journey and a new outrode. It is sufficient to mocke those that so many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Knights have made, that those two whereof hee hath made shew unto the world,
to the generall applause, and universall content of all Peoples and Nations that have
had knowledge of them, as well through the whole Countries of <hi>Spain,</hi> as in all other
forreigne Kingdomes. Thus shalt thou performe what a good Christian is bound to
doe, in giving good counsell to him that wisheth thee evill. As for mee I shall rest
contented and well satisfied to have been the first that fully enjoyed the fruites of his
writings, and that according to my desires; since I never desired any other thing, then
that men would utterly abhore the fabulous impertinent and extravagant Bookes of
Chivalries: And to say truth, by meanes of my true <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they begin already
to stagger; for, undoubtedly such fables and slim-slam tales will shortly faile, and I
hope shall never rise again. Farewell.</p>
