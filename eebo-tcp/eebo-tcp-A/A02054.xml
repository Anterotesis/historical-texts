            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let me haue no need to remember you of that, <hi>Vnum restat,</hi> one thing is wanting, an humbled soule: Thou hast ouercome many corruptions, subdued lustes, qualified infirmities; take heed, least (<hi>Vincenda superbia restat,</hi>) Pride remaynes yet to be ouercome. Hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes others, makes himselfe most contemptible. But, <hi>Quorsum haec?</hi> to what end is this? no such vice cleaues to vs. I would it did not: I would no Starre did enuy the brighter shining of another. But alas, Pride is a subtile insinuating nature, euer conuersant in good thinges: it crept into Paradise; nay, it stoale into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: No sinne is more sawcie, none more bold with God, none lesse welcome: It tooke vp lodging in the <hi>Pharise,</hi> that was so precise in tything, almes, prayer. Many a <hi>Pharise</hi> is proud, that he is not proud: so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile is that temptation of our Aduersary (when a man will be humble) to make him highly conceited of his humilitie; not vnlike the <hi>Cynicke,</hi> that condemned <hi>Plato's</hi> pride, with a worse of his owne. <hi>I thanke God, J am not as others,</hi> sayes that <hi>Pharise:</hi> he was not indeed, but had litle reason to thanke God for it. The emptiest Barrell, makes the loudest sound: Hee that is truly learned, hath learned this, not to boast it. It often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falles such, as it did that Cardinall, who making a shew of bringing much Treasure into the Land, one of his Mules stumbled, &amp; the Port-mantle broake and there was a goodly shew of Mosse, and Straw, and Stones. They that looke so bigge vpon their brethren, were their Cabinet opened, all the great supposed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure within, would appeare to be meere Huskes, Froth, and Ignoraunce. The Sunne excells the Moone in glory; yet both are Starres without emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one of another. The higest Cedar will suffer the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:517:5"/>
lowest Shrubbe to grow vnder it. He that digges the ground, hath his vse in the Garden, as well as he that drawes the Knot. Siluer is Mettall, as well as Gold: and the Beggar may be as good a Subiect as the Lord. <hi>Christ</hi> gaue his life for his Sheepe, as well as for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Shepheardes: Despise not then thy fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, least the Maister of vs all, despise thee.</p>
               <p>This Subiect is set downe indefinitely, <hi>Many</hi>: Whence obserue, that the power of God is heere per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spicuous, that designes a few, to conuert many; nay, one man to haue the charge of a Congregation: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Minister with his Charge, and thinke the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. 1. One man to a multitude. 2. One without pompe, to many mighty, wise, rich, noble. 3. A weake man with a few leaues of Paper, to those that are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a preiudiciall opposition of Nature against it. 4. The Message not promising libertie, ease, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to lustes; but threatning persecution, crosse, rodde, trouble: yet to bind Kinges in Chaines, and Nobles in Fetters of Yron: to recouer the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then from their auncient and nationall Idolatries, and prostrate them to the name of <hi>Jesus</hi>: to make the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard sober, couetous mercifull, malicious charitable; <hi>Hic digitus Dei,</hi> This is the Finger of God. Thus, one <hi>Moses</hi> shall giue preceptes to sixe hundred thousand men, able to beare Armes. One <hi>Peter</hi> conuert three thousand at a Sermon. One Minister (full of weaknes) affect a great congregation, erect, depresse, with either threates or promises; and perswade wild <hi>Japheth</hi> (as tame as a Lamb) into the Tents of <hi>Sem.</hi> Thus a doosen weake Apostles passed once through legions of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, prohibitions of Lawes, menaces of aduersaries, oppositions of flesh, Pride, Religions, Satan, into the Courtes of Kinges, and ouercame them with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. What shall we say? We admire the Conquest of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that with fourty thousand men, subdued

all <hi>Asia</hi>: If his Armie had been greater, his victorie, his glory had been lesse: If he had atchiued it with fewer, we would haue doubted his honour; but if with twelue, deified him. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath; and doth dayly, make greater conquestes with fewer Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, subduing soules (which a greater victorie, then that of bodyes) <hi>sine vt et armis,</hi> without Militarie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines: Yet who apprehendes the immensenes of his power, or admires the deapth of his wisedome?</p>
               <p>Indeed, it is admirable, if any such thing be wrought in these dayes: time was, one Sermon could turne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; now many Sermons cannot turne one: Many thirsty soules haue drunke at one Fountaine, and been satisfied; infinite Fountaines are now open, and none will drinke: They come indeed to <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, but they bring no Pitchers with them, no Fayth, no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, no Conscience; hence their thirst, burning and killing thirst, is not quenched: God hath set open the dores of Mercy, Gospell, Grace, Glory; onely our Heartes are shut vp: wee may as well preach to these materiall Walles, and moue the Seates, as your canteriz'd and nummed consciences. When we haue studied our colour into palenesse, our strength into weaknesse, our bloods to Gelly, and spoake away our spirites into ayre, you are the same still, and your sinnes in the same strength; not a <hi>Mammon, Belial, Melchom,</hi> changes their lodginges, or is vnroosted out of your heartes: You come before the Pulpit, but your Fayth and Conscience is left behind you: Your Clossets, Shoppes, Fieldes; nay, perhappes Tauernes and Tap-houses, plead possession of your affections: and all the Law that comes out of the Chaire of <hi>Moses,</hi> cannot giue the Deuill a <hi>Defeasance.</hi>
