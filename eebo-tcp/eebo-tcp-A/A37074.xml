            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is conceived, that these Proposalls containe the strength of all those Scruples; which the consciencious, and hitherto otherwise wel-affected party towards the Cause of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Reformation, hath taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Engagement: and because it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther just nor conscionable, that any matter <note place="margin">The occasion and induce ment to write this Treatise.</note> should be pressed upon the Conscience of any as a Duty, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by a clear demonstration of the righteousnesse thereof, and a conviction of the judgement therein: nor can it with any probability be conceived, that the Parliament which with so much Pious zeale and vigour, hath opposed the incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Tyranny hitherto; should now intend any pressures upon any, which are not absolutely necessary, or further then they are unavoidably requisite for common safery; therefore it will be very expedient, to endeavour the removing of these Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as of stumbling-blocks out of the way of conscionable men, <note place="margin">The Scope thereof.</note> whose aime is, to seek Peace and Unity in the Truth; and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by a just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proposall, and more faithfull Representation of matters, some equitable satisfaction to these humble Proposals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:39609:3"/>
And to this effect two things shall be weighed without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <note place="margin">The things to be handled therein.</note> and taken into serious consideration: First, what strength of Reason, and strain of Christianity is in these Proposals. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what way may be followed, to bring the mindes of these Proposers into a quiet frame, by the performance of these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they themselves acknowledge to be just, and which to the State will undoubtedly give satisfaction.</p>

            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>SECT. II. <hi>The Summe and Substance of the Proposals briefly, and in order.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Ministers who have made these Proposals, represent first themselves unto us; and then their scruples concerning the Engagement, for which they desire to be excused from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription thereof.</p>
               <p>They represent themselves in reference to that which is past, to that which is present, and to that which is their future resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">In the Proposals.</note> In reference to things past, they have faithfully served the Parliament; they have suffered for the cause thereof in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> I.</note> of just liberty and reformation; and they have adhered to their first Principles unto this day.</p>
               <p>In reference to things present, they are peaceable and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Lawes of the Nation; they endeavour with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and humility to preserve their inward peace, and outward safety; and they finde themselves straightned in conscience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the case of the present Engagement.</p>
               <p>In reference to future Resolutions, they declare that they will behave themselves according to these following Positions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That although they hold themselves still bound by their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> former solemne Covenant and Engagements; yet that they are also convinced, that it is necessary some Civill Government should be maintained in the Land.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they count it agreeable to the will of God, to the light of nature, to the practise of all Christians, to their own principles, and to their former Engagements; to own the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39609:3"/>
of Government, which Gods providence brings upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when he disables one, and inables another, Government to afford protection to the people thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That their owning of the Government will be by living quietly and peaceably in their places and callings under it; and by submitting to such things as are imposed upon, or required of them by the Powers which are in actuall possession; being things in themselves lawfull, &amp; necessary for the preservation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all this may be done without disputing the right and title of those who are in place of Magistracy over them.</p>
               <p>In these things they propose themselves unto us; that we may know what they are, and what their sense is of the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the subjection due thereunto.</p>
               <p>Then in the second place, they propose also what their scruples are, concerning a subscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Engagement, which are of four sorts. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of that which the words in themselves seem to imply &amp; import. 2. Of that where they relate to the violating of former Engagements 3. Of that which is a matter of generall scandall and offence. 4. Of that which may become a snare unto the Subjects, and a prejudice unto the Rulers themselves. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the sense of the words, they scruple at them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they seem to import (say they) things not to be assented unto. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Approbation of the present establishment as effected by a full and free Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Ratification and consent of the people unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Obligation to act, at all times, in all places and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the promoting and strengthening of the Authority.</p>
               <p>Concerning the violation of their former Oathes and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they declare from the words thereof, and the manner of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> taking the same; that such an awfull impression remaines upon their conscience thereby, that except the consistency of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement be made unquestionably clear, with the solemne League and Govenant; that to enter into it will be utterly unlawfull unto them.</p>
               <p>Concerning the matter of Scandall; they say that the taking <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:39609:4"/>
of the Engagement being lookt upon, as an infringement of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Oaths, will blast the whole reputation of their persons, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> of their Ministery, and reflect with more dis-advantage upon the Gospel, then bring advantage to the State: for which cause, they cannot yield to a Subscription thereof: till either by a solemne Debate about it (as of the Covenant) or otherwise; the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Conscience be taken away.</p>
               <p>Concerning the snare laid by Superiours before their Subjects; and the prejudice redounding from thence upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self; it is not offered as a Scruple, but rather as a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7-</note> Consciences.</p>
               <p>From all which premisses, they inferre a conclusion by way of supplication, put up to those that are in present Power, that they may not be compelled, either to draw reproach upon Religion, <note place="margin">

               <p>The Answer will be this; because we are streigthned in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the first Branch.</note> upon the Cases incident to the Engagement, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subscribe it without doubting; which to do, in us would be sin by the Apostles Rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>What is the cause of your doubting?</p>
               <p>The cause of our doubting is, 1. The sense of the Engagement importing things greatly different from that, which we conceive to be our duty in respect of the present establishment. 2. The seeming violation of our former Oaths. 3. And the matter of grievous scandall, which will be given to all sorts of people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel and our persons and ministery therein, if we be counted perjured in our former Oaths; which rather then to suffer, and to make the glorying of our Ministery void, we should resolve to dye.</p>
               <p>For all which reasons (say they) we ought not to subscribe this Engagement; because to our thought, these are the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the sense implyed therein; nor can these inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as to us be removed, except the consistency of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the former Oaths, be made unquestionably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>If the Reason of the second assertion be asked of them, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch.</note> Why the Rulers of the State ought not to punish them for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subscription? The Answer will be this; because Governours though in highest Authority, are bound to avoid the laying of snares and stumbling-blocks in the way of their brethren: and if these that are over us now, should do as our former Governours did, to impose ensnaring Oaths upon godly people, and enforce their subscriptions thereunto; tbey may by that meanes in the beginning of their Government, lay the unhappy foundations of ensuing troubles, to themselves and thir people; as King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> and the Bishops in former times have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:39609:5"/>
And then another reason why the Subscription ought not to be enforced with a punishment; is because the professed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and resolutions of these that are in present power are to have respect to tender consciences, which in this case would not be rogarded; if without considerations of these scruples, a punishment should be inflicted upon the non-subscribers of the Engagement.</p>
               <p>And if it be objected: but what assurance can the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the State have of the non-subscribers peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation? The Answer is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the many years experience of the good behaviour, and faithfull service of the Non-subscribers ought to be taken as a better security for their peaceable disposition, then a fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed subscription which many yield unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they plead for a forbearance from Subscription on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till by a solemne debate, or otherwise; their conscince shall be cleared of their important scruples.</p>
               <p>If lastly, the reason of the third assertion be asked. <hi>viz.</hi> Why ought you to have the benefit of the Law, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to that effect, though you subscribe not to be true and <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the third Branch.</note> faithfull to the Common-wealth? The Answer will be this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because we have been faithfull all along to the Parliament, till now of late these stumbling-blocks are come in our way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because we have been sufferers with you, and as much as any in the cause of liberty and Reformation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because we adhere still to our first principles upon which you did undertake to give us protection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because we do promise to maintain the Peace of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to pay obedience to the Lawes thereof, whereof we crave the benefit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And because notwithstanding all our former Oaths and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; yet we acknowledge not onely the necessity of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Government in generall, for the preservation of humane so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the prevention of out-rages which wicked men unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained would do to those that are peaceable; but we consider also in particular, this Government which Gods providence hath set up over us, to be that under which we ought to live quietly and peaceably in our Callings; and to which we will submit in

                  <pb facs="tcp:39609:6"/>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:39609:6"/>
all things law full and necessary for common safety, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Right and Title, by which it standeth; and seeing this is the duty, which we are willing to performe, we crave the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection due to such as behave themselves after this manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we subscribe not that Engagement, which we conceive is greatly different from the tenor of these duties.</p>
               <p>This may be conceived to be the full strength and Rationality of their Plea: whereunto what by way of answer may be said; shall afterwards distinctly appear in the Re-proposals, and in the discovery of the way of satisfaction, to be given hereunto.</p>

to wound the Authority of their Rulers with all; then to brand their publick Consultations, and the designes which they have for common safety; with the-Character which is given in <hi>Psal</hi> 64. 5. to persecuting wicked Atheists, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>But if any of themselves should have put forth these their own Proposals; with these high commendations of themselves; and with so much despite against their Superiours, to whom they seeme willing to be humble sutors for a favour; then it may be judged not onely indiscretion and vanity; but malicious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie (even against the very matter and scope of their own Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals) in him (whosoever he is) that hath thus done it. For if this stinging expression <hi>(that they commune of laying of Snares privily)</hi> be the true meaning of the Proposers of these matters; and their positive judgement of the way of those to whom they offer their Proposals; it is apparent, that by the publishing thereof, they have none other aime, but under a faire pretence of Reason and Humility; to commend themselves unto the discontented mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as learned and pious Divines; and under that notion, to foment in the popular weak apprehensions, the plausible prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the change of publick affaires hath begotten against the persons and the proceedings of their Governours: which to cover, strengthen, and insinuate under a Cloak of Religiousness, and a colour of straitness of Conscience, is as far from the truth of Christianity, as that which to God and Men is most abominable and hatefull.</p>

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>First, We have taken and subscribed this Engagement; because we hold our selves still bound, by our former solemn Covenants and Engagements, (as taken by us in that sense, which their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words do undoubtedly declare; which is most clearly suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their main ends of publick Peace and Safety; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is at this time possible and lawfull for us to observe them)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39609:8"/>
to uphold the grounds of Civill Government in this Land; for the preservation of humane society, and prevention of all those evills, which the outrages of wicked men un-restrained would produce therein; which is the whole effect of this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Upon mature deliberation we did perceive; that <note place="margin">2. <hi>Because God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, the Government of this State, from a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to a Common-Wealth, whereunto obedience is due.</hi>
                  </note> the wise and holy Providence of God, (whose judgements are unsearchable, and wayes past finding out) hath at this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst and beyond all mens former thoughts and expectations, shaken the foundations of this State, as it was a Kingdom, and disabled that way of Government and all that depends thereon, from affording any protection and preservation to any of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Land; and hath inabled another forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to afford it; Wherefore we did conclude from the light of nature; from the judgement of the Learned; from the practise of Christians in former ages; from our own Principles; and from our former Engagements; that it was the will of God, we should quietly and peaceably set our selves in our places and callings, to live under this Government; and to submit to it, in such things as are imposed upon, or required of us, by the Powers which are in actuall possession; being things in themselves lawfull and necessary, or expedient to the preservation of our selves and others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because although we found others making a question <note place="margin">3. <hi>Because obedience is due to the publick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without disputing their title.</hi>
                  </note> of the way, how those who governe at present are come to the helme; yet we conceived that in this case of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we were bound without disputing the right or title of those that are in place of Magistracy; to declare our willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be true and faithfull to the Common-wealth of this Nation, which now doth stand without a King, and House of Lords: because we found this clear duty included in the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">4. <hi>Because the words of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted then as they contain a clear duty.</hi>
                  </note> sense thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because we clearly conceive, that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at all between the submission which the Authours of the Proposals themselves rightly acknowledge to be due to the Powers, which are in actuall possession, and that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the subscription to this Engagement: for seeing the expresse words of the Engagement give no ground, to interpret
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39609:8"/>
the Act of subscription, beyond that which is a clear and known duty: therefore we think it not (as to our Consciences) war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to interpret it otherwise; but we rather think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a known duty, to make of a thing in it self lawful and necessary at this time, any scrupulous interpretation beyond what the words import; or to suspend obedience from a duty, upon the conjecture of something which may be thought unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <note place="margin">And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull.</note> when that which is to our Conscience a known duty is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: Upon which ground we declare, that we trouble not our selves, nor do we think it lawfull to stagger others in their thoughts; with the inferences which the Proposers make upon the Subscription of the Engagement, with Reference to these <hi>Queries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As how far it doth imply an approbation of the manner of the present Establishment; Whether as effected by a full and free Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority yea or no? whether yea or no, it doth imply an active Concurrence, and a ratifying consent of the People thereunto, further then what hath been already acknowledged to be due to the Powers in actual possession; by all that are in subjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and depend upon their protection? and whether yea or no, and how far it fastens an obligation to act to the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and promoting of the Government, which is at present, or may be hereafter established by the advantage of possible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? we say, that to trouble our own, or other mens weaker Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, with these or such like doubtfull Conjectures to colour the suspension of our own, or occasion the aversion of other mens affections from yielding obedience to a clear and confessed <note place="margin">Reasons why none should interpret the Engagement as the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers do.</note> duty, is not onely preposterous and contrary to the aime of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breaches, and of advancing a publick good in this time of distraction; but inconsistent (as to our reason) with the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaning of the words, which are to be subscribed, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing (as to our affections) with the Charity due, no lesse to superiours, then to other men, which is not to think evill when good may be thought of them. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</note> And lastly, it is opposite (as to our spirits) unto that wisdom which is from above (the Rule of our walking) teaching us, to have pure and peaceable thoughts in all our actings; to perform duties in Godly simplicity, and without worldly wisdom; to be <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</note>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39609:9"/>

               </p>
               <p>And upon these principles of true wisdom (which we humbly conceive are not laid to heart, by our Brethren in the third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of their Proposals) we professedly wave all those scruples and the stumbling-blocks, which they have laid to themselves, and wherewith they have puzled others, upon this clear Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; that whenever the consideration of these things, which are said to be implyed in the Subscription (which we see not) shall come before us, to be circumstantially considered for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of others, or the clearing of our own way; we then shall be most ready to declare our sence therein, according to known principles and the circumstances, which God shall offer; but in the mean time we think it answerable to the Duty of Christianity, that we should acquiesce in this plain and generall Resolution; that whatsoever hereafter shall appear to us in any of these doubtfull Cases to be a truth, or a duty; to be asserted or performed, for the good of the Common-wealth (under what forme, or without what forme soever we find it established) we shall hold forth the same freely in word and deed towards all, behaving our selves therein accordingly in a peaceable manner. Because to do otherwise, we think it so far from following a known Rule of Christianity in uprightness and simplicity, that it tends to nothing else but a prejudicate forestallment of our own and other mens thoughts, by the laying of snares and stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks before them.</p>
               <p>The thing then which we re-propose to our Brethrer is this.</p>
               <p>That as we ingenuously conceive, there is no difference at all between the things which they themselves have mentioned to <note place="margin">An Answer to the 3. Sect. of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, by way of Reproposal.</note> be duties of Subjects to Superiours, and the Subscription required by the present Authority to the obvious sence of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So we say to that which they call a difference, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Subscription, it is free for us in Conscience to think differently of the manner of the Establishment, according to that which our judgement and light doth or shall dictate unto us in reference to changeable circumstances, if onely at all times, and in all circumstances however changeable; we engage
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39609:9"/>
our truth and faithfulness towards the publick good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth under the same: whence we do acknowledge, that upon this Engagement these consequences will follow, as to our Consciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That we are bound to approve of the present establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so far as the manifestation of our truth and faithfulness to the Common-wealth, doth oblige us in our places to follow qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly our own Callings, whether the Authority over us be full and free or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> That we ought not to suspend and denie our active concurrence and ratifying consent to any thing which in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent establishment shall be offered and found lawfull and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for common safety; being offered to us by the Authority which is, especially because it is declared, that the Originall of all just power is in the People: therefore conceiving that our consent is required hereunto, (as being some of the People) we judge it our duty in this sense to give it; least we become accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the causes of disturbing our present peace or future settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we ought to be obliged in things lawfull, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and expedient for common safety to act at all times, in all places and capacities, to the promoting and strengthening of the Establishment which Gods providence hath set over us, and he hath inabled to afford us just protection.</p>
               <p>And seeing by this Engagement, we think not our selves bound up by any words expressed therein; to the particulars: <hi>(Of a full and free Authority; of the consent of the people; and of the strengthening of another establishment, which may set it self up, &amp;c.)</hi> implyed and mentioned in the Proposals: but meane to declare by our subscription, thus farre only as we have said, our <hi>approbation of,</hi> our <hi>ratefying consent unto,</hi> and our <hi>obligation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> the present establishment: therefore we conceive not that we do violate any of our former Oaths, Protestations or solemne League and Covenant, whereunto by the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <note place="margin">Re-prosall to the 4.

               <p>Nor is there now (to our understanding) any parity of reason; in that which we at this time do, to that which would have been if we had done the like in time past: for although it would have been undoubtedly inconsistent with our Covenant at that time; when King, Lords and Commons made up a Parliament, to have subscribed any Engagement to the King &amp; Lords (if it should by their Agreement &amp; Authority have been required of us) without the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> because the Covenant did expresly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate the relation which we had to the King and Lords, unto the relation which we had to the Common-wealth, yet now it

cannot be understood to be inconsistent with the tenor there of (when there is no King nor House of Lords in being) to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them engaged to the Common-wealth: because we never understood our selves otherwise engaged, nor could we justly by any Covenant or Oath whatsoever be otherwise engaged to them; but in order to the Common-wealth, and as they were true and faithfull to the same.

               <p>We shall desire alwayes with our Brethren, and we hope no lesse then they, to keep in mind the noble resolution of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle; who would not in case of scandall use his own just power, <note place="margin">And relating to Pauls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</note> but chose freely to suffer all outward inconveniences to himselfe, rather then to hinder the Gospell of Christ; concluding that it

               <p>We shall therefore again say with the Proposers in our Case; that upon these and such like grounds purely consciencious, and <note place="margin">And to the grounds of conscience,</note> not out of any private interest or design; but for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our affection towards the peace of this Common-wealth we were not necessitated to forbear; but were free to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Subscription, which was required of us.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>It is a sad thing to consider, how far some men, who want not parts; and who undoubtedly are truly Godly for the main; are led sometimes (in the agitation of the affaires, wherein a party which they do affect is in<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But supposing as I ought to do, that in these Proposers there is nothing under the deck; but that in this modest and dis-creet way, the plaine truth and all the truth of their grievances, at the subscription is represented above board; I shall now point at the means, which in a faire Treatie, I conceive may produce unto them so much satisfaction, as in equity they can desire; That they may have cause to deale ingenuously, either by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39609:14"/>
of that which is offered, if it may be procured, or by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting against it, if it seem not satisfactory; in which last case, I think it would be fair dealing in them, not only to alleadge their reasons, why they are not satisfied with what shall be offered; but also to make their own demands, wherein at least they will rest satisfied; for to lye only at the word of excepting, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable posture in treating between two equals, when both are alike concerned in a matter of difference, far more then it is unreasonable when Subjects by a Treaty make their application toward Superiours, and seek to gaine the favour of some equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table satisfaction from them in a matter of such concernment; which imports no lesse then either the losse or the assurance of all their outward protection and safety.</p>
               <p>And seeing to stand alwayes on the excepting, and not at all on the offering or accepting hand, is a frame of spirit not onely unfriendly amongst the Members of the same Communalty, but altogether unsutable to the profession of Christianity; and also most of all unbecoming the worke of the Ministery, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the wayes of peace and mutuall confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst brethren; therefore, I shall not be so injurious as to suspect any of them of any unwillingnesse to treat in a faire way; nor shall I imagine, that any sinistrous designe is hatched by the matter, and the proposing of these Proposals in the mind of a discontented party, to strengthen the captions, carping, peevish, and excepting humour of the times. I say, I shall not suspect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such thing, although to a jealous eye; the matter thereof compared with the aime therein, and the covered close way of dispersing the same amongst the doubtfull multitude; and at a time whiles petitions to gaine delayes, and respit for further resolutions, are presented to Superiours, may look somewhat suspitiously. Yet (I say) for all this I shall not suspect that any designe contrary to peaceablenesse, is fomented thereby in the affections of any: nor shall I wish, that upon the appearance of such a cause of jealousie any strictnesse should be used in the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of this businesse; But I shall rather pray, perswade and exhort, that on both sides, the open carriage of all matters, as in the presence of God, may take away or prevent as well the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of subtile contrivances on the one hand, as the surmises
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39609:14"/>
thereof on the other: for both these equally blast the hopes of unity, and the grounds of amiable confidence in all men who are at a distance one from another; for which cause I shall be a most humble sutor towards all sides, that on all hands, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a friendly Treaty may be set afoot, and chearfully assented unto; but that whiles matters of just scruple are taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, therein to be resolved by known and predetermined <note place="margin">Why matter of duty should not be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded during <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 word">

If therefore this ground can be laid and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto, that whatever we shall agree upon to be a clear and undeniable duty in Christianity or Morality, shall be practised for it selfe, not withstanding all other differences or defects fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in among us, and that in the disquisition of matters we shall proceed alwayes first to determine that wherein we fully agree, before we mention matters of dis-agreement; I am confident that we shall finde so much cause of satisfaction and assurance in each others resolutions and engagements of that kind, that the different apprehensions of matters which now seem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream; and through our mutuall mistrustings of each other, are like to be the utter ruine of both, will be found very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and such as will be wholly swallowed up by the grounds of mutuall assurance which naturally results from every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Engagement, to practise things wherein there is a full agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between parties; for the not doing (as I said before) of that which in our places we should do with singlenesse of heart,

               </p>
               <p>First let matters of agreement be proposed, understood and ratified, in things Positive and Negative.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let there be a professed Engagement, to practise that which is answerable unto their Agreements, and tending undoubtedly to edification between them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let matters of disagreement both positive and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative be thought upon with these two cautions premised to prevent a breach.</p>
               <p>First, That no disagreement in Judgement or practise, shall make void the Dutifull Engagement, to follow joyntly the matters of Agreement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That to take away the offences, which may arise upon the differences of opinions and practises, some Rules are to be pre-determined; whereby contentious debates about the same may be prevented, and whereby the right use of Christian, of Morall and of Rationall freedom therein may be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>If therefore those Pious and Learned Brethren, whose scruples against the Engagement, being thus proposed, have a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the minds of others, to make them scrupulous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected at it: if (I say they would condescend to the Overture of such a Treatie, (which hither to some have not been willing to do) I am very confident through the blessing of Christ, that an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient would easily be found to settle their doubtfull thoughts; and so to make all others willing to yield unto their Superiours,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39609:15"/>
that ground of just assurance and acquiescence, for which the Engagement by them proposed, is requisite.</p>
               <p>And this is the course, by which those that are ingenuous may receive satisfaction, if they seek it as they ought; but if any doth scruple more through Policie then Pietie, this course will not <note place="margin">But in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing With men of Policie th<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> course will not take.</note> be liked of, because it will crosse their design; which is, to keepe the minds of the weaker sort in a staggering condition, that they may not close to any settlement; but lye open to all manner of changes: I shall not charge any of the Authors of these Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals with any such designe; yet I cannot absolve all of them from it; for I may as lawfully suspect them in this matter as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Why the scruplers may be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected though not charged with Policie.</note> matter I may do mine own heart, whereof although I know none evill; yet I shall do my self no injury, to say, that yet there may be some mixture of deceitfulnesse in it, when I thinke my meaning is at the best; For the Apostle himself would not take upon him to justifie himself in all things. <hi>I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by my self, yet I am not thereby justifie; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</hi> So I may without offence say, of the Proposers of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.</note> these scruples, that although I know nothing by them, but judge charitably that their scruples as to them are truely conscientious yet I must also say, that thereby they are not justified from the mixture of collaterall designes; but that it is the Lord who will judge them. The maine of the businesse may be truly a doubt of Conscience; and yet the managing of it, in the hands of some may be somewhat else; nor do I wrong the Christian charity which I owe to all or any of them in this; because it is lawfull for me to be jealous over them with godly jealousie lest by any meanes, as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> by his subtilty: so their minds should be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</note> And truly to look but upon the matter it self, by comparing the former and latter parts of the proposals together, a doubt may be made thus; that seeing the maine scruple where at they stick, is not so much against the Duty expressed in the words of the Engagement; which is, <hi>to be true and faithfull,</hi> or against the Object of the Duty considered in it self, which is <hi>this Common-Wealth:</hi> or against the immediare qualifications of the Object and of the Duty; which are, <hi>as it is now established without a King and House of Lords,</hi> which are acknowledged to be the effects of Gods Providence; but onely against the act of subscribing to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39609:16"/>
whole, in reference to some State-considerations and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following thereupon; which tend to nothing else, but to suspend the minds of men, and take them off from the regular performance of a present Duty, by the conjectural apprehensions of doubtfull inconveniences which may ensue as to the State. Therefore it is not without a rationall ground of jealousie; that although the matters proposed, may be reall scruples of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and rationally reflected upon by some without prejudice; yet that in this proposing of them, as to the disposition of the matter, to fetch about this form of speech, the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> may also have been in it, for some selfe-interest of State. <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this may be thought the more likely to be true, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve two things. First, that the words of this Engagement (which are scrupled at, and said to be contrary to former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and the duties mentioned in the second <hi>Sect.)</hi> are not at all once alleadged; to shew distinctly, wherein the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned contrariety doth stand; but the objection is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly against the Act of subscribing to the words, according to that prejudice which the vulgar hath taken up against them in a generall notion. Herein then the subtilty of the Policy doth lye: that the matter should be couched in such a way, as doth most commodiously favour that notion, and strengthen it: which in men of learning, conscience and piety, feeking a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of doubts, doth not seem to be faire and plaine dealing, and therefore may be thought to have somewhat of a Collaterall designe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may observe also, that if the thing clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in the second <hi>Sect.</hi> of the Proposals to be a known duty, had been really intended, and resolved upon to have been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised at this time no lesse then in generall termes acknowledged to be a thing at some time lawfully practicable; there would not have been any inclination to do two things which here are done; not without some contrivance. First, the performance of duties confessed to be due to such Superiours, as are in places over us, and by a people in our case under them, would not have been <hi>per indirectum</hi> denied to be due by us unto them. Secondly, the words of the Engagement upon which the whole stresse of the scruple is said to lye; and for which that which is confessed to be due to others is denyed to our Superiour Powers, would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39609:16"/>
not have been suppressed, and left in the dark as they are; but clearly mentioned and alleadged as they are not, lest the falacy of the pretended scruple should appear. For if the duty acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in <hi>Thesi,</hi> had been applied to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, and the duty required in the words of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement had been compared therewith, the pretended matter of scruple, would by the full agreement of the one with the other, havebeen found apparently impertinent: but it may be conceived, that the matter is laid thus before the pre-possessed Reader, or weak discerner of such contrivances; to the end, that upon a full acknowledgement of a just duty, and a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to perform the same, in a case like to ours, the iniquity of that which is supposed to be required of us, by the Engagement; may be heightened in mens apprehensions, who are easily swayed to receive the worst impressions of those that are in places of power over them: by how much then they seem to yield to a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall duty, and be of an equitable disposition towards their Superiours, by so much they prevaticate against the intention of the Engagement to make it to be thought altogether contrary to reason and to justice; by a slye concealing of the words, and a suspitious interpretation thereof, suggested, as containing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters very far different from the acknowledged duty, and wholly opposite to former Engagements. Whereas in truth and deed, there is no such thing aimed at by the Engagement, nor implyed in the words thereof. So that from the third paragraphe of the Proposals to the end thereof; the whole matter and contrivance of the discourse may be thought (and yet without doing inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Authours) nothing else but a Politicall Stratagem and Sophisme grounded upon the mis-application and mis-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Engagement and Covenant, to entangle weake and <note place="margin">And how their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of this nature are to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the generall.</note> undiscorning consciences; and to keep up the spirit of dis-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the mindes of the multitude under the pretence of scruples of that kind.</p>
               <p>The thing then to be offered to obviate the deceit of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall contrivance of the bosinesse, and to give satisfaction (if it can be admitted) to this politicall scrupulosity of conscience is this: that the words of the Engagement in their plain sense; which imports a clear duty, are to be confronted with that which in the second <hi>Sect.</hi> they confesse to be consonant with the will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39609:17"/>
of God, with the light of nature, with the judgement of the Learned, with the practise of former Christians, and with their own principles and former Engagements: and then if the Duty mentioned in the Engagement doth run wholly parallell, as the case now stands with us, to that which they yield to be a Duty as they State the case in generall themselves; then they should be made to reflect upon themselves, that they ought to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this; that by taking the Engagement, nothing is farther required of them then what they proclaime themselves, to be a performable duty in such a case. But if their Politicall contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of the meaning of the Engagement, through the sinister prospectives &amp; jealousies which they take up, and foment against their Superiours, by an uncharitable mis-construction of their aimes; will not suffer them to acquiesce in this parallelisme of the Engagement, with what they acknowledge to be lawfull; then a further course may be taken, and shall be offered unto them, if they will intend to bring matters to a faire tryall and issue, and that is this: that the consequences, which they say are implyed in the words of the Engagement, may be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and examined in three respects. <note place="margin">And also in particulars.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, How far the words of the Engagement, do import in the ordinary acception by an indifferent Judge, any such matters, as they say are implyed therein.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How far, if the words should import any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in any sense, the performance of the Engagement in that sense, is agreeable with the Duties mentioned by themselves in the 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> performable by Subjects towards their Superiours, in the case they are supposed and wherein now we are.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How far the Covenant and former Engagements, wil be contradictory or not contradictory to this Engagement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the consequences here said to be implyed therein, should be granted to follow thereon.</p>
               <p>In all which matters, if upon known grounds and principles of Christianity and Rationality, a regular way of disquiry may be followed, as it becometh Divines within their bounds, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Conscience, modestly, and not as it becometh States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in reference to interests, suspiciously, and if they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to stand or fall to the issue of that disquiry; I dare in the fear of God, undertake to let them see satisfactory grounds,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39609:17"/>
whereby their scruples will be cleared, and wherein consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Consciences ought to acquiesce, if they will not subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the inclinations thereof, to an affected scrupulosity for the love of a party. For that all this contrivance of the Proposals, is like unto the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> in the mouth of the woman of <hi>Tekoah;</hi> to bring about a designe, rather then to receive a single-hearted satisfaction for themselves; is neither irrational to think, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</note> to say, but just and equitable in prudencie to suspect: and here we have a clear example of a smooth and handsome conveyance of a State-business, under a ministerial cloak and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religiousness, not in, but out of the Pulpit; which is one of the things which in another larger Treatise, I have shewed to be one of the main causes of our present distempers and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; namely, when Ministers meddle with State-matters, either in their Pulpits a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> were authoritatively, or out of the same more subtilly in such a way, and to such a purpose as this; therefore to rectifie the fundamentall error of the aime and design of these Proposalls, as to State-Matters, let me referre the ingenuous Reader, but especially these Learned and Pious Divines, to an unprejudicat perusall of that Treatise; wherein if any shall show me, that I have wronged the profession, or unjustly taxed the practise of some, or mistaken my way in seeking Peace &amp; Truth, to heale our present breaches; I shall professe my self to be very much beholding to him. Upon this whole matter then I shall professe thus much; that although I thus trace in the Spirits of these Proposers by the matter and contrivance of their Proposals such an inclination to meddle in State-affairs, which is unsutable to their Calling; yet that I have no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against them in my heart for so doing, nor do I intend, to fasten upon them any charge of false and fained pretences of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scrupled, otherwise then indeed they are (for I believe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they are thus scrupled, and puzzeled in Conscience about their own imaginations concerning State-matters, rather through weaknesse and custome, and want of a Rule to discern the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own spirits, then through any set aime, to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the management of State-Matters) but I look upon them, as the frame of their thoughts represents it self and them by their way unto me; whereof I have discovered the Rationali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Christianity and the Policie, to shew, that in all respects
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39609:18"/>
satisfaction may be given them, if they desire it ingenuously; and that if their spirit by the deceitfulness of error is led forth unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly, in another way then they ought to walk in, that that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so can be discovered; for there is nothing hid but it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: and being revealed, a Rule may be found to rectifie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is amisse therein. I shall therefore for mine own part, not refuse (if they will needs insist upon their Politicall scruple, and thinke that their Consciences ought to be engaged, into those State-considerations) to deale with them upon their inferences from the words of the Engagement, which is their own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon onely with this caution; that we shall not take opon us to become such absolute Judges, of the wayes of those that are in places of Magistracy, as to make our own interpretation of their wayes a Rule of all obedientiall dutifulnes in our selves or other Subjects, to bind thereunto as to a Law, our <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
