         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE troubles whereunto God bringeth his Ministers and
People, though they be many and Great, yet are they not
more, and greater, then the comforts which He affordeth
unto them, to support and encourage them in their troubles. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
this Chapter, and the Sermon of Christ therein recorded,
concerning those sore Trials whereunto his Church and Children
should be brought. As any kind of affliction is foretold, a proper
and peculiar consolation is usually annexed. Therefore to establish
the hearts of his suffering Servants, and to encourage their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courers,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55174:3"/>
He closes up His Sermon with the words of the text,
wherein He declareth not only that high account which he had of
His Ministers, and People themselves, but also of them who
should yield any relief, of upon His account shew kindness to them,
assuring them; <hi>That he who receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
should receive a Prophets reward.</hi> And <hi>he that receiveth a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man in the name of a righteous man, should receive a righteous
mans reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words in brief contain, A <hi>Declaration of that great benefit,
which they bring to themselves, who afford any relief, and succour to
Ministers, or other Saints;</hi> teaching, <hi>That there is no such way to
fill our Treasures, as by emptying them for God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, the clearing of the words, I shall breifly shew you,
<list>
                  <item>1. Who is here meant by a <hi>Prophet.</hi> And who by a <hi>Righteous
man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What is meant by <hi>receiving</hi> them.</item>
                  <item>3. What is the <hi>Reward</hi> which followeth thereupon.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. For the first, who is here meant by a <hi>Prophet;</hi> and who by a
<hi>Righteous</hi> man.</p>
            <p>By a <hi>Prophet</hi> our Saviour here meaneth not onely extraordinary
Ministers, such as were immediatly and extraordinarily inspired
by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> or who had extraordinary revelations to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
things to come: but also ordinary Ministers of the word, and
interpreters of the Scriptures, as <hi>Ioh. 4. 44. Rev.</hi> 11. 18.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Righteous men</hi> he meaneth his <hi>Saints,</hi> or such as testifie their
justification thorow faith in Christ, by their sanctification, and fruits
of a good conscience, whom commonly the Scripture stileth <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. For the Second, what is meant by <hi>receiving these?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer thereunto, you must know, There are two things
whereunto this receiving may have a respect.</p>
            <p>1. To the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>message</hi> of a Minister, and so it signifies, the
hearkning to, and embracing their holy Counsel and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>2. To the <hi>Person</hi> of a Minister, and so it signifies the harbouring,
or shewing kindness to Him, as is evident from the instance of <hi>cold
water,</hi> given unto a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Righteous man,</hi> expressed in the
following verse. Both these are implyed under this phrase of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a Prophet,</hi> viz. His <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by embracing, and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to it: and his <hi>Person,</hi> by harbouring, succouring, and reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him according to his need.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55174:3"/>
               <hi>By the receiving a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet,</hi> is meant a
a succouring and relieving him <hi>for his particular calling sake, eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
because he is a Prophet. So <hi>by receiving a righteous man, in
the name of a righteous man,</hi> intendeth the same thing; namely, the
relieving him, <hi>for his General</hi> callings sake, because he is a Christian
a child of God, and a member of Christ.</p>
            <p>III. For the third particular, what is here meant by <hi>the reward of
a Prophet, and of a righteous man?</hi> I Answer, These phrases of
<hi>receiving a Prophets, and of a Righteous mans reward,</hi> may be taken
<hi>Actively,</hi> or <hi>Passively. Actively,</hi> for that reward which a <hi>Prophet</hi>
or a <hi>righteous man</hi> giveth. <hi>Passively,</hi> for that which is by God given
to the one, and to the other. <hi>The reward which a Prophet giveth,</hi> is
ministerially to preach the word of Reconciliation to such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10. 34. &amp;c. To pray for
them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Abimeleck, Gen.</hi> 20. 7, 17, And to bless them,
as <hi>Melchisedec</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 19.</p>
            <p>The reward which a righteous man giveth is privately to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
and edifie, to pray for, and to be a good pattern, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of righteousness, to such as entertain or otherwise relieve
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The reward which is given by God,</hi> to either of these, for that
kindness which any shew unto them, is such a surpassing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
weight of glory, as cannot be expressed by the tongue of
men, or Angels, yet different in degrees, as is evident, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
            <p>Some take these phrases, <hi>Of receiving a Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>righteous
mans reward,</hi> in the former sense, <hi>Actively;</hi> and others, <hi>Passively.</hi>
I conceive it may be taken in both.</p>
            <p>The words thus explained do afford unto us several points of
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>From the duty here expressed of receiving, and relieving <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
and <hi>righteous men,</hi> with the manner of setting it down, we
may observe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Doct.</hi> That all needful succour, and good entertainment is to
be afforded to Ministers of the Gospel. <hi>This is the main and
principal point intended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Christian kindness is to be shewed not only to Ministers,
but also to all the members of Christ. <hi>For our blessed Saviour
contents not himself to have mentioned a</hi> Prophet, <hi>but also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>
a righteous man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55174:4"/>
These two sorts make up <hi>The household of Faith;</hi> to whom the
Apostle exhorteth Christians <hi>especially</hi> to doe good, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <p>Q. Is our Charity to extend no farther?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, even to all that are in want, but <hi>especially</hi> to such as
have a particular relation to Christ, as being his members, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
because Christ in them is after an especial manner succour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and relieved. It will be therefore our wisdom to take notice
of the extent of this duty, and in all we doe, either for Christians
or others, to see to it, that what we doe, is done for the Lords,
and for conscience-sake, to the one in compassion to his members,
to the other in obedience to his will.</p>
            <p>4. Doct. <hi>According to the kindness which we shew, shall our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be.</hi> He that receiveth, and relieveth a <hi>Prophet,</hi> shall receive
a <hi>Prophets reward.</hi> And he that receiveth and relieveth a <hi>righteous
man,</hi> shall receive <hi>the reward of a righteous man.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Verse 42.</bibl>
               <p>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
ones, a cup of cold water onely in the name of a Disciple, he
shall in no wise lose his reward.</p>
            </q>
            <p>These words are added by our Saviour to the former to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
some Objections, which might be made thereupon, as also
more fully to explain the forementioned points.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Obj.</hi> May be thus made, These Preachers and Professors of the
Gospel are but mean persons, and little in esteem, what great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
can be expected for entertaining them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As little as they be, be they as inconsiderable and contemptible
as the proud world make them, yet are they not so little in the eyes of
Lord, but that he will reward all such as are friendly to them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> I my self am but poor, and can doe but little for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Though thy kindness be never so small, as small as a <hi>cup of
water,</hi> and that <hi>cold,</hi> taken out of the River, without any pains
or cost to heat it, yea but <hi>ONE</hi> cup full thereof, and no more,
(supposing that to be the most thou canst doe for them) yet it shall
be rewarded by him, who more respecteth the willingness of the
Giver, then the greatness of the Gift.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55174:4"/>
The greatest difficulty in the words is who are here meant by
<hi>little ones,</hi> for whose sake the reward is promised.</p>
            <p>By <hi>little ones,</hi> our Saviour meaneth no other than such in the
foregoing verse, he had stiled <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>righteous ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are called <hi>Little ones</hi> in two respects.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In regard of the worlds esteem of them.</item>
               <item>2. In regard of their own account of themselves.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, <hi>They are little in the worlds eye.</hi> The world which judgeth
not according to inward worth, have them in low esteem. It fares
with the servants, as it fared with their Master, they are despised,
and rejected, and troden under foot of men. Of old they were
accounted <hi>Desolate,</hi> and <hi>forsaken, Isa.</hi> 62. 4. In the <hi>Apostles</hi> time,
the <hi>filth of the world,</hi> the <hi>of scouring of all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 13. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of all ages verifieth as much. And among other ages
ours giveth not the least evidence.</p>
            <p>That comfort and contentment which God's people find in the
Lord, and the light of his countenance, yea that hope they have
of finding grace in his eyes, make them the less to mind, and seek
after the honour, wealth, and promotions of the world, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they have but little of it. Now the world judgeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to outward, earthly, worldly glory, it discerneth not the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
glory of the Saints, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Judg not of men according to the worlds judgment: think not
ever the more meanly of Saints, because the world thinks so of
them. They are highly favoured of the most High: they are such
<hi>of whom the world is not worthy,</hi> they are <hi>the excellent ones, Psal.</hi> 16.
3: but what ever they be in deed, in the eye of the world they are
but <hi>little ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>They are little in their owne eyes, Gen.</hi> 18. 27. we read
how <hi>Abraham</hi> in speaking to God, stiles himself no better than
<hi>Dust and ashes.</hi> And <hi>Gen. 32. 10. Iacob</hi> acknowledgeth himself
<hi>unworthy,</hi> or, <hi>less than the least of Gods Mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ground thereof may be because the Saints best know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
since they more thorowly, than other men, Search their
hearts, and observe their ways, and compare themselves with the
pure and perfect law of God, and take notice of their inward, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
corruptions, as well as of their outward and visible transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55174:5"/>
and thus come they to know more of themselves, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can, or may suspect of them. And this clearer sight of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
brings them down, and lays them low. This made Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
to cry out, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?</hi> This is a note of true grace, and of a
sanctified heart. They are the <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> not the proud in Spirit,
that are Christs blessed ones, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 3. The false disciple thinketh
highly of himself, and would be accounted not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>little one,</hi>
like a true disciple of Christ; but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Some great one,</hi> like
to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act 8. 8, 9. This Spirit is a Satanical Spirit. Try
thy Spirit by this note, whether it be of God, or no.</p>
            <p>But though all the Servants of God are on the the forementioned
account <hi>little ones,</hi> yet there are some among them less than others,
<hi>as in regard of their offices,</hi> and stations in the Church, some are in
higher, others in lower Offices, some are in office, others not; So
also <hi>in regard of their parts and gifts,</hi> and graces, some are strong,
and others are weak; some the chief, others the least of Saints: some
as the head, and others but as the finger, or the foot: and 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the text hath the most special respect (and the Emphasis of it is
the greater) to the least of all these little ones, and so the expression
is <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 40. In as much as ye have done it unto one <hi>of the least</hi>
of these my brethren ye have done it unto me.</p>
            <p>This I the rather take notice of it to give an hint to Christians in
their Charitable distributions to have an eye to such Ministers or
Christians as are more obscure, and less considerable in the World.
Possibly when those of greater worth and remark may tast deeply of
their bounty, every one almost hath a kindness for them: in the
mean time there may be some poor hidden ones, whose worth is
less, but their wants are greater, who being low in those gifs or
graces which would commend them to the more publick notice, are
almost buried in forgetfulness. Its true that by how much the more
eminent the person is that is relieved (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) by so much
the more excellent the work: yet special care should be taken that
the more obscure and least deserving among all that belong to God
be not forgotten.</p>
            <p>The words thus explained, afford unto us two special poins of
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55174:5"/>
1. <hi>Doct.</hi> God taketh notice of every of his Saints, even of the least of
them, and of kindness shewed to them.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Ioseph</hi> was but a lad, and sold as a slave, yet being one of
the Church, one of the little ones, yea <hi>minimorum minimus;</hi> yet in
<hi>AEgypt</hi> God takes notice of him, and of that kindness which was
shewed to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 5. Many other like examples are noted in
the Scripture; but none more fit for our purpose, than the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luk. 16. 20. though he were a very poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and full of sores, and despised of <hi>Dives,</hi> and all his househo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
yet God took such notice of him, as he made his Angels attend him.
Yea God took notice of the kindness which the Dogs shewed him,
for their licking of his sores is recorded to all ages. Note those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 40. 12. But I am poor and needy, yet
the Lord thinketh upon me.</hi> And again <hi>Psal. 34. 6. This poor man
cryed, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. If you ask, why the Lord taketh notice of every of his Saints.</p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>They are all his Children, and of his household;</hi> therefore
as a tender, and carefull father, and Master, he careth for every one.
Yea they are all members of the body of Christ. Now the head
taketh care of every member, even the least, and taketh notice
of every kindness done to any of them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They are all by reason of grace in them, as Iewels</hi> and <hi>precious
stones;</hi> therefore as a provident <hi>Ieweller</hi> he will look to every one
of them. Yea that which often appeareth least may be of greater
worth; as a little <hi>Diamond</hi> is of more Value than a far greater
pebble.</p>
            <p>This affordeth a singular ground of comfort to such as in this
world are desolate, and forsaken: though they be left alone (as
<hi>Elijah was</hi> 1 King 19. 10.) And <hi>as a Pelican in the wilderness:</hi> Or <hi>an
Owl of the Desert,</hi> Or <hi>as a sparrow alone upon the house top,</hi> as the
Psalmist expresseh, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 6, 7. yet is the Lord with them, and
takes care of them. Now if the Lord be with us, and taketh care of
us, What need me fear?] How should this encourage us to extend
our charity to any one of the Saints, and members of Christ, though
mean and little in the world, and not able to recompence us: and
though none take notice thereof, to consider that the Lord taketh
notice, and will abundantly recompence every good work, yea the
least kindness we do unto them. Heb. 6. 10. <hi>God is not unrighteous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55174:6"/>
to forget your work, and labour of love, which ye have shewed towards
his name, in that ye have ministred to the Saints, and do minister,</hi>
Where, <hi>Gods not forgetting their labour of love in ministring to the
Saints,</hi> doth imply, that as God taketh notice of their beneficence,
So he is, and will be ever mindfull of such and such persons to support
and succour, and every way do them good.</p>
            <p>And if God will thus remember those that remember the least of
his, how will he take it that they are neglected? Beloved, how is
it with Gods little ones at this day? Is it not very low with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of them? God takes notice how very low it is; and whether
you will or no, God will not forsake them; but (that I may use the
words of <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Ester,</hi> with some variation, <hi>Ester.</hi> 4. 14.) If
you altogether hold your hand at this time, relief shall arise to them
some other way, but you and your house (take heed that word be
not verified upon you) shall be destroyed. But who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are come to your estates for such a time as this!</p>
            <p>And thus I come to the Second and main point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which
riseth from the <hi>reward promised</hi> to such as shew the least kindness
to a <hi>minister,</hi> or <hi>righteous man,</hi> though it be but <hi>a cup of cold water
they shall in no wise lose their reward.</hi> Whence we may observe.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Doct.</hi> That the least work of charity shewed to a Minister or
righteous man, shall be abundantly recompensed, and that not only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
but likewise here on earth.</p>
            <p>Though our beneficence ought to extend unto all who are in want
and come within the verge of our knowledge, and power, as <hi>Gal.</hi>
6. 10. <hi>According as we have opportunity, let us do good unto ALL
men;</hi> yet I confine my discourse here to <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>righteous
ones,</hi> because they only are implyed under those <hi>little ones</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in my text.</p>
            <p>That mercifull men shall be abundantly recompenced hereafter in
heaven for their works of charity, there is no doubt, being so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed in the word of God, Luk. 16. 9. <hi>Make your selves
friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail, they
may receive you into everlasting habitations</hi> And 1 Tim. 6. 17. <hi>Charge
them that are rich in this world, that they do good, that they be rich in
good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in
store for themselves a good foundation</hi> against the time to come, that
they may lay hold of eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55174:6"/>
But the great question is concerning <hi>temporal reward, Whether
Christian charity, rightly performed, shall be recompenced here in this
life with temporal blessings:</hi> So that what men give in a way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
there is ground to expect, it shall be here returned into their
bosomes again with increase.</p>
            <p>I deny not but a charitable man may become poor, and be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into some straights, through Suretiship, negligence in his Calling,
or in respect of some secret sin, wherein he liveth, which may justly
bring a temporal curse upon him: So that his liberality in such cases
may not be a sufficient fence against want and penury. But this I
say, <hi>That as penuriousness towards the poor is the readiest way to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty:
So Christian charity, rightly performed, is the surest way to
plenty and abundance,</hi> it being usually rewarded with <hi>temporal</hi>
blessings here, as well as with <hi>eternal</hi> hereafter. Where is the
man to be found, that is the poorer by what he hath given to the
poor? How many are the instances of such which have met with
some <hi>signal blessings</hi> from God in this life, as the reward of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality?</p>
            <p>This may seem a <hi>paradox</hi> to many uncharitable men, that <hi>Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
should be the surest way of getting,</hi> and that <hi>the more liberal any
man is, the more likely he is to thrive and prosper in the world.</hi> Yet
nothing more clearly laid down in the Scripture, and found to be
true by the experience of multitudes of Gods people in all ages.
<hi>And I am verily perswaded, that there is seldome any man, that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
conscience of this duty, who giveth out to the poor proportionably to
what God hath bestowed on him, and with an honest, upright heart, but
if he do observe the passages of Gods providence towards him, he shall
find the same doubled, and redoubled upon him in temporal blessings,</hi> I
dare challenge all the world to give one instance, or at least any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
number of instances of any truly mercifull men, whose
charity hath undone them. But as <hi>living wells</hi> the more they are
drawn, the more freely they spring, and flow; So the substance of
charitable men doth oftentimes, if not ordinarily, multiply in the
very distribution; Even as the five loaves, and few fishes did mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
in their breaking, and distributing. And the widdows Oyl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by the pouring it out.</p>
            <p>But these bare assertions being no full convictions: For the better
clearing the truth of this doctrine, I shall prove it by <hi>Scriptures,
Examples, and Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55174:7"/>
1. For <hi>Scripture proofes,</hi> there are very many both in the old, and
New-Testament. What the Apostle saith of <hi>Godliness,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8.
<hi>It is profitable unto all things, having the promise of this life, and of
that which is to come.</hi> The like I may say of <hi>Charity,</hi> It is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto all things, having promises of <hi>temporal blessings,</hi> as well as
of <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deut. 15. 10. <hi>Thou shalt surely give unto thy brother, and thy heart
shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this
the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou
puttest thine hand unto.</hi> It is not thine own labour, or care, but the
divine blessing that maketh rich, and of that blessing behold here's a
<hi>Scripture-entail</hi> upon the liberal. And the like we have Pro. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 9, 10.
<hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance,</hi> by giving out a portion thereof
for the relief of the poor, <hi>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,</hi> and
as thy <hi>Barnes,</hi> so thy <hi>Shop,</hi> thy <hi>Cellers, warehouses,</hi> where thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowest
thy goods, shall be filled with abundance: <hi>and thy presses
shall burst out with new wine,</hi> this seemeth to be an hyperbolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
yet it signifieth no less then this, <hi>that Gods usuall way is to
make good returns of all we lay out upon him and his;</hi> and that our
wisest way both for ensuring, and improving what we have is to
make our selves Creditors to his wanting Saints.</p>
            <p>A compassionate heart, and an helping hand will gather by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending;
such <hi>giving</hi> is <hi>getting,</hi> such bounty is the most compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
way to plenty. Whereupon the wiseman addeth, Pro. 11. 24.
<hi>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; there is that withholdeth
more then is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</hi> Who is he, here, that scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth?
not he that wastes his estate upon his throat, his back and his
belly, or with the <hi>Prodigal</hi> upon <hi>Harlots;</hi> but he <hi>that casteth his
bread upon the waters,</hi> as the expression is Eccl. 11. 1. <hi>He that dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and giveth to the poor,</hi> as Psal. 112. 9. this is the scatterer in that
text. And what of him? is he wasted? is he impoverished? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the quite contrary: the man is grown rich, <hi>he is encreased by
scattering.</hi> Let him look to it, that withholdeth more than is meet:
this is the more likely man of the two to be found shortly on the
dunghil. If thou wilt secure thy self from beggery, keep not Gods
beggers from thy door, nor send them away empty whose needs,
though not their tongues, cry in thine ears, <hi>Give for the Lords sake.</hi>
Fear not to loose by laying out. Thy <hi>laying up</hi> what thou shouldst
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55174:7"/>
               <hi>lay out</hi> hath the most danger in it. The divine curse may wither
that in thine hand which thou holdest fast against the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>In the following verse we read further, <hi>The liberal soul shall be
made fat.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> is often in Scripture taken to signifie the <hi>Man,</hi>
and so it is here, and is the same, as the <hi>liberal man. To be made fat,</hi>
signifies <hi>to prosper,</hi> to be <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>abound,</hi> or <hi>to grow rich in this worlds
goods;</hi> and thus it shall be, if this Scripture may be credited.</p>
            <p>The <hi>liberal Soul</hi>] It is in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as you may find it noted in
the Margin, <hi>the Soul of blessing,</hi> the merciful man is a blessing, and
hath a blessing for such as need him: and he that is a blessing, shall
be blessed; the Lord God shall bless him with an increase of his
substance, who hath most emptied himself for him, and his. Its
true that the SOUL of the liberal properly taken, shall be a gainer
by his liberality: no more <hi>thriving Christians,</hi> then the <hi>merciful
Christians,</hi> what they expend in temporals is abundantly returned
in spirituals. But because there is so much of <hi>carnal,</hi> even in too
many Christians, and have need of encouragements suited to our
tempers, therefore to our spiritual advantages, which are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
these outward encouragements are added as often most taking
with our too carnal hearts. So that this is the sense of the place. The
liberal man, as the reward and encouragement of his liberality, shall
prosper in the world. And as it follows, <hi>He that watereth,</hi> the soul
of the needy, his waters shall not fail, but he <hi>shall be watered also
himself.</hi> God will give in to him, according as he hath given out
to others.</p>
            <p>And for their farther encouragement, saith the wiseman, Pro. 19.
17. <hi>He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and that
which he hath given, shall he pay him again.</hi> If that which thou giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
be repaid thee again, how can it be said to be lost? Indeed the
poor, unto whom thou givest, are not able to repay thee again, yet
having such an alsufficient Surety, as God himself, who hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the repayment, thou need'st not doubt thereof. Oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is that man that becomes a Creditor to his Creatour, and makes
God his debtor! whose is the earth, and the fulness thereof. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth shall be emptied before he shall want a royal pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Fear not to be an Vsurer, so thou lendest unto God, make him
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55174:8"/>
thy debtor, and he will surely pay thee Principal and Interest. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him his time (for that he will have) and he will not only pay
the debt, but allow thee for the forbearance. The ungodly borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and payeth not again: but this shall never be said of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God: He is just, and will make good payment of whatsoever is
lent unto him.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Lord loves to deal <hi>upon trust,</hi> and uses to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by way of <hi>Returns.</hi> He will be trusted, and those that will
not give him Credit, let them if they can, put their estates into surer
hands. And he uses to pay by the way of <hi>Returus,</hi> it may be neither
in the same kind, nor in the same Country. Sometimes tis so that
he pays not in the same kind, bread for bread, or clothes for clothes,
or money or money, Nor possibly may he make his payment in
this forreign land, where thou art a Merchant adventurer, but may
give thee his bill of exchange to receive it in thine own country,
that better Country, which is thy home, and inheritance, which
shall be the reward of thy works, and labour of love, which thou
shewest to his name. And if he do thus, does he thee any wrong?
Is it not best for thee that thou receive thy goods at thy home? Is
it any harm to thee to receive Silver for thy Brass, Gold for thy Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Rubies for thy Gold, a treasure in Heaven, for thy treasure
on Earth? Doubt not that he will be behind hand with thee: yet
stick not if thou shouldst be put to it, to wait for payment in full
till hereafter: and for the present this thou may'st depend upon
from <hi>Pro. 28. 27. He that giveth to the poor shall not lack,</hi> he shall
have in hand whats needful at least. <hi>He shall not lack</hi> and there may
be more in this word, then if he had said, I will presently pay thee
all: For all that thou hast, if thou shouldst hold it never so close, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
secure thee from ever coming to want; as great as thy abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
is, thou maist come to want before thou diest. But what
thy abundance cannot do, this promise of God can and doth for thee
even give thee security that thou shalt never lack.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Eccl. 11. 1. Cast thy bread vpon the waters, for thou shalt
find it after many days.</hi> By <hi>bread</hi> is here meant all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the support of mens lives. And by <hi>casting</hi> their bread upon
the waters, is meant their giving freely of that which they have for
the relief of the poor, whose watry eyes bewray their great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And though that which thou bestowest on them, may seem to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55174:8"/>
be as clearly lost and cast away, as that which is thrown down the
River, or cast into the Sea, where ther is no like<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ihood of receiving
it again, because given to those who can no way recompence thee;
whence arose that <hi>Greek Proverb</hi>

               <hi>Thou sowest upon

where they are utterly lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet thou shalt find it after many days, Lavater in locum</hi> saith, that
here is implyed a promise of long life to the charitable, that God
will lengthen out his days to a good old age. Though this falls out
true in many, yet I conceive it not to be here intended, nor to be
the meaning of the words, but rather, this, that though thy reward
doth not presently appear, yet if thou bestowest thine alms with a
sincere heart, it shall not be lost, but certainly be returned into thy
bosome with increase.</p>
            <p>Yet further saith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Isa. 58. 7, 8. &amp;c. If thou
deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out, to
thy house, and when thou seest the naked, if thou cover him, and that
thou hide not thy self from thine own flesh,</hi> by tnrning thy sace from
him; <hi>Then</hi> (see what a gracious promise of signal blessings follow
hereupon) <hi>shall thy light break forth as the Morning,</hi> that is, then
shall the night of thine adversity be dispelled, and the day spring of
thy prosperity break forth as the Morning-light: <hi>and thy righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall go before thee,</hi> that is, the fruit and reward of thy charity
shall be visible to all: <hi>the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward,</hi> that
is, the God of glory shall by his power and providence both go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

usually follow, and accompany merciful men.</p>
            <p>Yea our blessed Saviour, Math. 19. 29. promiseth, that such as
for his sake shall this or any other way part with their estates, or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55174:9"/>
any part or portions of them, <hi>shall receive an hundred fold here, and
inherit eternal life hereafter</hi>: here in this life he shall have the return
of an hundred fold, which many Christians have found true in their
own experience, and with thankfulness to God have acknowledged
as much.</p>
            <p>And what variety of expressions doth our Saviour use in <hi>Luke</hi> 6.
38. to assure us of a large reward here of all our labour of love shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Ministers, and members? <hi>Give,</hi> saith he, <hi>and it shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to you again, good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and
running over.</hi> For your encouragement unto this duty of giving
to the poor, Our Saviour first annexeth a general promise of return,
<hi>Give, and it shall be given to you again,</hi> where he giveth you a <hi>Bill
of his hand,</hi> that you shall be no looser by what you give to his poor,
but shall be repay'd, and that with advantage, as the following
words declare, <hi>you shall have good measure, pressed down, shaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and running over,</hi> we account it good measure, when it is
<hi>heaped up,</hi> but when it is not only heaped up, but <hi>pressed down,</hi> that
is more; but when it is heaped up, pressed down; and then <hi>heaped
up,</hi> and <hi>running over again,</hi> who can but say, that this is good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
indeed? Yet thus God deales with merciful men, they shall
have mercies and blessings <hi>heaped up, pressed down, and running over.</hi>
How truely then may I take up the words of the Psalmist, <hi>Blessed
is he that considereth the poor;</hi> He shall not only be blessed, but he
shall have blessings <hi>heaped up, and running over!</hi> which the Apostle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth very <hi>Emphatically</hi> by the similitude of <hi>reaping</hi>
and <hi>sowing,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 6. <hi>He that soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly,
but he which soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully.</hi> As men sow,
so shall they reap, the more liberally they give to good uses, the
more bountifully they shall receive from God: they shall find a
plentifull harvest, as the fruit of all their cost and pains. Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
in his practical Catechism, quoting these words of the Apostle
<hi>He that soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully,</hi> addeth this gloss,
<q>By <hi>reaping bountifully,</hi> I conceive is meant, <hi>not onely Gods abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
retributions of glory in another world, but even his payments of
temporal plenty, and blessings here to those who have been willing to
make that Christian Vse of that earthly talent commited to their Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding.</hi>

this proposition. <q>That <hi>alms-giving or mercifulness</hi> was never the

Such as every Auditour will not consent to, I doubt not but there

               <q>All these being put together, must, saith he, (to my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)

Dr. <hi>Ieremy Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Rules of holy-living,</hi> treating of Alms,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 8. among other <hi>Motives</hi> therunto, hath this. <q>That portion
of our estate, out of which a tenth or a fifth, or a twentieth, or some

returns with a great blessing upon all the rest.</q> It is like the effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

unto, than to any other almost that a Christian can perform.</hi>
               </q> And
three sorts of promises there be that are made unto it. First, <hi>That
it shall never hinder, nor beggar a man; That that is thus given shall
not be lost,</hi> yea it will return again with advantage and increase: Yea
that that is thus given will bring Gods blessing upon all that we

            <p>Dr. <hi>Thomas Iacomb,</hi> in his Sermon on <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 7. preached at

               </gap>ll return to the Mercifull man what
he gives to the poor, he will reward him <hi>in kind;</hi> that look what ever
it is that he bestows, it shall be <hi>in the very kind</hi> made up to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
many have found this to be true: in the Morning they have
given, may be, five shillings, &amp; before night God hath brought them
in unexpectedly twenty for it. <hi>The best way for a man to encrease
his estate is charity:</hi> Money here like the widdows oyl, the more
'tis <hi>poured out,</hi> the more it doth <hi>increase,</hi> &amp;c. And p. 26, No man
shall be the poorer at the years end for what he lays out upon the

               <q>The Author of the <hi>whole Duty of man,</hi> treating of Alms in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
17. saith, There is but one Objection to be made against a
cheerful giving of Alms, and that is, <hi>The danger of impoverishing
ones self by what one gives.</hi> To which he answers in these words;
that this is sure a vain supposition, God having particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
the contrary to the charitable: <hi>That it shall bring blessings on
them, even in these outward things. The liberal soul shall be made
fat, &amp; he that watereth, shall be watered also himself,</hi> Pro. 11. 25. <hi>He
that giveth to the poor, shall not lack,</hi> Pro. 28. 27. And many the like
texts ther are, so that one may truly say, This Objection is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in direct unbelief. The short of it is, we dare not trust God,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55174:11"/>
for this giving to the poor, is directly The putting our wealth into
his hands: <hi>He that giveth to the poor, lendeth unto the Lord,</hi> Pro. 19.
17. and that too, on solemn promise of repayment, as it follows in
that verse, <hi>That which he hath given will he pay him again.</hi> It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men thought a great disparagment, when we refuse to trust
them: it shews, we either think them not sufficient or not honest.
How vile an affront is it then to God, thus to distrust him? Nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
how horrid blasphemy, to doubt the security of that, for which
he has thus expresly past his word, who is the Lord of all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot be insufficient: and who is the God of truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will not fail to make good his promise?</q> 
               <q>Let not then that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel-fear
of future-want contract and shut up thy bowels from thy
poor brother: for though he be never like to pay, yet God becomes
his Surety, and enters bond with him, and will most assuredly pay
thee with increase.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Therefore it is so far from being damage to thee, Thus to give,
that it is <hi>thy great advantage.</hi> Any man would rather chuse to put
his money in some sure hand, where he may both improve, and be
certain of it at his need, than to let it lye unprofitable by him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if he be in danger of thieves, or other accidents, by which
he may probably lose it: Now alass! all that we possess is in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent-danger
of losing: innumerable accidents there are, which
may in an instant bring a rich man to beggery; he that doubts
this, let him but read the story of <hi>Iob,</hi> and he will there find an
example of it. And therefore what so prudent course can we take
for our wealth, as to put it out of the reach of those accidents, by
thus lending it to God, where we may be sure to find it ready at
our greatest need, and that too with improvment and increase? In
which respect it is, that the Apostle compares almes to Seed 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. 10. We know it is the nature of Seed that is sowen, to multiply
and increase; and so do all our acts of Mercy, they return not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and naked to us, but bring in their sheaves with them, a most
plenteous and bountiful harvest. God deales not with our almes,
as we too often do with his graces, wrap them up in a napkin, so
that they shall never bring in any advantage to us, but makes us
most rich Returns. And therefore we have all reason, most cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
yea-joyfully, to set to this duty, which we have such invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to, as well in respect of our own <hi>Interest,</hi> as our Neighbors
needs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55174:11"/>
Thus have you the truth of the point proved both by divine, and
humane testimonies. I should now proceed to give you some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
for the farther confirmation thereof. But I must beseech you
first to take these two <hi>Cautions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Not to ascribe the reward to any merit of your good works, but
only to the free grace, and rich mercy of God.</hi> It is his rich mercy,
that we have wherewithall to give, and his free grace, that we have
an heart to give, and his abundant goodness, that he accepteth our
works of charity, and rewardeth them with all sorts of blessings,
both temporal, Spiritual and eternal; but we cannot merit any
thing at his hand; by giving him that which is his own.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Though our Alms-deeds are sacrifices acceptable and welpleasing
unto God through Christ;</hi> and though he hath bound himself by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gracious promises to reward the same both here, and hereafter:
yet far be it from us to perform them meerly out of hope of reward,
but rather for <hi>conscience-sake, in obedience to the command of God,</hi>
(who hath required them at our hands,) and <hi>in testimony of our
thankfulness unto him,</hi> for what he hath graciously bestowed on us.
As we are commanded to obey the Magistrate, not so much <hi>for fear
of punishment,</hi> and <hi>hope of reward,</hi> as <hi>for conscience-sake,</hi> in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the command of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. So ought we to distribute
our Alms not so much for the reward-sake, as out of conscience, for
the Lords-sake.</p>
            <p>I deny not but Christians in their well-doing may for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
have respect to the recompence of reward, but not
<hi>onely,</hi> and <hi>chiefly.</hi> The chief and principal Ends we should aim at in
all our good works, are, <hi>The glory of God,</hi> And <hi>Obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
Our respect to the recompence of reward ought to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
unto these. The truth is, This temporal reward should not
so much be looked on, as an <hi>argument</hi> to perswade us to give, but
as an answer of an Objection against Giving. Thou wilt be ready
to say, I may want it my self, or mine may want it. But do but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God will repay thee, and with overplus; and then that
doubt willbe taken out of the way.</p>
            <p>These two Cautions premised, I shall proceed in the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the point from the examples of many charitable persons, who
have in temporal mercies been abundantly recompensed for the
kindness they have shewed to the Ministers and Members of
Christ.</p>

               <hi>Notable is the instance of</hi> Iob. <hi>What a merciful man he was,
we may read chap.</hi> 29. 12, 13, 15. I delivered the poor that cryed,
and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The blessing
of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
heart to sing for joy. I was eyes to the blind, and feet I was to
the lame, I was a father to the poor. <hi>And chap.</hi> 31. 16, &amp; 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If I
have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the
widdow to fail, or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath
not eaten thereof; If I have seen any perish for want of cloathing, or
any poor without covering; If his loyns have not blessed me, and if he
were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep: Then let mine arms fall

            </p>
            <p>But you will say, what became of this merciful man? did he
prosper? did he flourish, and grow great? who so poor as poor
<hi>Iob</hi> after all these acts of mercy? How long after was it, that we
find this <hi>merciful man</hi> a <hi>miserable man,</hi> strip'd naked of all that ever
he had? But, First, It was not <hi>his own mercy,</hi> but <hi>Sathans malice</hi>
that brought him down: It was the <hi>Devil</hi> that set the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and
<hi>Chaldeans,</hi> upon him, to plunder, and carry away all that he had.
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> what became of <hi>Iob</hi> afterwards, after <hi>Sathan</hi> had done
his worst? you may read, chap. 42. 10. &amp;c. <hi>That the Lord turned
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55174:12"/>
the Captivity of</hi> Job <hi>and gave him twice so much as he had before, and
blessed his latter end more than his beginning, so he had fourteen
thousand sheep, and Six thousand Camels: a thousand yoke of Oxen,
and a thousand shee asses:</hi> He had <hi>also seven Sons, and three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 7. We read how <hi>Publius</hi> the chief man of the Island of
<hi>Melita</hi> (into which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; many others with him were cast by
Shipwrack) received and lodged them three days courteously: and
in the next verse we read how the father of <hi>Publius,</hi> when he lay
desperately sick of a feaver, and bloody-flux, was recovered by St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and restored to his former health. So likewise the kindness
which the barbarous people of that Island shewed unto <hi>Paul</hi> and his
his fellow-Travellers, was recompensed with the cure of many of
their sick bodies.</p>
            <p>To these Examples, recorded in Scripture, I shall add a few
more out of ancient, and modern writings.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>A ban</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his first To me mentioneth amongst
the Martyrs who suffered for the name and cause of Christ) having
received a poor persecuted Minister into his house, was by his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, and gracious exhortations so wrought upon, that he turned
from <hi>Heathenism</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> and at last suffered as a Martyr
for the truth of Jesus Christ, as <hi>Beda,</hi> and others write of him. His
kindness to a poor persecuted <hi>Minister</hi> was recompensed not only
with his conversion to the true religion, but likewise with the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

            <p>St. <hi>Austin,</hi> having set forth the mercifulness and liberality of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the great, saith, <hi>Bonus Deus, Constantinum Magnum tantis
terrenis implevit muneribus,</hi> &amp;c. God gave <hi>Constantine,</hi> that Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>
               <q>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his forementioned Treatise mentioneth an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Story out of <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> of a <hi>Iew,</hi> who upon reading those
words of <hi>Salomon, Pro. 19. 17. He that hath pity upon the poor,
lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him
again,</hi> resolved to try, whether God would be as good as his word:
therupon gave all that he had but two pieces of silver to the poor
and then waited and expected to see it come again. But being not
presently answered in that expectation, grew angry, and went up
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55174:13"/>
to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to expostulate with God for not performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
And going on his way, found two men a striving, engaged
in an unreconcileable quarrel, about a Stone, that both walking
together had found in the way, and so had both equal right to it;
but (being but one and not capable of being divided) they could
not both enjoy: and therefore, to make them friends, he having
two pieces of Silver, doth upon contract divide them betwixt the
Contenders, and hath the Stone in exchange for them. Having It,
he goes on his journey, and comming to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> shews it the
Goldsmith who tels him, that it was a Jewell of great Value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Stone faln, and lost out of the high-Priests Ephod, to whom
if he carried it, he should certainly receive a great reward. He did
so, and accordingly it proved. The high Priest took it of him,
gave him a great reward, and withall sharply reproved him for
questioning the truth of Gods promises, bidding him trust God
the next time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The story of <hi>Tiberius the second</hi> is pertinent to this purpose,
which take in the words of that Reverend person before-mentioned
in his Sermon at the Spittle. This <hi>Tiberius</hi> was very famous for
his bounty to the poor, insomuch that his wife was wont to blame
him for it, and speaking to him once, how he wasted his treasure
that way, he told her. <hi>He should never want money, so long as in
Obedience to Christs Command he did supply the necessities of the poor.</hi>
And presently see how providence ordered it! Immediately after
he had given much this way, under a marble table which was taken
up, he found a great treasure, and news was brought him too of the
death of one <hi>Narses,</hi> a very rich man, who had given his whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
unto him.</p>
            <p>Famous is the story of that charitable Bishop of Millain, who as
he was travelling with his Servant, overtook some poor people
who begged an alms of him: wherupon he asked his man what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he had about him, who answered <hi>Three crowns,</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to give unto them: but the servant thinking himself
wiser than his Master, gave them but two crowns, not knowing
what occasions they might have for money before that got home.
Not long after Some Noblemen meeting the Bishop, and knowing
him to be a very charitable man, appointed <hi>two hundred Crowns</hi>
to be paid to the Bishops Servant for his Masters use. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55174:13"/>
having received the money, presently with great joy acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Master therewith, whereupon said the Bishop, Thou mayst
now see how in wronging the poor of their due, by keeping back
the third crown which I intended them, thou hast likewise wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, <hi>Si enimtres dedisses, trecentos accepisses</hi> &amp;c. If thou hadst gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those <hi>three Crowns</hi> I commanded thee to give, thou hadst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>three hundred Crowns</hi> whereas now I have but <hi>two. Melanc.

            </p>
            <p>It is recorded of <hi>Mary</hi> the wife of <hi>Alexander F<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnese,</hi> Prince of
<hi>Parma,</hi> that being childless, she conceived an hope, that if she would
take into her house some <hi>Orphan,</hi> or poor mans child, and there train
him up, God would bestow a Son upon her. Whereupon she took
a poor mans Son into her care, and gave order for his education
and according to her expectation, at nine Moneths end she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of a Son.</p>
            <p>Suitable likewise to this point is the story of one <hi>Iohn Stewart</hi>
Provost of <hi>Aire</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was eminent for piety &amp; charity.
He had a considerable estate left him by his Father, of which he gave
a great part to the poor and other charitable uses. To pass by many,
I shall mention only one. His heart on a time being much affected
with the wants and necessities of many of Gods people, who wer in
a suffering condition, he sendeth for divers of them to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
where being met, and some time spent in prayer, he made them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
not to reveal what he was about to do, so long as he lived: and
then told them he was not ignorant in what a low condition many of
them were, and therefore he had brought some money with him to
lend each of them, yet so as they should never offer to repay it till he
required the same; Soon after this, such aplague brake forth in <hi>Air,</hi>
the place of his abode, that trade much decayed, and he himself with
others were reduced to straits. Wherupon Some of the Prophane in
that place derided him, saying, that Religion had made him poor, &amp;
his giving so much to others, like a fool, had brought him to want,
But mark what followed. Having borrowed a little money, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
from <hi>Aire</hi> to <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>Salt</hi> and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
being exceeding cheap for want of trading, he adventured
to fraught a ship, and loaded her upon Credit; and then went back
again through <hi>England</hi> unto <hi>Air</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having ordered the
ship to come thither. But after long expectation he was informed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55174:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for certain, that his ship was taken by a Turkish man of war, the
report whereof did exceedingly afflict him, not because he knew
not how to be abased, as well as how to abound, but out of fear,
that the mouths of wicked men would be the more opened to the
reproaching of his profession and charity. But Soon after, tidings
was brought him that his ship was safely arrived in the Road, &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his going forth saw it was a truth. And through Gods good
Providence, as a reward of his charity, he made so much of the
Commodities in the ship, that after the payment of his debts, he
had twenty thousand marks left for himself. Though his bread
was cast upon the waters, and to appearance lost, yet after many
days it returned to him with great advantage. This Story I lately
read in a book, called, The fulfilling of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The point being thus proved by <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi>
Come we now to the Reasons for the farther confirmation
thereof.</p>
            <p>1. Reason, <hi>May be taken from the goodness and bounty of God</hi> which
is such, that he will not suffer any work of charity, shewed to any of
his Ministers, or Children, to pass away unrewarded, without a full
recompence. Whereupon saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 62. 12. <hi>Vnto thee,
O Lord, belongeth mercy, for thou rendrest to Every man according to
his work,</hi> Though God doth not render a reward to any man <hi>for
his work done,</hi> yet doth he render to every man <hi>according to his work.</hi>
So that whosoever hath done a good work, shall be sure to receive a
royal reward from God for the same. Yea God doth allways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in his remunerations, to give Evidence of his grace and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So that not onely no man shall sit down a loser, but shall be a
great gainer in the end. God will not be in any mans debt long, but
what he hath dis-bursed upon his account, he will speedily return
into his bosome with advantage. Not that the liberality of the rich
doth merit any thing at the hand of God, (as is before said) but in
regard of the promises of God, made to all them who in faith apply
themselves to the practice of good works.</p>
            <p>2. Reason. <hi>May be taken from the faithfulness and righteousness
of God,</hi> who having in his word graciously promised abundantly to
recompense, and reward our beneficence, his faithfulness and
righteousness ingageth him to make good what he hath promised;
So that he cannot but be as good as his word. Men may be forward</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55174:14"/>
               <hi>Daniel Waldow</hi> Esquire, <hi>Citizen</hi> and <hi>Mercer,</hi> who was chosen
Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> is a further proof of this Doctrine before laid
down. I could from mine own experience speak much of his
<hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> as also of that <hi>plentiful estate wherewith God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him therupon.</hi> But I shall rather give it you in the words of that
holy man, and blessed servant of Christ in the work of the Ministry,
Mr. <hi>Iames Nalton,</hi> now with God, who was more intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Mr. <hi>Waldow,</hi> and therefore the more fit to preach his
Funeral Sermon, and to set forth his life for our <hi>Imitation.</hi> His
words are these, <hi>He was a man eminent, and exemplary in the grace
of Charity; as appeared by his great bounty manifested on every occasion.
Never any good man, Minister or other, came to propound any work of
Charity, publick or private, that needed to do any more than to propound
it: For his heart was so set upon works of mercy, that he prevented im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
by his Christian and Heroick liberality. He made no more
of giving ten pounds to a work of Charity, than many other rich men make
of giving ten shillings. His Charity had two singular concomitants,
which made it the more remarkable and praise-worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He did good while he lived: He carryed his Lanthorn before him:
He made his own hands his Executors, and his own eyes his Overseers.
Some will part with their riches when they can keep them no longer: This
is like a Cut-purse, that being espyed or pursued, will drop a purse of
gold, because he can keep it no longer. But to be doing good in our life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
while we have opportunity; this is an act of Faith, and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that we can trust God with our estate, and our children, that he
will provide for them, when our heads are laid in the grave.</p>
            <p>2. He dispensed his Charity so secretly, without any self-seeking, or
pharisaical vain-glory, that his left hand did not know what his right
hand did. Therefore did he often go with an hundred pounds under his
cloak to some godly friends, desiring them to distribute it amongst such
honest poor people as stood in most need of relief.</p>
            <p>In brief, He did so much good while he lived, as if he meant to have
nothing to do when he died: And yet he gave so largely when he came
to dye, as if he had done no good when he lived.</p>
            <p>Many, I know, are apt to say, they have many children, and therefore
cannot give. So had Mr. <hi>Waldow;</hi> He had nine children alive at
his death, but the providing for them was no obstruction to his Charity,
nor prejudice to his Children, but did rather entail a blessing upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55174:15"/>
Mr. <hi>Iohn Walter, Citizen</hi> and <hi>Draper</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> was signally
charitable, not only at his death, but in the whole course of his
life, even from his younger years. For the avoiding of vain-glory,
his manner was, to send considerable summs of mony to several
poor families, by the hands of others, in whose faithfulness he
could confide. Whereupon God did not only bless him with a
large estate, but likewise gave him such contentedness therein, that
he sate down abundantly satisfied; and made <hi>a solemn vow and
promise unto God,</hi> that he would give the surplusage of his estate,
whatever it was that for the future should accrew unto him
from his calling and employments, to charitable uses. That you may
be assured of the truth thereof, I have here given you his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
transcribed out of his last Will and Testament, which are
as follow.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to declare, that about twenty years past, when the
Lord had entrusted me with a convenient estate, sufficient to maintain
my charge, and afford fit portions for my wife and children after my
decease; I resolved that what further estate the Lord should be pleased
to entrust me with, to bestow the same on charitable uses.</p>
            <p>After this vow finding his estate wonderfully encreased, he began
to build <hi>Alms-houses;</hi> one in the Parish of St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Southwork;</hi>
another in St. <hi>Mary Newington;</hi> because in those <hi>Parishes</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
there were many blind, lame, distressed poor people, and
never an <hi>Alms-house</hi> in them. He likewise built a <hi>Chapel</hi> neat one
of his Alms-houses for the poor people to serve God in daily. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
built his <hi>Alms-houses,</hi> with the <hi>poors stock,</hi> he bought <hi>Lands,</hi>
and <hi>Houses of Inheritance,</hi> which he settled upon the Company of
<hi>Drapers,</hi> as for the relief and support of his <hi>Alms-people,</hi> after his
decease; so for the performing other charitable gifts mentioned in
his last Will and Testament. While he lived, he was wont to go
himself once a month to his <hi>Alms-houses</hi> in his worst clothes (that he
might not be suspected to be the Founder of them) and gave unto
the poor people their promised allowance. Doubtless, that is the
best Charity, which <hi>Nilus like,</hi> hath the several <hi>streams thereof seen,</hi>
but the <hi>fountain concealed.</hi> Having built his <hi>Alms houses,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
them with a good revenew; then with the remainder of his
<hi>poor's stock,</hi> (which daily encreased through God's blessing upon his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55174:15"/>
pains and endeavours in his calling) he relieved <hi>poor people,</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>
with considerable summs of mony; and gave <hi>much bread
weekly</hi> to the poor of several <hi>Out-Parishes.</hi> All this he did whilest
yet living; besides what he gave upon the like account at his death,
which was also very considerable, as further appears by his Will.
Nothwithstanding all which, he gave and left to his Wife and his
two Daughters about ten thousand pounds. This questionless is
the surest way to have our WILLS performed, to see them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in our life-time; in regard that many <hi>Executors</hi> prove <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners</hi>
of WILLS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Pennoyer</hi> Esquire, <hi>Citizen</hi> and <hi>Merchant</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
wholly composed of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>goodness, bounty</hi> and <hi>liberality,</hi>
which he expressed in the whole course of his life, even from his
first setting up in the world. Many years before his death, he turned
great part of the stock wherewith he traded, into Lands of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to the value of <hi>four hundred pounds per annum;</hi> and being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
charitable, he lived as frugally as he could, spending about
two hundred pounds a year upon himself, wife and family; and the
remaining part of his incomes, he wholly bestowed on charitable
uses; as I have been informed by those who lived long with him,
and were nearly related to him.</p>
            <p>To give you a clear demonstration of his Christian Charity, and
of God's recompencing the same unto him here in this life with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
blessings; I shall recite some of his <hi>Legacies</hi> bequeathed in his
last Will and Testament, to charitable uses, passing by such as he
gave to his rich kindred and acquaintance.</p>
            <p>To poor Ministers, Widdows, and others in distress, about 150 l.</p>
            <p>To four of his poor Tenants 20 l.</p>
            <p>Likewise 800 l. to be laid out here in Wollen Cloath, or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
to be sent to <hi>New-England,</hi> for the use of his poor kindred
there.</p>
            <p>He gave to certain Trustees Lands to the value of twenty pounds <hi>per
annum,</hi> to pay for the teaching of forty Boys at School.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Bristol</hi> 54 l. <hi>per annum</hi> towards the maintenance of a School-master,
and Lecturer, to preach a week-day Lecture there; and to other
charitable uses.</p>
            <p>He likewise settled 20 l. <hi>per annum</hi> on <hi>Trustees,</hi> for the teaching of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55174:16"/>
forty poor children in or near <hi>White-Chappel:</hi> And 40 <hi>s.</hi> yearly to buy
Bibles for some of the children.</p>
            <p>He gave 12 l. <hi>per annum</hi> for the maintaining a School at the <hi>Hay</hi> in
<hi>Brecknockshire:</hi> And 40 <hi>s.</hi> more yearly to buy Books for the Scholars.</p>
            <p>As also 10 l. <hi>per annum</hi> for the maintenance of poor distressed people
in the <hi>Hospital</hi> of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 10 <hi>l. per annum</hi> to ten of the blindest, oldest and poorest Cloath-workers,
at the discretion of the Masters, Wardens and Assistants of
the said Company for the time being.</p>
            <p>He gave 40 <hi>l. per annum</hi> to <hi>Christ-Church Hospital,</hi> for the placing
out four children yearly: And 40 <hi>s.</hi> more yearly to buy each of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
a Bible.</p>
            <p>Besides these, he gave to his poor kindred above two thousand pounds
by his Will.</p>
            <p>And by a Codizel annexed thereunto, he bequeathed to certain <hi>Trustees</hi>
a <hi>thousand pounds</hi> to be given to honest poor people; as also 300 <hi>l.</hi> for
releasing poor prisoners; which summs have been paid into the hands of
the <hi>Trustees</hi> by Mr. <hi>Richard Loton,</hi> and <hi>Michael Davison</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> who
to their honour approved themselves <hi>faithful Executors</hi> to this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Arnold, Citizen</hi> and <hi>Haberdasher</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> At his first
setting up for himself, his stock was not great; but being charitably
disposed, and ready to every good work, his estate, through God's
blessing, very much encreased.</p>
            <p>His Charity in his life-time appeared not only by his forwardness
to communicate to the relief of such, whom he saw in want; but
likewise by his frequent enquiring of others, after such poor people
as were over-burthened with children, or otherwise distressed. Yea,
he hired men with money, to make it their business to find out ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
poor people, on whom he might bestow his Charity; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
did entrust others with considerable summs of money, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
amonst the poorest sort, charging them to have special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the honest poor, such whom they conceived did truly fear
God. That he was no <hi>loser,</hi> but a <hi>gainer</hi> by his <hi>liberality,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
in that God so blessed him in his Calling, that he attained to
an <hi>Alderman</hi>'s estate, and was chosen to that <hi>Office.</hi> Yea, he gave
over his Calling in the City, and withdrew himself into the Country,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55174:16"/>
that he might the better mind God, and the concernments of his
soul more, and the world with its concerns less.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Clark, Doctor</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> one of great repute for his <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> Some while <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians.</hi>
His custom was, to lay by all his <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> fees, as a <hi>sacred
stock</hi> for charitable uses; devoting that entirely to God, which he
received on <hi>his day;</hi> acconting it a piece of <hi>sacriledge</hi> to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it to himself, or any common use: whereupon the Lord was
pleased so to prosper him in his Calling, that though at first his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
was little, and his estate not very great, yet afterwards his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
so encreased, and the world so flowed in upon him, that he
lived <hi>plentifully</hi> &amp; <hi>comfortably,</hi> &amp; gave to his children liberal portions.</p>
            <p>The like also was practised by <hi>Iohn Bathurst, Doctor</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi>
with whom I was very well acquainted: His <hi>Lord's-Days</hi> fees were
constantly kept as <hi>a bank for the poor,</hi> and wholly devoted to, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for their use; which was so far from lessening his incomes,
that by the blessing of God upon his practice, they were greatly in
few years augmented by it. For though at his first coming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
he brought little estate with him, and here had small acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>Yorkshire</hi> being his native Country, where he had spent his
former daies; yet the Lord was pleased so to prosper him in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that in twenty years time he purchased <hi>Lands of Inheritance,</hi> to
the value of a <hi>thousand pounds per annum,</hi> to speak what I know to be
certain; For in the repute of some, his estate at his death was no less
than two thousand pounds of yearly value.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Edmond Trench</hi> likewise observed the same course, as his
wife, and divers other friends of his do testifie. And certain it is, that
this was no <hi>damage,</hi> but a great <hi>advantage</hi> to him: For he had as
many Patients as his weak body would permit him to visit. And,
though he lived at a full and plentiful rate, frequently and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
entertaining Ministers and Scholars at his Table; yet did he
gain a very considerable estate, which he left to his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
in whom not only his memory, but his Piety still survives.</p>
            <p>I have good ground to believe, that many other <hi>Physicians</hi> do
make conscience of this duty; but oh that all would do the like!
certainly they would be no <hi>losers</hi> thereby at the years end, but find
God's blessing upon their <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Estates</hi> prospering them in
both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55174:17"/>
And here to me occurs a <hi>Case of Conscience</hi> worthy to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into, <hi>viz. Whether Physicians may lawfully appropriate unto their
own private use their Lord's-Dayes fees;</hi> I mean, those fees which they
receive from their <hi>Patients</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deny not but <hi>works of mercy</hi> may, and ought to be done on that
day; for, saith the Lord, <hi>Matth. 9. 13. I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice;</hi> that is, mercy <hi>rather</hi> than sacrifice. And I deny not, but,
of the richer sort especially, they may receive their fees for their
<hi>pains.</hi> But I much question whether they may <hi>appropriate those fees
to themselves:</hi> In regard the Lord hath afforded us six daies of seven,
wherein we may and ought to follow our Callings, for our own live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
and of those who belong unto us; but hath sanctified and set
apart the Christian Sabbath for his own honour and service: And
therefore it seemeth but reasonable that what accrews unto us on
that day, should be set apart and imployed for his more immediate
use and service. But I will not impose this as a necessary duty, at
least upon all, in regard that circumstance may vary; but leave it at
present to the determination of their own consciences who are most
concerned therein.</p>

of their poor. And upon the last here named, he settled Lands of
Inheritance for ever for the same use. And to <hi>Rumsey</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi>
he gave by Deed upon the like account a Lease of 99 years to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
after his descease. The poor also of the said Town, whom
he call'd his <hi>Alms-people,</hi> had, during his life, <hi>weekly relief from him,</hi>
and many other Towns together with them, were large sharers in
the like bounty.</p>
            <p>Several poor children of the said Town, and likewise of those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>Farriugdon</hi> he set to School, and did not only pay for their
teaching, but also furnished them with all such books as were fit
and convenient for them. He also caused several good books to be
printed at his own charge, which he freely gave to the poor, that
they might the better be encouraged to mad, and to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the concerns of another and better life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55174:17"/>
He further gave considerable summs of money yearly for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
supply of such godly Ministers as he knew to be in want: And
upon several of them he settled considerable Animities, 10 <hi>l. 20 l. per
annum</hi> for their lives, besides such Legacies which were not small,
that he gave to some of them at his death.</p>
            <p>Besides all this, his hand was ever open and ready to distribute
when ever any fit occasion was offered to him; yea, such was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of his heart, and tenderness of his bowels, that he could
hardly pass by any whom he judged due objects of his Charity, but
he freely and bountifully contributed to their relief.</p>
            <p>Thus did this pious Gentleman honour God with his substance,
and adventure upon the royal <hi>Prophet</hi>'s words, <hi>to cast his bread upon
the waters;</hi> which though the unbelieving world accounts but folly,
and usually reckon it amongst their losses; yet he to his advantage,
according to the promise thereto annexrd, <hi>found it again not after
many daies:</hi> This bread, like the loaves with which Christ fed the
multitude, was multiplyed in his hands, and his oyle encreased by
pouring out. He was but a younger Brother, and the Estate settled
upon him was but 800 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> or thereabouts: And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
I had almost said, this excess of Charity, his Estate was
so far from being ruined, or in the least impaired, as that not only the
same bare measure he received, but <hi>much</hi> greater, <hi>pressed down, and
running over, was meeted out to him and his posterity.</hi> So signally did
God in this life reward his Charity, wisely ordering by his good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that one way or other large handfuls, as over-measure, were
from several hands thrown into his bushel. There is now left to his
Heirs an Estate of more than the double value of what he received
from his Father, besides the portions which he gave to all his <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
five in number, which were very considerable, to some of them
more than 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I hope I may, without offence, or vain glory, take liberty
to mention, amongst others, the <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Liberality</hi> of my dear
and hononred Father Dr. <hi>William Gouge,</hi> late <hi>Pastor</hi> of <hi>Black fryers,
London,</hi> who was eminent as in other graces, so in that of Charity;
From him I first heard, <hi>The tenth part of a rich mans estate to be a fit
proportion to be devoted and dedicated to God for charitable uses.</hi> But
though he commended that to others; yet by what I find in some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
written with his own hand, I may truly say, He gave <hi>the seventh
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55174:18"/>
part of all his yearly comings in,</hi> towards the maintaining poor
Scholars at the University, and the relieving poor families, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
persons. And how wonderfully God blessed, as his <hi>Ministry,</hi>
so his <hi>outward Estate,</hi> is so well known to all who lived in his daies,
that I suppose it needless for me to say any thing thereof; only I
may truly apply unto him the words of the <hi>Psalmist, He was ever
merciful and lending, and his seed is blessed</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more instances of the like nature might here be added;
some of persons who are now with joy reaping in the other world
the blessed fruit of that seed which they had so plentifully sown in
this: Others of persons yet living amongst us, some of which have
acknowledged to me, <hi>That God hath already rewarded them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold
for what they have lent to him, by giving it to his poor.</hi> But
these already mentioned, may be abundantly sufficent to evidence
the truth in hand, and to encourage and provoke us in imitation of
those Worthies, to a more ready and conscientious practice of this
great duty, so essential to Christianity, so well pleasing to God, so
creditable to our profession, so beneficial, not only in order to our
eternal happiness, but our present gain, comfort and prosperity
here on earth.</p>
            <p>The Point being thus proved by <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> Come
we now to the Reasons for the further confirmation thereof</p>
            <p>1. Reason. <hi>May be taken from the goodness and bounty of God,</hi> which
is such, that he will not suffer any work of Charity, shewed to any of
his Ministers, or Children, to pass away unrewarded, without a full
recompence. Whereupon saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 62. 12. <hi>Vnto thee, O
Lord, belongeth mercy, for thou rendrest to every man according his
work.</hi> Though God doth not render a reward to any man <hi>for his
work done,</hi> yet doth he render to every man <hi>according to his work.</hi> Yea
God doth alwaies exceed in his remunerations, to give evidence of
his grace and bounty. God will not be in any mans debt long, but
what he hath dis-bursed upon his account, he will speedily return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his bosome with advantage.</p>
            <p>2. Reason 2. <hi>May be taken from the faithfulness and righteousness
of God,</hi> who having in his word graciously promised abundantly to
recompence and reward our beneficence, his faithfulness and
righteousness ingageth him to make good what he hath promised;
So that he cannot but be as good as his word. Men may be forward
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55174:18"/>
in promising, but slow in performing: but with God, who is the
true and faithful one, <hi>dictum et factum,</hi> saying and doing, are both
alike, <hi>All his promises are Yea and Amen in Christ Iesus.</hi> Heb. 6.
10. saith the Apostle, <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and
labour of love, which ye have shewed towards his name, in that ye have
Ministred to the Saints, and do Minister.</hi> Here the Apostle argueth
a certainty of reward to those who minister any thing to the Saints,
from the <hi>righteousness of God,</hi> even because he is righteous, and
therefore will not fail to do what he hath promised. He is not
unrighteous to FORGET, that is, he will righteously remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and Gods remembring, signifies the same as recompencing:
as he will remember sinners by recompencing their evil ways upon
their own heads, so he will remember his Saints by returning the
good that they have done into their own bosomes.</p>
            <p>The more to assure us of such kind of remembrance from God,
the holy Ghost mentioneth certain <hi>books,</hi> or <hi>roles of remembrance
written before God,</hi> wherein the merciful deeds of his servants are
recorded. So that it is no more possible that such as are charitably
benign, and helpful to the poor Ministers, and people of God should
lose their reward, than that God himself should cease to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or be forgetful of his word.</p>
            <p>3. Reason. <hi>May be taken from several metaphorical expressions used
in Scripture, by which Alms-giving is represented to us;</hi> all which
imply not onely a certain return, but that with increase, as <hi>SOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING,</hi>
and <hi>LENDING,</hi> and that upon Usury.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>We find it set forth in Scripture by</hi> SOWING, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 9. 6.
<hi>He which soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly: and he which soweth
bountifully, shall reap bountifully.</hi> This proverbiall speech
the Apostle applyeth to the dispersing of almes. Now as
<hi>Husbandmen,</hi> who sow their corn with a liberal hand, do usually
reap a crop answerably thereunto: In like manner, such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
as shall sow their feed of charity with an open, plentifull hand,
shall reap accordingly a plentiful crop, they shall find their seed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
come up with increase, yielding <hi>thirty,</hi> if not <hi>sixty,</hi> or <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fold here,</hi> besides eternal life hereafter. It may be, thou mayst
not presently reap the fruit of thy seed, and what wonder? Who
is there that sowes, who expects to reap the same day? The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
waiteth for his harvest; wait thou on the Lord, and doubt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55174:19"/>
not but an harvest will come, that will pay thee both for thy sowing,
and thy waiting.</p>
            <p>2. The second <hi>Metaphor,</hi> whereby alms-giving is set-forth in
Scripture is <hi>LENDING,</hi> and that upon use, <hi>Pro. 19. 17. He
that hath pitty on the poor lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he
hath given, will he pay him again.</hi> Men that lend to men receive
their own with increase: what they lay up lies dead, and possibly
the Thief may break in, and steal it away; but what they lend if
to sure hands, comes in with advantage. How rich do some Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
grow by this trade of lending? And though it be a <hi>Paradox,</hi>
that <hi>GIVING</hi> is a richer trade than <hi>Lending,</hi> even upon use:
yet 'tis a certain truth: for <hi>this giving</hi> is lending: and he that lends
to the Lord will find a greater income at the years end, then he that
lends to the best of men. Therefore as one well saith, <hi>Eleemosyna
non est divitiarum dispendium, sed dite scendi potius compendium, quaest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>;
omnium uberrimus;</hi> Giving to the poor is not the way to wast
our wealth, but the art of thriving, and the most compendious course
to attain unto riches. Though our alms-deeds seem (as the seed
sown) to perish, and rot; yet believing what we see not, we shall
assuredly see, what we believe, and find (even here) such a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
increase, as we shall conclude, <hi>that Giving to charitable
uses is the surest and safest way of getting, and thriving in the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have you the truth of the point confirmed by <hi>Scriptures,
Examples,</hi> and <hi>Reasons.</hi> Come we now to the application.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Vse of Reproof of all unmerciful men,</hi> who notwithstanding the
many charges God hath laid upon us, <hi>to be rich in good works, ready
to distribute, willing to communicate, to draw forth our souls to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
to open our bowels to the needy; and the manifold encouragements
he hath given us in his word hereto, yet do shut up their bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
from them, refusing to afford them any succour or relief.</hi> Surely
such have no love to Christ: for who can say he loves the Lord Jesus
Christ in truth and sincerity, when he suffers his Ministers &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to want necessaries, even food and rayment? Is this thy love
to Christ to suffer him to starve? It is evident thou lovest thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
more than Christ, and so commest under that fearful <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him
be <hi>Anathema Maranatha:</hi> These two words though both deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55174:19"/>
a curse, are of two several languages. The former word <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi>
is a <hi>Greek</hi> word signifying <hi>accursed;</hi> So it is used <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. The latter is a <hi>Syriack</hi> word, as <hi>Beza</hi> observeth in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. yet frequently used by the <hi>Iews:</hi> it
signifieth, <hi>Our Lord cometh. Maran</hi> is Our Lord, and <hi>atha</hi> cometh;
intimating that such as were under this curse, were to expect no
mercy, but to look for the dreadful coming of Christ to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of them. So that, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, chap. 2. 13. <hi>Such
shall have Iudgment without Mercy, that shewed no mercy.</hi> How do
they think to find mercy from Christ who never shewed mercy to
him, and his!</p>
            <p>I will not condemn all for unmercifulness (God forbid I should)
many there are (and I would to God they were more) who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
bountifully to the necessities both of Ministers, and other
poor Saints of God. But yet I have too great cause to say, that
the greatest part of rich men amongst us have their hearts hardened
and their bowels shut up, that they cannot compassionate their
wants; and their hands withered, like his in the Gospel, that they
cannot reach them out to any good use.</p>
            <p>Oh that such would consider, that unmercifulness is a greater
sin than they do imagine. It was one of <hi>Sodoms</hi> sins which fetched
down fire and brimstone from heaven upon them, and all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. Uncharitable men are cursed as in their life so
at their death: but most cursed will they be at the day of Judgment.
Being barren fruitless trees in Gods Orchard, they shall with
the barren fig-tree be surely cut down, and cast into unquenchable
fire.</p>
            <p>More particularly to shew you the miseries of uncharitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They are accursed here in every thing: all they have is cursed:</hi>
So much is implyed in that expression of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 41.
<hi>Give alms of such things as you have, and all things are clean unto
you,</hi> but without alms-giving nothing is clean unto you, that is, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is blessed, and sanctified unto you, but all things are defiled
and cursed. Not only your crosses are curses, but your blessings are
curses unto you. So God threatneth, <hi>to curse their very blessings,
Mal.</hi> 2. 2. Though thou enjoyest abundance of this worlds goods,
yet so long as thou art hard-hearted to the poor and needy, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55174:20"/>
curse of God cleaves to thy store, and abundance. Oh how sad and
lamentable must thy condition needs be, when those things which
are not only blessings in themselves, but likewise blessed unto others,
should be cursed unto thee! Surely, To be thus accursed is misery
enough.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>As the unmerciful are cursed here, so shall they be cursed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
Jam. 2. 13. <hi>He shall have Iudgment without mercy, that
hath shewed no Mercy.</hi> Such as have shut up their bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
against the necessities of the poor, God will shut up his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
of compassion against them, and let forth his fury upon them,
they shall have their portion in his plagues, and indignation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least drop of pitty or Mercy. And at the day of judgment
Christ will say unto them, <hi>Math. 25. 41. Depart from me ye cursed
into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</hi> There's
their doom, and why? <hi>For I was an hungry, and ye gave me no
meat, I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink.</hi> Oh dreadful sentence!
every word whereof carieth much terrour in it, and breatheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fire, and brimstone. What! must they <hi>depart from Christ</hi>
the fountain of bliss and happiness? and into <hi>everlasting fire?</hi> Ah
wretches! cursed indeed. For as the Prophet speaketh <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14.
<hi>Who can dwell with devouring fires? who can dwell with everlasting
burnings?</hi> An everlasting feaver, or an but an everlasting tooth-ach,
were a misery unspeakable. But what are these to the <hi>lying in that
lake which burneth with fire and brimstone to all eternity?</hi> Oh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
the name of <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> and <hi>everlasting burnings</hi> should
awaken all uncharitable men out of their security, and stir them up
without any farther delay to bewail their former unmercifulness,
to beg the pardon thereof, and unfeignedly to resolve, willingly to
give out of their store towards the relief of the poor, proportionably
to what God hath graciously bestowed on them. It may be, thou
hast a plentiful portion of this worlds goods; but oh, what will it
profit thee to live plentifully here, and to be eternally miserable
hereafter? Seriously I cannot but stand amazed to consider, how
men who do believe the words of Christ to be true, That all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
men shall by him at the last day be sentenced into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burning for their not feeding the hungry, nor cloathing the
naked; and yet can be so hard-hearted, as not to hearken to the cry
of the poor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55174:20"/>
3. <hi>The misery of uncharitable persons appeareth in this, That the
wants and necessities of the poor cry loud to heaven against them.</hi> God
hath <hi>dealt bountifully with thee, loading thee with his henefits,</hi> (as the
Psalmist speaketh, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 19.) and hath given thee not only food
and raiment, things needful, and necessary, but an abundance, an
affuency of outward things, even all things richly to enjoy: but
how many of Christs Ministers and members are in great want, not
having wherewithall to satisfie their own and childrens hunger?
whose miseries like the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cry unto God for vengeance
against thee, saying, <hi>Lord, there are not a few who have enough and
to spare, a liberal portion of this worlds goods, with Dives they fare
sumptuously every day: but what are we thy wanting servants the
better for them? who of us are warmed with their fires, or clothed with
their rayment, or so much as partake of the crums or their table? we
are ready to perish for want, when they are surfeited with their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Is the blessing of them that are ready to perish like to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them? wilt not thou judge them O Lord?</hi> Certainly, these bitter
and lamentable complaints cry loud in the eares of the Almighty
against such unchristian and inhumane misers. Beware of the cry
of the poor against you: If thou wilt not hear their cries unto thee,
God will hear their cries against thee.</p>
            <p>4. Thy unmercifulness to the poor will provoke God to reject thy most
religious exercises; <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 13. Whoso stoppeth his eares at the cry
of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. <hi>In which
words</hi> Solomon <hi>hinteth to us two things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That unmerciful men, such as turn away their ears from the cry
of the poor, shall fall into such miseries as will bring them to their
knees, &amp; make them cry sooner or latter. Here in this world world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men sometimes make many prayers, and their religion they
hope will make amends, for their inhumanity at least. And in the
world to come they shall follow their fellow <hi>Dives</hi> in his infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
devotion.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Though they cry, yet they shall not be heard:</hi> whether they cry here
upon their death-beds for mercy, or hereafter in Hel for ease, they
shall not be heard. A notable instance hereof we have in <hi>Dives,</hi>
who though he cryed not here, yet he cryed in, hell, saying, <hi>Father
Abraham have Mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the
top of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55174:21"/>
this flame,</hi> Luk. 16. 24. But was he heard? was his request grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
'twas but a smal request, but yet it is denyed. Because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
crumbs of bread here in this life to the poor, he was denied a
drop of water in Hel.</p>
            <p>And as thy prayers are rejected by God, so likewise will it be in
vain for thee to hear the word, or come to the table of the Lord. All
thy religion will be in vain, shall I say? Nay it will be an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Lord, whilst that accursed thing thy covetous, and
cruel heart, which the Lord abhoreth, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 3.) remaines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee. Think not that one duty will excuse the neglect of another,
that thy praying may serve instead of thine alms, that religion shall
excuse thee mercy, or thy confession of thine unmercifulness will
make up the matter. The Lord abhorreth thee and all thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
whilst the Sacrifice of a compassionate heart is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Oh that all uncharitable persons would steep their thoughts in a
serious meditation of these things: and as they desire to prevent
those judgments which accompany all merciless men, they would
put in for a share in the mercies of the merciful, and to that end,
would put on bowels of pitty and compassion towards the wants
and miseries of Gods distressed ones, and stretch forth an helping
hand towards their relief, which leadeth me to a Second Use,
namely</p>
            <p>2. Use <hi>of Exhortation, to stir up every one who have given up their
names unto Christ, to make conscience, as of every duty comanded by
him, so of this especially, which he hath so vehemently pressed upon us
in his word, and encouraged us unto by many sweet and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi>
This work of charity is <hi>wages,</hi> and like <hi>Samson</hi>'s <hi>Lyon</hi> it
carrieth honey in the belly of it. He who out of a principle of love,
in obedience to Gods command, shall open his heart and hand wide
to the poor, shall find God blessing his stock and store, and prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his undertakings. As there is a <hi>Secret curse</hi> goes out from
God upon the uncharitable mans estate, which blasteth all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and undertakings whereby they prove altogether fruitless:
So there is a <hi>Secret blessing</hi> goeth out from God upon the charitable
mans estate, whereby he thrives and prospers in the world, even to
his own and neighbours admiration.</p>
            <p>It is observed that they are the richest Merchants, and Citizens
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55174:21"/>
who trade boldly: whereas they who are fearful to adventure their
goods, have but small returnes. In like manner it is found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that such Christians as are most forward to supply the
wants of the poor, boldly adventuring their goods upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
do most of all thrive, and prosper in the world. Why then
will any man be so unwise, as to lose his riches for fear of losing
them? And not rather seem to lose them that he may in truth find
them? These earthly things are assuredly lost by keeping, and kept
by well bestowing them.</p>
            <p>What now remaineth but that you look about you, where
you may lay out your money to your best advantage? Make
diligent enquiry after the poor Ministers and members of Christ:
Seek more after them than they do after you. For most certain
it is, that you get more by giving unto them, than they do by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
from you. And you are more beholding unto them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
your charity, than they are unto you for giving it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you only relieve <hi>their bodies,</hi> they feed <hi>your souls,</hi> as Pro. 11. 17.
<hi>The merciful man doth good to his own soul,</hi> which is refreshed with
the mercy which he sheweth to others. And whereas they partake
of a small quantity of your outward good things, you shall have the
same in kind here returned seven-fold into your bosomes, and at
last shall be received into the Kingdom of heaven, prepared for all
those who have fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, and performed
such like works of charity to the poor members of Christ, <hi>Math.</hi>
25. 35. So that you pleasure not the poor so much by <hi>giving,</hi> as you
profit your selves by <hi>receiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riches are a meer uncertainty, like unto a flock of birds in a mans
field, who cannot say they are his because they sit there, <hi>for they take
unto themselves wings, and fly away.</hi> Now in dealing with things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
it will be your wisdome,
<list>
                  <item>1. To make them as sure as you can.</item>
                  <item>2. To make the best use of them that you can.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. What greater wisdome than to make sure? And what better
way imaginable to make sure your estate, than by putting it into
good hands? And what safer hands than the hands of the Lord?
Put them into the hands of Gods poor, and you thereby put them
into Gods hands.</p>
            <p>As in a State Politick, the <hi>Lieger Ambassadors</hi> that are sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55174:22"/>
to lye in forreign Kingdoms secure our peaceable state at
home. So what we disperse and send abroad to the poor, secureth
the rest at home. For as the poor beg of thee, so they beg of God
for thee, that he would preserve, and bless thy store: their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are sent up to heaven for thy Security.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>And what better use can you make of your riches, than by bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a part of them upon the poor and needy?</hi> It being the chief end of
Giving more of this worlds goods to some than to others, that they
who have the greater store should give out thereof to them who are
in want. Which was <hi>typically</hi> signified by the <hi>Israelites</hi> gathering
of <hi>Manna,</hi> which though it were rained down from heaven, yet
the Lord would not allow, that they who had gathered more than
was needful for themselves, and their household, should hoard up
their superfluity, but enjoyned them to communicate of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to such as had not enough, that so he that had the most, should
have nothing over; and he that had the least, should have no lack.
The which the Apostle applyeth to the giving of almes out of our
abundance to those who want, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
            <p>By communicating of our riches to the poor, we shall make
them <hi>our friends,</hi> both to give evidence for us of the truth of our
<hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> and to beg a plentiful return upon us: This is the
advice of our Saviour, <hi>Luke 16. 9. Make to your selves friends of the
Mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail, they may receive you
into everlasting habitations.</hi> Where, by <hi>Mammon,</hi> our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<hi>the abundance of this worlds-goods,</hi> which he called <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
of <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> because ordinarily by worldly men it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously
gotten, unrighteously reserved, and unrighteously used.
This he hinteth, that his Disciples might be the more wary about
it, and the more careful of <hi>making themselves friends thereof,</hi> that is,
so to use their riches by relieving the poor, as the good works done
by them may give testimony of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the
part of Friends. Friends are ready to give good testimony of one
another. The coats &amp; garments which <hi>Dorcas</hi> made for poor wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 39. were such <hi>friends.</hi> But mark what follows, Make
to your selves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, <hi>that
when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. When
ye fail,</hi> that is, when ye depart out of this world, <hi>they may receive
you into everlasting habitations.</hi> This particle <hi>THEY,</hi> some refer
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55174:22"/>
being relieved call upon God to recompense their benefactors,)
but most refer it to the <hi>Riches</hi> which they bestow upon the poor,
which, by vertue of the evidence that they give of the <hi>faith</hi> and
<hi>charity</hi> of the giver, are said to receive them into everlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Surely, rich men have a price in their hands, wherewith to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
to themselves a good inheritance, had they but hearts to make
use of it. Though charity pretend not to any merit <hi>ex congruo,</hi> or
<hi>condigno,</hi> yet will it be plentifully recompensed by God both here
and hereafter.</p>
            <p>I hope you will pardon my zeal in pressing this duty of <hi>charity</hi> so
much upon you: I do assure you, it is not out of any design to take
any thing from your selves, and children, but only to shew you <hi>the
surest and safest way of thriving in the world;</hi> and how you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
Gods blessing upon your children, and so secure unto them the
portion which you leave them. I am willing to do you a kindness,
and I shall do you a great kindness, If I can but effectually perswade
you to this duty: Whatever kindness I may herein do to those
who need, I shall do a greater kindness to you that will be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to help them in their need; in as much as it is a more blessed
thing to give, than to receive. And therfore bear with me, if I do
not only offer you a kindness, but use such importunity to press you
to accept it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle,</hi> knowing how backward rich men especially were
to all works of charity, adviseth <hi>Timothy</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.) not only
to <hi>commend</hi> unto them the duty, but to <hi>command</hi> it. The expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Apostle</hi> is very observable, He doth not say <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi>
unto them, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>charge</hi> them that are rich in this
world, as they love their lives, and would save their souls, To be
rich in good works. As one wittily glosseth upon those words
of the Apostle. <q>If God should charge the <hi>Rocks,</hi> they would send
forth water: If the <hi>Stones,</hi> they would become bread: If the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
they would feed <hi>Elijah:</hi> If the <hi>Quails,</hi> they would victual
the Camp: If the <hi>Clouds,</hi> they would rain down food from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon his poor people; will you then be more rocky than rocks?
more stony then stones? more ravenous than ravens? more senseless
than birds? more empty than clouds?</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you be rich in this worlds goods, and be not rich in good works,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55174:23"/>
talke not of your <hi>faith,</hi> for there can be no true faith without good-works,
Jam. 2. 17. Neither tell me of your religion: for there can
be no true religion in you, so long as you make no conscience of
this duty. <hi>Pure religion;</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Iames, chap.</hi> 1. 27. (<hi>is this</hi>)
<hi>To visit the Fatherless and widdows in their afflictions,</hi> and you never
learned other Religion of us.</p>
            <p>The Lord indeed giveth us leave to eat and to drink, and to chear
up our hearts by partaking, in some measure, of that portion he
hath bestowed on us: but he never allowed us to keep all unto our
selves, or to spend it in the gratifying our sinfull lusts, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to set apart some portion of our estate for the relief of
those for whom nothing is provided, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 9. Saith the wise-man,
<hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance.</hi> He doth not say, <hi>Honour thy
self with thy riches, but honour the Lord with them;</hi> as they come
from his grace, so they should be used to his glory. Now then we
use our riches to Gods glory, when in obedience to his command,
we therewith supply the want, of his children, who will thereby be
stirred up to bless and praise the name of God for his Fatherly care
and providence over them.</p>
            <p>Shall I yet again need to tell thee, that thy liberality to the poor
cannot bring any loss to thine estate, seeing, The more thou givest,
the more thou shalt receive? It is fabled of <hi>Midas,</hi> that <hi>whatsoever
he touched was turned into gold.</hi> But it is no fable, nor fancy, That
the hand of charity can do it; can extract grace out of your goods,
righteousness out of riches, and heaven out of earth. The impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of goods to such good uses, whilest it seems to <hi>impaire,</hi> doth
mightily <hi>improve</hi> what you have, to your most singular advantage.
The more liberal any man is, the more likely he is to be a rich man:
the mercy of God will crown his beneficence with such a blessing of
store, that he shall find, He will never be behind hand with him. Its
nothing which the poor receive from him, in comparison of that
blessing which he shall receive from the Lord. It may be, thou dost
not find thy store thereupon presently increased, yet if thou dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
observest the passages of Gods providence towards thee,
thou wilt sooner or latter find thy self abundantly re-imbursed of
all thy disbursments.</p>
            <p>I told you before that I am willing to do you a kindness: and
that it may be a kindness indeed, I must farther tell you, not only
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55174:23"/>
what you should do, but <hi>How you must do it, that you may not loose
your reward.</hi> And if you would make sure to be gainers by
whatever you thus lay out, observe the following <hi>DIRECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Give your selves to the Lord, and with your selves, all that ever you
have, to be so laid out, whether upon your selves or others, as He doth
appoint and require.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. The <hi>Apostle</hi> boasting of the <hi>Macedonian Christians,</hi>
and of the riches of their liberality, tells us, ver. 5. <hi>That they first
gave themselves to the Lord.</hi> He that will not give <hi>himself</hi> to the
Lord, is like to give but little else. And if he should give all that
he had, and only withhold himself, God will not accept, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it. God will have nothing of thee, if he may not have thy
Heart.</p>
            <p>Give your selves for <hi>Servants</hi> to the Lord, to serve him with your
Spirits first, and then with all that you have. Make over your selves
to God in Christ to be his <hi>Covenant Servants,</hi> &amp; thence-forth count
and say of your selves, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> teacheth you, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. I
am not mine own, but must henceforth glorifie God with my body and
my spirit, yea and with all that I have, which are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knowes not what he says, that says <hi>I serve the Lord, who hath
not first given himself to him for a servant;</hi> God will not be served by
Aliens. And he hath but lyed unto God, who says, <hi>I give my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord for a servant,</hi> and doth not actually serve him with all
that he hath. He that hath given <hi>himself</hi> to the Lord, will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
nothing from him that God will have.</p>
            <p>He that will serve the Lord with his spirit, will as readily serve
him with all that he hath. God that hath given us his <hi>Son,</hi> how
<hi>will he not with him freely give us all things, Rom.</hi> 1. 32? And that
Man that hath given God his soul, will keep back nothing from
Him.</p>
            <p>Friend, thou sayst thou art the <hi>Lords,</hi> and hast devoted thy self to
him; thou hopest that thou art Christs, and hast joyned thy self in
covenant unto him, resolving to be his disciple: but, which way
runs thine estate? whose house is this, these lands, and this mony
which thou hast, are these the Lords too? How is it then that thy
<hi>lusts</hi> have so much of them at their service? That thy <hi>pride</hi> hath so
much, and thine appetite so much, or that they are all impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55174:24"/>
and kept by thee to feed thy <hi>covetousness?</hi> Is all thou hast the
<hi>Lords?</hi> How is it then that thou begrutchest, or thinkest-so-much
of every little that he calls for from thee? Thou who wilt not in
every case part with so much as God calls for, art either a Lyar, or
a Robber. Either thou didst not give all to God, when thou saydst
thou didst, and then thou art a <hi>Lyar:</hi> or if thou didst give all, and
yet will not let him have what he calls for, but bestowest it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
then thou art a <hi>Robber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But some will say, Must I give all I have to the poor, and so
leave my self, and my farily to be beggars? Or, what else is your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when you say, I must give all to the Lord?</p>
            <p>My meaning is, <hi>that you so give all to the Lord, as to resolve to
dispose of your whole estate to such persons and purposes, as God orders
and appoints you.</hi> The Lord would have you live, and maintain
your self, and provide for you family soberly, according to your
rank and degree (some extraordinary cases being excepted.) But
still you must allow no more to your self, nor no less to those
in need, then is according to the will, and good-pleasure of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Some other will here put in and say: But I am free and bountiful,
and give great alas; I cast my bread upon the waters; I give a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to six, and also to seven: I devise liberal things, I delight to shew
Mercy.</p>
            <p>Dost thou so? 'Tis well thou dost, Gods blessing on thine heart
for it: 'tis great pitty that any liberal man in the world should
lose his reward; and that thou maist not lose thine, take this
Counsel of a friend that loves thee, See that thou hast sincerely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up thy self to God as his <hi>covenant-servant,</hi> and art a devoted
Disciple of Jesus Christ, and that these thy workes of Mercy are
done in pursuance of thy Covenant, as a part of that service which
thou owest and hast vowed to thy Lord, whose thou art, and whose
talents thou reckonest all thou hast. And look to this the rather,
because its possible that men of great good works may be, as of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
charity, so of little faith also, which is that grace which entitles
God to us, and all we do, and obtains our acceptance with Him.
First, by faith give thy self to him, and then by charity serve Him
with what thou hast, and then doubt not of a plentiful return.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Offer up your gift upon the Altar.</hi> Give your selves, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55174:24"/>
with your selves, all that you have, <hi>through Christ,</hi> unto God. Let him be
<hi>your Altar that sanctifies your gift:</hi> 'tis through him alone you will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Eph. 1. 6. He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> Let your <hi>Souls be
sprinkled with his blood,</hi> and thereby washed from your blood, from your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and contracted guilt, and pollution, and then they will be a gift accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Lord. Do not think you have no more to do, but to give your
selves as you are to the Lord: you have given your selves to sin, and now,
it may be you think, you will give yourselves back to the Lord: but know
there is more in it than so. Thou art in thy self a guilty, and defiled soul,
and God will have none of thee in this case: Go to <hi>Christ</hi> first, and get him
to cover thine unrighteousness, and to cleanse thee from thy filthines, put
thy wretched soul into his hands, and let him present it unto the Father.</p>
            <p>And what ever thou givest with thy self, <hi>thine alms, thy bread,</hi> or <hi>thy flesh,</hi>
or <hi>thy money,</hi> that thou hast for his poor; put it all into the same hand, and
let him present this also to the Father for the use of his Servants.</p>
            <p>Friends, though I would have you givers yet I would not have you los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
I would not have you losers, either by <hi>Saving,</hi> or by <hi>unprofitable
Giving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Be not losers by Saving.</hi> That's the next way to <hi>lose all,</hi> by thinking
to <hi>save, and k<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ep all to your selves. He that will save his life,</hi> that is, by not
laying it down when God calls for it, <hi>he shall loose it.</hi> And so <hi>he that will save
his estate,</hi> that is, <hi>by refusing to lay it out where</hi> God would have him, <hi>he is the
more like to loose all that he hath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Lose not by unprofitable Bestowing.</hi> All that is bestowed unprofitably,
as to thee, to whomsoever thou givest it, which is not given first through
Christ unto God, and to his servants for the Lords sake. It may be profit
however to them, who receive it, but no profit to thee who givest. 'Tis
onely whats given to God, and to men for Gods sake, for which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
debtour.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Fetch all your alms out of your hearts. Draw forth thy soul to the
hungry,</hi> Isa. 58. 10. Give what thou givest, 1, <hi>Out of a willing heart.</hi> 2,
<hi>Out of a compassionate heart. 3. Out of a thank<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> heart:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Out of a willing heart; Give willingly,</hi> 2 Cor. 9 6. <hi>Every man as he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
in his heart so let him give, not grudgingly, or of neccessity, for God lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a cheerful giver.</hi> An alms-deed in Scripture is called a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> such a
Sacrifice as is well-pleasing unto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16: <hi>To do good, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
forget not, for with such Sacrifices God is well pleased.</hi> Now all
our Christian Sacrifices are to be <hi>free-will Oblations.</hi> An alms without a
will, is a Sacrifice without an heart, and will be rejected of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55174:25"/>
2. <hi>Out of a compassionate heart.</hi> Get a compassionate heart, and fetch all
thine alms out of thine own bowels. <hi>'Tis the hard-hearts of men</hi> that shut up
their <hi>purses:</hi> thou say'st, Thou hast not to spare, thou wantest it thy self, or
those about thee may want it: <hi>No, thou wantest an heart,</hi> and that is the
reason that those that need, must want <hi>thine alms.</hi> A compassionat heart
would find something, or other, for those that are in distress.</p>
            <p>Get a compassionate heart. God is a God of compassion, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are compassionate children, <hi>Col. 3. 12. Put on, (as the elect of God) bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of Mercy. 1 Iohn 3. 17. Whoso hath this worlds goods, and seeth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, (or is a man of no
bowels,) how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> What ever thy profession, or
thy religion be, or thy hopes be concerning it, thou hast nothing of God in
thee, thou art none of His, who hast no bowels. God is a God of mercy, His
children are all merciful children.</p>
            <p>Worldling, wilt thou prove thy self to be <hi>no child of God?</hi> wouldst thou
prove that the <hi>faith</hi> thou hast is <hi>vain,</hi> thy <hi>religion vain,</hi> and that thou art but
<hi>a pretender to the love of God,</hi> and hast not the love of God within thee? This
unmercifulness of thine will put it out of question. If thou hast no bowels of
compassion, the love of God is not in thee.</p>
            <p>O get a compassionate, and merciful heart. Hast thou received Mercy,
and wilt thou not be merciful? Dost thou hope for mercy, and wilt
thou not shew Mercy? Put thy self into thy poor brother's case a while, think
how hard tis with him, think of <hi>his hunger</hi> and <hi>nakedness,</hi> of <hi>his pressing straits
and miseries,</hi> let thy soul go into his house, and see <hi>his naked walls, his cold
chimney, his empty cup-board, his starveling children:</hi> and then think again
O how if it were thus with me! Ah poor distressed creatures: how
are they <hi>pinch'd</hi> and <hi>pin'd</hi> whilst I have enough and abound? O my <hi>bowels</hi>
how can you but yern? O mine <hi>heart,</hi> how canst thou but bleed over such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
ones? Hast thou nothing to help them? Ther's enough in my house
ther's enough in my purse to yield them relief, but is there no alms for them
in my heart? Can I have the heart to see them pine and perish, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lp them? Where are ye, O my bowels? Where are my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions?
O my soul help, and send portions to them for whom nothing is
provided.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Out of a thankeful heart.</hi> Remember what God hath done for thee;
Hast thou any sense or experience of his special love to thee, in Christ? What
should that produce? The sense of divine Goodness in a way of <hi>Common
Providence</hi> calls for all due acknowledgment from us: But a <hi>taste</hi> of his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
love in pardoning our sins, and justifying our persons, and enstating us
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55174:25"/>
in eternal life and happiness, upon the account of his Son's-suffering, and dying
for us,</hi> this is, as the strongest <hi>Motive</hi> to, so the most <hi>commanding reason</hi> of
our charity, or beneficence to our fellow-creatures, who stand in need of
it.</p>
            <p>In Christ, the beams of Gods mercy are concentred, as the beams of the
Sun are in a burning-glass, which falling upon our hearts, they are, or should
be hereby inflamed, and made to burn with greater heat of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to all in want, especially to all who bear his image. <hi>The right spring
of Mercy to our neighbour, is the sense of God's Mercy towards us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Let all your streams of love flow into the Ocean.</hi> My meaning is, <hi>Let
all be done to the glory of God.</hi> This must be your last end to which all must
be directed, as the Apostle charges, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether you eat or drink,</hi>
I may add, or whether you give to eat, or to drink, <hi>or Whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God.</hi> Let this be chiefly in your eye, and your heart, <hi>that
God may be glorified.</hi> Other subordinate ends there are, As <hi>the refreshing
of the needy,</hi> the <hi>adorning our holy profession,</hi> the <hi>edification of others by our
good example,</hi> but all at last must end here, <hi>that God may be glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed your end be not to glorifie your selves. As <hi>worms</hi> breed in
the fairest fruit; so <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>vain-glory</hi> are apt to creep-up out of the best
duties.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Let your works of charity be done in humility, giving unto God the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of them, by acknowledging that as what you have bestowed on the poor, you
first received from him: So it was his goodness to give you an heart to give any
thing out of your abundance towards their relief.</hi> Yea, you ought to be ever
jealous over your-selvs, lest there hath been some <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>self-seeking</hi>
in your works of <hi>charity;</hi> acknowledging that you are so far from merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>Salvation by your good works,</hi> that, if God should deal with
you according to the rigour of his justice, he might cast you into <hi>hell,</hi> for that
<hi>pride</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie</hi> which cleaves to your best works.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Let your workes of charity to men be accompanied with prayers, and
thanksgivings unto God.</hi> Thank God, that he hath put you amongst the
<hi>givers,</hi> and not amongst the <hi>receivers,</hi> it being <hi>a more blessed thing to give
then to receive:</hi> that he hath put you among the <hi>givers,</hi> and not the <hi>withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi>
that he hath given you an <hi>estate</hi> to give, and an <hi>heart</hi> to give. Thank
God, that he will accept a gift at your hands; that He, whose is all you have,
and to whom it is owing, will count that a gift, which is but the payment of
so small a part of your debt: say with <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chro. 29. 11, 13. Thine, O
Lord, is the greatness: both riches and honour come from thee; Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. But what am I,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55174:26"/>
and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all
things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. <hi>Give out proportionably to what God hath given unto you,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 2. The Apostle
adviseth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to give, <hi>as God had pr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>spered them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rich men therefore ought to be <hi>rich in good wor<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> for God expecteth fruit answerable
to the seed which he soweth. Hath he <hi>abounded</hi> to you in this worlds goods? you ought
thereupon to be <hi>abundant</hi> in good works towards others: your Pounds are <hi>expected,</hi>
where the Widdows mites are <hi>accepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having given you some <hi>Directions</hi> for the <hi>manner</hi> of bestowing your Almes, I shall
briefly shew you the means how to attain to this grace of <hi>Christian Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>means</hi> I shall prescribe, shall be,
<list>
                  <item>1. Such as tend to the bringing your hearts to be willing to this Duty.</item>
                  <item>2. Such as shall tend to the helping of you for the better managing of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, for <hi>means to bring your hearts to be willing to set upon this duty, take These,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oft call to mind, and imprint in your memories the manifold precepts in the Scriptures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
this Duty at your hands. As also the many gracious promises God hath there made for
the encouragement of his people thereunto;</hi> and thereupon reason thus with thy self, <hi>what?
Hath God</hi> commanded me, (Deut. 15. 10.) <hi>to give unto my Brother according to his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity?
to cast my bread upon the waters?</hi> Eccl. 11. 1. And hath our blessed Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, <hi>Luk. 6. 38. to give unto the poor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hath the Lord for my encouragement thereunto promised, <hi>that he will bless me
in all my works, and in all that I put my hand unto, prosper me in my Trade</hi> and <hi>Calling?
That my Barnes shall be filled with plenty? That what we shall give or lend unto the poor, he
will pay us again with Interest? That though I cast my bread upon the waters</hi>
where it may
seem to be lost. <hi>yet I shall find it after many days,</hi> it shall certainly be returned into my
bosome with increase? And hath my <hi>Saviour</hi> for my encouragement promised, Luk. 6.
36. <hi>That if I give unto the poor, it shall be given to me again, good measure, pressed down, and
shaken together, running over?</hi> Then certainly, <hi>there is no such compendious way to thrive and
prosper in the world, as by my liberality to the poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Prefer Heaven and the things thereof before this earth, and earthly things.</hi> Though
the temporal reward which I have so much insisted on, be a great encouragement, yet
the greatest encouragement is the <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> reward that the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And that this may be the more prevailing encouragement, <hi>learn to esteem and prize
things spiritual and eternal above all things that are but temporal.</hi> Suppose it should so fall
out, that you should never receive <hi>in kind</hi> what you bestow, yet count those <hi>temporal</hi>
things put off at the best rate, which you receive in things <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> Value
<hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> above all the <hi>treasures of the earth,</hi> and count your selves to grow rich men,
according to your abounding in grace, and your evidences for glory. And esteem it an
unthristy Saving, and holding in, where you have an opportunity to improve in <hi>your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
man</hi> by expending of <hi>your outward substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till Heaven be valued above earth, this great Argument encouraging to Acts of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and mercy will lose its efficacy. When God says, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters, for
thou shalt find it again after many dayes;</hi> the Worldling will be ready to demand. But how
shall I find it? in what way shall it be returned me? Shall I have <hi>bread</hi> for <hi>bread,</hi> or <hi>money</hi>
for my <hi>bread.</hi> or <hi>houses or Lands</hi> for my <hi>money?</hi> probably thou may'st. But suppose not
so, yet it shall be better than so, thou shalt have <hi>in grace</hi> what thou partest with in <hi>bread</hi>
or <hi>money;</hi> thou shalt reap <hi>in Heaven,</hi> what thou sowest <hi>on the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55174:26"/>
I but the worlding will reply; <hi>I do not mean to part with my bread,
or my money so.</hi> No, I know thou dost not; but the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou lovest this earth more than Heaven. Thou sayest, Will
<hi>Grace</hi> feed me? Will <hi>Grace</hi> cloath me? Can I keep my self, and
my Family? Can we live and be maintained, and preserved from
poverty and beggery here, by hopes of glory hereafter?</p>
            <p>Go fool, and learn better what God is, and what his everlasting
mercy is; let the lasting treasures, the durable riches be more priz'd
and valued by thee, and this will stop thy mouth, and silence thine
heart from such vain reasonings. Thou wilt never again say, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
spare my bread, or my money, when by spending it for God
thou seest thou makest him thy debter, who will pay it thee again
in spiritual and eternal good things, if once thou account these to
be better than thy bread, or thy money.</p>
            <p>But till thou art come to be settled in this Judgement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
both that the good things of God are infinitely better than the
good things of this earth; and that what thou sowest in the earth,
thou shalt certainly reap in Heaven; till thou comest in good earnest
to be of this mind, God's poor are like to be but little the better for
thee.</p>
            <p>'Tis this, beloved, that will effectually do it, will open your
hearts, and open your hands in bounty and liberality for God, when
you come to be rooted in the practical belief of this <hi>principle,</hi> upon
which the practice of all Religion stands, and is upheld in the world;
<hi>That Heaven is better than Earth:</hi> if this other be added to it, That
<hi>what is sincerely laid out for God in the Earth, shall certainly be repayed
in Heaven;</hi> besides that return which the Lord here in this world
oftentimes makes to the charitable.</p>
            <p>2. For the Means tending to help you for the better managing
of it; take these following.</p>
            <p>1. Either follow the Example of the Primitive Saints, in setting
apart something every Lords Day out of the former weeks gettings.</p>
            <p>Or, 2. <hi>Devote unto God a certain portion of thy yearly incomes for
charitable uses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the former way of setting apart something every Lords
Day for the relief of the poor, was the practice of the Primitive
Christians, is clear from that of the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. <hi>Now concerning the Collection for the Saints, as I have
given order to the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>even so do ye. Vpon the first
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55174:27"/>
day of the week</hi> (which is the Lords Day) <hi>let every one of you lay by
him in store, as God hath prospered him.</hi> This way and course concerns
such in special who live upon their daily labours.</p>
            <p>But to such Gentlemen, and others who live upon their Rents
and Offices; and to such Merchants and Citizens who once a year
cast up their accounts, I would commend the latter way of devoting
unto God a certain portion of their yearly income by Rent or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and then separating it from the rest, to account it <hi>a sacred stock</hi>
for the poor, not to be imployed to any other use.</p>
            <p>All men naturally (through the corruption that is in them) are
hard-hearted, and close-handed, very unwilling to part with any
thing considerable upon sudden occasions for charitable uses. But
having aforehand set apart something, their ears, hearts and hands,
are open to every charitable motion, and very ready and forward
are they the more liberally to contribute thereunto of what is laid
by; rejoycing that they have met with so good an object of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>quota pars,</hi> what proportion every one ought to set
apart out of his yearly income for good uses, I do not find it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
set down in the Word of God, and therefore dare not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
determine the same: and the rather, because there are so
many circumstances which alter the case, that no certain rule can be
given, but shall leave it to the discretion and ingenuity of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Christian.</p>
            <p>But though the Scripture doth not determine the exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be set apart for good works, yet doth it command us, <hi>to
give out proportionably to what God hath given unto us; to open our
hands wide to the necessities of the poor; to be rich in good works,</hi> and the
like. Yea the Scripture doth commend unto us the examples of
very bountiful Christians, as of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> who is said to be <hi>full of
good works, and alms-deeds which she did,</hi> Act. 9. 36. And of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
who is said <hi>to give much alms,</hi> Act. 10. 2. And of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
who are said, <hi>to give to their power, yea and beyond their power,</hi>
2 Cor. 8. 3. It likewse commendeth unto us the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
who in testimony of his thankfulness unto God for what he should
bestow upon him, vowed the tenth thereof unto God, for pious
and charitable uses; as <hi>Gen. 28. 20, 22. And</hi> Jacob <hi>vowed a vow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, saying, Of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth
unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:55174:27"/>
These examples are left upon record for our imitation; for as
the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. Whatsoever things were written
aforetime, were written for our learning, and for our admonition.</hi> The
most that I have heard or read of, who have taken this course, to
con<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecrate unto God a certain portion of their estate to charitable
uses, have followed the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi> in giving a tenth part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. And as God did exceedingly bless <hi>Iacob</hi> after his vow;
so hath he likewise blessed very many others, after their like vow
unto God.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Stock</hi> in his funeral Sermon at the burial of the <hi>Lord Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi>
speaking of his Charity, declared that in his life time, he
gave the tenth part of his yearly revenue to the poor. Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
in his funeral Sermon at the burial of Mr. <hi>Iohn Parker</hi> Merchant,
and Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> speaking of his Charity, saith, That <hi>at his
first effectual Call, among other things he then resolved upon, this was
one, to set apart every year a tenth of his gain for the relief of the poor
and needy; and that God from that time abundantly advanced his estate.</hi>
And questionless, if such <hi>Merchants,</hi> who usually ensure their goods
upon their apprehension of danger at Sea, would sincerely promise
unto God, in testimony of their thankfulness unto him, the tenth of
what should come safe into their hands, they might receive far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
returns than they do.</p>
            <p>In the Life of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> I find this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<q>
                  <hi>The rate and summ of what the Doctor devoted, was the
tenth of all his income, wherein he was so strictly punctual, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the first thing he did was to compute, and separate the poor mans
share.</hi>
               </q> And how his stock increased notwithstanding his abundant
giving out to the relief of others, the history at large declareth. The
like I read in the Life of Mr. <hi>William Wheatly,</hi> Minister of <hi>Banbury,</hi>
how for many years he set apart the <hi>tenth</hi> of his yearly comings in,
both out of his <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Means, and that <hi>his
Estate prospered the better after he took that course.</hi> To these I could
add many more out of the Lives of good and charitable men, and
out of several funeral Sermons, which are printed and published.
And could name multitudes of men now living, who have devoted
the like, and greater portion out of their estates for charitable uses,
and are ready to attest the truth of this discourse, <hi>That they are no
losers, but great gainers in Temporals by what they have given to the
poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55174:28"/>
Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> in his Learned and Usefull Piece, called <hi>A
Christian Directory, Part</hi> the 4th. <hi>fol.</hi> 195. of the <hi>quotapars,</hi> what
proportion is meet for most men to devote for charitable uses, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the tenth part of their increase be not ordinarily a fit propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
hath this expression,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Though the proportion of the tenth part is too much for some, and much
too little for others, yet for the most part, I think it as likely a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as it is fit for another to prescribe in particular.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I would not be thought to impose this as a proportion to be
observed by all; for all mens hearts are not alike inlarged with
love and bounty: and some there are who have no more than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the comfortable support of themselves and family; from
whom less is required for the relief of others. But I would advise
such whom the Lord hath blessed with a plentiful estate, so that
their necessary expences are, or might be, far less than their incomes,
to devote a <hi>tenth part</hi> of their <hi>whole</hi> yearly income to charitable
uses: I say, of their <hi>whole yearly income,</hi> without first deducting any
part thereof for diet, cloaths, or other necessary expences; for the
tenth of the remainder will be a very inconsiderable proportion
for a rich man to devote to Charity, and far short of that which
the Scripture seemeth to call for.</p>
            <p>And know assuredly, that this course is so far from being a means
of diminishing your stock and store, that if it be managed as it
ought, according to the forementioned rules and directions, it is the
surest and safest means, the most compendious course of increasing
it, through the secret blessing of God, which accompanieth the same;
which hath been sufficiently demonstrated in the foregoing discourse.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Be careful on whom thou bestowest thine alms;</hi> for by giving to
such common beggars who are able to work, and yet are so lazy,
that they will not work, but would live by the sweat of other mens
brows; I say, by relieving such, we shall both maintain them in their
idle and wicked life; and they who are truly poor, and ought to be
looked upon as the proper objects of our Charity, will be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or at least scanted of that, which of right belongeth to them.</p>
            <p>I am not against the relieving of all beggars; some of them I know
are blind, others lame, aged, and past their work; these <hi>impotent</hi>
poor, in regard of their present condition, are objects of Charity,
but not the <hi>impudent</hi> poor, who have strength enough to work, and
will not, those <hi>canting vagrants,</hi> who are the burthen of the earth,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55174:28"/>
and shame of the Kingdom, for these I have no charity: Neither
had the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who towards God's poor was full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion;
but for <hi>the Devil's poor,</hi> he gave this command, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10.
<hi>That if any would not work, neither should he eat;</hi> that hunger and
necessity might drive them to labour. <hi>Erasmus</hi> mentions a kind of
mercy meetest for such, '<hi>tis misericordia puniens:</hi> Surely the <hi>Whip</hi>
is more their due, than <hi>food: Bridewell</hi> to entertain them, than an
<hi>Alms-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Another <hi>Means</hi> for the attaining this grace of Christian
Charity, is this, <hi>Be earnest with God in prayer, that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to bestow upon thee that adorning and enriching grace of Charity,
and accept thy offering.</hi> This Sacrifice, as it must be offered up to
Heaven; so it must be fetched from Heaven. The gift of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
and charitable heart, is one of those gifts that come down from
above, even the Father of Lights, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17. If thou receivest not
this gift from God, thy poor Brother is like to have no gift from thee.
Now it must be thy prayer that must fetch down this gift from
God. Lift up thine heart to the Lord, and beg a merciful and
compassionate soul; beg of God that he would make thee ready
to every good work, willing to communicate to the poor members
of Christ, according to thine ability, and their necessity, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thou mayest lay up in store for thy self a good foundation
against the time to come, and so lay hold on eternal life: pray for a
willing heart, and pray for acceptance of thy gift, that thine alms
may be such a sacrifice, and so offered up, that therewith the Lord
may be well pleased.</p>
            <p>Having thus shewed you the <hi>Means</hi> on our part to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for attaining and exercising this grace of Charity: I shall close
this discourse with answering two or three Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Some object the greatness of their charge, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their children, who must be cared for, and thereupon have
little to give to the poor.</p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>Hast thou many children, thou oughtest the rather to be
charitable, that thereby thou mayest entail God's blessing upon them,
which is the best portion, and surest inheritance thou canst leave them;</hi>
that will secure their stock, and improve their store; whereas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulness
to the poor will intail a <hi>curse</hi> instead of a <hi>blessing</hi> upon
the persons and estates of thy children.</p>
            <p>2. Thou who objectest the number of thy children as a plea for thy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55174:29"/>
parsimony, how justly may God then lessen the number, and so take away
this excuse, by taking thy children from thee.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Suppose thou hast many children, it may be half a score, reckon
God for one more; give unto him a childs portion;</hi> I mean, bestow upon
the poor, for his sake, as much every year, as one child stands thee
in; give unto them a childs portion, and I dare boldly say, thou
wilt not be the poorer, but rather a great gainer. For thereby wilt
thou procure God's blessing upon thy self and children, which in
truth is all in all; and without which, all is like to come to nothing,
as wee see by daily experience; which made St. <hi>Austin</hi> say, <hi>Haeredi
praestabis, quicquid misericordiae causa de ejus portione detraxeris,</hi> Aug.
de Tempore, Serm. 76. That which thou givest out of thine estate to
charitable uses, will be no loss to thy children, but rather a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
Yea the Spirit of God in setting forth the happiness of a
merciful man, saith, His children shall fare the better for his goodness
and bounty, as <hi>Psal. 37. 16. He is ever merciful, and lendeth, and his
seed is blessed;</hi> that is, God will bless his children, not only with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
but also with temporal blessings.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Many Professors in these daies are very barren in good
works.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Fruitless and uncharitable Christians may make a profession
of Religion, but questionless they are no sound Christians, nor sincere
Professors.</hi> For most certain it is, that <hi>the Elect of God do put on
bowels of mercy and compassion,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12.
And therefore an <hi>uncharitable Christian</hi> is a meer contradiction. For
who is a Christian but he who conforms himself to the Law and
Life of Christ? The substance of whose Law is <hi>Charity,</hi> and whose
Life was spent in going about doing good, some way or other, to
the soul and bodies of men and women.</p>
            <p>Whosoever therefore having this worlds goods, seeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,
and will not communicate any thing considerable towards his
necessities; let his profession be never so specious and glorious in the
eyes of men, yet certainly he is but a rotten Professor, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Hypocrite in the sight of God. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 23. We find
that liberality to the members of Christ is made the special touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of true Faith and Godliness. For they are the charitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who at the great day of Judgment will appear to be the <hi>Sheep</hi>
at Christs right hand, and shall hear that joyful sentence of absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55174:29"/>
               <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for
you, from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye
gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger,
and ye took me in: I was naked, and ye cloathed me: I was sick, and
ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the other side, all unmerciful men, who have not relieved
Christ in his members, whatsoever profession of Religion they have
made here in this world; yet at the last day will appear to be the
<hi>Goats</hi> set on Christs left hand, and shall hear that dreadful sentence
of condemnation, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was an hungred, and ye
gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a
stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye cloathed me not: sick and
in prison, and ye visited me not.</hi> Hence it appeareth, that as mercy
and bounty to the poor members of Christ, is a conspicuous evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of true Faith, and sincere godliness in a Christian, and signal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare him pious: so illiberality, and unmercifulness to them,
is a clear mark of infidelity, and ungodliness, and signally declare
him as an unbeliever; so a wicked and prophane person: Therefore
I should much question the sincerity of their faith and piety, who
making a profession of Religion, shew little or no charity to the
poor members of Christ. For as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, c. 1.
v. 21. <hi>Pure Religion and undefield before God, and the Father, is this,
to visit the fatherless and widdows in their affliction:</hi> Implying, that
works of mercy and charity rightly performed, are clear evidences
of the truth of our Religion, and of the sincerity of our Profession.
And if you look into the Scriptures, you shall scarce read of a man
truly godly, but you may read also, that he was merciful and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
forward to every good work.</p>
            <p>So much shall suffice for this Point of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:55174:30"/>
A word or two for my Brethrens sake of the <hi>first Doctrine</hi> raised
from the foregoing verse, which is the principal Point there intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our Saviour, which was this.</p>
            <p>17. That all needfull succour, and good entertainment ought to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
in special to the Ministers of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour in commending objects to our Charity, in the first
place mentioneth <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Righteous ones,</hi> saying, <hi>He that
receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophet's
reward;</hi> and then addeth, <hi>He that receiveth a Righteous man in the
name of a Righteous man, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, so general must be the extent and emanation of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that it must not exclude any who are in want and distress. For
though we may, and ought to put a difference between men upon
whom we bestow our Charity; yet ought we not to restrain it from
any men who are in want; but must act the <hi>grace of Charity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them who have not the <hi>grace of Faith.</hi> Yea, <hi>we ought to do
good unto all,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Gal. 6. 13. But especially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them who are of the houshold of Faith.</hi> And among them chiefly to
the <hi>Ministers of Christ.</hi> So as this object of Charity, <hi>Prophet,</hi> is
not here to be taken <hi>exclusively,</hi> but by way of <hi>eminency</hi> and <hi>prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
Ministers are <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>above others,</hi> with more <hi>readiness</hi>
and <hi>chearfulness</hi> to be ministred unto.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Israel</hi> we read were commanded once and again
not to leave nor forsake their <hi>Levites,</hi> especially when they were
reduced into any streights and exegencies, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 19. and
14. 27. Then much less should the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel</hi> be left
and forsaken by the people of God, when they lye under any want
or distress.</p>
            <p>The examples of God's people that have gone before us in the
performance of this duty are many, both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
It is recorded to the perpetual praise and commendation
of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> that he hid the <hi>Prophets of God</hi> by fifty in a cave
from the cruelty of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and sustained them with food, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
all things necessary unto them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 13. We read
likewise how the widdow of <hi>Sarephath</hi> nourished the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>
in her house for many dayes and years, even so long as the famin
continued, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 15, 16. The kindness of the good <hi>Shunamite</hi>
to the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> is largely reproved, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 8, &amp;c. <hi>It fell
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55174:30"/>
on a day that</hi> Elisha <hi>passed to</hi> Shunem, <hi>where was a great woman, and
she constrained him to eat bread;</hi> that is, to refresh himself with food.
<hi>And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
bread.</hi> Having found good entertainment, and hearty welcome,
he did the oftner visit the family. <hi>And she said unto her Husband,
Behold now I perceive, that this is an holy man of God, which passeth
by us continually, let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall,
and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</hi>
Under these, other necessary accommodations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized.
The good woman desired of her Husband, <hi>that a chamber
might be made for the Prophet on the wall;</hi> perhaps not that she want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
room in her house to lodge him in, but because she considered,
that the noise of a great family might be some disturbance to the
Prophet's study and devotion; therefore thought it convenient to
provide such a chamber for him, where he might be more retired,
and have the free ingress and egress; that by those accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he might be encouraged the oftner to take up his lodging
there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 2. It is set down as the height and crown of <hi>Phebe</hi>'s
good works, that she had been <hi>a succourer of the Apostle Paul in his
wants and straits.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. we read how <hi>Onesiphorus</hi>
refreshed and relieved the <hi>Apostle</hi> in his suffering condition, and <hi>was
not ashamed of his chain;</hi> that is, though he were a prisoner, and
under restraint for the Gospels sake, yet <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> owned him,
shewed him all respect, succoured and relieved him in that his low
condition. <hi>Gaius</hi> likewise, a godly, wealthy Citizen of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
is famous for that kind entertainment and succour which he gave
to the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and the Church with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 23.</p>
            <p>It is recorded to the commendation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth,
that he afforded all needful succour, and good entertainment to <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
Fagius,</hi> and other Divines, when they fled into this Kingdom
by reason of the troubles in their own Nation. And <hi>Beza</hi> in his
Epistle <hi>ad Regem Iacobum,</hi> maketh an honourable mention of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
collection of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> sent to the <hi>French-Ministers,</hi>
who were banished <hi>Religionis causa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are fair Copies for us to write after. And indeed why are
these things written, and left upon record to posterity, but for our
learning? Not so much for our <hi>admiration,</hi> as for our <hi>imitation,</hi> that
we might follow their steps, and write after their copy; which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55174:31"/>
               <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>testifies of the</hi> Macedonians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. How that very many
of them were stirred up and provoked to a liberal contribution to the poor
Saints at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the forwardness and zeal of the <hi>Corinthians.
And St.</hi> Austin (Confes. lib. 9. cap. 2.) <hi>confesseth, that</hi> the examples of
God's servants, did burn and consume his own lukewarmness; and their
fervent zeal set an edge on his Devotion.</p>
            <p>To these Examples I shall add a few REASONS for the better
enforcing this duty upon you.</p>
            <p>Reas. I. <hi>Because Ministers being supported, are like to be most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Church of God.</hi> They are <hi>Spiritual Fathers,</hi> to beget
men unto Christ. They are his <hi>Anbassado<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs,</hi> and stand in his stead
to reveal the Mysteries of the Kingdom, sent forth to be reconcilers
betwixt God and this sinful world; to pray and beseech them to
be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 20. Their work is to bear the
Name of God, to publish the salvation of God before the world;
to open the eyes of the blind, and to turn them from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are
sanctified: In which respect <hi>Ministers of the Gospel</hi> are more useful
and serviceable in their generation, than either <hi>Lawyers, Physicians</hi>
or <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> which yet are useful enough.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Lawyers</hi> indeed may be a means of settling your Right in your
Goods and Lands: But <hi>Ministers</hi> of settling your Right to your
heavenly Inheritance.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Physicians</hi> may cure the maladies of your bodies: But <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
are sent to cure the diseases of your souls.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Merchants,</hi> and all sorts of Tradesmen may replenish a Land
with all manner of Commodities necessary for this life: But <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
only bring in such heavenly and spiritual treasures as spring up
into the everlasting treasure.</p>
            <p>So that by supplying their bodily wants, you do comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
the souls of many. And what better Charity imaginable, than
by relieving the temporal wants of some few, to further the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
salvation of many? Oh what cause will their souls have to
bless God to all eternity for your Charity, who have been convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Ministry of those whom you have refreshed and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their work!</p>
            <p>Reas. II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Another Reason may be taken from the consideration of the
quality of the persons for whom I am pleading:</hi> They are not so mean
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55174:31"/>
as outwardly they appear. They whom you behold so poorly clad,
walking so djectedly, being destitute of many outward comforts,
are men endowed with many singular prerogatives and priviledges,
not only above the rest of God's people; but likewise above the
most <hi>glorious Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Compare them first with the people of God; they are called the
<hi>Lord's Sheep;</hi> These <hi>the Shepheards of the flock,</hi> Ezek. 34. 2. They <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
in God's family; These <hi>Spiritual Fathers,</hi> who by the seed of
the word beget men unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. Therefore the Spirit
of God vouchsafeth them this dignity, to be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>fellow-labourers with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Angels;</hi> true it is that they and Ministers are <hi>fellow-servants,</hi>
Rev. 22. 9. But yet Ministers have sundry prerogatives
above them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Angels rejoyce at the conversion of a sinner,</hi> Luke 15. 10. But by
the Ministery of <hi>Prophets</hi> sinners are converted unto God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18.</p>
            <p>2. An Angel was sent to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to advise him whither to go
to be instructed: but a Minister instructed him in the way of life,
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. 6. 34.</p>
            <p>3. Was the word of Reconciliation ever committed to <hi>Angels?</hi>
to Ministers it is committed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. It is observable, that
the Embassage of Ministers is not simply <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Message,</hi> but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Gospel,</hi> the gladsome tydings of salvation by Jesus
Christ, <hi>into which the Angels themselves do desire to look and prie,</hi>
as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> expresseth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. The Lord hath also
committed to his <hi>Ministers</hi> the administration of the Sacraments,
which are the seals of his covenant, whereby all his precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are ratified, and confirmed unto us. So that as in respect of
the rich treasures of God's Word committed to their dispensing,
they are the <hi>Lord's Treasurers:</hi> So in respect of the Sacraments,
they are the <hi>Keepers of his great Seal.</hi> If these Officers be great
under mortal Princes, what are they under the King of Kings?</p>
            <p>I have taken the liberty in a few words to set forth some of the
priviledges of the Ministers of the Gospel; partly for the comfort
and consolation of many of them under the present misery and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
which they suffer, rather than to sin against their consciences:
and partly for the incitation of others to afford them that <hi>double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
which the Apostle calls for, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Namely, <hi>the honour
of respect,</hi> and the <hi>honour of maintenance,</hi> that they suffer them not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55174:32"/>
to sink under their burthen, but afford them some seasonable
succour and relief, suitable to their present wants and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>
            <p>Reas. III. <hi>Because Ministers are oftenest exposed to sufferings
and distresses, and so have most need of relief.</hi> The Bow of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of Religion is bent most against the Teachers and Leaders
of the people. That word, 1 <hi>King. 22. 31. Fight neither with
small or great, save only with the King of</hi> Israel, is often changed
into, <hi>Fight neither with small or great, but only against the Prophets
of the Lord.</hi> Smite the <hi>Shepheards,</hi> and the <hi>Sheep</hi> will be scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Experience enough tells the world who they are that are set
in the Front of the Battel, and who are the first that fall by the power
of the Adversaries. And <hi>who should be most in the eye of Charity, but
those that are most in the eye of malice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, For whose sakes is it that Ministers are so often
brought so low? Is it not for your sakes, whose souls are dearer
to them than their own substance? Is it not often upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
because they will be faithful to you, and will not keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
nor cease to watch over you, and to warn, and to instruct you
from day to day?</p>
            <p>Might they not save themselves more whole, if they would
hold their peace, and let the <hi>Devil</hi> alone to have his will of you?
For your sakes no doubt it is, that much of their sufferings come
upon them; and shall they be forsaken by you? The truth is, it
is upon this account a piece of <hi>Iustice,</hi> as well as a piece of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
to relieve and succour them; and so you may do two good
works in one; the same alms may be both a work of righteousness,
and a work of mercy.</p>
            <p>Reas. IV. <hi>Your gratitude to God requireth a cheerful perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of this duty from you.</hi> For wherein can you otherwise
make a suitable return to God, for what he hath plentifully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on you, than by contributing some of your <hi>Temporals</hi> to
them, from whom ye reap so much in <hi>Spirituals?</hi> The Lord of
his free grace and rich mercy hath abounded to you in these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things; <hi>He hath given you richly all things to enjoy.</hi> Yea, as
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh, <hi>He hath loaded you with his benefits.</hi> Now,
not to return some part of your estate to him, who hath given
you all that you do enjoy, were ingratitude in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
And therefore how doth it concern you often to put the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55174:32"/>
               <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s question to your selves, <hi>What shall I render unto the
Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> Psalm 116. 12. Surely one
kindness deserveth another; as God hath been bountiful to you,
sure you are very unworthy, if you be not bountiful to his.
And how do you think he will take it at your hands? Will he
ever say to you, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou hast
been faithful, a good Steward of my many gifts?</hi> Or, is it all one to
you whether he say, <hi>Well done, or not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in regard you cannot directly and immediately requite him
who is uncapable of being enriched by us; <hi>My goodness extendeth
not to thee,</hi> Psalm 16. 2. It will be your wisdom to expresse your
thankfulness to God by being kind to his poor relations. Now,
who are nearer to God than his Ministers? whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to stand in his room, to declare his mind unto his people;
who are as the mouth of the people unto God; so God's mouth
unto the people; who are the Messengers of the Lord of Hosts,
by whose Ministry there is peace concluded, and reconciliation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
between God and man. Surely what kindness you shew
to these, he takes as done unto himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 40.</p>
            <p>Reas. V. <hi>Your relieving the faithful Ministers of Christ, may in
a sense be said tò have something more in it, than if you should shew
your Charity to himself, in his own person, as being a sign of greater
love.</hi> It is but an ordinary thing to return kindness to our dearests
friends; but to extend our good will to their relations, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
for their sakes, is an evidence of much greater love. For
if upon their account only we do good unto these; how much
more would it be judged we should be ready to do it unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if they stood in need of our help? And so will Christ look
upon it: Our bounty expressed to his Ministers he will receive as
an evidence of our more abundant love unto him, which he will in
no wise forget, nor suffer to go unrewarded.</p>
            <p>Reas. VI. <hi>Such as relieve the poor Ministers of Christ, shall
have their blessing, the benefit of their prayers unto God.</hi> They
will blesse you however, though you have no blessing for
them. Though you have not an alms for them, yet they will have a
prayer for you. But their bowels being refreshed by you, you
may expect that their heart will be the more enlarged for you;
and this will be a far greater kindness than you can bestow on
them. Your gift cannot be worth their fervent prayers. In this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55174:33"/>
respect it is much better to give, than to receive; because he that
receives hath but a perishing alms; he that gives, receives an abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blessing, the blessing of prayers.</p>
            <p>Herein did the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> make a large requital to <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
for the kindness he shewed to him in his imprisonment; as
you may read, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 16. The Lord give mercy unto the house of</hi>
Onesiphorus, <hi>for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my
chain.</hi> As if he had said, I received much comfort and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> when I was in prison, for the which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
the Father of all mercies, to shew mercy unto him, and his,
by blessing him, and his whole family, with all blessings, both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
spiritual and eternal. And indeed what blessing can that
man want, who hath a share in many Ministers prayers? which
are available for the obtaining of all good things at the hand of
God, as for themselves, so for others. Yea the very work of
Charity doth bespeak a blessing from God. As the blood of <hi>Abel</hi>
is said to cry to the Lord for a curse or vengeance upon <hi>Cain:</hi> so
every act of Charity cryeth to God for a blessing upon the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable.
Our very acts of Charity in relieving the wants of the
poor, and refreshing their bowels, do pray and cry to God for his
blessing upon us and ours.</p>
            <p>Reas. VI. <hi>Your Charity to them will be hereafter rewarded with
everlasting glory and happiness in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
our Saviour himselfe giveth in these words; <hi>He that recieveth a
Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward;</hi>
whereby is meant that surpassing and excellent weight of glory,
which cannot be expressed by the tongue of men or Angels. Yea,
by the reward of a <hi>Prophet</hi> seemeth to be implyed the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of heavenly glory. For <hi>Daniel</hi> 12: 3. It is said, <hi>That they
that be wise,</hi> that is, the righteous, who are endowed with true spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
wisdom, being lightned by the Spirit of God, <hi>shall shine as the
brightness of the Firmament; but they that turn many to righteousness,</hi>
which is the work of <hi>Prophets, shall shine as the Stars for ever and
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by your bounty to the <hi>Prophets of God,</hi> you may come to
partake of their reward. So that it is your own concernment to
contribute liberally towards their relief. Not that your Charity to
them doth merit that glorious reward; but in regard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God made to all those, who do exercisethe same to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55174:33"/>
his Ministers, it shall be truly given unto them.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>For a word of Application.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh how should the consideration of these things stir up the hearts of
all, especially such as have a blessing in their hand, an estate to give,
to draw forth their souls, and reach forth their hands to the supply of
these wanting servants of God.</hi> Surely this is a time wherein Christ
is trying your love to him, by your Charity to them. Are you not
concerned to make proof of your love to Christ? Have you not an
opportunity before you, and a loud call from Heaven to prove it
in this way? Can you not hear him, that said once to <hi>Peter,</hi> John
21. 16. <hi>Lovest thou me? Feed my Sheep.</hi> Can you not hear the
same voice calling to you, <hi>Lovest thou me? Feed my Shepheards.</hi> Sure
thou art very deaf to the voice <hi>of the Providences of this day,</hi> if thou
do not hear this Call. And will you prove that you have no love
to Christ? What do you else if you suffer his to starve, when you
have wherewith to feed them?</p>
               <p>Beloved, it is through God's free grace, and rich bounty, that
you enjoy such plenty of outward good things, when many of his
Ministers are in great want. What you have, you have recieved
from him. Is it not then most just and reasonable, that you should
return back some part of your estates unto God, by relieving his
Ministers, in testimony of your love and thankfulness unto him for
what you have? Hath God given you hundreds and thousands?
and will not you part with a few pounds or shillings when he calls
aloud unto you for the same, as now he doth in these dayes?
Though the earth be his, and the fulness thereof, yet (in a sense) he
hath sometimes need of your estates. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35. Christ telleth
you of his wants, and sheweth you how, and when he is relieved.</p>
               <p>If you have any spiritual wisdom to discern times and seasons.
you may know, that now Christ stands in need of your helping
hand, now that so many of his Ministers are in want, for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a good conscience: And should you now deny him in his
Ministers, I do verily believe, that if Christ were now upon earth, as
when he first took our nature upon him, and in his own person
should crave your relief, you would turn a deaf ear unto him.</p>
               <p>Though for the present you enjoy manifold blessings; yet how
easily can he pluck them out of your mouths, and if you will not
perform your duty, thrust you down from among the givers, to
take your place among the receivers! Certainly the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55174:34"/>
a part is your best way to secure the remainder, and to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and sanctifie it to your more comfortable use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 41. Saith our Saviour, <hi>Give alms of such things as you
have, and behold all things are clean unto you;</hi> that is, lawful to be
used. The metaphor is taken from the Law, whereby many things
were counted <hi>unclean,</hi> and so unlawful for use; they might not be
touched or meddled with. Yea by the inference of the Apostle;
<hi>Give alms of such things as you have, and behold all things are clean
unto you:</hi> He seemeth to allude to another Rite of the Law about
<hi>First-fruits, Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Free offerings,</hi> by giving which to the Lord,
all the rest which they had were secured, sanctified and made
clean. So that charitable men are they, who may with the more
freedom, quietness and comfort use what they have. Who that
hath any desire to be accepted and appoved of God, would not
have his person, and the actions which he doth, and things which
he possesseth to be clean? Whatsoever is unclean is odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in God's sight: unclean persons might not approach to
God's Sanctuary, nor meddle with sacred matters. If they were
not cleansed, they were to be cut off from God's People, <hi>Numb.</hi>
19 20. <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 20. and every unclean thing was an abomination.</p>
               <p>This thereforé must needs be a strong perswasive to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the counsel of our Saviour, in <hi>Giving alms of such things as
we have, that so all things may be clean,</hi> and sanctified <hi>unto us.</hi> What's
clean you may use with God's good leave and allowance: (clean
things might be eaten) and where you have God's good leave, you
may expect his blessing. It's sin to eat where God's portion is
among it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, it is the great mistake of many, to think that all
their goods are their own, and that they are <hi>absolute Lords</hi> and
<hi>Owners</hi> of all which they possess: Whereas indeed they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Stewards,</hi> than <hi>Lords and Owners</hi> of this worlds goods; all is
the Lords. God of his infinite wisdom hath committed to some
a greater portion of them, than to others, yet not to be impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to themselves, but they must give him his special part, to
which his have as good a right as themselves unto the rest, saving
only that they may not lay hands on it themselves, until you put
it into their hands. But as they may not take it out <hi>of yours;</hi> so
you may not keep it out <hi>of their hands.</hi> Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the right which the poor have to a part of rich mens estates,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55174:34"/>
saith, <hi>Prov. 3. 27. Withold not good from them to whom it is due, when
it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</hi> So that relieving the poor is
not only an act of <hi>Mercy,</hi> left to our choice to do, or leave undone;
but also, as I said before, an act of <hi>Iustice,</hi> to the performance
whereof we stand bound. Hence <hi>to give alms,</hi> and <hi>to do Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Iustice,</hi> are oft in Scripture put the one for the other, both
signifying the same thing. Therefore the <hi>Septuagint</hi> have rendred
the Hebrew word signifying <hi>Righteousness,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>alms deeds.</hi> And in <hi>Psalm.</hi> 112. 9. It is said, <hi>His Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
endureth for ever;</hi> that is, his <hi>alms,</hi> or his <hi>mercifulness;</hi> as is
clear from the foregoing words; <hi>He hath dispersed, he hath given to
the poor; his Righteousness endureth for ever:</hi> Whereby is implyed,
that <hi>giving of alms is one special branch of that Righteousness and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
we owe to our poor neighbours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And darest thou yet hold it in thy hand? Wilt thou wrong the
<hi>Almighty</hi> of his <hi>right,</hi> and rob <hi>his poor</hi> of their <hi>due?</hi> If it be nothing
with thee to be unmerciful, is it nothing neither to be a <hi>robber? a
robber of God? Will a man rob God?</hi> Mal. 3. 8. Dares any man be
so wicked? How canst thou but expect that he will make a <hi>forcible
entry upon thee,</hi> and take what is his own, and seal a <hi>Writ of Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against thee,</hi> and turn thee out of all that ever thou hast?
Look not to be long in quiet possession of what thou hast; but fear
lest either God should take thine estate from thee, or thee from
thine estate, and give thee thy portion with <hi>Dives,</hi> who because he
denyed his <hi>crumbs</hi> to satisfie poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> his hunger, was himself
denyed a <hi>drop of cold water</hi> to quench his own heat and thirst, <hi>Luke</hi>
16. 23. Upon which words St. <hi>Austin</hi> thus glosseth, <hi>Ideo rogans
Dives non exauditur in tormentis, quia rogantem pauperem non exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divit.</hi>
Therefore was not <hi>Dives</hi> heard when he prayed in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
because he hearkened not to the poor that begged of him,
when he was upon the Earth. <hi>Aug. Serm. de Divite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me add a few quickning words to set home what hath been
spoken, by these following Questions.</p>
               <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Now at length,</hi> What dost thou think of mercy and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the poor?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Is there not an excellency in it?</hi> Oh how much of God is there in
it! <hi>There is faith in it;</hi> He that will cast his bread upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is it not a sure sign that he believes God, who hath said, that
it shall be returned again? <hi>There's the love of God in it:</hi> He that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55174:35"/>
                  <hi>sees his Brother in need, and shutteth up the bowels of his compassions
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> And he that openeth
his bowels, and draws forth his soul to God's hungry ones, who
can deny but the love of God dwelleth in that man? <hi>It is the
Image of God's goodness.</hi> God is a merciful God, and his mercy is
his glory; and this glory of God shineth forth in his merciful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
<hi>There is self-denyal in it.</hi> Self would keep all; flesh would
hold back; it cannot spare for God; 'tis a sign that self is laid low,
that the flesh is kept under, that the interest of God is the sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
interest, when whatever God will have, this self is not suffered
to keep back. Is there so much of God in mercifulness, and is there
not an excellency in it?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Is there not a necessity of it?</hi> Shall the merciless ever obtain
mercy? Canst thou hope for mercy who wilt shew no mercy.</p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What dost thou think of thy self?</hi> Art thou merciful, or
merciless? How dost thou find it? Is thine heart open? are thy
bowels open? or are they still shut? Dost thou feel that heart of
thine inclined and resolved to open thy hands, and to disperse, and
that liberally the good things thou hast received, as a good Steward
of the manifold gifts of God? Or dost thou yet feel that the door
is shut, thine heart is hardned against shewing kindness to the Lord?
Give thy plain judgment, what thinkest thou? Art thou a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man, or merciless? and if merciless, How dost thou hope to
obtain mercy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. What dost thou think of thy worldly goods?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Are they not thy Talents, committed to thee for thy Lord's use?</hi>
Must thou not be accountable to him, how they have been laid out?
Will it be a comfortable account when thou must bring in thy Bill;
so much for thy pride, so much for thine appetite, or all hoarded
up for thy covetousness, and nothing or but little for God?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Are they more worth than Treasures in Heaven?</hi> Is it more to
thine advantage to be rich in this worlds goods, than to be rich in
good works? Dost thou in good earnest judge, that thy laying up
treasures on earth is better husbandry, than thy laying up in store for
thy self a good foundation against the time to come?</p>
               <p>Qu. 4. <hi>What dost thou think of the state of many of the servants of
God in this age?</hi> Are there no wanting ones? no distressed ones?
What neither amongst Ministers, nor Christians? Are they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for? Do not many of them eat the bread, and drink the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55174:35"/>
of affliction? Is it not very strait and very short with them? Do
but enquire after their condition, and thou wilt find it so. Art thou
one of those that carest not how it fares with the poor friends of
Christ? Are they not worth the enquiring, and looking after? or at
least, Is not he worthy, whose they are, and whom they serve? Is
not Christ worthy, for whose sake thou should'st shew kindness to
his? How will he take thy neglect of them? Remember that word,
<hi>Matth. 25. 45. Inasmuch as ye did it not to these, ye did it not to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 5. <hi>What wilt thou do for the future?</hi> What shall be the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of these few words that are written for thy learning? What
art thou resolved upon? for mercy, or for cruelty? Consult thine
own heart; lay not by this little Book, till thou art come to a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
one way or other, either to accept, or reject this counsel,
which in the name of the Lord is offered thee for thy good. Oh
shew thy self a man in whose soul Christ hath an interest, and so
great an interest, that thou wilt do any thing at his word; pity at
his word, relieve at his word, give, lend, feed, cloathe, refresh the
bowels of his needy ones: Let thy soul say, Lord, at thy word I
will do it: here's my bread, and my flesh, and my money, command
what thou wilt of it, I will not say thee nay. Thou hast given me
a large portion, and every one of thy servants that thou appointest
to receive it, shall have their part; for thy sake, Lord, they shall
have it. Thine I am, and thine is all that I have; shew me thy
pleasure, how much, and how often, and where, and to whom I
shall bestow it, and through the grace of God there it shall go.</p>
               <p>Friend, Wilt thou say thus? Wilt thou in the presence of the
Lord come to this gracious resolution? or canst thou yet find in
thine heart to deny thy Lord, and continue to be as hard-hearted,
and close-handed as thou wer't wont to be? Dare not to say, Lord,
my goods are mine own, I owe thee nothing: Dread such thoughts,
that how much soever thou hast, the servants of Christ shall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the better for it.</p>
               <p>Once again consider, thou art put to this choice, either to accept
of the counsel of Christ, or to reject it; which of the two wilt thou
do? If thou resolvest not on mercy, and liberality, thou rejectest
the word of the Lord; and if thou rejectest his word, thou rejectest
the Lord, and therein sayest, He shall be no Lord for me. But if
thou acceptest, then go, and do accordingly: Let the hunger, and
the thirst, and the nakedness; the wants and distresses of his servants
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55174:36"/>
feel in that relief they shall receive from thee, that thou art a man
to whom the Lord hath not spoken in vain. Let them feel it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
and let them feel it constantly; this year, and the next year,
and the next, even whilst they have need to receive, and thou hast
it by thee to give. This do, and the Lord accept thee; remember
all thy offering, and accept all thy sacrifices; the Lord hear thee
in the day of thy trouble; the name of the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> defend
thee: The Lord grant thee according to thine own heart, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
all thy counsel: The Lord remember thee with the favour he
beareth unto his children, and visit thee with his salvation.</p>
