         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE VINDICATION OF VVILLIAM PRYNNE Eſquire, From ſome ſcandalous Papers and Imputations, nevvly Printed and Published, to traduce and defame him in his <hi>REPUTATION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHere as A ſcandalous Paper have been newly printed and publiſhed in my Name by ſome of the <hi>impriſoned Stage-Players,</hi> or Agents of the <hi>Army,</hi> intituled Mr. <hi>William Prynne</hi> his <hi>Defence of Stage-Playes,</hi> Or, <hi>A Reſtraction of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book of his called</hi> HIS TRIOMASTIX, of purpoſe to traduce and defame me: I do hereby publikely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to all the world, the ſame to be a <hi>meere Forgery</hi> and <hi>impoſture,</hi> and that my <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>opinion</hi> concerning <hi>Stage Playes</hi> and the <hi>Common Actors</hi> of them, and their intollerble miſcheivouſneſs in any Chriſtian ſtate, is ſtill the ſame, as I have more amply manifeſted it to be in my HISTRIOMASTIX. And whereas another Pamphlet hath been printed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, with this title. <hi>The examination of Mr.</hi> Wil. Prynne <hi>by order of the Houſe</hi> of Commons, <hi>with his Anſwer:</hi> wherein is related. <hi>That the two Members appointed to know Mr.</hi> Prynnes <hi>Anſwer, whether the ſcandalous</hi> Pamphlet <hi>to which his Name was ſet was his? and whether he would owne it?</hi> repored this anſwer, <hi>That when a ſufficient authority ſent to Him, he would returne a ſpeedy anſwer;</hi> Which anſwer is to be conſidered of on Thurſday-next: that there is a miſtake in this Report: which I conceive my ſelfe bound to rectifie, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole truth, which is as followeth. That on Friday laſt about five of the clock at night, Mr. <hi>Humphrey Edwards,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fry,</hi> came to my Chamber, to the <hi>Kings head</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> &amp; without ſhewing me any order, or commiſſion; told me: <hi>that they were ſent to me by the houſe of Commons to aske me a queſtion:</hi> which was, <hi>Whether a Booke they then produced, and held in their hands, were mine, or not?</hi> not reading the Title, nor any part of it; but J conceived it was the <hi>Memento,</hi> To whom J returned this anſwer. <hi>That I knew of no authority they had to demand this queſtion of me; that</hi> I <hi>neither knew nor took them to be Members, their elections being both void and illegall, and ſo proved at the Committees which examined them, who had voted them ſuch, and therefore they ought not to ſit, being voted out of the Houſe. And that this was all the anſwer</hi> J <hi>ſhould returne them: Who ſhould be alwayes ready to give an anſwer to any queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any book</hi> I <hi>had written in a legall way,</hi> when it <hi>ſhould be demanded by a lawfull authority.</hi> M. <hi>Fry</hi> anſwered, that though his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was voted voyd by the Committee, that it was not reported to, nor voted void by the Houſe, and therefore he might ſit, TO which I replied, <hi>That no man after his election was unanimouſly voted voyd by the whole Committee, being ſo foul as his and Mr. Edmonds were, had the impudency to ſit and vote in the houſe, til they made the preſident.</hi> Whereupon they departed ſomewhat diſconted. This is the reall truth of all that paſſed between me &amp; them, Which I thought it my duty to publiſh to the world to avoid miſtakes: &amp; ſo much the rather, becauſe the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> counſell of the Army</hi> in their <hi>Anſwer</hi> of Jan 3, <hi>touching the ſecured and ſecluded Members:</hi> p, 4, 5, complain of many abuſes in the New Elections; and <hi>that the elections of many honeſt men have been long ſuſpended under examination, and kept off from tryall by practiſe of the ſecluded Members,</hi> when as in verity, the greateſt abuſes of this kind that ever were, have proceeded from the Officers and their parties; moſt of the elections of their adherents being very foule and void, &amp; petitioned againſt, being kept off by their parry, from examination, and report: by reaſon whereof, the two forementioned Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Blagrave,</hi> (whoſe Election is voted void long ſince) and divers others now ſitting, have been kept in the houſe againſt al right and juſtice, when as there is not one ſecluded Member for ought J can learn whoſe election is not fair and legall. In witneſſe whereof <hi>I</hi> have hereunto ſubſcribed my Name;</p>
