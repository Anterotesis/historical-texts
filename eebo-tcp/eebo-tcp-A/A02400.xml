            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>in his
time was this vniuerſall Head.</hi> Againſt which poſition, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration ſhall be this: The Kings and Gouernors which liued in the time of <hi>Peter,</hi> had more authoritie ouer their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians which liued in their do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minions, then <hi>Peter</hi> had: <hi>Peter</hi> therefore was not vniuerſally the Chriſtians Head. That thoſe Kings and Gouernors
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21933:14"/>
had ſuch authority more then <hi>Peter</hi> had; wee proue: becauſe they ſtood more deepely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from God, to improoue thoſe Chriſtians vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God then <hi>Peter</hi> did. For the only end why God giues authoritie vnto men ouer one another, being this; that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde may bee the more fully improued vnto his glory; hee by that meanes hauing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not onely of particular perſons, but alſo of Societies, Families, Cities, Countreys and Kingdomes, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie follow, that ſuch as are more deepely charged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue a companie vnto Gods glory, muſt alſo haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power and authoritie ouer that company which they ſo ſtand charged with. Now that thoſe Kings were more deeply
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21933:14"/>
charged ſo to improue thoſe Chriſtians then <hi>Peter</hi> was, we thus proue; by they had greater meanes ſo to doe: euery mans charge being anſwerable vnto his meanes,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> 
               <hi>vnto whom much is giuen</hi> (as our Sauiour tels vs) <hi>there being much of him to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and, the more mighty</hi> (as Salomon addes) <hi>being to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſorer triall.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiſd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.8.</note> Now that the meanes of theſe kings were greater then the meanes of <hi>Peter,</hi> we thus finally declare: firſt becauſe it was in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to protect thoſe their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Subiects from perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; ſo to open a doore vnto their preaching; whereas <hi>Peter</hi> was not able ſo much as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect himſelfe noe not to ſaue his owne ſhoulders from the whipp. Secondly for that it was alſo in there powers to

ſhift but muſt alwayes ſleepe in his cloathes and ſhooes, and with his weapons about him of neceſsity. The meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which thoſe Kings had for the improouing of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians vnto the propagation (yea plantation) of the Goſpel, muſt be acknowledged to bee farre greater then the meanes of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo conſequently there charge to be greater. For though it is eaſily granted that thoſe Heathen Kings did little regard or feele any ſuch charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather abuſed and hated the meanes thereof; yet is not that materiall; our queſtion being, not what there feeling or practice was, but what their duty and charge was: which if it was greater then <hi>Peters,</hi> then alſo by the proportion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Iuſtice, their authoritie

For admitte that hee which hath Supremacy in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls, ſhould haue neuer ſo little command, were it but of the leaſt finger of the hand, or the leaſt digit of the foote, yet might hee by meanes of it, either draw the ſeruice of the whole body, or ſo crampe and torment the whole body, as that he which ſhould haue the command of all the reſt, ſhould haue no ioy, nor ſeruice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: much more then if he hath ſo great a ſhare as the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirituals may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto; &amp; that not only in

            <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> therefore muſt haue any Supreamacy at all (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſpiritualls) he muſt of neceſſity haue all: Souerainty (like <hi>punctum</hi> or <hi>vnitas Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica</hi>) being vndiuidable. For

though Souerainty may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in diuers perſons, as namely in a State (as it is ſeated in but one in a Monarchy) yet muſt the Authority in euery man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date goe together; as likewiſe euery perſon muſt obey it, not at halues, but with his whole man; and <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.10.</note>

But <hi>Peter</hi> ſo ſurpaſſed all men in his time: <hi>Peter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt bee the ſupreame. Wherevnto we anſwer; that neither of the grounds are found. For as we acknowledge no cauſe why <hi>Peters</hi> gifts ſhould bee eſteemed of a more infallible and diuine element then others of the time (as by and by we ſhall more fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) ſo neither is the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be granted which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth, that the more ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a man is, the more he ſhould be poſſeſſed with Authoritie.

Though truly and properly the Lord only is the Shepheard, in reſpect of whom all Kings, Gouernors, and

Will; whereunto though it be a guide, yet is it alſo a Subiect; the Will hauing power to in force both obiects and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vppon it.<note place="margin">Axioma Theolog.</note> As therefore the Moone and not the Sunne, is ſaid to rule the Night, though all the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Moone rules, ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues of the Sunne: So hee which poſſeſſeth the Throne muſt be eſteemed the ruler of the people, and not hee which is poſſeſſor of the Light; though it muſt bee confeſſed that all good rule is by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the light. And as the Sunne beeing beneath the Moone, and vnder the Earth, can doe nothing in the time of the night, but ſo farre foorth as it can caſt his beames into the lappe and capacitie of the Moone, which by vertue of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21933:21"/>
her conſpicuous eminency hath onely the power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe light vnto all that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: ſo the Spirituall man during his being (as it were vnder the earth) in an earthen veſſell, and in a priuate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can doe nothing with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but in the vertue and power of him that ſits in the Throne: the maine reaſon heereof being this; for that the rude and ignorant (for whoſe only ordering and gouernment Authority is imparted vnto men) can incomparably better deſerne who is a poſſeſſour of the Throne, then who is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo by that meanes more certainely know whom they are to obey. For as in Wedlocke, had the Lord ordained that the holier or the wiſer of the two ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21933:21"/>
be the Head, there muſt needs inſue continuall diſcord and vncertainty in the Family, who ſhould bee the Head: the woman often times being (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at leaſt) the holier, wiſer &amp;c. whereas hee expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining that the man ſhall be Head (which with the leaſt turne of the eye is diſcerned) ſo all controuerſie is ended, and the weakeſt of the Family ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reſolued, who (in caſe of difference about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) ought to be obeyed. So in greater ſocieties, had the Lord ordained that the moſt holy, or the moſt ſpirituall ſhould bee head, there muſt needs haue inſued the like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and diſcord who hee ſhould be: hee that is holy or ſpirituall to day, being apt to be otherwiſe (at leaſt in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)

For, though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Vſurpers may get poſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Crowne or the Sword; yet is that nothing ſo hard to diſcerne, as who is a falſe Profeſſor of the Spirit: Time, place, perſon, diſcent, records, and titles (which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men can iudge of, and lay together) being of ſufficient force to detect who is an Vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: all which though they bee but circumſtances, yet are they

ſuch, as a man can haue no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the diſcerning his owne father, whom notwithſtanding he ſtands charged in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to obey. Better therefore that authority bee tyed to the Crown, then to the Spirit; and that not only in regard of mans neceſsities, but alſo more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the effecting the Lords owne purpoſes; who by this meanes can correct or ſcourge a whole Nation, and yet ſmite onely one particular perſon: namely by ſuffering their Prince or Head to becom a Tyrant or a Babe: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as himſelfe hath taught vs) <hi>a woe muſt befall the whole Land:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 3.4.</note> whereas were the Crowne continually kept and poſſeſſed by the Spirit, ſuch a kind of Rod ſhould finde no place. For as concerning thoſe which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21933:23"/>
thinke there is no neceſsity for this conſequence, becauſe in caſe a Babe or a Tyrant ſupplies the Throne, the whole Nation neede not be obnoxious vnto any ſmart thereby, for that it is thought lawfull, yea neceſſarie to cut off ſuch Babes and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. We anſwer, that ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is not only moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and preſumptuous againſt God, but alſo moſt prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, monſtrous, vniuſt, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous before men. Firſt, moſt impious it is; becauſe it is the common Ordinance of God that wee ſhould obey and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Princes; yea that wee ſhould honour our particular Fathers, much more the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the whole Country: ſo farre muſt wee bee from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing them, eſpecially in caſe of their imbecillity. How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21933:23"/>
then muſt they needs be, which will handle their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no better then caityfes, and moſt deſperate members? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, moſt preſumptuous it is, both for that it puts him by, whom the Lord will haue raigne, namely that Babe, or that Tyrant for the purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; and alſo for that it does interpoſe a Iudgement ſeate betwixt the Lord, and him whom the Lord will haue his moſt immediate, his very next, his owne Annointed. And as for the monſtrouſneſſe of it, it appeares in this: both for that it ſuppoſeth a power in the Body aboue the Head; namely that power which muſt cut the Head off; in the roome of which head, in caſe another head ſhould grow vp; yet muſt it ſtill bee vnder that power of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21933:24"/>
the Body; which is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous; and alſo (in caſe no ſuch head growes vp) for that either the Body muſt remaine without a head (which will ſtill be monſtrous) or ſome other member muſt ſupply the heads place which will be miſerably ridiculous: For when the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour members which cannot diſcerne a Head from a Hand or a Foote, but only by the outward ſhape and figure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhall ſee (ſuppoſe) a hand or at leaſt that which is like a hand to be in the place of the head; they muſt needs a great while take it for but a fellow member, and ſo not doe it that reſpect and obedience which to the Head is due; and then when at length after many admonitions they haue learned to ſee the power of an Head vnder the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21933:24"/>
ſhape of an hand; yet withall when they ſhall alſo learne how that hand came there; namely by cutting off the vnſound or fooliſh Head: what remaines but that they thinke it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (at leaſt lawfull) for them to obſerue whether that Hand be found, or whether ſome fit of a <hi>Chyragra</hi> be not growing vpon it: which if they finde; what elſe but that ſome other member be thought of for the place? and then who perhaps ſo likely to put forward as the Foote? which if it attaines to the place of the Head; as it muſt needs be a miſerable ſhame and confuſion to the Domeſticke members, ſo how can it bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then a moſt horrible ſcorne vnto the forraigne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? and as good ſport as the walking of men with their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21933:25"/>
heeles vpwards, is to idle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. Yea what more vniuſt euen in the eies of common Senſe, then that the Maſter-builder ſhould bee at this paſſe, either to giue account of the ſoundneſſe of his worke vnto thoſe which are beneath him; or elſe to be at their mercie to haue the Stage pulled from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him? But, Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I feare mee you thinke I haue committed an excurſion; and yet I pray ſuffer mee to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one Obiection more, which is thought to be of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiue force for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling the Spirituall man to the Throne before any: and it is this. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> vpon his fall did forfeit all the domini- and titles which the Lord vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Creation had ſet him in: Such therefore as haue no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21933:25"/>
other birth but from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> can haue no title to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions or authorities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: and therefore they which are borne of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (vnto whom the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> inheritance muſt lapſe vnto) muſt be the only true Heires thereof; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as men are more or leſſe borne of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (that is, as they are more or leſſe Spirituall) they ſhall more or leſſe haue titles to Kingdomes, Lordſhips, properties or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities whatſoeuer, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Wherevnto wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; firſt, that though <hi>Adam</hi> vpon his fall did looſe the ſweetneſſe of his dominions (the curſe of God inuading it) yet does it not follow but that he might ſtill retaine the ſtate and title thereof; euen as a rich
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21933:26"/>
man when hee falls into ſome tormenting deſeaſe, and ſo hath no ioy of all his riches, yet ſtill remaines ſeazed and poſſeſſed of his riches neuertheleſſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the eſtate and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God gaue vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> though it might be a ioy &amp; dignitie vnto him, yet was it principally to bee taken in the nature of a charge; which charge it was not in <hi>Adams</hi> power to auoid or forfeit vpon his treſpaſſe and fall, but rather to double and increaſe it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: a mans voluntary daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his abilities, being no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for his duties; negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence being of no more force to diſcharge vs, then voluntary ignorance is to excuſe vs. Thirdly, that the Lord did make vnto the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall grant of vniuerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21933:26"/>
and dominion, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly find (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. &amp;c.) but that hee did reuoke the ſame we finde not. Paradiſe indeed, both the heauenly (the fruition of God) and alſo the earthly (the Garden of Eden) we find expreſly that it was taken from him: but wee alſo finde as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that it was giuen him only vpon condition of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: whereas the donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vniuerſall dominion had no ſuch condition annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Fourthly, had <hi>Adam</hi> apprehended that ſuperiority and dominion ſhould vpon his Fall, be conueyed vnto men by the courſe of Grace, and not by the courſe of Nature: hee would neuer haue intitled his vngracious firſt borne vnto all his poſſeſſions, as the name <hi>Cain</hi> ſignifies, and left nothing for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21933:27"/>
his beſt-borne, but (the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brothers portion) vanitie, as the name <hi>Abel</hi> ſignifies. Fiftly, the Lord euery where ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Hethen Princes in their States and Kingdomes; as <hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchadnezar, Cyrus, Ahaſhueroſh, Darius, Caeſar, &amp;c.</hi> who had no kind of right ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hath his originall only from (conſecrated reaſon) the Law of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom only they were diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> being to them vnknowne;) it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teach that no reuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of originall Dominions did follow vpon the fall.</p>
            <p>But finally and principally, and in ſtead of all, may be this; for that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and his line (vnto whom only ſuch ſuppoſed forfeiture was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21933:27"/>
did neuer make the leaſt title or claime thereunto: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he was firſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or when he was firſt made manifeſt in the fleſh. For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time when hee was firſt promiſed, ſo farre was hee then from taking any vantage of the Fall; as that the firſt mention of him did promiſe a Succour againſt our Enemie that gaue the Fall; in theſe words: <hi>The ſeede of the Woman, ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> Likewiſe his firſt-borne <hi>Abel</hi> (who by faith in him <hi>offered the the good Sacrifice</hi>) was ſo farre from attayning any ſuperiority by vertue of his being borne of him, as that it proued the only cauſe of his earthly ruine: his <hi>Brother therefore hating him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his works were good</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.12.</note> and his works (wee know) being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21933:28"/>
therefore only good, becauſe he was borne of him. So alſo the Patriarkes and holy men in their times; did they not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies account themſelues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſers then gainers by this ſecond birth? they euery where vndergoing tributes and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages more willingly and more faithfully then any.</p>
            <p>And as for the time of the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> manifeſting himſelfe in the fleſh; ſo farre was he then alſo from claiming any of the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> rights, as that vpon all occaſions, hee profeſſeth the maine intent of his comming, to be for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of his loſſes, euen though it were with the loſſe of his owne life: euery where ſtyling himſelfe no better then <hi>The Sonne of Man</hi>; which the meaneſt of <hi>Adams</hi> Race might
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21933:28"/>
aſſume as well as hee: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as often telling vs that his Kingdome was not of this world; that he came not to be miniſtred vnto, but to miniſter; that he had not whereon to lay his head, and refuſing ſo much as to arbitrate a matter betwixt two brethren (which the moſt priuate perſons that are may be allowed to doe) leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to take vpon him the Office of a Iudge, and ſo leaue a conceit in his followers that ſome degree of Authority might bee deriued from him: euery where finally preſcribing ſuch courſes, and aduiſing all that deſired to grow great in him, to exceed only in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, preferring therefore a child before them all, when they <hi>ſtroue who ſhould be the greatest:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 20.25.</note> and telling them (in effect) that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21933:29"/>
authority and greatneſſe was to bee deriued only from the Kings of the Nations.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> For whereas after his aſcention hee tells vs that <hi>All power was giuen him both in Heauen and in Earth,</hi> His meaning therein is only this; that now all power both in Heauen and Earth ſhould be vnder his humanitie, as before it was vnder his Deity; and that as all men, euen <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe and all his race were formerly vnder him as he was the Sonne of God: ſo now they ſhould likewiſe bee vnder him as hee was the Sonne of man. For the effecting thereof there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no alteration of States, or new conueyances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that as all other creatures both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and in Earth; whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Beaſts, Wormes, Plants, Stones, or whatſoeuer; are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21933:29"/>
likewiſe become ſubiect vnto this manhood, and yet ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their orders, natures, and properties as before: Angels remaining Angels; Beaſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Beaſts; Lyons, Lyons; Stones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stones, &amp;c. ſo does it no otherwiſe follow but that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind may likewiſe become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto the manhood of God; and yet all men ſtill to continue in their former properties: Kings, remaining Kings; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Princes; Fathers, Maſters, Husbands, Wiues, Subiects, Sonnes, Seruants, in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition; and (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles tell vs) <hi>Euery man in the ſame calling wherin he was called,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.24.</note> as well after his birth in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> as in the firſt. For as the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did not thinke good to be the Father of a new generation by the courſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21933:30"/>
of Nature; wherewith to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his Church, but made choiſe of the old <hi>Adams</hi> iſſue to new graft vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be a courſe moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereunto, that when he meanes to adorne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpangle his Church with Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Crownes and Authorities, He will not make new Crowns or new Scepters, or take away Crownes and Scepters from the old poſſeſſors, to adorne his followers withall: but only new graft vpon thoſe old Crownes and Potentates; and ſo moſt ſweetely bring it to paſſe, that though hee does not make his followers Kings, yet does hee make Kings his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Which as it is all one for the outward glory and countenance of the Goſpell, ſo it is farre more agreeing with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21933:30"/>
the propertie and profeſſion of the Goſpel; namely in winning Kings vnto the grace of God, by gentle, eaſie, weake, and peaceable meanes; making choice of Sheepe, and not Wolues or Lyons for his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and that when hee ſends to Wolues and Lyons and worſe then Tygers: that ſo thoſe Rebells in the day of viſitation when they ſee how the Lord hath dealt with them, and how in ſtead of ſheepe hee could haue ſent wolues and Lyons in their owne kinde, to haue worried and deſtroyed them; then as ouercome with the coales of fire which his long ſuffering had caſt vpon them, they with all their hearts and ſoules, preſent him and his Goſpell with their Scepters, Crownes, Dignities, and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21933:31"/>
yea they thus breake forth into moſt vehement and ſincere proteſtations (as our ſo Chriſtian Soueraigne hath taught them) <hi>vnto his Maieſtie alone I haue deuoted my Scepter,<note place="margin">Remonſtr. Anglice. pag. <hi>249.</hi>
                  </note> my Sword, my Penne, my whole induſtry; my whole ſelfe with all that is mine in whole and in part: I doe it, I doe it, in all humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his vnſpeakable fauour, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>to whoſe ſeruice as a moſt humble homager and vaſſall, I conſecrate all the glory, honour, luſtre and ſplendor of my earthly Kingdomes.</hi> Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, that neither diuine ordinance, nor Church bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, does inforce or perſwade this ground (without which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be intitled vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Soueraignty;) that the more ſpirituall men are, the more they ought to bee poſſeſſors of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21933:31"/>
Authority: which concluſion alſo were it granted, yet would not <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſue, vnleſſe it bee alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that in Spirituall gifts and graces <hi>Peter</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity bee acknowledged to ſurmount all perſons: which we grant not. For as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Text and collections which vſe to bee alleadged for that purpoſe; as namely that <hi>Peter</hi> is ordinarily firſt named when the Apoſtles are rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 2. That our Sauiour <hi>three ſeuerall times gaue him charge to feede his ſheepe.</hi> 3. That our Sauiour particularly told him that he had <hi>prayed for him.</hi> 4.

               <hi>Rocke,</hi> and promiſed to builde <hi>his Church</hi> vpon him. 8. Gaue him the <hi>Keyes of heauen.</hi> 9. And finally, wrought eſpecially by him in <hi>the Primitiue Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres.</hi> We thus ſhortly anſwer them in order.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt concerning his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall priority, we anſwer, that it is not of force to intitle him vnto any principality; it being not auoydable amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the moſt equals, but that there muſt bee ſuch kind of precedency; as for example in the Trinity: though neither is <hi>Peter</hi> euery where firſt named; both <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 1.40</note> 
               <hi>Andrew</hi> being ſometime na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. And as for our Sauiours triple charging him to <hi>feed his ſheepe:</hi> wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, That it is rather a checke then a grace, to bee often called vpon to doe a dutie: and in that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21933:32"/>
it is ſaid that <hi>Peter was ſory when it was ſaid vnto him the third time, &amp;c.</hi> it may ſeem that <hi>Peter</hi> took it no otherwiſe; as perhaps conceiting ſuch tripling of his charge, to bee in the way of a glance at his triple denial. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the like conſideration of <hi>Peters</hi>
weakneſſe (wee anſwere to the third) might proceed our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours telling him, that <hi>He had praied for him.</hi> For no doubt our Sauiours praier was as frequent &amp; effectuall for the reſt, though he ſaw not the like cauſe to tell them ſo much. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. And as for
our Sauiours paying the tribute for him; we anſwer, that it may rather argue <hi>Peters</hi> pouerty and ſubiection, then any kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and dominion: the reſt alſo perhaps not being lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the tribute which was then demanded; either becauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21933:33"/>
they were no dwellers at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, as <hi>Peter</hi> was; and ſo it might bee if it were the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors tribute; or for that they were not the firſt borne in their Families, of whome onely the other tribute (toward the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) was demanded. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. And as for our Sauiours ſo ordinary diſcourſing with <hi>Peter</hi>; wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it is ordinary with natural Fathers, to make choice rather of their little ones to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and diſcourſe withall, then their men growne ſonnes; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when their intent therein is to teach ſtanders by; the moſt ready anſwerers rather then the more wary being fitteſt for ſuch purpoſes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21933:33"/>
Saul, Paul; Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn Boanerges</hi>; which name being by interpretation <hi>the ſonnes of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> may farre better reſemble perſons of Authoritie, then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> new name of <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tros</hi>; for that a <hi>Stone,</hi> as thoſe names ſignifie, is more fit to make a Subiect then a Head, if names ſhould bee regarded. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. Now as for our Sauiours
tearming <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to build <hi>His Church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him</hi>; we anſwer, that neither doth that Text giue <hi>Peter</hi> any higher preheminence, for that the reſt of the Apoſtles were ſtyled by higher termes then ſo; euen no leſſe then abſolute and ſeuerall foundations of the Church; the wall <hi>of new Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> being ſaid (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.14.) <hi>to haue twelue foundations, and in them the names of the twelue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21933:34"/>

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.23.</note> 
               <hi>they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> though to ſpeake truely and properly, neither <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> nor any mortall man euer had power to remit ſinne, but onely as the Prieſts in the Old Law had power to cleanſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie; which was only by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing according vnto the Leuiticall Rules,<note place="margin">Leuit. 13.</note> who were cleane, and who not; the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Leproſie being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

But to conclude; for as much as wee can finde no neceſsity for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging ſuch Superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of <hi>Peters</hi> Spirituall gifts; nor (were that granted) any ſtep to Authoritie thereupon; nor that the Kings and Gouerners in <hi>Peters</hi> time did looſe there Soueraignty ouer their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Subiects; it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be, that <hi>Peter</hi> was vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally the Head of all Chriſtians in his time: and ſo the ſecond Linke of the maine Chaine proues of no force. The next is this:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:21933:41"/>
               <hi>Only the Succeſſors of Peter muſt be theſe vniuerſall Heads in their times:</hi> whereunto wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; firſt, that the Founder of the Church, Ieſus Chriſt, did neuer ordaine that any Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, gifts, or capacities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould bee conueyed to any of his members by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Secondly, that hee neuer diſabled or excepted againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Line, Tribe, Nation, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or Continent whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, from taking as high place in his Church, as his Church afforded: Thirdly, when his will was in the time of the Old Law, to haue the Prieſthood goe by Succeſsion; He did both ſpecifie the Line wherein it ſhould paſſe, namely the Line of <hi>Aaron</hi>;<note place="margin">Num. 17.</note> (confirming alſo the ſame by the miraculous bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod) and alſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21933:42"/>
expreſly ſet downe all the rites and ceremonies, which ſhould be ſtricty obſerued at euery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall conſecration; yea, the very garments wherwith euery Succeſſor at his annointing,<note place="margin">Exo. 29.29.</note> ſhould be inueſted, were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Since therefore in the new Law, no ſuch Line or Tribe is mentioned, no rites appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no garments or manner of conſecration inioyned; it muſt be a forcible argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that in the new Law no ſuch Succeſsion was euer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for that the new Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, not vnto one People, but vnto all people, not for a time but for euer; had much more needed ſpecifications of perſons, places, ceremonies and circumſtances then that which was but for one particular Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and in continuall expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21933:42"/>
to vaniſh away. Fourthly, when in proceſſe of time the Church ſhall attaine vnto ſuch an amplitude, as ſhall reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the corners of the Earth; If none muſt then be head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but the Succeſſour of <hi>Peter,</hi> it muſt follow that <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour ſhall bee intollerably ſurcharged: For either he muſt haue more gifts then <hi>Peter</hi> had, or no more; if more, then is he more then <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſour. But if no more; there is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie nor proportion in it, that he whoſe charge is a thouſand fold greater then <hi>Peters,</hi> yet ſhall haue no greater meaſure of gifts to diſcharge it then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had. Finally, for as much as the Lord hath told vs, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and ſit with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham Iſaac and Iacob, and the

               <note place="margin">Ezch. 18.</note> 
               <hi>nor a godly Sonne any thing the worſe for his vngodly Father:</hi> the courſe alſo of the times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring vnto vs, how holy Kings had vnholy Sonns to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede them: and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as good King <hi>Iotham</hi> hauing a wicked Sonne <hi>Ahaz</hi> for his Succeſſour, and he a good Son <hi>Hezechia</hi> for his Succeſſour; and hee a wicked Son <hi>Manaſſes</hi> for his Succeſſour, and hee a good grand-child <hi>Ioſiah</hi> for his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21933:43"/>
Succeſſour; and hee a wicked Sonne <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> for his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſour: It may ſufficiently reſolue a Chriſtian mind how farre it is from the purpoſe of God, that his gifts and graces ſhould goe by ſucceſſion. For though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times a good and godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a good and godly Son to ſucceed him, yet was not that by vertue of Succeſſion, but by vertue of Gods grace immediately directing the Son, as well as the Father: euen as to day may be as faire a day as yeſterday, and yet not becauſe it ſucceeds yeſterday, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sunn ſhines as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vpon it, as it did vpon yeſterday. Finally, (for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) whoſoeuer challengeth Supremacy in the Church by vertue of Succeſſion, does plead no leſſe then flat contradiction:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21933:44"/>
For whoſoeuer is Supreame Head of the Church, muſt bee immediate vnto God himſelfe; But whoſoeuer claimeth any thing by vertue of Succeſſion, does of neceſſity imply, that there is a perſon betwixt him and the Lord; namely his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor from whom his vertue is deriued.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The next Linke of the Chaine is this: that <hi>Only the Biſhops of Rome were the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Peter in their times.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer; Firſt, that no diuine record does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch ſo much, or ſo much as mention any by the name of Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>: and therefore the knowledge of any rites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Sea, can not bee materiall vnto a point of faith. Secondly, as it is not certainely agreed vpon, who that Biſhop
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21933:44"/>
was which immediately Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſome affirming <hi>Liuius,</hi> ſome <hi>Clemens,</hi> and ſome <hi>Clitus</hi> to bee the man) ſo can there be no cauſe ſhewne, why ſom Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs be he. For firſt, if holineſſe of life were ſufficient to make a Succeſſour; ſo euery Chriſtian might be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor as wel as any Biſhop of Rome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if beſides holineſſe of life there muſt alſo concurre ſoundneſſe of Doctrine; yet ſo alſo any Paſtor may as well be his ſucceſſour. Or if yet further ſuch a quantitie of charge as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had, bee requiſite vnto the conſtitution of his Succeſſour; yet ſo alſo euery ordinary Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan is able to be his ſucceſſor. Or if yet further, the foure fold qualifications Apoſtolicall, namely <hi>Immediate calling, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21933:45"/>
of commiſsion, Infallibility of Iudgement,</hi> and <hi>Vniuerſality of Languages</hi> muſt concurre to make ſuch a Succeſſour: yet, as the firſt Biſhops of Rome are no where avouched to bee thus qualified more then others, if ſo much; eſpecially if they knew no Language but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and came to their places by Election, which is no <hi>immediate Calling</hi>; So neither will ſuch quallification make a Succeſſor vnto <hi>Peter</hi> more peculiar, then vnto the reſt of the Apoſtles vnto whom ſuch foure-fold qualification was common: wherein then ſhall conſiſt the marrow and quiddity which makes the Roman Biſhops the peculiar Succeſſours of <hi>Peter?</hi> For, ſhould it be ſuppoſed that ſome peculiar impoſition of hands did paſſe from <hi>Peter</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21933:45"/>
the firſt Biſhop of Rome (wherewith the Holy Ghoſt was giuen in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) or ſome portion of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſpirit was giuen to that firſt Biſhop (as the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> was vnto <hi>the Seauenty</hi>) or that <hi>Peters</hi> garments were put vpon him (as the garments of <hi>Aaron</hi> were vpon his Succeſſours) or ſome ſuch like Rite of conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;<note place="margin">Num. 11:15</note> yet for as much as thoſe kinde of ceremonies,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.26.</note> when they were vſed had no vertue in themſelues but were diuiſed by the wiſedome of God, for the ſhaddowing and concealing his owne miraculous and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate operations (as our Sauiour and the Apoſtles vſed <hi>Spitle,</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> and <hi>Hemmes</hi> of garments, <hi>Napkins, Partlets,</hi> &amp; <hi>Shaddowes</hi>) the intitling any Biſhop of Rome vnto <hi>Peters</hi> vertue, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
