         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>The Defendant pleads to the Jurisdiction of this Court;
and says,</head>
                     <p>That by the Law and Custom of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons sitting, the Parliament,
according to the Duty of his Office, as Servant to the House,
ought, and ever has accustomed, to Speak, Sign and Publish
such Proceedings of that House, and in such manner as he shall
be ordered by the Commons so assembled.</p>
                     <p>And that such Speaking, Signing or Publishing, according to
the Law and Custom of Parliament, are the Act and Doing
of the Commons themselves; and hath ever been so accepted
and taken, and not as the Speakers own Acting or doing.</p>
                     <p>And that the Speaker, for such Speaking, Signing or Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by him made or done, sitting the Parliament; and by their
Order, ought not to answer in any other Court or Place, but in
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>He further says, That at the Sessions of Parliament at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
the 15th. of March, 31 Car. 2, held by Prorogation,</p>
                     <p>One <hi>William</hi> Viscount <hi>Stafford</hi> and others, were impeached
by the Commons, before the Lords, according to the Law and
Custom of Parliament, of High Treason,</p>
                     <p>For a most execrable Conspiring to kill the King,</p>
                     <p>And to Alter and Subvert the Ancient Government, and the
Laws of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>And to Suppress the true Religion established in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>And to root up and destroy the Professors of it.</p>
                     <p>And that afterwards, in the Sessions of Parliament, held by
Prorogation, at <hi>Westminster, 21 Octob. 32 Car.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>The said Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> at the Prosecution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
was Tried, and Convicted, and Attainted, in due Form
of Law, by the Temporal Lords then assembled in Parliament,
for the High Treasons, of which he was so Impeached by the
Commons.</p>
                     <p>As by the Record of Parliament does appear.</p>
                     <p>He further says, That in the opening of that Session,</p>
                     <p>The King, in his Speech to the Lords and Commons, charged
them to pursue a further Examination of that Conspiracy, with
a Strict and <hi>Impartial</hi> Enquiry.</p>
                     <p>And the King then told them, That he did not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
nor them secure till that matter was throughly done.</p>
                     <p>He further says, That in the same Sessions of Parliament, last
mentioned, which continued at <hi>Westminster</hi> till 10 <hi>Jan. 32 Car.</hi> 2.
both Houses of Parliament, in pursuance of his Majesties said
Direction, made a Strict and Impartial Enquiry after that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</p>

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57483:3"/>
And upon that Enquiry, in the same Sessions of Parliament,
last mentioned, the said <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> in the said Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
named, did upon his Oath exhibit to the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the said Libel (entituled, <hi>The Information of</hi> Thomas
Dangerfield, <hi>Gentleman</hi>) as his true Information of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy:
And delivered it to the Lords, which was and is there
Recorded, as by the Record thereof in Parliament does appear.</p>
                     <p>And he also delivered it to the House of Commons in the same
Parliament, at the Bar of that House.</p>
                     <p>And the said Commons then ordered, That that Information
(among others, then before given in at the Bar of that House,
touching the said Plot) should be entred in their Journal.</p>
                     <p>And that all the said Informations should be printed, being
first Perused and Signed by their Speaker:</p>
                     <p>And that the Speaker should name and appoint the Persons
that should print them:</p>
                     <p>And that <hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi> should have the Benefit of the
Printing of his Information.</p>
                     <p>And the Defendant further says, That he was a Member of the
House of Commons during all the Sessions of Parliament, last
mentioned, and was duly Elected and Made their Speaker, and
was so all that Sessions.</p>
                     <p>And that by virtue of, and in pursuance of the said Order, as
Speaker of the House, afterwards, during that Session, <hi>sc. 10

said County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He did Peruse the said Information, so exhibited by the said
<hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi> to the Commons, and he Signed it by putting
to it his Name, <hi>viz. William Williams,</hi> Speaker of the House of
Commons.</p>
                     <p>And then and there appointed <hi>Thomas Newcomb</hi> and <hi>Henry Hills</hi>
(being the Kings Printers) to Print that Information, according
to the said Order of the House of Commons.</p>
                     <p>And thereupon the said Information afterwards, and during
that Session, <hi>sc. 10 Nov. 32 Car.</hi> 2. was printed by those two
Printers.</p>
                     <p>And that the said <hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi> had the Benefit of that
Printing, according to the Order of the House.</p>
                     <p>Which Setting to of his Name, and Appointment of the said
Printers to Print the said Information, are the same Causing and
Appointing of the Printing and Publishing of the Libel in the

                     <p>THe Information taken singly by it self,<note place="margin">Introduction.</note> (without the
Defendents Plea) contains a very Severe and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Charge in it, against the Defendant, set out
with the highest Aggravations:</p>
                     <p>And this against a Gentleman of the Profession of
the Law, and one who hath had the Honour to be Speaker of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>We may observe in this Information the worst of <hi>Adjectives</hi>
or Epithites fastned upon the Defendant: It stiles him, A <hi>Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
and <hi>Seditious</hi> Man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It charges him with the worst of</hi> Actions; <hi>sc.</hi> Stirring up of
Sedition, Disturbing the Peace of the Kingdom, endeavouring to
procure Ill-will between the King and his Subjects; and to bring the
<hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> into Contempt with the King and his Subjects; and with
the Printing and Publishing <hi>a False, Scandalous, Seditious and
Infamous Libel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Crimes and Actions are set out in Mr. Attornies Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the worst of <hi>Adverbs;</hi> and with a great Heap of them
together; <hi>viz.</hi> That these things were done by the Defendant,
<hi>Falsly, Vnlawfully, Vnjustly, Wickedly, Maliciously, Scandalously,
Seditiously</hi> and <hi>Devillishly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to add (if possile) to all this, it is charged to be done
out of one of the basest Principles: Out of <hi>Malice;</hi> and for one
of the most Sordid and Odious Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> For <hi>his own Lucre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may further be observed, That the Information does not
alledged or affirm, That there is any such Person in the World
as <hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi> (though it mention the Name;) nor
that any such Person did ever Frame or Draw up any such Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and Libellous Book or Information, as is mentioned in
Mr. Attorneys Information.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57483:5"/>
But (for all that, Mr. Attorney shews) the Name of <hi>Thomas
Dangerfield,</hi> may be but a feigned or borrowed Name, and that
the Defendant may be the Author and Composer of this Libel,
as well as the Publisher.</p>
                     <p>And one would not imagine, upon reading Mr. Attorney's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that any thing of these Matters, thus charged, was
ever transacted in Parliament: But Mr. Attorney gives them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Date, both of Time and Place.<note place="margin">Time and Place not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, unless the Defendant make them so, by his Plea, (as here.)</note> He does not lay the Scene
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> but at S. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> and he <hi>times</hi> it
to the Year 1682. whereas there was no Parliament in that
Year. This was warily done.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Case stands upon Mr. Attorney's Information, and
should it be left here, it would be a wosul Case with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant;</p>
                     <p>But as <hi>Solomon</hi> says in his <hi>Proverbs;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first in his own cause is just, then comes the other party
and enquires into him.</p>
                     <p>The plain English of which is (as we use to say) <hi>One Tale is
good till another is told.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Defendant, in his Plea,<note place="margin">Plea.</note> states the matter truly and fully,
and tells us, That there is nothing true in this Information exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
against him, save only that there was such an Information
of <hi>Dangerfields,</hi> but that the Defendant was none of the Author.</p>
                     <p>It was drawn up and delivered in to both Houses of Parliament,
first to the Lords, upon Oath; and there ordered to be entred in
their Journal: And afterwards delivered at the Bar of the House
of Commons.</p>
                     <p>And that the Defendant, being Speaker of the Commons, he
examined that Information of <hi>Dangerfields,</hi> and directed the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: But it was all done in time of Parliament, and ordered
to be done by the House of Commons.</p>
                     <p>By this Narrative of the Plea, all the unlucky Adjectives and
untoward Adverbs are thrown off, and the Defendant cleared
from the Malice.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it true that is said in Mr. Attorney's Information, To
be done for the Defendants Lucre. He did it out of Obedience
to the Parliament; and he denies that he made any Profit by it,
but according to the Order of the House; the Profit of the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was to <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> And all this is confessed by the Demurrer.</p>
                     <p>The Plea consists of these Parts: Matter of Fact, Matter of
Record, and Matter of Law.</p>
                     <p>It begins with Matter of Law; and sets down the Law and
Custom of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Then he does assume the Matter of Fact, and of Record, and
brings them home to that Law.</p>
                     <p>He tells us, That, <hi>for certain,</hi> there was such a thing as a
Popish Plot, and that it was a Desperate, Horrid, Devillish
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57483:5"/>
Plot. And here all the bitter Adjectives and Adverbs would
have been well bestowed, rather than upon the Speaker of that
Parliament; which Parliament with such admirable Zeal and
Courage did prosecute some of those Plotters.</p>
                     <p>He sets forth, That—the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
Convict before the Lords of High Treason, committed
in that Plot; and he was Covicted at the Prosecution of the
Commons, according to the Law, and Custom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>He says, That the King in his Speech to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
charged them to make a further strict and impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after this Plot.</p>
                     <p>Then the Plea tell us, They did accordingly make an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Enquiry, and diverse others were thereupon convicted of that
Plot.</p>
                     <p>It now appears plainly, That all that is contained in this Plea
was not only done during the Parliament, but by the Parliament
it self; and that the Defendant only acted as Speaker.</p>
                     <p>And it is worth the remembring too, That there has been ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parliament since, namely that at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though all that was done by him in the Parliament at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> was then very well known and remembered; and
though he were so Pernicious and Seditious a Man, in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mr. Attorneys Information, yet the World had a better
Opinion of him, for he was chosen Speaker again, in that lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Parliament, and his Majesty approved of him.</p>
                     <p>At last, the Defendant concludes his Plea <hi>to the Jurisdiction of
this Court: viz.</hi> That what he had so acted,<note place="margin">Conclusion of the Plea.</note> being acted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
time, and by Order of Parliament, he demands the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Court, Whether they will take Conusance of it.</p>

                     <p>THe Subject Matter of this Record is a very large Field, viz.
The Power and Jurisdiction of Parliament, and yet I
shall have but a narrow Path to walk in. It is a very Nice and
Tender Point: It is my Case, as it was heretofore with those

nor yet on the other hand, shall I be wanting in that Duty I owe
to the Kingdoms Cause. I shall speak my mind freely in it, and
leave the Success to God.</p>
                     <p>And while I must argue for the freedom of acting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

may have the liberty instantly to explain my self.</p>

                     <p>1. That what is done in this Case, is done in a course of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and that in the highest Court of the Nation (the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and according to the Law and Custom of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>2. That however, that which is done in this Case, is not to be
imputed to the Defendant, who acted in it but as the Servant or
Minister of the Parliament, though in a very honourable Station.</p>
                     <p>3. That these being Matters transacted in Parliament, and by
the Parliament, this Court of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> ought not to take
conusance of them; nor hath it any Jurisdiction to judge or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of them.</p>

                     <p>But what has been done by the Defendant, and by the House

slanderous News, whereby Discord may grow between the King
and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm, is to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
till the first Author of the Tale be brought into the Court.
This comes near our Case; and this is all the Punishment that
the Statute inflicts upon this Crime of reporting such a Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>Sir. <hi>E. C.</hi> in his Exposition upon this Stat. in his <hi>2d. Instit.</hi> 228.
says, That this Stat. extends only to <hi>Extrajudicial Slanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore (says he) if any man bring an Appeal of
Murder or Robbery against any of the Peers of the Realm, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Charge be false, yet shall not the Peer have an Action
<hi>De Scandalis Magnatum,</hi> neither at the Common Law, nor by
this Stat. of <hi>W. I.</hi> nor any other Stat. for any such Appeal, nor
for affirming the Matter of it to be true, either to Councel or
Attorney, or for speaking the same in Evidence to a Jury.</p>
                     <p>It was the Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">Lord Beauch. Case.</note> 13. <hi>H. 7. Keilway, 26, 27,

<hi>Keble,</hi> of Council for the Lord B. admits, that at the Common

                     <p>But <hi>Keble</hi> was of Opinion, that this Statute of 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. did

Yet where there is but a Mistake of the Jurisdiction, if the Suit be

the Court in that Case, <hi>viz.</hi> The Words appear not to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of Malice: And no Actions of this sort, nor will any

words that a man in discharge of his Function or Calling is led by

                     <p>In the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> written by <hi>Fox,</hi> there is a Story of one
<hi>Greenwood,</hi> who lived in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that he had perjur'd himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in testifying against a Martyr that
was burnt in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time; and says (<hi>Fox</hi>) this <hi>Greenwood</hi>
afterwards, by the just judgment of God, had his Bowels rotted
in him, and so he died.</p>
                     <p>This Story by <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> was utterly false
of Mr. <hi>Greenwood,</hi> and after the Printing of that <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Greenwood</hi> was living in that very same Parish.</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Prist,</hi> a Parson, happen'd to be Presented to the Living
of that Parish where this Mr. <hi>Greenwood</hi> then dwelt; and 27.
<hi>Eliz.</hi> in one of his first Sermons, happen'd to inveigh against
the Sin of Perjury; to which his Text did lead him; and the
better to deter the People from the Sin of Perjury, he told this
Story out of <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> and named the very Man
Mr. <hi>Greenwood;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenwood</hi> himself was then in the Church,
and heard this Story told of himself, but the Preacher knew it
not, but thought the Story to be true. <hi>Greenwood</hi> brings an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Slander against <hi>Prist</hi> the Preacher; and upon the Trial of
the Cause before the <hi>Lord Chief Justice Wray,</hi> the Case appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be thus, he directed the Jury to find for the Defendant,
for that it appear'd it was not done out of <hi>Malice:</hi> And <hi>Ch. I.
Popham</hi> affirm'd it to be good Law, it being a Matter deliver'd <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

This Case is cited by Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in Sir <hi>Henry Mountagu's</hi> Case,
before mentioned. <hi>Crook. .</hi> f.. 90.</p>
                     <p>With this agrees the Case of the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> against <hi>Denny</hi>
a Vicar, 4 <hi>Rep. 13. b.</hi> in an Action <hi>de Scand. Magn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a Case in many Circumstances of it much resembling
our Case.</p>
                     <p>It was the Case between <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Crashaw,</hi> and others <hi>M. 20 .</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> in Sir <hi>Jeffr. Palmer</hi>'s Rep. 315.</p>
                     <p>An Action upon the Case is there brought against the Defendants,
for maliciously causing the Plaintiff to be indicted of Treason;
upon which Indictment the Grand Jury found an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Action the Defendants pleaded Not Guilty, and were
found Guilty.</p>
                     <p>It was moved in Arrest of Judgment; That to accuse one for
Treason was not Actionable, for the Safety of the King and
State: For if a Man be subject to an Action for it, it will be a
means that Treason shall be smothered, and Men will not expose
themselves to Actions, by making such Discoveries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. Houghton</hi> held the Action would not lie upon an <hi>Ignoramus</hi>
found; for by that the Party is not acquitted, but may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
again and Convicted.</p>
                     <p>But he holds, That if he be Indicted, and upon Trial <hi>Legitimo
modo acquietatus,</hi> then he shall have an Action upon the Case, in
Nature of a Conspirary; for now he is absolutely acquitted and
cleared of the Accusation, and never can be Indicted again for
that particular Fact.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dodderidge</hi> agrees with <hi>Houghton,</hi> and puts this Case;</p>
                     <p>If an Action of Conspiracy be brought against a Man, For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
the Plaintiff of Treason, <hi>The Defendant may Plead</hi> Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
(and that is the safest way of Pleading) <hi>That he heard the
Plaintiff speak such and such Treasonable Words, and that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
complained to a Justice of Peace,</hi> who committed the Plaintiff
upon it, and this (says he) shall excuse him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ley,</hi> Chief Justice, inclines too against the Action, and gives
a strong Reason, Because (says he) it is Misprision to Conceal
it; and yet if we allow of this Action, it shall be Dangerous too
to discover it, so that the Defendant does <hi>Lupum auribus tenere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so the Judgment was arrested.</p>
                     <p>But we find, that soon after, when the Judges of that Court
were chang'd, the same Plaintiff brought a new Action for the
same Cause: And it was adjudged for the Plaintiff, That the
Action would lie; but the Judges acknowledged it was the first
Precedent. I suppose it was upon pleading Not Guilty. Perhaps
the Court might have been of another Opinion, had the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
pleaded specially, and justified, according to the Opinion of
Judge <hi>Dodderidge.</hi> The Case is <hi>Cro. Car. 15 &amp; Latch.</hi> 79.</p>
                     <p>The allowing of such Actions of Conspiracy, or upon the Case,
or of Indictments or Informations for what is said or done in a
Course of Justice, and especially by way of Discovery of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
would prove of a mischievous Consequence;</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57483:8"/>
And would be an occasion of multiplying Actions against the
Parties to the Suits, against Councel, the Attorneys, the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and so Suits would be infinite.</p>
                     <p>As in this present Case, Should an Action be adjudg'd to lie
against the Defendant for what he has acted by Authority
of Parliament, what a multitude of Actions would be stirred
up by it?</p>
                     <p>If the Speaker be liable to this Information for what he
has done; by the same Reason he would be liable to the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the several great Persons that are said to be defamed by
the Printing of <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Narrative.</p>
                     <p>And if the Speaker be liable, who acted but by Command of
others, and as their Minister, how much more would all those
Persons be ilable, by whose Command he so acted?</p>
                     <p>And how many Narratives have there been printed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
several great Persons were severely reflected on, and how
many Votes of the like Nature have there been Printed?</p>
                     <p>So that there would arise a Multitude of Suits.</p>
                     <p>In Sir <hi>Drue Druries</hi> Case, 6. <hi>Rep.</hi> 74. The Justices in
judging of that Case, give a very good Rule and Caution:
They say, That Judges ought to have good Consideration
in all Cases depending before them, not only of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Cases, but also of the <hi>Consequences,</hi> What general
Prejudice may ensue upon them either to the King or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>The Case before you exceedingly requires that Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
                     <p>The Prejudice to the King will be, that he will not be Safe,
for by this means Men will be discouraged from discovering
Treasons.</p>
                     <p>The Subjects will receive Prejudice, by the multitude of Suits
that will arise by it.</p>
                     <p>This mas suffice to be said in maintaining the first Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That no Information or Action lies for what is said or done
in a Course of Justice.</p>
                     <p>The Minor Proposition is,<note place="margin">The Minor Proposition.</note> That what is here done by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
in this Case, was done in a Course of Justice, and in a
Legal Proceeding, and that in the highest Court of the Nation,
(in the Court of Parliament) and done according to the Law and
Custom of Parliament. This I must make out in the next Place.</p>
                     <p>In the making this out, I am under a Necessity of speaking
of the transcendent Power of the High Court of Parliament,
and I must assert these Positions following.</p>
                     <p>1. That the House of Commons was originally, and from the
first Constitution of the Nation, the Representative of one of
the three Estates of the Realm, and a part of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>2. That what is done by either House, according to the Law
and Usage of Parliament, is properly, and in the Judgment of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57483:9"/>
Law, the Act of the whole Parliament: And that what concerns
the One, must of necessity concern the Whole; not meerly by
Consequence, but by an immediate Concernment, as being One,
and Entire.</p>
                     <p>3. That what hath been acted in our present Case, by the
Defendant, as Speaker, and by the House of Commons, whose
Minister he was, and by whose Command and Order he did
What he did, was done according to the Law, and Usage of
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>As to the first,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as now elected, have ever been a part of the Parliament.</note> That the House of Commons was from the first
Constitution of this Kingdom, a part of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>There has been an Opinion, that hath been stifly maintained
by some Divines, and others of late,</p>
                     <p>That the House of Commons originally were no part of the
Parliament, at least not as now elected, and consisting of Knights,
Citizens and Burgesses; but that their Beginning was in the
forty ninth Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. when that King had given a
total overthrow at the Battle of <hi>Evesham,</hi> to <hi>Symon Montford</hi>
Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> and the Barons.</p>
                     <p>And that to ballance the Power of the Barons, that King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses to be chosen, and to
make a Part of the Parliament.</p>

                     <p>Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in his 12. <hi>Rep.</hi> 64. delivered his Opinion freely in the
Case of Prohibitions, before the King and the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;

Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And what Sir <hi>E. C.</hi>
deliver'd for Law, was with the clear consent of all the Justices
of <hi>England</hi> and Barons of the Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>And there Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> says, it was greatly marvell'd at, that the

Courage that grave Chief Justice Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> answer'd the King
himself in that Debate. When the King was pleas'd to say, It
was Treason to affirm, that the King was under the Law: The
Chief Justice answer'd him with the Words of an ancient Judge,
and Author of our Law (that is, out of <hi>Bracton</hi>) That the
King was <hi>Sub Deo &amp; Lege.</hi> And <hi>Fleta,</hi> another of our ancient

his Discourse of the <hi>Powder-Treason:</hi> Which proves it the more
seasonable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is a Time</hi> (saith King <hi>James</hi>) when no man ought to
keep silence.<note place="margin">Fol. 223. of his Works.</note> It hath (says he) been ever held as a general Rule
in all well-govern'd Common-wealths, whether Christian, or
Ethnicks, That when either their Religion, or their King, or their
Countrey was in any extream hazard, no good Countrey-man
ought then to with-hold either his Tongue or his Hand according
to his Calling or Faculty, from aiding to repel the Injury, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Violence, and avenge the Guilt upon the Authors.</p>

To support the Power and Priviledge of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as being an essential part of the Parliament;<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as now constituted, began before 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</note> it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to make it out against these Innovators, that the
House of Commons have ever been a part of the Parliament,
and that they were long before 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>Or otherwise they are but precarious in their power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and enjoy them but of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Every Priviledge is by Prescription, says the Lord <hi>Dier,</hi> fol.
60. <hi>a. med.</hi> in <hi>Trewinnard</hi>'s Case, which I shall have occasion to
mention more at large before I have done.</p>
                     <p>And in the same <hi>Dier,</hi> fol. 70. in the Case of <hi>Withers</hi> and <hi>Ise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
it is held, That a man cannot prescribe to an Incident or
Appendent, nor indeed to any Power or Authority where the
Principal Thing hath not had a perpetual continuance.</p>
                     <p>Therefore where the beginning of a thing is known, there
can be nothing belonging to it by Prescription.</p>
                     <p>In one of our late Kings Reigns,<note place="margin">Rushw. Hist. Collec. <hi>Part 1. fol.</hi> 52.</note> the House of Commons in an
Address of theirs, made mention of their Priviledges, as their
ancient and undoubted Right and Inheritance: But Offence was
taken at it, and they were told, it had been better if they had
said their Priviledges were deriv'd from the Grace and Permission
of the King and his Ancestors.</p>
                     <p>Now I shall clearly prove that these Powers and Priviledges
were indeed their ancient Right and Inheritance. Which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unless that House, or the Commons by their Representative,
have been ever from the beginning of the Governm ent a part and
member of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>I shall prove it out of several authentick Authors of the Law,<note place="margin">Proof that the House of Commons have ever been a part of the Parl.</note>
Historians and Antiquaries, and by a multitude of Records, and
by divers Acts of Parliament, which are all the sorts of Proof
that can be in a Question of this Nature.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mirrour of the Justices,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In his Pref. to his 10th. Rep.</note> of which Book Sir E. C. says,
That most of it was written before the Conquest (as appears by
the Book it self) <hi>Tho. Horn,</hi> a Learned man, added much to it
in the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 1. in this <hi>Mirrour of the Justices, c. 1. sect.</hi> 3.
It is said that King <hi>Alfred</hi> Ordain'd for a perpetual Usage, That
twice in the Year or oftner, if need be, the Parliament should
assemble. And to let you see of whom that Parliament did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
he tells us in the same Chapter by whom the Laws were
then made. It is (says he) among other things, ordain'd, that
no King should change his Money, nor impair it, nor inhanse it,
nor make any Money but of Silver, without the assent of the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>All the Commons.</hi>
                     </p>

Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>9th. Rep.</hi> tells us, That Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in Ancient Demesn, because by their Tenure they were
bound to Plow and Husband the Kings Demesnes, before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
And in the Conquerors Time, had divers Previledges,
which they claimed by Prescription; and among others, <hi>Not to
contribute to the Wages of the Knights of the Shire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Priviledge must be as Ancient as their Tenure and
Service, for their Priviledge comes by reason of their Service,
and their Service is known by all to be before the Conquest, in
the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, and in the time of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
And it is expresly said by this Learned and Reverend Judge,
That these Tenants, in Ancient Demesn, claimed this by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription;
and it could not be so, if the Wages of the Knights
of the Shire had begun within Memory of Man, or of
any Record. Therefore it clearly follows, That Knights of the
Shire to serve in Parliament, and the paying Wages to them for
their Service, has been Time out of Mind, and did not begin
49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. for that is within Time of Memory in a Legal
Sence.</p>
                     <p>The same Argument is used by a Learned Lawyer and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> in his <hi>Archion,</hi> or Commentary upon the
Courts of Justice, fol. 57, and 239, and 245. where the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that the Parliament was used in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, and then
consisted of the King, Lords and Commons, as in the time of
King <hi>Ina. Anno</hi> 712.</p>
                     <p>He does affirm, That Burgesses were chosen to the Parliament
before the Conquest, <hi>fol.</hi> 257, 258, 265.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Littleton</hi>'s <hi>Tenures, sect.</hi> 164. says, That the ancient Towns
call'd Burroughts, be the most ancient Towns that are in <hi>Engl.</hi>
for the Towns that now are Cities or Counties, in old time were
Burroughs, and call'd Burroughs, for that of such old Towns
came the Burgesses to the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in his Comment upon this Text of <hi>Littl. 1 Inst.</hi> 110.
says, it is called <hi>Parliamentum,</hi> because every Member of that
Court should <hi>Parler la Ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many Pretenders to Learning, take upon them to censure Sir
<hi>E. C.</hi> for this and some other like Etymologies, as being ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                     <p>Let me do right to that Learned in the Law, and (which is
more) honest and worthy Chief Justice, who lives in his useful
Works, and in (that great Blessing from God) a numerous and
flourishing Posterity.</p>
                     <p>It is true, <hi>Mentum</hi> is an ordinary Termination of divers words
of the Neuter Gender, and so it is (if we will be strict) in the
Word <hi>Parliamentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But give me leave to say, if it be ridiculous, he is not the first
nor the greatest that hath been guilty in this kind; nor is it any
proof of Illiterateness, nor to be charg'd only upon the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Common Law, as if it were an Absurdity peculiar
to us.</p>

For the Antiquity of the like Etymology, it is of above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

the last of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>
                     <p>Even in the very Text of the Civil Law, it makes the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology

Commons,<note place="margin">

                           </gap>1 H. 6. Thorpes Case.</note> 31 <hi>Hen. 6. num.</hi> 25. there are the very Words
of the Petition, at large set forth, in the fourth Reg. of
Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> fol. 644.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thorp,</hi> was taken in Execution, at the Suit of the D. of <hi>Y.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole House of Commons petitioned to have their
Speaker restored to them: And their Petition is in these Words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By</hi> Common Custom, Time out of Memory of Man, <hi>and</hi>
ever <hi>afore these Times used,</hi> in every of the Parliaments
<hi>of the</hi> Kings Noble Progenitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so it proceeds to declare the Priviledge of the Commons.</p>
                     <p>I would observe also, out of these three last Records of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
That when any Breach of Priviledge befell but a
single Member of that House, as that of <hi>Walter Clerk,</hi> and <hi>I.</hi>
at <hi>Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole House thought it self concerned, and the whole
House petitioned; especially in this last Case of <hi>Thomas Thorp,</hi>
their Speaker, to whom the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> was no Friend. This will
be useful to my Second Point.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have presented you with Records of Parliament,
as being the most proper Proof of the Rights of Parliament,
much beyond the Reports of our Historians, from whom our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators
fetch most of their Arguments.</p>
                     <p>I shall now offer you some Records out of an inferior Court,<note place="margin">

one of the four Courts of <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> that is, out of the
<hi>Exchequer:</hi> But they are <hi>Judicial Records,</hi> adjudged by the whole
Court, by Advice, with all the Judges of both Benches, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the same Point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. 12. E.</hi> 4. and <hi>H. 13. E.</hi> 4. in the Office of the Pleas in the

of Parliament Writs, <hi>fol.</hi> 752.</p>
                     <p>In a Plea of Debt by <hi>Donne</hi> against <hi>Walsh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Walsh</hi> was menial Servant to <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and he sued
out his Writ of Priviledg, and the Writ under the Great Seal,
was of this Tenure: <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cum secundum</hi> consuetudinem <hi>in regno hactenus obtentam &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatam,

enumerate other sorts of Actions) <hi>dum sic in Parliamentis nostris
morentur, arrestari aut implacitari minime debeant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And then the Writ mentions that Action of Debt, brought
against <hi>Walsh,</hi> menial Servant to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, <hi>Vobis mandamus</hi> (sayes the King by that Writ
of Priviledge to the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,) quod si ita est.</hi> Those
Words do not refer to the Custom set forth, nor to the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, but to the Allegation in the Writ of matter of Fact; <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Walsh</hi> the Defendant was menial Servant to the Earl of
<hi>Essex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then the Defendant does by way of Plea, grounded upon that
Writ, apply the Writ to himself; and averrs, That he is the same
Person mentioned in the Writ; and averrs, That he was the menial
Servant to the E. of <hi>Essex,</hi> and then demands allowance of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
                     <p>The Plaintiff in that Suit traverses the Custom and Priviledge
alledged in the Writ (as to the being impleaded) but admits it
as to the Freedom from Arrest. This Traverse is in the Nature
of a Demurrer; for it is <hi>Quaestio Juris, ad quam respondent Judices
non Juratores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Et super hot viso &amp; <hi>praelecto</hi> brevi praedicto, per Barones, &amp;c.
Habitoque Avisamento Justiciariorum Domini Regis, de utroque Banco
in hac parte. Quia videtur praefatis Baronibus de avisamento Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciariorum
praedictorum, quod talis habetur &amp; habebatur <hi>consuetudo,</hi>
quod Magnates &amp; Milites Comitatuum, ac Cives &amp; Burgenses Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum
&amp; Burgorum ad Parliamentum de Sumonitione Regis venientes,
ac eorum Familiares Ratione alicujus Transgressionis, &amp;c. dum
sic in Parliamento morentur, capi aut arrestari non debent. <hi>(But then
they adjudge that the Priviledge does hold only against Arresting
their Persons, but not against the Suing them.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This strongly proves the Point I have in Hand, That the House of
Commons have their Priviledges by Custom, and therefore the
House it self could not have its Original within Time of Memory,
as 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. is, in a Legal Understanding.</p>
                     <p>It is very useful further to observe, That the single and sole
Occasion of this Record was from the Priviledge of the Peers,
from the suing a menial Servant of a Peer. No Man denies but
the Peers have even been a part of the Parliament: Nay, our
new Modellers of the Government would have the Parliament to
consist only of the King and Lords.</p>
                     <p>And yet it is said to be a <hi>Joint Custom</hi> for the Commons, as
well as for the Lords, by express and particular Words. Why
did they not lay the Custom for the Priviledge of the Lords on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that might have serv'd for that present Occasion, which was
about the Priviledge for a menial Servant of the then E. of <hi>Essex?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Custom was an entire Custom for both Houses: This
proves them to be coaetaneous, and Twins by Birth and Original.</p>
                     <p>All this is by the Judgment of all the twelve Judges, in a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Proceeding: And it takes in the Opinion of the Chancellor,
who issued out that Writ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57483:14"/>
The other Record of the same Court is entred <hi>H. 12. E.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">H. 12. E. 4. <hi>in the</hi> Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</note>
                        <hi>Rot. 7. inter Ryner &amp; Cousin,</hi> Keeper of the Wardrobe to the
King, in an Action of Debt too; and there the Defendant claims
his Priviledge, not as Servant to the King, but as Servant to
<hi>Thomas St. Leger,</hi> Knight of the Shire for <hi>Surrey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Writ of Priviledge sets forth the same entire Custom,
both for Lords and Commons (tho' the Occasion was here from
the Commons only) and the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> gives the like
Judgment, as in the former Case, by Advice too, of all the
Judges of both Benches.</p>
                     <p>The next Record I shall make use of,<note place="margin">E. 2. S. Albans.</note> shall be that of <hi>E.</hi> 2.
which is a most invincible Proof that the Knights, Citizens and
Burgesses have originally, and before 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. constituted the
House of Commons, and have ever been a part of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Burgesses of <hi>S. Albans,</hi> in their Petition to the King, say,
That they <hi>sicut caeteri Burgenses Regni ad Parliamentum Regis,
per duos Comburgenses suos venire debeant, prout retro-actis tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
venire</hi> consueverant, <hi>tam</hi> tempore Domini Edwardi, nuper
Regis Angliae, <hi>Patris Regis</hi> (which must be <hi>E.</hi> 1.) &amp; progenito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
suorum (which must be understood of the Progenitors in
the plural number of <hi>E.</hi> 1. for he mentions the then King <hi>E.</hi> 2.
afterwards) so that of necessity it must take in King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and
his Father King <hi>John,</hi> at the least.</p>
                     <p>And this Computation much exceeds the Date given to the
House of Commons by these new Authors, <hi>viz. 49 H.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>And then the Petition descends to the mention of the then Kings
Time, <hi>viz. E. 2. tempore Domini Regis qui nunc est,</hi> semper <hi>ante
instans Parliamentum.</hi> And the Petition complains of the Sheriff of
<hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> who by the Abbots procuring, refused to summon
that Burrough.</p>
                     <p>The Answer by the Councel is, <hi>Scrutentur Rotuli, &amp;c. de Cancella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
si</hi> temporibus Progenitorum <hi>Regis Burgenses praedicti</hi> solebant
<hi>venire, vel non.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Answer admits the general Usage of Burgesses to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for divers Burroughs, in the times of the King's Progenitors;
For it is absurd to think, that that needed any search of the <hi>Rolls</hi>
in <hi>Chancery,</hi> but the Search was to be only, Whether that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Burrough of S. <hi>Albans</hi> was one of those Ancient Burroughs
that had used that Priviledge, and had a Right to it, which would
appear by the Rolls, and Returns of Writs of Summons.</p>
                     <p>The Record lays the Usage for the Burrough to have been <hi>semper,
ante instans Parliamentum;</hi> so that the Usage had been from ever.</p>
                     <p>In the Rolls of Parliament 11 <hi>H. 4. num.</hi> 59,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. <hi>num.</hi> 59.</note> cited by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi>
in his <hi>Brevia Parliamentaria rediviva, fol.</hi> 185. There is <hi>a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Commons in French,</hi> reciting the Stat. of 7. <hi>H. 4. c.</hi> 15.
which Statute (as the Petition says) was made for the preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Franchises and Liberties of the Election of Knights of the
Shire, used throughout: the whole Realm, and by the Kings Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors

I will now put the Court in mind of some Acts of Parliament,
that fully prove this Point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Statute of</hi> 5 R. 2. Parl. 2. c. 4.<note place="margin">Proof by Acts of Parliament. 5 <hi>R. 2. Parl. 2. C.</hi> 4.</note> 
                        <hi>(in a time When Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were not so much valued)</hi> It is thereby Enacted, by Assent
of the Prelates, Lords, and Commons, that all Persons and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,

to do, and <hi>had been accustomed of Old Times;</hi> otherwise they
should be Amerced <hi>as of Old Times had been accustomed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

Cott. Abr.</hi> That Act declares, that the Commons had ever been a
Member of the Parliament, and that no Statute or Law could be
made without their Assent. I will not spend time in citing those
Learned Antiquaries,<note place="margin">Historians and Antiquaries.</note> or Historians; as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman, Bedes
Eccl. Hist.</hi> nor Famous <hi>Selden,</hi> nor Learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> who by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Words, used in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, for the Assembling of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
tho' not by that Name, prove the Commons to be a Part
of Them; but they do not prove the Commons to be so Elected,
and to consist of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, as is clearly
Proved by the Records I have already offer'd.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times was styled <hi>Commune Concilium,</hi>

King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor Confirm'd the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, and made

and there' tis said, all to be done a <hi>Rege, Baronibus &amp; Populo.</hi> These

by several Statutes, that <hi>Mag. Charta</hi> was made <hi>De Communi

                     <p>It is worth the while to examin the Grounds of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and it will appear how weak they are.</p>
                     <p>These new Authors affirm, that the House of Commons began
to be admitted as a part of the Parliament, not till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. Their
reason is because (as Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> says,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> in his Plea for the Lords <hi>fol.</hi>
182. and in his Preface to Sir <hi>Robert Cott. Abr.) The first Writ of
Summons</hi> of any Knights, Citizens and Burgesses now extant is no
antienter than 49 <hi>H. 3. Dorso</hi> 10. and 11. And from thence he
concludes, that it is most apparent, that the Commons had no
Place, nor Votes by Election in Parliament, before the End of
the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. and Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> is in like manner posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in it in his Book call'd The <hi>Freeholders Grand Enquest, fol.</hi> 18.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57483:15"/>
and they both cite <hi>Mr. Seld.</hi> and <hi>Camd.</hi> and other Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> in his <hi>Origines Juridiciales, fol.</hi> 18. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
them in it. It is true Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in His <hi>Titles of Honour, fol.</hi>
717<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> towards the end of that <hi>fol.</hi> does take notice that the
<hi>First Roll</hi> that they find extant is that of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. for the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
of the Commons by way of Election; <hi>but he does not
thence conclude,</hi> (as those new Authors do) that this was the
first time that the Commons came to the Parliament by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>But in other places of his Learned Book, he does strongly
intimate his Opinion to be that the Commons did very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
and long before 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. make an Essential part of the
Parliament, and were summon'd to it; but in what Form they
were summon'd, and when they first began to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>Barones Majores, Selden</hi> himself seems much unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Learned Camden</hi> does indeed date the Original of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
as a part of the Parliament, and as now Elected, from 49
<hi>H. 3. fol.</hi> 13. of his <hi>Britannia in the Edit. at Lond. An.</hi> 1600.
But let us take notice upon what Authority he does it. He says
he has it <hi>Ex satis Antiquo Scriptore,</hi> but he names not his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Seld. fol.</hi> 713. says, he could never meet with that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and professes he gives little Credit to that Relation, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
there had been a great Change in the Constitution
of the Parliament, but supposes it long before 49 <hi>H. 3. viz.</hi> in
the time of that King's Father (King <hi>John</hi>) and that it was done
by a Law, tho' the Law be lost, as many Rolls of Parliament
were, wherein those Laws were entered.</p>
                     <p>And the distinction of <hi>Barones Majores &amp; Minores</hi> he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
was made by Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">Fol. 709.</note> about the time when
the great Charter of King <hi>John</hi> was made at <hi>Runnymead</hi> viz. 17
<hi>Johannis.</hi> By which Charter, some of the <hi>Barones Majores</hi> were
severally to be Summon'd to Parliament by special Writs. And
all other Tenants <hi>in capite,</hi> or Tenants by Knights Service
were to be summon'd by a general Summons directed to the
Sheriff of every County.</p>
                     <p>By this Conjecture, it should seem that the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
before consisted but of one House or Assembly. And
it is generally held, that at the first, from the beginning of
the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the first, till that Charter of King <hi>John,</hi>
all Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> had a Right to sit in Parliament. For
says Mr. <hi>Seld. fol. 704. medio folii. Tenere de Rege in Capite,</hi> and
<hi>to be a Baron,</hi> and <hi>to have a right to sit in Councils or Courts
of Judgment,</hi> are Synonymies. That great Charter of King
<hi>John,</hi> says <hi>Seld.</hi> was made by the King and his Barons, &amp;
<hi>liberos homines totius Regni,</hi> and that it seems first made the
distinction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57483:15"/>
But Mr. <hi>Seld.</hi> does by no means leave it to K. <hi>H.</hi> 3. or his Son
E. 1. or to any other King at any time, to send his special Writ
of Summons to such of the Barons only, <hi>quibus ipse Rex dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus
est Brevia Summonitionis dirigere.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Camden's</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Authour taught him, and from Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi>
Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> take it up, and so propagate
that Error. So that this new fancy is wholly grounded upon
the Credit of that uncertain Writer, whom Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
could never meet with, and to whom he gave no credit.</p>
                     <p>The Argument upon this Subject, begins <hi>fol.</hi> 701. in Mr.
<hi>Seld. Tit. of Honour,</hi> and is continued to <hi>fol.</hi> 718.</p>
                     <p>Now the Argument taken from the Rolls of Summons, which
are not extant before the time of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. is of no weight.</p>
                     <p>For by the same Argument it might be proved, that there was
no Parliament from the time of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. till 23 E. 1. For there
is no Roll nor no other Testimony left of a Summons for any
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, from 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. till 23 <hi>E.</hi> I.
And yet we know there were no lest than fourteen Parliaments

                     <p>Another Argument used by these late Authors, to prove that
the whole Power and all the Priviledges of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
are not from the Original Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(as I Affirm, and I hope have proved they are) but of a
later Original, and by the meer Grace and Indulgence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(as indeed they must be, if the House of Commons began
within Memory) is taken <hi>from the Words and Phrases of our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note>
who have written since the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and
ascribe the making of Laws, and all the Determinations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
in Matters of Judicature, and all the Actings of the Ancient
Parliaments before the time of the <hi>Normans,</hi> to the King and
Lords only, Exclusive to the Commons, and that the Commons
had no part in them, till this time of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>And they ground this Opinion upon the Form of Penning of
our Ancient Acts of Parliament,<note place="margin">Pennings of Ancient Acts of Parliament.</note> which seem by the Words of them
to be meer Concessions of our former Kings, and to have proceeded
only from their Royal Bounty, and at their sole Will and
Pleasure.</p>
                     <p>And they Confirm themselves in that Opinion,<note place="margin">Petitions for Freedom of Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> from observing
the Course used in the beginning of Parliaments, when the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
makes his humble Petitions to the King for the Granting
of them Freedom from Arrests, and Freedom of Speech.</p>
                     <p>Now to discover the Falsity of these Grounds, and the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of these Arguments, taken from the Words and Phrases
us'd by our Historians, I shall shew that our Historians who
have written since the time of the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi>
and have Translated the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> have in those Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
instead of the <hi>Saxon Titles,</hi> used the Titles that were
never in use before their own Times, which Titles used in the
<hi>Saxons</hi> times had quite <hi>different Significations</hi> from the Titles
used in the times of the Translators.</p>
                     <p>The Title (<hi>Earl</hi>) for Example, is used in the Penning of the
<hi>Saxons</hi> Laws (as among those of <hi>Athelstan</hi>) as we may see by
Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Book <hi>de Priscis Anglor. Legibus,</hi> and the Title
(<hi>Comes</hi>) came in amongst us since, from the Empire; and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
a different thing from (<hi>Earl.</hi>) Now our Translators mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
those two Titles (<hi>Earl</hi>) and (<hi>Comes</hi>) to signifie the same
thing, wherever they met with (<hi>Earl</hi>) in the <hi>Annals</hi> of the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> they have rendred it (<hi>Comes</hi>) in their Translations:
and whatever in those times was done by <hi>Earls,</hi> and whatever
Power the <hi>Earls</hi> then used, is by our Translators ascribed to
our <hi>Comites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. of Honout <hi>Fol.</hi> 603, 604.</note> who are therefore also called <hi>Earls,</hi> when in Truth
they had different Significations, and were different in their
Powers. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> takes notice of this Error in our <hi>Norman</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57483:17"/>
or <hi>English</hi> Translators proceeding from their Ignorance. But
from this Error false Conclusions have been raised, and false
Measures taken in our Discourses, concerning the Power of the
Peers.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> observes the same Error in our Translators,
in rendring Words and Titles <hi>Non èmore Saeculi antiquioris,</hi>
but according to the Titles used in their own times, when
many times they signified different things. <hi>Nobilis,</hi> says Mr.
<hi>Selden,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fol. 603.</note> in the <hi>Saxons</hi> times denoted every Gentleman.</p>
                     <p>Now because (<hi>Nobilis,</hi>) in our times is generally restrain'd to
Peers, whom we call the (<hi>Nobility,</hi>) our New Writers, as Mr.
<hi>Pryn,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> and several others, ascribe all to the
Earls and Barons and other Peers of our times, which they read
in the Translations of the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> to be acted by those
that are called (<hi>Nobiles</hi>) in those <hi>Annals.</hi> Altho' in truth in those
<hi>Saxon</hi> times, they were acted by the middle sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as well as by those of the highest sort of Dignity under the
King.</p>
                     <p>Those Translators misled our new Authors. For the <hi>Norman</hi>
Writers translate the Word (<hi>Thanes</hi>) into (<hi>Barones</hi>) and these
new Authors of ours, whatever they find in these Translations
to be related of the (<hi>Barones</hi>) they limit it as a Peculiar to
our present (<hi>Barons</hi>) and so ascribe all judicial Power antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used in Parliament to the <hi>Barons</hi> only. And they bring
those Historians and Translators for a Proof.</p>
                     <p>For Example, The <hi>Saxon</hi> Title (<hi>Thanes</hi>) was in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
times applyed to all Lords of Mannors. But the Translators
of the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> translating the Title (<hi>Thanes</hi>) into (<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi>)
Our Innovators apply all that in <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers is said
to be done by the (<hi>Thanes</hi>) that is, all Lords of Mannors, as
peculiarly belonging to the Power of the <hi>Barons</hi> in our
times.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> cautions us against taking Reports
of Law from Historians: in his Preface to the <hi>3d. Rep.</hi> he calls
it Chronicle Law.</p>
                     <p>The Word (<hi>Baro</hi>) was not in use in <hi>England</hi> till the <hi>Normans</hi>
times, and the Root of it (as Mr. <hi>Seld.</hi> and <hi>Camd.</hi> and Sir <hi>H.
Spelm.</hi> teach us) is from the Northern Language (<hi>Barn</hi>) which
signifies the Male Sex, as when we put Cases of <hi>Baron</hi> and
<hi>Feme;</hi> or it signifies (<hi>a Freeholder</hi>) hence come the Words
<hi>Courts Baron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nomine Baronagii</hi> (says <hi>Camd. Eliz. Edit. Lond. An. 1600. fol.</hi>
137.) <hi>omnes quodammodo Regni Ordines continebantur.</hi> It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the Gentry as well as the greatest Persons.<note place="margin">Fol. 176.</note> After
this manner <hi>Godwin</hi> in his <hi>Roman Antiquities</hi> speaking of the
Roman Magistrates, Translates the Words (<hi>Triumviri capitales</hi>)
into (3. <hi>High Sheriffs</hi>) but this affords no Argument, that what
was done by the <hi>Triumviri</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lawfully belong to the power of High Sheriffs among
us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57483:17"/>
And so the Words <hi>Proceres, Magnates, Optimates, Nobiles,</hi> and
such like, were not in the Writers of the <hi>Saxons</hi> times restrain'd
to Men of the highest rank then, such as our Earls and Barons
are now, but to all Persons of the better sort, tho' not of the
highest rank, not only to <hi>Patricians,</hi> and those of the <hi>Senatorian</hi>
order, but to those also that were <hi>Equestris ordinis.</hi> Excluding
none but the <hi>Ignota capita,</hi> or <hi>sine Nomine turba,</hi> such as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
styled <hi>Plebeians. Magnates &amp; Proceres,</hi> are said to make
the Stat. of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> but we all know that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that made it, consisted then of King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                     <p>The great Charter made 17 of K. <hi>John</hi> appears by the body of
the Charter it self to have been made <hi>per Regem, Barones, &amp;
liberos Homines totius Regni;</hi> so that it is most plain it was not
made by the King and the Barons only, as Mr. <hi>Seld.</hi> observes in

                        <hi>That the Power of making Laws
rests only in the King,</hi> (as Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> would have it,)
which he proves from the Titles of Acts of Parliament, and
the Forms of those Acts being by way of Charter and Grant
from our Kings in ancient times, as that of <hi>Magna Charta
DOMINVS REX CONCESSIT;</hi> and the Stat. <hi>De donis condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalibus,
DOMINVS REX statuit,</hi> sure he was no Lawyer
that used this Argument, and he never read the Prince's Case.</p>
                     <p>Nor Sir <hi>E. C. 2. Inst.</hi> nor shall I need to labour in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutation
of this Errour, the fallacy of it being so well known
to every Man that wears a Gown. As for that Stat of <hi>Mag.
Char.</hi> whereby the King only seems to speak, and all that is
ordain'd by that Stat. runs in the language of the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
only; yet we know the Stat. of 15 <hi>E. 3. c.</hi> 1. which
confirms it, says of it, that it was ordain'd by the King,
Lords, and Commons. The Stat. of 28 <hi>E. 1. c.</hi> 8. and <hi>c.</hi> 13.
hath these words,<note place="margin">28 E. 1. c. 8. &amp; 13. <hi>Elect.</hi> of Sheriffs.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. The King hath granted unto his People
that they shall have Election of their Sheriffs every year, if they
list.</hi> One would take this to be a most gracious Liberty,
and an high Condescension if it should be granted now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</p>
                     <p>And our Innovators would be apt to conclude from the
words of this Act and from the Penning of it, that the
People once had this mighty Priviledge meerly as a Boon
from the King, and by virtue of his Grant. Whereas there
is nothing more certain and clear than that the Freeholders
(who are often call'd the People, and are the true Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Nation and Land) had originally and from the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57483:18"/>
very first Constitution of the Nation, the <hi>Election</hi> not
only of all <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> but of all other Magistrates Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
that had any Authority over them under the King;
so that they had a mighty Freedom in the very Constitution
of the Nation, and this overthrows all the wild Fancies of
Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and some later Doctors,
as if all were deriv'd from meer Grace and Bounty, and many
other Deductions might be made from the knowledge of
this.</p>
                     <p>The Freeholders had originally the Election of the <hi>Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Peace,</hi> who are become out of date by introducing
our present <hi>Justices of Peace,</hi> who have their Power not by
the Elect. of the Freeholders, or are they of their Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as anciently) but nominated by the King, and have their
Power by special Commission under the great Seal; and how,
and by what means, and in what tempered times this came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and that this freedom was gain'd from the Freeholders
of <hi>England,</hi> you may read in Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> in his <hi>Eirenarcha,
fol.</hi> 16. 19. 20. 147. It was done by Act of Parliament, in the
beginning of K. <hi>E. 3d,</hi> and in his Infancy, when his Mother

                     <p>The Freeholders originally and from all antiquity did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

In the last place, that humble and modest way of the People's
addressing to their Sovereign either for the making of Laws
(which has been very ancient) or for granting of Priviledges (as the
Speaker of the Commons hath of late years done) it shews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
great Reverence, and I do not in the least dislike it; and it
becomes the Majesty of the Prince to be so address'd to; but let
it not be made an argument that either the Laws thereupon made,
or the Priviledges so allow'd, are precarious, and meerly of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and may be refus'd them.</p>

was used by the Figure <hi>Catachresis,</hi> as the Scholars call it; not
properly, as appears by the Subject matter of that Act that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
what was it, I pray, that they so <hi>prayed?</hi> They prayed (says
that Act) That upon the mischiefs that happen to the Realm,
the King <hi>ought,</hi> and is <hi>bound by his Oath,</hi> with the <hi>accord of his
People</hi> in his Parliament, thereof to make Remedy and Law. The
Peers are here included in the <hi>People;</hi> so that the word <hi>prayed</hi>
had it been used to any other than the King, had signified <hi>remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
declared,</hi> or <hi>represented.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This proves too where the transcendent Power of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, and that the Exercise of it, tho' it be free and not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to coercion, yet it is not at will and pleasure in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of it, but guided by Rules.</p>
                     <p>And tho' the Speaker does (upon his being approv'd of by the
King) make it his humble Petition to have Liberty of Speech al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd

I hope I have sufficiently made it out, that the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
as a Member of the High Court of Parliament, are not
of so late an Original, as 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. but have been as Antient as
the Nation it self, and may in the Sence of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> in his
<hi>Comment.</hi> be accounted among the <hi>Ab-Origines,</hi> and that they
have had a perpetual Being, to speak in the Language of the Law,
<hi>temps dont, &amp;c. à tempore cujus contrarii memoria hominum non
existit,</hi> and that they are therefore capable by Law (together
with the rest of the three Estates in Parliament) to prescribe
and claim a share in all Parliamentary Powers and Priviledges;
I do not mean separately, but in conjunction with those other
Estates, which they could not otherwise legally have done, if
their Originall and Commencement could have been shown.</p>
                     <p>I shall in the next place endeavour to make it evident,<note place="margin">All three Estates one entire Body and Corporation.</note> That
the three Estates of Parliament are one entire Body and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration;
and that all their Powers and Priviledges in the <hi>Right</hi> of
them, and in the Title to them, are intire, <hi>per my &amp; per tout,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the whole Body of the Parliament, tho' in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
of those Powers, and sometimes in the claim of them they
are distinguish'd, and in the practice of their Powers, they are in
many things distributed into parts.</p>
                     <p>For their <hi>Powers</hi> are one thing, and their <hi>Priviledges</hi> are
another; the latter are but an incident or attendant upon the
former.</p>
                     <p>It is very material in our present case to have this matter
consider'd, I mean the Intireness of this High Court; for <hi>Divide
&amp; Impera:</hi> The Faggot is easily broken when first the Band is
broken. If this be well consider'd, the consequence of this Case
will be better understood.</p>
                     <p>It concerns the Defendant only by name and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
but in the right and near consequence, it is now most
evident, that it nearly concerns the House of Lords: this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Mr. <hi>Attornies,</hi> like a <hi>Terrae-motus,</hi> or as that great
Blast would have done (had not Almighty God, in his Infinite
Goodness to this Nation, prevented it) shakes the Foundation of
both Houses, and reaches to all future Parliaments; it frights me
to speak what may be the effects of it, if it should prevail and
be stretch'd to the utmost. I am far from saying or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is so intended. But who knows how far a single Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
will be made use of in times to come?</p>
                     <p>All the Estates, in Parliament, are all called by one common

                     </p>
                     <p>This proves likewise (what I before argued) that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

I forbear to English it.</p>
                     <p>It is the proper work of this Supream Court, to deal with
such Delinquents, as are too high for this Court of the King's Bench
or other ordinary Courts. Against whom, through their Potency
or mighty Interest, common right cannot be had, it must be
understood in ordinary Courts. And the Writing and Printing
of this, was never taken to be a Scandal to the Government or
to the Justice of the Nation. For the Author speaks in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the King himself, and tells us, that the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is arm'd with a Power, able to cope with and quell the
most insolent Offenders.</p>

our Laws are like the Spiders Webs, which catch the little Flies,
but the great ones break through them.</p>
                     <p>Now it is quite contrary with this great Court, this great Court
encounters only with great Offenders. It is like the Imperial

four <hi>special Persons</hi> should be <hi>remov'd out of the Kings House.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This in some Ages, as in the Reign of <hi>K.</hi> R. the <hi>2d.</hi> would
have been thought a very high presumption, and a sawcy thing
(to speak in the Language of the Pulpit, and Press too from a
late <hi>Cambr. Dr.</hi> and a Chaplain in Ordinary, (if the Title of the
Print may be credited) but said to be printed by the—of
that University. A sawcy thing with their Prophane and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed
Hands to presume to meddle in a thing so Sacred. (Thus
says the late Printed Sermon) <hi>But it was a Sacred or Consecrated
thing indeed in this Roll of Parliament mention'd.</hi> One of the 4 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be remov'd out of the King's House, (where he was
a Domestick) was no less than the King's Confessor. And it was
not in the Reign of a <hi>R.</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> or <hi>H.</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> but of <hi>K. H.
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> one of our Wisest and most Active Valiant Kings.</p>
                     <p>But it may be thought that these four Persons were in some
desperate Popish Plot of killing the King, as the four we have
heard of, were.</p>
                     <p>No, the King himself will resolve that Doubt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That noble King said in answer to it,</hi> He knew no cause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they should be remov'd, but only for that, they were hated of
the People.</p>
                     <p>And yet that great King charged those Four to depart from
his House.</p>
                     <p>This proves their Councelling Power.</p>
                     <p>I might enumerate a vast multitude of <hi>Animalia Majora,</hi> no
small Flies, that have in several Ages been catched in the Net or
Webb of an Inquiry made by the House of Commons, who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57483:21"/>
fish only for such greater Fish, such as we call the Pike, who by
Oppression live upon the smaller Fish, and devour them. The
Commons to that end fish with a Net, that has a wide and large
Meshe, such as lets go the small Frye, and compasses none but
those of the largest size. Such as the <hi>Lord Latimer</hi> in the time
of <hi>E. 3. An.</hi> 50. Such as <hi>Michael de la Pool E. of Suff. and Lord
Chancellour; in 10. R. 2. Tho. Arundel Archbishop of Canterbury.
21 R.</hi> 2. and such like. <hi>William de la Pool D. of Suff.</hi> 28 H. 6. who
were all impeach'd by the House of Commons in several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>
                     <p>And I my self have seen a Lord Chief Justice of this Court,
while he was Lord Chief Justice, and a Learned Man, by leave
from the House of Commons, pleading before that House for
himself, and excusing what he had done in a Tryal that came
before them in the <hi>West,</hi> whereof Complaint was made to the
House. And he did it with that great Humility and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and those of his own Profession and others, were so far
his Advocates, as that the House desisted from any further
prosecution.</p>
                     <p>In the the late Act of 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. of his now Majesty for safety of
his Royal Person, there is a <hi>Proviso</hi> for the saving of the Just
<hi>Antient</hi> Freedom, and the Priviledge of either of the Houses of
Parliament, or any of their Members, of debating any Matters
or Business, which shall be debated or propounded in either of
the said Houses; or at any Conferences or Committees of both,
or either of the said Houses; or touching the Repeal or Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of any old, or the preparing any new Laws; or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of any publick Grievances.</hi> I observ'd but now out of
<hi>Trewinn.</hi> Case in the <hi>Ld. Dier.</hi> that the Judgment of the House
of Commons in a Case of the priviledge of that House, in that
Report, is called a Judgment of the most high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which proves they are not without <hi>a Judicial Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 <hi>H. 6. Sir Rob. Cott. Abr. fol.</hi> 574. The great Case between
the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> and the Earl <hi>Marshal</hi> for Precedency, <hi>fol.</hi> 576.
was determin'd by the King. <hi>By Advice and Consent of the Lords
and Commons;</hi> and yet one would have thought that a Case
of Precedency between two Peers, should have been a peculiar
of the Lords.</p>
                     <p>In the Case of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in the Year Books, <hi>fol.</hi> 4. about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
of <hi>Attainders,</hi> it is advis'd <hi>by all the Judges,</hi> that those
Knights and others of the House of Commons, should not sit in
the House, till the Act for reversal of their <hi>Attainders</hi> were
pass'd. And the Reason is, that it is not convenient, that such
as were attaint should <hi>be Judges;</hi> (and it might have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>in their own Case</hi>) so that attainting by Bill, or Reversing
<hi>Attainders,</hi> tho' by Bill, is most properly a Judicial Act, and the
Members of the House of Commons are acknowledged to be
<hi>Judges</hi> in that Case <hi>by all the Judges,</hi> and by that Statute of
6 <hi>H. 8. C.</hi> 16. which I mention'd before to another purpose, <hi>the
Iournal of the</hi> House of Commons is call'd a <hi>Record.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57483:22"/>
I have formerly observ'd, but to another purpose too, that
the Writs of Summons anciently for Electing Knights, Citizens
and Burgesses to Parliament, did direct them in their Duty, that
they were to meet <hi>ad Consulendum &amp; Consilium impendere,</hi> tho'
of late Years this has been omitted, and now advantage is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of it.<note place="margin">Nothing acted in this present Case, but what is within their Power.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us in the next place examin whether the matters
acted in this Case by the House of Commons be Warranted by
these Powers, of the Parliament, and have been done in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of those Powers.</p>
                     <p>And upon Examination, we shall find they have done nothing
but what they had a full power to do, and what is agreeable to
the Law and Usage of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>It is set forth in the Plea, (and admitted by the <hi>Demurrer,</hi> but
we all know it to be true) that there was an Horrid Devillish, &amp;c,
Popish Plot. The Enquiry after which, and the searching of it to
the bottom. and discovering all the Accomplices, was <hi>Negotium
Arduum,</hi> and it did, <hi>Regem &amp; Statum Regni specialiter tangere,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Writ of Summons to Parliament.</p>
                     <p>For the Plea tells us the design of it, <hi>viz. to Kill the King.
2ly.</hi> To subvert the Government and the Laws, to suppress the
True Religion, and to destroy the Professors of it.</p>
                     <p>The Plea shows, that One great Lord was convicted of it by
Impeachment of the Commons, and attainted before the Lords.
The Kings Speech shows there was need of further Enquiry, and
that it was not as yet thoroughly done, nor himself, nor the two
Houses safe; and the King charges both Houses to make an
<hi>Impartial</hi> Enquiry. The word <hi>Impartial</hi> imports, there might be
some great Persons concern'd, that might be apt to be favour'd.</p>
                     <p>And the Plea shows that both Houses accordingly made a strict
and impartial Enquiry after the Conspiracy.</p>
                     <p>All this appears plainly to be the proper Work of a Parliament,
and his Majesty himself was of that Judgment, and charged them
to do their Duty in it.</p>
                     <p>And the Enquiry is the most proper Business of the House
of Commons.</p>
                     <p>For this Reason they are commonly styl'd <hi>The Grand Inquest
of the Nation.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The House of Commons the Grand Inquest of the Nation.</note> tho' Sir <hi>Rob. Filmer's</hi> bold writing terms them so
by way of Diminution and Contempt, (as if enquiry were their
highest work).</p>
                     <p>This Inquiry of theirs is necessary in a Subserviency to all the
several High Powers of that High Court. Namely, in order to
their Legislature, or to the Exercise of their Power of Judicature.</p>
                     <p>Courts that have Power of <hi>Oyer and Terminer,</hi> and to punish
Great and Enormous Crimes, are still by their Commissioners
arm'd with a Power of Empannelling grand Inquests, to make
Enquiries in order to their Exercise of their Power of determining.</p>
                     <p>Or it may be in order to their Counselling Power, for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of great Officers or Favourites, whereof I have given an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57483:22"/>
and the Parliament Rolls and Journals are full of them.</p>
                     <p>But still they first make Enquiry. They enquire among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and every Grand Jury Man by his Oath, is to impart his
Knowledge in any thing Material to his Fellows. But the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Enquiry is most probably from without doors; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such enquiry, things of great importance may lye conceal'd.</p>
                     <p>And the Defendants Plea shows some good effect of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.
Diverse were convicted: And one <hi>Tho. Dangerf.</hi> deliver'd
in an Information, and that upon Oath, and first to the Lords
House, so that it did not begin with the Commons; but if it were
so Infamous and Malicious, why did not the Lords Reject it, and
Commit the <hi>Informer</hi> and punish him? No, they receiv'd it, and
Entred it of Record in their Journal. The Reason was, it was
done in a Course of Legal proceeding, they could not reject it,
being the proper Court of Justice for a thing of this Nature.
And the King had given it them in charge to enquire. Nor do
they by receiving of it give it any Countenance or Credit. Then
why should it be so heinous a thing in the House of Commons,
more than in the Lords? Let us remember still they are but one
Body; and though they sever themselves for their better dispatch of
their great Affairs, and distribute the Work amongst them, yet
the Power by which they Act, is Entire.</p>
                     <p>But why should any man divide and sever those that are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire?
It concerns the Lords equally with the Commons.</p>
                     <p>But how comes it to concern the Speaker of the Commons so
highly above the House it self, who Acts meerly as a Minister,
and by Command of the House; but that, I reserve for a point
distinct.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it may be allow'd, that what is done by either
House, in receiving <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Information and entring of it in
their Journals is Parliamentary enough. But the Offence and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
arises first upon the publishing of it in print.<note place="margin">The printing <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Information.</note> Now a word
or two to that.</p>
                     <p>Let us consider how publick this Information of <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s
was before the printing of it. It was made very publick by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deliver'd at the Bar of the Lords, the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and indeed all Courts of Justice ought to be open and of
easie Resort.</p>
                     <p>The Information of <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is first made a Record of that
Court, and to a Court of Record any person may resort, as Sir
<hi>E. C.</hi> tells us in his Preface to the <hi>3d. Rep.</hi> and that it was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Law of <hi>England,</hi> and is so declar'd by a General Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
46 <hi>E. 3. C.</hi> which tho' a general Law is not in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Book of Statutes, as I observ'd of another general and useful
Act of Parliament before (however it comes to pass) In that Act
of 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Commons prayed that a Record of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is done in the King's Court,<note place="margin">46 <hi>E. 3. C.</hi> Search of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords must be Free.</note> ought in Reason to remain
there for perpetual Evidence for all persons. And they complain
that of late the Court had refus'd to suffer the People to search and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57483:23"/>
to have Exemplifications for evidence against the King or to his
disadvantage.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they pray that search and Exemplification be made
to any persons of any Record whatsoever, though it concern the
King or any other, and make against the King or any other.</p>
                     <p>And the Answer is, <hi>Le Roy le voet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then it was made more publick, by being deliver'd in at the
Bar of the House of Commons, which ought to consist of about
500 Members, who are suppos'd to come from all parts of the
Kingdom: So that this was made very publick, before this
publishing of it in print.</p>
                     <p>Let me observe by the way, that this Author of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<hi>(Tho. Dangerfield)</hi> was not sent for by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
but for any thing that appears, applies himself to the
House of Commons, as he had before done to the Lords, of his
own accord, so that this is far from malice or ill design.</p>
                     <p>The Commons order it to be entred in their Journal, among
other Informations that had been given them.</p>
                     <p>And besides, they order this and several others to be
Printed.</p>
                     <p>The Offence and Scandal is suppos'd by Mr. <hi>Att.</hi> Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to begin here: what need was there of printing it?</p>
                     <p>I wish we could hear the House of Commons answering for
themselves to this point: they could (it may be) give a better
account of it, and a sufficient reason for the Printing of it.</p>
                     <p>But let it be observ'd, they barely cause it to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>They do not give any Attestation or Credit to it, but leave
all that hear or read it, to judge or believe as they think fit.
They do not make it their own, by printing it without mention
of the true Author, they style it the Information of <hi>Tho. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield,</hi>
as indeed it was; they do not adopt it their own, as
they had done, had they left out the name of the Author.</p>
                     <p>Nay the Author himself had deliver'd it in a course of Justice
and in the Highest Court of Justice, <hi>i. e.</hi> before the Lords in
Parliament. If it were a Libell and Slander, why did the Lords
receive it,<note place="margin">See the 1 <hi>st. St.</hi> in such Cases of Reporting false News, <hi>viz. W. 1. C.</hi> 34. the Reporter is only to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd till he have found out him of whom the word was moved. So is 2 <hi>R. 2.

Why did they not rather reject the Information and punish
the Author?</p>
                     <p>If it were no Crime in the Author to deliver it to the Lords,
were it true or false, Why should it be a Crime to Print it as being
his, and with his Name?</p>
                     <p>Whether the matter of that Information were true or false, yet
what is done by the House of Commons and by the Defendant
as their Speaker, is all true, that is that <hi>Tho. Dangerfield</hi> had
drawn up, and was the Author of such an Information, and this
was true. By the Statutes that punish the Reporters of false News,
the penalty is but Imprisonment, till the first Author be brought
forth, and that is done in this Case.</p>

against themselves?</p>
                     <p>There may most probably and justly be this in the Case, to
induce the Printing this Narrative or Information of <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Plot was very desperate and dangerous, it was not yet
fully discover'd and search'd to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>They were Commanded by the King to search further into it.
Besides it was the proper work of the House of Commons so to
enquire, as they were the Grand Inquest of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>Here was one positive Witness already that had sworn to these
particulars, before the Highest Court of Justice, where the great
Persons concern'd in it, sate themselves as Members of the Lords
House.</p>
                     <p>But one Witness alone, though it were sufficient to make an
Accusation, yet it was not enough to make a Conviction; in
High Treason the Law requires two at least.</p>
                     <p>The House of Commons could not in Duty and Conscience to
the King and Kingdom, pass it by or let it sleep.</p>
                     <p>This Information tho' but from one man, might possibly
have given Courage to another Person or more than one to
testify to the same particulars, if there were any more that knew
them to be true, who were unwilling to be the first in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
not knowing but they might stand singly in it: but
finding the discovery already made and sworn to, might then think
it their Duty, and be encouraged to appear also in it, when it might
probably be of effect and amount to a Legal Testimony. The
difficulty, and the danger, and discouragement, lay upon the first
Informer.</p>
                     <p>This Consideration might induce the House of Commons out of
a Sense of their Duty, to make a further and impartial enquiry
as his Majesty had commanded them, to make it yet (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
a little more publick in order to a fuller proof: and Printing
is but one way among many other of Publishing or Enquiring
into any matter.</p>

And of late years enquiry by Printing has been a most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practice, and we meet with it every week, and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the most ordinary way of making enquiries, which run
into all parts of the Nation. And the Printing of publick

                     <p>But what has made this Information of <hi>Dangerfield's</hi> more
publick, than Mr. Attorney General's preferring this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the Defedant Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> for causing it to be
publish'd in Print?</p>
                     <p>Had it not been thus awaken'd again, it might have slept in
silence, and have been Buried in Oblivion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Historian tells us in his Annals in the
Life of <hi>Nero,</hi> of one <hi>Fabricius Veiento,</hi> who was accus'd for ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
slanderous Speeches against the Lords of the Senate and
against the Priests, in certain Books, which he termed <hi>Codicel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's,</hi>
which in our Dialect, is the same with Libels or little
Books.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nero</hi> would have the hearing of the Cause himself, and he
was Convicted before him, and was Condemn'd to Exile, and
his Books were Sentenced to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes, that before this Sentence for the burning of
the Books, there was little notice taken of these Books, and few
there were that read them: but when once it grew dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to read them, then they were much sought
after.</p>
                     <p>But the very opening of that Information of <hi>Dangerfield</hi>
here in this great Court, and in so great an Audience, which
was of necessity, and occasion'd by Mr. Attornies Information
that recites it, tho' Mr. Attorney never intended this ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
hath made the matter of it as publick as possibly can
be.</p>
                     <p>And it must be observ'd, that it never yet came so far as
to a Tryal, nor to have an Ignoramus found, much less to
an acquital <hi>modo legitimo,</hi> in which case, according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of some Judges, an Action of Conspiracy, or upon the
Case for a Slander will not lye, as not being ripe for it till an
Acquital: by the same Reason it is not ready for an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which is but the King's Suit, the Reason being the
same in both.</p>
                     <p>

But it may perhaps be thought,<note place="margin">The Persons too great to be so used.</note> that in respect of the Persons
concern'd in it, this was too high a Flight, and too bold an
Attempt, and that the height and eminence of some persons may
exempt them from common Justice, and from the Power even
of a Parliament.</p>
                     <p>In answer to which, I would observe, that some Laws are
more especially levell'd against the Highest Subjects.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute of <hi>W. 1. c.</hi> 5. The King forbids that <hi>nul haute
homme,</hi> no High or Great Man, upon pain of grievous forsei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
disturb Elections, but Elections ought to be free.</p>
                     <p>The like may be observ'd in the Statute of <hi>W. 1. c. 35. Des
hautes bommes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And the greater the Persons are, if they are in the rank of
Subjects, they must be subject to the King's Laws, and they
are the more proper for the undertaking and encounter of this
High Court. It will not be <hi>Impar congressus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cited before, <hi>the Mirror of Justices, Chap. 1. Pag.</hi> 9. where
it is said, that Parliaments were ordained for to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in such wrongs, and against such Persons, <hi>especially against
whom otherwise Common Right cannot be had.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will cite no Historians to prove what hath been done in
Antient Times within this very Kingdom, of this Nature
against the highest Subjects.</p>
                     <p>I will keep still within my own Sphere, and cite none but
Authorities in Law. And so keep my self in the way
that belongs to me, and so doing, I am under the Protection
of this Court and of the Law, and may relye upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of that Blessed Promise, <hi>He will keep thee in all thy
ways.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There must be no respect of Persons in doing Justice. The
great Judge of all the World gives it as a Rule, and himself
gives the Example, <hi>God is no respecter of Persons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King was pleas'd to charge both Houses, to make a strict

                     <p>Let me remember you of a stronger and higher Case, and I
have it out of an Author of the Law too. <hi>Crompt. Jurisd. of

                     <p>In a Case of <hi>Corpus cum Causa. Whidden,</hi> one of the Judges
of the Court, cited a Case that did happen in the time of
<hi>Gascoign Ch. I.</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>H. 4. Gascoign</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (who was afterwards our King <hi>H.</hi> the
<hi>5th.</hi>) to Prison for endeavouring to take away a Prisoner from
the Bar of the King's Bench, and the Prince humbly submitted
and went to Prison, and the King hearing of it, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it.</p>
                     <p>If the King's Bench, being an Inferior Court to that high
Court, might soar so high, how much more the highest Court
of the Realm; where the King sits in the Exaltation of his
Orb, and is in his greatest Splendor?</p>
                     <p>The King indeed is presum'd in Law to be in this Court,
which makes the style of its proceedings to be <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> and
some of our Kings have been said to have sate here. But the

that he in no time stood so high in his State Royal, as
in the time of Parliament. Then if we consider the Person
whom the <hi>Ch. I. Gascoign</hi> Committed. He was a continuing,

This is Resolved in the <hi>Countess of Rutland</hi>'s <hi>Case</hi> 6 Rep. 54. and
the same Case likewise Reported in <hi>Moor</hi>'s Rep. 765. That an
Officer or Minister executing Process which is erroneously awarded
(as where a <hi>Capias</hi> is awarded against a Peer) the Officer is
to be excus'd; for he must not dispute the Authority of the Court,
but obey. And in that Case the Secondaries of the <hi>Counter,</hi> and the
Serjeants in <hi>London</hi> were excus'd and held not guilty of any offence.</p>
                     <p>So in the Case of the <hi>Marshelsea,</hi> 10 Rep. 76. Where the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction

though the Process be Erroneous. <hi>Qui jussu Judicis aliquod fecerit,

Arrested, is granted, where it ought not to be; and
the Sheriff by virtue of that Writ discharged the person Arrested.
Yet the Sheriff (saith that Case) is not chargeable in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for this: <hi>Parere necesse est.</hi> What that necessity is we may see
in that Case of <hi>Trewinnard, Dier fo. 61. a Med.</hi> if the Sheriff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to execute the Writ.</p>
                     <p>And as a fair warning to Sheriffs, and other Officers not to
resist or disobey the Commands and Orders of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
the Lord <hi>Dier</hi> mentions what punishment was inflicted
upon the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> in the Case of <hi>Geo. Ferrers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> for their contempt in not
letting a Parliament-man taken in Execution, to go at large, when
the Serjeant at Arms of the House of Commons came for him
without a Writ.</p>
                     <p>Nay the Lord <hi>Dier</hi> says, in the latter end of that Case of
<hi>Trewinnard,</hi> that if the Parliament err'd (he speaks it of the House
of Commons) yet there is no default in the Sheriff.</p>
                     <p>When the late King being in Person in the House of Commons,
and sitting in the Speaker's Chair, ask'd the then Speaker, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
certain Members, whom the King named, were then in the
House. The Speaker answer'd readily, and wisely, and with a
good presentness of mind (which arose from the Genius of that
House) <hi>That he had neither Eyes to see, nor Tongue to speak,</hi> but as
the House was pleased to direct him.</p>
                     <p>III. <hi>POINT.</hi> As to the last Point; That for matters done in
or by the Parliament (as the matters in our Case are) neither the
<hi>King's-Bench,</hi> nor any other Court, but the Court of Parliament
it self, can by Law take Cognizance of it. <hi>This is the great Point
of the Case.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall first offer to prove it by Reasons, and then I shall back
and enforce those Reasons by many Authorities, and those of the
highest sort.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Reason.</hi> The Parliament <hi>gives Law to this Court</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Beneh,</hi>
and to all other Courts of the Kingdom; and therefore it is
absurd and preposterous that it should receive Law from it, and be
subject to it. The greater is not judged of the less.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57483:27"/>
2. The Parliament is the immediate Court for Examining the
Judgments of the Court of <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and if they be erroneous,
they reverse them; and if this Court should against Law take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to proceed in this Cause, and give Judgment, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
when it Meets, no doubt, will set it aside as Erroneous: And
no Man does in the least doubt but they have power to do it, and
there is as little doubt but they will do it; therefore it is wholly
in vain for this Court to take Cognizance of it; and it cannot be
revers'd elsewhere, it being in a matter of Jurisdiction. See the
Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 8. The Preamble reciting, that Erroneous
Judgments given in the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> are only to be reform'd by
the <hi>High Court of Parliament;</hi>

Neither yet in respect of the greater Affairs of the Realm could
they well be consider'd of and determin'd in Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is an Exception of Errors that concern'd the Jurisdiction
of the <hi>King's-Bench;</hi> those remain as before; and in the Errors
that are referr'd to the Judges of the Common-Pleas and Barons of
the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> by 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 8. the Jurisdiction of the Parliament is
to Examine them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. This Court, as all the Courts of Common-Law, Judge only
by the ordinary Rules of the Common-Law. But, the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Parliament are by quite another Rule. The matters in
Parliament are to be discuss'd and determin'd by the Custom and
Usage of Parliament, and the Course of Parliament; and neither
by the Civil, nor the Common-Law, used in other Courts.</p>
                     <p>4. The Judges of this, and of the other Courts of Common-Law
in <hi>Westminster,</hi> are but Assistants and Attendants to the High
Court of Parliament: And shall the Assistants judge of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors?</p>
                     <p>5. The High Court of Parliament is the dernier resort, and this
is generally affirm'd and held; but it is not the last, if what
they do may yet again be examin'd and controll'd.</p>
                     <p>6. The Parliament is of an absolute and unlimited power in
things Temporal within this Nation.</p>
                     <p>I shall now proceed to Authorities that are full to this Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and do second and back those Reasons that I have offer'd; wherein
I shall not observe any method by reducing or ranking of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these Reasons that I have offer'd, because some of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
justifie several of these Reasons, all at once.</p>
                     <p>That the Parliament hath the highest and most sacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of my Reasons.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Trewinnard</hi>'s case, it is said, that though the Parliament erre,
it is not reversible in any other Court: This is spoken in a case
where the then occasion was upon a Judgment given, only by the
House of Commons, in a case of Priviledge.</p>

for a Judgment in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> Error must
be sued in Parliament; and as the Parliament shall correct the
Judgments, so they are to correct the <hi>Judges</hi> that give corrupt
and dishonest Judgments. These are the words and the opinions
of the Lord chief Justice <hi>Vaughan</hi> in his Reports <hi>fo.</hi> 139. in <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shel</hi>'s
case. Such, says he, in all ages have been complained of to the
<hi>King in the Star-Chamber,</hi> (which is a Court now dissolv'd by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
<hi>or to the Parliament.</hi> He there mentions many Judges;
those 44. that were hang'd in King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time before the
Conquest, for corrupt judgments; and those in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 1.
<hi>E.</hi> 3. and <hi>R.</hi> 2. for their pernicious resolutions: He vouches the
Journals of Parliament, and instances in the <hi>Judgment of Ship-money</hi>
in the last King's time, and the particular Judges impeach'd.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in his 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> fol. 64. the words are spoken by Sir <hi>E. C.</hi>
but (as that Rep. says) with the clear consent of all the Judges.
<hi>The King hath his Court, that is to say, in the Vpper House of
Parliament, in which he with his Lords is the Supreme Judge over
all other Judges. For if Error be in the</hi> Common-Pleas <hi>that may be
revers'd in the</hi> King's-Bench; <hi>and if the Court of</hi> King's-Bench <hi>erre,
that may be revers'd in the Upper House of Parliament, by the King
with the assent of the Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now though this is spoken of the Lords House only, yet it must
be again remembred that the Parliament (as I prov'd before) is one
entire Body, and that their power in the right of it is entire, though as
to the exercise of it, it is distributed into parts, and is divided:
Not can the House of Lords exercise any power as an House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or as a Court for Errors, without the House of Commons
be in being at the same time. Both Houses must be Prorogu'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and Dissolv'd together; like the Twins of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
they live and die together, and the one cannot be in being, without
the other also, at the same time be, in being too.</p>

                     <p>Sir Rob. Cott. Abr. 20. R. 2. nu. 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey</hi> delivered a Bill to the Commons in Parliament,
for the honour and profit of the King, and of all the Realm,
complaining of the outragious Expences of the Kings House, and
namely of Bishops and Ladies.</p>
                     <p>Here the <hi>Camb. Dr.</hi> I have before mention'd, would take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
again to complain of the sauciness of this Bill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>K. R.</hi> 2. was offended with the Commons for preferring this
Bill to the King; for it seems they had entertain'd this Information
from a particular hand, (as was done in our Case from <hi>Dangerfield</hi>)
and they proceeded upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>K. R.</hi> 2. said it was an offence against his Dignity and Liberty,
and said he would be free therein.</p>
                     <p>And Sir <hi>John Bussey,</hi> the Speaker to the Parliament (as that Roll
of Parliament calls him) is charg'd to declare the Name of him
who Exhibited that Bill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57483:28"/>
By this, it appears the King could not take notice of what was
done in the Commons-House, or deliver'd to them, but by the
House it self, and that is one of the Laws and Customs of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and yet, no doubt but it was well known to every Member
of that House, and yet it came not to the Kings knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nu.</hi> 16. The Commons deliver'd to the King the Name of the
Exhibiter, which was Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nu.</hi> 17. The Commons afterwards came, and submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the King, and crav'd Pardon, and the King excus'd
them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nu.</hi> 23. Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey</hi> was adjudg'd by Parliament to die as
a Traitor. The King was offended, the Commons forsook the
Exhibiter, and submitted, and the Lords adjudge him guilty of
Treason. This seems to be a strong Case against the Liberty and
the Privilege of the House of Commons, (but it seems strange
how it should be made Treason;) but it is stranger; especially, if
it be suppos'd this Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey</hi> was a Member of the House,
one would have thought he should have been under a protection
and special privilege. But I take him to be no Member, for he is
afterwards call'd Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey,</hi> Clerk; and Graduates in the
University, and those in Orders, were usually dignified with the
addition of Sir; and it is not yet quite out of use in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</p>
                     <p>I find by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> in his Plea for the the Lords, <hi>Fol.</hi> 345. that
in the next Kings Reign, <hi>H.</hi> 4. the Commons exhibited a Petition
on the behalf of Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey,</hi> (for he was not Executed, the
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> took him into his Protection, being a
Clergy-man;) and the Commons in their Petition affirm, that the
Judgment against Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey,</hi> for delivering in this Bill to the
Commons in Parliament, was against <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>Course</hi> that
had been <hi>used</hi> before in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in destruction of the <hi>Customs</hi>
of the Commons.</p>
                     <p>Here note,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pryn.</hi> ibid. 388.</note> That the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the
<hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>Commons,</hi> are mention'd as <hi>Synonymies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this Petition of the Commons, the Judgment is adjudg'd
to be null and void.</p>
                     <p>But this could be adjudg'd no where but in Parliament, for it
concern'd the Right and Privilege, and the Customs and Course
of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>H. 4. Nu.</hi> 91. In Sir <hi>Rob. Cott. Abr.</hi> the Record says, Sir <hi>Tho.
Haxey,</hi> Clerk, Pardon'd, and the Judgment revers'd, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
to all.</p>
                     <p>This Case, in very many Circumstances, suits with the Case of
<hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and in many, with our present Case. Ours is in the
Case of an Heir apparent or presumptive. But a greater than the
Heir is here, in this Case of Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey.</hi> namely, the then
King himself.</p>
                     <p>But I cite it, principally to prove one of my Reasons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to the third point, namely, that there are Rights and
Customs that are peculiar to the High Court of Parliament; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57483:29"/>
that there is a Law called the <hi>Course</hi> of Parliaments, and it may
be observ'd, that the Customs of the Commons are the Law and
Course of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Concurring with one observation that I made out of this Case,
that one of the Laws or Customs of Parliament, is, That no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is to publish at the Court, or elsewhere abroad, what is done
in the House of Commons, but it ought to proceed from the House
it self, and no other, (which is another Argument, to prove that no
other inferior Court can enquire into, or hear or determine of their
doings) for no notice can be taken of what they do, unless it come
by their own Relation and Discovery.</p>
                     <p>That, I say, which concurrs with this, is another Roll of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that noble King <hi>H. 4. viz. 2 H.</hi> 4. Nu. 11. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
require, that is, request the King, that he would not give
an ear to any untrue reports of the Commons-House, until the time
might try the same; and that time is when the Commons apply to
the King in it, and not before. <hi>Whereunto the King granted;</hi> which
allows it to be the Law and Course of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Inst. Fol.</hi> 15. Every Court of Justice (says Sir <hi>E. C.</hi>) hath
Rules and Customs for its direction. So the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in his select Case, Printed 1677. <hi>Fol.</hi> 63.
Note (says he) the Privilege, Order, or Custom of Parliament,
either of the Upper House, or of the House of Commons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the determination only of the Court of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And there he cites two Precedents for it.</p>
                     <p>The First that of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. in the Controversy between the Earls
of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Devonishire,</hi> for Precedency: The King, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lords, referr'd it to the Judges to examine and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
not finally to determine as Judges of the Case, but as Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
to the Lords.</p>
                     <p>☞ The Judges answer'd, That it <hi>was a matter of Parliament,</hi> and
belong'd to the King and the Lords to determine.</p>
                     <p>One would think this were a strange answer of the Judges, to
deny their advice; Were they not Assistants to the Lords in
matters of Law?</p>
                     <p>The true reason of their declining to give their Advice, is,
It was a Case above them, and not to be determined by the
ordinary Rules of Law, and therefore out of their element.
<hi>Quae supra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi> Therefore their answer was, That it
was a matter of Parliament, and belong'd to the King and Lords,
but not to the Judges.</p>
                     <p>This is a Resolution of all the Judges in the very point; though
this particular Case concern'd only the Lords,<note place="margin">A Resolve of all the Judges in the point.</note> being a matter of
precedency between Two Lords; yet, as I have prov'd, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is one entire Body, and are mutually concerned in their
powers and privileges.</p>
                     <p>The other Case mentioned by Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> is that of <hi>Tho. Thorp.</hi>

                     <p>The Commons, at the opening of the next Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
request the King and Lords, to restore their Speaker to
them.</p>
                     <p>The Judges being demanded of their Counsel therein; (Note,
it was nothing but their Advice ask'd.) It was after mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
they answered, <hi>It was not their part to judge of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which may judge of the Law.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> in his Plea for the Lords, calls this a famous, memorable Case, and says he was then ch. Baron.</note> Note, the reason to judge of
the Law, signifies they are the Supream Court to judge what is
Law, and what is not. And to judge of the Law, likewise signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
that they can judge whether a Law be good or not; in
order to Approve of it, and to Enact it, or to Repeal a Law.</p>
                     <p>This is in a Case that concern'd the privilege of the Commons
and their Speaker; and yet they say, that judging in this Case were
to judge of the Parliament: This intimates too, that the Parliament
judges by other Rules than those of the Common-Law. And
'tis the Common-Law is the proper Element of the Judges of
the Courts of <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution

Now for an Act of Parliament full in the point,<note place="margin">An Act of Parliament in the point.</note> and then I
can go no higher.</p>
                     <p>It was in the Case of <hi>Richard Strode,</hi> one of the Burgesses for
<hi>Plympton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pryn</hi>'s Plea for the Lords, fol. 401 at large.</note> in the Parliament of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for agreeing
with the Commons House, in putting out Bills (as it is reported
there) which seems to resemble the <hi>Printing or Publishing,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in our Case. Those Bills so put out were against the Abuses
of the Tinners, who were a great and numerous Body of men; who
by these Bills took themselves to be scandalized and slandered.</p>
                     <p>After the Parliament was risen, this <hi>Richard Strode</hi> for <hi>what
he had so done in Parliament,</hi> was presented and found guilty in
the <hi>Stannary-Courts,</hi> and condemn'd to forfeit 40. <hi>l. (a moderate
fine.)</hi> He was for this imprison'd in a Dungeon, within a Castle,
and fed with Bread and Water.</p>
                     <p>When the Parliament met again, he Petition'd the Parliament for
remedy, and that the <hi>Judgments</hi> had against him <hi>and the Executions</hi>
might be <hi>made void;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4 H. 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> which was done accordingly <hi>by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it was further Enacted, That <hi>all</hi> Suits, <hi>Accusations,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations,
Executions, Fines, Amerciaments, Punishments, pass'd or
had, or thereafter to be pass'd or had, upon the said <hi>Strode,</hi> and to
every other person, that <hi>was in that Parliament</hi> (thus far it is a private
and particular Act) but the reason of this, and the Justice of it extends
to all like Cases; but then it goes farther, <hi>Or that of any Parliament
hereafter shall be;</hi> for any Bill, speaking, reasoning, or declaring of
any matter concerning the Parliament, to be communed or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of (these are very large and general words) <hi>be utterly void,</hi>
and of none effect. And it goes farther yet, And that any person
vexed or, troubled, or otherwise charged for any Cause, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said;
shall have an <hi>Action of the Case,</hi> against every person so vexing
contrary to this Ordinance, and recover treble damages and costs.</p>
                     <p>Here now is an Action given against one, for what they shall
do in a course of Justice. But it is because it is suing in an inferior
Court that has no jurisdiction in the matter. This Act takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all jurisdiction in such Parliament Cases, from all other
Courts.<note place="margin">Memorials of the <hi>English</hi> Affairs, fol. 12.</note> I know that in the Case of <hi>Denzill Hollis</hi> (afterwards the
Lord <hi>Hollis</hi>) Mr. <hi>Seld.</hi> and others, 3 <hi>Car.</hi> I. the Judges being
consulted upon some Questions propounded, <hi>Res.</hi> That that Act
of <hi>Strode</hi>'s, was a particular Act, and extended to <hi>Strode</hi> only; and
no doubt it was a particular Act in a great part of it, and in
that part extended to <hi>Strode</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>But if the Judges meant that no part of that Act was a general
Law, then I must crave leave to say, 1. That their opinion was
extrajudicial; it was delivered upon their being consulted with
about Questions propounded to them, and therefore hath not that
weight. And I must take the liberty to appeal to the very words
of the Statute it self, and to any man of reason, and honesty, to
use his reason aright, that shall read them; and I must offer some
reasons against their opinion, and cite some good Authority in that
point, and then leave it to this Court to judge of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57483:30"/>
The words, and persons, and time mention'd in the latter part
of that Act, are general.</p>
                     <p>It speaks indeed, first of <hi>Strode</hi> in particular; but then it hath
these words (every other person.)</p>
                     <p>It mentions that Parliament in particular; but then it proceeds
to speak of (any Parliament that there-after shall be) Then the
things also are general that the Act extends to, not onely to indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>Strode,</hi> for what he had said, or done in parliament; but then
the Indemnity extends to every other person, <hi>for any Bill, Speaking,
Reasoning, or Declaring of any matter concerning the Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words of the Royal Assent to this Bill, are such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
used, only to general Acts, <hi>viz. Le Roy veut;</hi> whereas to a
particular Act, the Royal Answer is, <hi>Soit droit fait al parties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this Act of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is enrolled as general Acts use to be.
But a private or particular Act is always fil'd, but never enroll'd;
for this latter distinction we shall find it in the Case 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. fol.
17, 18. for authority in this question, Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> in his 4th. <hi>Instit.</hi>
fol. 19. holds this Act of 4 H. 8. in the latter part of it to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Act.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed commonly said <hi>Boni Judicis est ampliare jurisdictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
But I take that to be better advice which was given by the
Lord Chancellor, (Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi>) to Mr. Justice <hi>Hutton,</hi> upon
the swearing him one of the Judges of the Court of Common-Pleas;
That he would take care to contain the jurisdiction of the Court
within the ancient <hi>Mere-Stones</hi> without removing the mark.</p>
                     <p>I find but one Resolution in all our Books, that I can meet with,
that seems to make against us in this point, and maintains a juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in this Court, for a Misdemeanor, or Conspiracy suppos'd to
be done by some particular Members of the House of Commons,
in the House in time of Parliament. It is reported by Mr. Justice
<hi>Croke</hi> in his Reports of the time of King <hi>Charles,</hi> fol. 181. but it
is more fully reported in a late Book, entitled Memorials of the
English Affairs, set out by a Learned Lawyer, and the Son of a
Judge; and it is the Case that I lightly touch'd upon but now,
that of Mr. <hi>Hollis, Selden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The offence charg'd upon Mr. <hi>Denzill Hollis</hi> (who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi>)<note place="margin">See <hi>Rushw.</hi> Collect.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi>
and divers other Parliament-men,<note place="margin">1 part pag. 672. Appendix to it pag. 44.</note> was for a force used upon the
then Speaker, Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> (afterwards Lord Keeper) in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in the Speaker's Chair against his will, when he would
have left it; and pressing him to put a question, which the King had
forbidden him to put.</p>
                     <p>For this supposed offence, after the Parliament was Dissolv'd,
these Parliament-men were first convened before the <hi>Council,</hi> where
they refus'd to answer the Charge, it being for matters done in
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Then the Judges had Questions propounded to them, to which
they gave their resolution, <hi>that for things done,</hi> not in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
way, a Parliament-man may be punished after the Parliament
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57483:31"/>
is ended, if he be not punished in Parliament; otherwise as J.
<hi>Croke,</hi> said, <hi>There would be a failure of Justice, but, that regularly
he cannot be compell'd out of Parliament to answer things done in a
Parliament in a Parliamentary course.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Answer seems to be very oracular, for it resolves that a
Parliament-man shall not Answer for things done in Parliament in a
Parliamentary course. If it be done in a Parliamentary course,
what occasion can there be to answer for it? But who shall judge
what is a Parliamentary course, but a Parliament? not Judges
of the Common-Law; for the Parliamentary course differs from the
Rules of the Common-Law.</p>
                     <p>But they refusing to answer at the Council-Board, were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
close Prisoners to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> the King's Attorney, preferr'd an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> against them, that was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in. The Lord Keeper was under difficulties about it, says,
the Author. The Judges of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> were to consult with
the rest of the Judges in granting a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for bailing the
Prisoners. The rest of the Judges would hear arguments, so it was put
off, and delay'd, (as our Author reports it.) At last an Information
was exhibited against <hi>them in the King's-Bench.</hi> The Defendants
pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court; their plea was over-rul'd,
and they refusing to plead over, judgment was entred by <hi>nihil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi>
and they fined and imprison'd.</p>
                     <p>Mr. J. <hi>Croke,</hi> at the latter end of those Reports gives this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account of that Case,<note place="margin">The Resolution of the Commons in <hi>Irewin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s Case is called the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the most high Court of Parliament. If it had been clear that the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> could have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it, they would have begun with it there, but they try'd the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> and the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> first.</note> that afterwards in the Parliament
17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. It was <hi>Resolv'd by the House of Commons,</hi> that those Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-men
should have a recompence for their damages sustain'd
for the services to the Commonwealth in the Parliament, 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.
If a Judge hath thought fit to report this, it may be as fit for me
to mention it. I take that to be the first precedent or resolution given
in any case for what was done in Parliament, and it stands alone;
I have heard of none since that neither. It seems to be directly
against the provision made by it; it is clearly within the Equity and
Reason of it, <hi>Strode</hi>'s Act. I wish I could not say that even those
times of 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. were not full of trouble. It appears much by
the <hi>difficulty the Judges seem'd</hi> to be at in the proceedings of that
Case; this detracts much from that veneration, that otherwise is
justly due to a Resolution so solemn as that of all the Judges.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> in his profound Book of the
Advancement of Learning, dislikes all Precedents that <hi>taste of the
times;</hi> and advises that Precedents should be deriv'd from good
and moderate Times.</p>
                     <p>The only reason that I find given for that proceeding in the
case of <hi>Denzill Hollis,</hi> is that given by Mr. J. <hi>Croke,</hi> viz. <hi>That other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there would be a failure of Justice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reason must be grounded either upon the <hi>Infrequenecy</hi> of
Parliaments, or upon an opinion that <hi>Parliaments will be partial</hi>
in cases of their own Members.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57483:31"/>
As to the first of these (the long intervals between Parliaments,)
This under favour ought to be no reason, especially to come from
a Judges's mouth, (I have a great honour for the memory of that
Reverend Judge) who must needs know, and ought to assert it,
That by the Law, Parliaments ought to be very frequent, and
Judges ought to take part with the Law, and to maintain it.</p>
                     <p>Before the Conquest (as 'tis untruly call'd) by the Law, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
were to be held twice a year, as appears by King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s
Laws, c. 5. in <hi>Lamb. de priscis.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And the Mirror of Justice c. 1. Sect. 3. tells us that King <hi>Alfred</hi>
ordain'd for a perpetual Usage; that twice in the year, (and if need
were) oftner. The Seniors or Earls should assemble themselves
at <hi>London,</hi> to speak their minds.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis reckon'd among the <hi>Abusions</hi> (as they are there term'd)
<hi>of the Common-Law;</hi> That whereas Parliaments ought to be twice
in the year for the salvation of the Souls of Trespassers (and at
<hi>London</hi> too) that they are there but very seldom, and at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the King, for Subsidies and Collections of treasure.</p>
                     <p>And by the Statute of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 14. Parliaments ought to be once
a year, and oftner (if need be) I have heard a Civilian in the
House of Commons give this construction to that short Act, that
the words (If need be) should referr to the Parliaments being
(once a year) aswell as to the words (and oftner) and I never heard
that any man was of that opinion but himself; but I remember
he himself laught when he spoke it, but he was more laught at for
that ridiculous exposition. And should that sense be put upon it,
it would make the Law a very ridiculous thing indeed, for then
the short of it would be this; <hi>That we should have a Parliament
when there is need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to refute that fancy, there is another Statute of the same
King's time, namely, 36 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 10. which says, that for redress
of divers mischiefs and grievances, which daily happen, its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
that a Parliament shall be holden every year without any
such restriction (If need be.)</p>
                     <p>And by the Act of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 1. These Acts are declared to
be in force. And farther, it is Declared and Enacted, That the
holding of Parliaments shall not be discontinued above three years
at the most.</p>
                     <p>Now how can any man say in Defiance of these Laws,
That there can be any long discontinuance of Parliaments?<note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</note>
His now Majesty has been pleased graciously to declare
his Resolution often to meet his People in Parliaments,
and in the word of a King there is power. Nay, we have
the King's Oath for it, for he is sworn to observe the Law;
And <hi>eadem praesumitur esse mens Regis quae legis;</hi> And it is an
high presumption for any man to think, or say otherwise.</p>
                     <p>For that other ground of that reason given by Mr. Justice
<hi>Croke,</hi> viz. That there would be a failure of Justice, if offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
committed in Parliament, were not punishable in the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57483:32"/>
namely, because Parliaments will be partial in Cases of
their own Members. This carries with it a very high reflection
upon that great and solemn Assembly, to entertain a thought so
mean, and so dishonourable of the Supreme Court of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Court which is to Correct the Errors of all other
Courts, and is the last resort of the Nation, that they should be
guilty of Injustice and Partiality.</p>
                     <p>No Man that is a lover of his Country, or a friend to his own
true and honest Interest, will harbour a dishonourable thought of
that great Assembly.</p>
                     <p>I am apter to think, that the reporter of that Case did mistake,
when he charg'd that worthy and reverend Judge, Mr. Just.
<hi>Croke,</hi> with the offering of that for a Reason.</p>
                     <p>I find the most Reverend of our Judges speaking with the greatest
Reverence of that Supreme Court.</p>
                     <p>Besides, the Learned Lord Chief Justice Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> who
often expresses his great veneration for them,</p>
                     <p>Hear what the Ch. Just. <hi>Brook,</hi> and Just. <hi>Saunders,</hi> say of that
Assembly in <hi>Plowd. Comment.</hi> in the Case of <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Grange, Fo.</hi> 175.
<hi>a.</hi> towards the lower end of that <hi>Folio, Injustice</hi> (say they) <hi>may
not be presum'd of a Parliament.</hi> And in the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s
Case, in the same Comment, <hi>Fol.</hi> 398. towards the end of the
Folio, <hi>The Parliament is a Court of very high Honour and Justice,
of which no man ought to imagine a thing dishonourable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do agree, that an offence committed in Parliament, is a very
high offence; but the higher it is, the more proper it is for their
Judicature; and that Court is arm'd with a power to punish the
highest offences, and the highest offenders.</p>
                     <p>But to take it out of their hands, and to make it determinable
in any other Court, is a disparagement to that Grave and Supreme
Court.</p>
                     <p>We easily agree that a Parliament may Erre, for they are not
Infallible; but the Law hath provided a Remedy against those
Errors, and a way to Reform them. A subsequent Parliament
may Reform the Errors of a preceding Parliament, as I have
prov'd by several Authorities.</p>
                     <p>But to say they will be partial or unjust, or corrupt, or do
any thing out of malice, is to raise a scandal upon the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whose Representative they are.</p>
                     <p>I will make no difficulty to affirm, That if any offence whatever
be committed in the Parliament, by any particular Members, (as
this was accounted a Force or Riot in the Case of <hi>Denzill Hollis</hi>
and <hi>Selden,</hi> and others committed upon the Speaker) it is an
high infringement of the right and privilege of Parliament, for
any Person or Court to take the least notice of it, till the House it
self either has punish'd the Offender, or referr'd them to a due or
proper course of punishment. To do otherwise, would be to
make the highest Court an Offender, and to charge them with
Injustice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57483:32"/>
Nay, their right and privilege so far extends, that not only what
is done in the very House sitting the Parliament, but whatever
is done relating to them, or in pursuance of their Order, during
the Parliament, and sitting the Parliament, is no where else to be
punish'd, but by themselves or a succeeding Parliament, although
done out of the House, as in the case of <hi>Ferrers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It any shall imagine, as Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> does, and others, that of
later times the Parliament have encroach'd more power than anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
belong'd to them, I have already answer'd this objection,
by shewing how large a power they exercis'd of old, and see
what is further mentioned in <hi>Lamb. Archion 57. viz.</hi> That King
<hi>H.</hi> 3. was told by his Lords Spiritual and Temporal, that of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time the Creating and Deposing of all the Judges and great
Officers belong'd to the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>I do not deny, but some sort of Orders by them made, are no
longer in force, than while the Parliament sits; but then, what is
done after the Parliament is risen, is not to be said to be done by
their Order, for then it ceases to be their Order: This must be
understood of matters Executory, not as to things executed by
their Order during Parliament.</p>
                     <p>However, this Case of <hi>Denzill Hollis</hi> comes not home to our
present Case, but 'tis wonderfully short of it: This was an Offence
charg'd only upon some Particular Members; and it cannot be
denied, but particular persons, even in the Parliament, may mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demean
themselves, and they are to be punish'd by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but no where else.</p>
                     <p>But in our Case, that which makes the Offence, and for
which the Information is brought by the Kings Attorney, is what
is done by the whole House of Commons, and by virtue of their
express Order. Although, as I have already observ'd, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
it self does not expresly own it, yet the demurrer to the
Defendant's Plea (which sets it all forth) does most plainly avow
it. And this I am sure is without any colour of precedent, and never
was attempted till this time.</p>
                     <p>If any Man will extenuate or justify this way of proceeding,
by saying, that this was not for any thing done in the House, but
a matter done out of the House; <hi>viz.</hi> the Printing and Publishing
was abroad in the Printing-House, and in the Streets, and spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them abroad throughout the Kingdom: Yet this will not salve
it, for the Defendant did what he did as Speaker, and not in his
private Capacity. And it was done by order of the whole House
and sitting the Parliament; so that this Information does directly
question the Parliament it self, and Arraigns their power
and actings; for I have fully prov'd, that what the Defendant has
done, is not his Act, but indeed the Acting of the whole House
of Commons. And I have also prov'd, that the Two Houses, as
to the right of the power that they claim, and use, is but one, and
they are intire, though they may divide in the exercise of that
power. So that it is a matter of the highest concernment to the
Nation that possibly can be.</p>

and it charges him with a Trespass and Contempt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from the Parliament without the Kings Licence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Bishop there pleads (as the Defendant does in this Case)
to the jurisdiction of the Court.</hi> Et dicit quod si quis eorum (<hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lords of Parliament,</hi>) deliquerit erga Dominum Regem
in Parliamento aliquo, in parliamento debet corrigi &amp; emendari, &amp; non
alibi in minori curia quam in Parliamento. Vnde non intendit
quod Dominus Rex velit in curia hic de bujusmodi transgressione &amp;
contemptu factis in Parliamento responderi.</p>
                     <p>Note the Plea, as to the offence, is very general, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to the offence of absenting from the Parliament, but to any
trespass or offence in Parliament. <hi>Si quis deliquerit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it would be a little improper to call absence from Parliament
offence committed in Parliament, for it looks like the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
But in a just sence, any offence committed by a Member
relating to the Parliament, though done out of the House, is
termed an Offence in Parliament. So Printing any thing by
Order of Parliament, though it be done and executed in another
place, yet it may be said to be done by the Parliament, and in
Parliament, if it be by their Order, and in time of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>We may note further that this is a prosecution only against one
particular Person, for a particular Offence and Contempt charg'd
upon him. But in our Case, the prosecution is against the very
Speaker of the Parliament, and is in effect a prosecution against
the Parliament; for it is against him, for what he did by command
and order of Parliament, and sitting the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And though the Attorney-General, reply'd to the Bishops Plea
that the King might sue in what Court he would, yet the Bishop
rejoins upon him and maintains his former Plea, and there it
rests; so that as Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> observes that the Bishops Plea did
stand and was never over-rul'd, agreeable to the resolutions
of former times. So this <hi>I.</hi> may claim as an authority on our
side.</p>
                     <p>And though Mr. <hi>Plowden</hi> the Lawyer,<note place="margin">

pleaded that he remain'd continually from the beginning to the
end of the Parliament, and travers'd the absence whereby he
passes by the advantage of the Plea to the jurisdiction, yet
this is no Authority against us, for he might think fit, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciare

clearing himself from that scandalous imputation of being absent
from doing his duty in Parliament, which certainly is a very
high breach of Trust; and he might be impatient of lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and therefore thought it best to traverse it to clear his
Reputation in that point; yet I must confess I should never
have advis'd it, nor was there any further prosecution against
him.</p>
                     <p>I will mention but one most excellent Record more, and it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
out of the Parliament Rolls, 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Num. 9. Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s

pertinent, and I am sure it is very seasonable.</p>

                     <p>They pray the King, that he will require the Archbishop,
and all other of the Clergy, to Pray for the Peace and good
Government of the Land.</p>
                     <p>And for the King's good will towards the Commons.</p>
                     <p>The King's Answer, is,</p>

Court will allow the Defendant's Plea.</p>

                  <head>A
DISCOURSE
Concerning the
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
IN THE
Realm of England:
Occasioned by the Late
COMMISSION
IN
Ecclesiastical Causes.</head>
                  <p>THE Preamble acknowledges,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 1.</note> That the King justly
and rightfully is, and ought to be, Supream Head of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and is so recognised by the
Clergy in their Convocations. And it is Enacted, That
the King and his Successors shall be taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the only Supream
Head in Earth of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And shall have and
enjoy annexed to the Imperial Crown all Jurisdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the said Dignity of Supream Head of the same Church
belonging. And that the King and his Heirs and Successors, Kings
of this Realm, shall have full Power and Authority from time to
time to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain and
amend all such Errors, Heresies, Abuses, Offences, Contempts and
Enormities whatsoever they be, which by any manner of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Authority or Jurisdiction ought, or may, lawfully be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57483:36"/>
repressed, ordered, redressed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Any Usage, Custom, foreign
Laws, foreign Authority, Prescription or any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
notwithstanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> This Act doth not make the King to be the Supream
Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but acknowledges, that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath been so (as it is recited by the Statute made in the same
Parliament of 26 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 3. the Act for the First-Fruits. See the
Preamble towards the latter Part, being the first Paragraph.) See
also the Oath prescribed by the Statute of 35 H. 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. for the
Succession, Paragraph the <hi>11th</hi> in Mr. <hi>Keeble</hi>'s Edition of the <hi>Statutes</hi>
at large, very full to this purpose, to shew that the Act of 26
<hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 1. gave the King no new Title, but only acknowledged,
that he ever had a Right to it, and that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had
but usurped it.</p>
                  <p>And as the Act of 26 H. 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. gave the King no new Title, so
it gave him no new, nor further Authority in Spiritual and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
things, nor over Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Persons, than
what he had before.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is to be enquir'd what jurisdiction or Authority
the King had before the making of that Act, and how the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Jurisdiction was of right and duly before exercis'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred.
<hi>viz.</hi> in what Courts, by what Rules, Laws or Canons,
and by what Persons.</p>
                  <p>It is clear in Law, that the King himself merely in his own Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Person could never take to himself the Hearing of any Cause
Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and adjudg and determine the Cause
himself: For by the Law and Constitution of the Realm, the King
hath committed all his Power Judicial to divers<note n="*" place="margin">

fol.</hi> 186. at the lower end of that <hi>folio,</hi> and in the middle
of <hi>fol.</hi> 187. All Matters of Judicature and Proceedings in Law
are distributed to the Courts of Justice, and the King doth judg
by his Justices. See the <hi>Reports</hi> that pass by the Name of Sir <hi>Ed.
Cokes 12th. Reports, fol.</hi> 63. the Case of <hi>Prohibitions:</hi> Which is true
as to<note n="*" place="margin">See the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Bishops Courts and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Hundred Court distinct from Provincial and national Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and that there were then Ecclesiastical <hi>Laws,</hi> the Chartter of K. <hi>William</hi> he <hi>1st.</hi> to <hi>Remigius</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Linc.</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Notes <hi>ad Eadmerum</hi> f. 167.</note> Ecclesiastical Causes as well as Temporal; for every Man
knows, that there have been from the first Constitution of the
Kingdom certain Courts and Jurisdictions erected within this
Realm for deciding and determining of Spiritual and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Causes. <hi>Selden</hi>'s History of <hi>Tithes, fol.</hi> 412.</p>
                  <p>All this is excellently well set forth by the Preamble of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 24 H. 8. <hi>cap. 12. concerning Appeals.</hi> That as the King hath
ever been the Supream Head of the Realm (which Word <hi>Head</hi> is
by way of <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and must have relation to some (<hi>Body;)</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57483:36"/>
therefore the Statute in the Preamble proceeds to tell you, what
the Body is to which the Head relates, <hi>viz.</hi> The Body Politick
of the Realm consists of all sorts and degrees of People (within
this Realm) divided by Names of <hi>Spiritualty</hi> and <hi>Temporalty.</hi> The
Statute proceeds to mention the plenary Power, Authority and
Jurisdiction the King hath within this Realm in all Causes. It shews
us how that Power is distributed, and by whom to be exercised.
Not by the King in Person, nor at his Will and Pleasure in any
arbitrary Way; but as that Preamble further iustructs us,<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed. Cokes</hi> 5. Rep. The Case of the Kings Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Law, <hi>f.</hi> 40.</note> The
Body Spiritual hath Power in all Causes Divine and Spiritual to
determin and to administer all such Offices and Duties as to their
rooms Spiritual doth appertain; the like is declared as to Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes to be in the other Part of the said Body Politick, call'd
the <hi>Temporalty.</hi> And both their Authorities and Jurisdictions do
concur in the due Administration of Justice, the one to help the
other.</p>
                  <p>The Preamble of this <hi>Stat. of</hi> 24 H. 8. c. 12. of Appeals further
shews, how that this Ecclesiastical and Spiritual Jurisdiction, had
been confirmed and defended by several antient Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Usurpations of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (and that
long before the Reformation of Religion.) Then comes the Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Part, which does Ordain, That all Causes determinable by
any Spiritual Jurisdiction, whether they concern the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(as the Case of the King's Divorce) or any of the Subjects,
shall be heard, examined discussed, clearly, finally and definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adjudged and determined, within the Kings Jurisdiction and
Authority, and not elsewhere <hi>in such</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Commissions at the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but only gradually <hi>upon Appeales</hi> Sir <hi>John Davies</hi> Reports <hi>fol.</hi> 91. the Case of <hi>Premunire 4.

                     <hi>Courts Spiritual</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
of the same, as the nature of the Cases shall require.</p>
                  <p>Then the same Statute shews us in what Courts, and by what
Steps and Method, Suits and Proceedings concerning Spiritual and
Ecclesiastical Matters ought to be handled, <hi>See Paragraph</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10. It begins with the Arch Deacon's Court, which is <hi>infimi gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
and proceeds gradually from the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> to the <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,</hi>
from him to the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and at last it mentions the
<hi>Convocation,</hi> as the Supreamest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That further Appeals have been given by several Acts of
Parliament, as by 25 <hi>H. 8 c</hi> 19. from the Arch-Bishop or Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan
to the King in <hi>Chancery,</hi> which is by Commission of <hi>Delegates,
&amp;c.</hi> And it hath been Resolved, That though the Acts of 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
<hi>cap.</hi> 12. and of 25. <hi>H. 8 cap.</hi> 19. do upon certain <hi>Appeals,</hi> make the
Sentence definitive as to any further <hi>Appeal,</hi> yet the King (as <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head)</hi> may grant a Commission of Review: <hi>See</hi> the Case
of <hi>Halliwell</hi> against <hi>Jervois,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Moores</hi> Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 462.
and in the same Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 782. in the Case of <hi>Bird</hi> against <hi>Smith,</hi>
and in Sir <hi>Edw. Cokes 4th. Institutes, fol.</hi> 341.</p>

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57483:37"/>
And as the Kings Ecclesiastical Power and Jurisdiction are by
the Fundamental Laws of the Realm distributed into several
Courts, which are mentioned and confirmed by the said several
Acts of Parliament, and may not therefore be exercised by any
other, but by such Courts, and in such Method and Manner as by
Law, and the said Acts of Parliament it is provided: So also those
Courts cannot proceed <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi> but by the known and setled
Ecclesiastical Laws, Constitutions and Canons that are in force.</p>
                  <p>By the Act of 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. Entituled, <hi>An Act for restoring to the
Crown the Antient Jurisdiction over the Estate Ecclesiastical and
Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. the seventeenth <hi>Paragraph</hi> in <hi>Keeble</hi>'s Book of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
It is Enacted, That such Jurisdictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Spiritual and

viz. It was Enacted out of necessity, <hi>&amp;c. and ibid.</hi> Necessity did
cause this Commission, and it was not to be Exercis'd, but upon
necessity; for it was never intended, That it should be a continual

                  </p>
                  <p>That the main Object of that Act was to deprive the <hi>Popish</hi>
Clergy. <hi>See fol. 332 Almere</hi>'s Case, and <hi>Taylor</hi> and <hi>Massie</hi>'s Case,

Upon the last recited Clause in that of 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the late Court call'd, <hi>The High Commission Court:</hi> From
which Act it may be observed and collected, That it needed
an Act of Parliament to give such Authority to the Queen to
grant such Letters Patents, or Commission; and that without
an Act of Parliament such Commission could not have been
granted: For if the Queen by her meer <hi>Prerogative</hi> and Supream
<hi>Power</hi> in Ecclesiastical Causes could have granted such Commission
an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> had been unnecessary. And the express
Words of the Act are, That the Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall have power,
<hi>(by vertue of this Act)</hi> and the Law had (as hath been before
observ'd) distributed the Kings Ecclesiastical Power and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
into several Courts: So that, <hi>without a new Law,</hi> the like
Power could not be put into any other hands in Derogation
of those ordinary Ecclesiastical Courts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Note,</hi> This Act makes no new Crimes nor Offences,
but gives the Commissioners or Patentees Power to Visit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
Redress, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all such Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Abuses, Offences, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and Enormities, which by any manner of Spiritual
or Ecclesiastical <hi>Power</hi> can, or <hi>lawfully</hi> may be, Reformed, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed,
Corrected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Sir <hi>Edw. Cokes 12 Rep. fol.</hi> 49: It was Resolved, <hi>Trin. 6. Jae.
Per totam Curiam,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> (there being
then Five Judges of that Court, <hi>Coke</hi> being Chief Justice) That
the High Commissioners by vertue of their Commission, and that
Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ought to proceed according to Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Law. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If their Commission gave them any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which was not allowed or warranted by that Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
it was not Legal (which proves that such Power cannot
be exercis'd by a Commission under the Great Seal merely,
without an Act of Parliament) See <hi>Drakes</hi> Case in Justice <hi>Croke</hi>'s
Reports of the time of King <hi>Charles, fol.</hi> 220.</p>
                  <p>There it is also Resolv'd, That the King by his Commissioners
cannot alter the Ecclesiastical Law, <hi>nor the Proceedings of ☞
it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Word <hi>(Lawfully)</hi> had not been in that Act of 1.
<hi>Eliz.</hi> yet it must have been so intended, and the Judges of the
Common Law (who are proper Judges, Expositors and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of Acts of Parliament) would have so understood it;
as appears by the Resolution of the Judges in the Case in the
same 12. <hi>Rep.</hi> of the Lord <hi>Coke, fol.</hi> 84, 85. and little regard

In the last Case, <hi>ibidem fol.</hi> 85. the Chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi> says,
He had seen the Commission made to <hi>Cromwell</hi> (by King <hi>Hen.</hi>
VIII.) to be Vice-gerent, and other Commissions to others (by
his appointment) and he refers to the Commission at large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in his Book of Precedents.</p>

Rules to be observ'd upon such extraordinary Commissions, <hi>viz.</hi>
They ought to be solemnly read; for they may possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
many things against the Law (as the Commission in that
Case mentioned did.) The Commissioners may every one of them
require Copies of the Commission: The Commissioners ought to
Sit in an open Place, and at certain Days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note</hi> also, That such Commissions ought not to be kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
but they ought to be Enrolled in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> That the
Subjects may be under a known Authority. See Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s 4.

                     <hi>Note,</hi> That part of the Act of 1 <hi>Eliz. viz.</hi> the <hi>18th. Paragraph</hi>
(before <hi>verbatim</hi> transcribed) <hi>viz.</hi> of the Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and her
Successors granting such Letters Patents or Commissions in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Causes, is repealed by the Act made 16 <hi>Car. 1. cap.</hi> 11. See
it in Mr. <hi>Keeble</hi>'s Book of Statutes at large. See the last <hi>Paragr.</hi> or
Clause in that Act of Repeal of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. It is Enacted, That <hi>no
new Court shall be erected or appointed,</hi> which shall have <hi>The like
Power</hi> or Jurisdiction, as the High Commissioners had or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have; but that all such <hi>Letters Patents, Commissions</hi> and
Grants, and all Powers and Authorities thereby granted, and all
Acts, Sentences and Decrees to be made by vertue or colour of
them shall be <hi>Void.</hi>

                     <hi>Note,</hi> The late Act of 13 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 12. in Mr. <hi>Keeble</hi>'s Book of
Statutes, does declare that the Ordinary Power of Arch-Bishops
and Bishops was not taken away by that Repealing Act of 17
<hi>Car. 1. cap.</hi> 11. (as this last <hi>Act</hi> dates it.)</p>

But by this <hi>Act</hi> of 13 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 12. in the second <hi>Paragraph.</hi> The
aforesaid Repealing <hi>Act</hi> of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and all the Matters and Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
therein contained (excepting what concerns the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
Court; or, <hi>the new Erection of some such like Court by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)</hi>
are Repealed. See the third <hi>Paragraph</hi> also of the <hi>Act</hi> of
13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. That the <hi>High Commission Court</hi> shall not be Revived.</p>
                  <p>So that I conceive, no such <hi>Commission</hi> nor Letters Patents can
now be granted, but the Repealing <hi>Act</hi> of 16, or 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. stands
in force against it.</p>
                  <p>By what Law or Rules <hi>Cromwell</hi> in the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi>
VIII. and by what Instructions he acted, does not appear; the
<hi>Commissions</hi> to make him <hi>Vicar General</hi> (which was surely in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of what had been used by the Pope in the time of his U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation)
or that of <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> in Ecclesiastical Matters (which
seems to be new and <hi>prime Impressionis)</hi> are not now to be found,
of which Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in the History of the <hi>Reformation of the Church
of England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hist. of the Reformation, 183. <hi>med. folii.</hi>
                     </note> makes some probable conjectures, <hi>fol.</hi> 181. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consisted the difference between those two <hi>Authorities</hi> and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and the Commissions for the exercise of them is not easy to
find out: But the thing then principally design'd was to suppress
the religious Houses belonging to the regular Clergy, which were
great Supports to the <hi>Popish</hi> Hierarchy, not at all to impeach
the Lawful Power and Jurisdiction of Episcopacy; for we find
at the same time as <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Commissions were in force, and had
been then but newly passed, That <hi>Cranmer</hi> Arch-Bishop of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
made his Metropolitical Visitation; under which (as I
conceive) most properly falls the Conusance of any contempt or
abuse committed by any of his Suffragan Bishops; if not in a<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>fol.</hi> 511, 512. The antient <hi>Canon</hi> requires the consent of 12, Bishops to censure, judge and depose a Bishop.</note>

                  <p>The exclusion of the Pope in the Time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. made
no diminution of the Power or Jurisdiction of the Clergy, as to
determining of Ecclesiastical Causes, or making Canons, Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and other Synodical Acts, as is rightly observ'd by Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>
in his Introduction to the History of <hi>Laud</hi> late Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury;</hi> upon this ground it is, that to this day they exercise
all manner of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in their own Names, and
under the distinct Seals of their Offices, the Statutes that made
some <hi>Alteration</hi> in the matter being all repealed: See Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>Introduct.</hi> aforesaid, <hi>ibid. fol.</hi> 341.</p>
                  <p>The Legislative Power in Matters Ecclesiastical continues in
the <hi>Convocation</hi> for making Canons and Constitutions confirmed
by the King and Parliament; Discipline and the Admonition still
resides in the Bishops and those under them.</p>

In Case of any Irregularity in the Metropolitan, Resort must
doubtless be to the Head of the Church upon Earth (the King)
as it was in the Case of Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who shooting at a
Deer unfortunately kill'd the <hi>Keeper;</hi> and his Jurisdiction (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suspended) was supplyed by Commission, as you may read in
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> of the Life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> in the <hi>87th fol.</hi> of
