            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the effect of Education may be liken'd to a second Birth, I may truly say, that I came into the World with a desire to travel. The daily discourses which several Learned men had with my Father upon Geographical subjects, which my Father had the reputation of understanding very well, and to which, though very young, I was with much delight attentive, inspir'd me betimes with a design to see some part of those Countries, which were represented to me in the Maps, from which I never could keep off my Eyes. By two and twenty years of Age, therefore I had seen the fairest Regions of <hi>Europe, France, England,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and I spake indifferently well the Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges most necessary and most generally spoken.</p>
                  <p>My first sally was into <hi>England,</hi> where at that time Reigned King <hi>James;</hi> from thence I pass'd into <hi>Flanders</hi> to see <hi>Antwerp,</hi> my Father's Native Country, and so into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> where my inclination to travel became the stronger, by reason of the great concourse of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which I met at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that crouded thither from all parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>Having seen what was most considerable in the united Provinces, I pass'd into <hi>Germany,</hi> and when I came to <hi>Norimbergh,</hi> by the way of <hi>Frankfort</hi> and <hi>Auspurgh,</hi> the noise of the Armies that were marching into <hi>Bohemia</hi> to retake <hi>Prague,</hi> instill'd into me a desire to go to the Wars, where I might learn something that might be useful to me in the series of my travels. I was not above a days journey from <hi>Norimbergh,</hi> when I met a Colonel of Horse, whose name was <hi>Hans Brener,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip Brener,</hi> Governour of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who engag'd me to follow him into <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Sometime after I bore the same Colonel company to <hi>Vienna,</hi> who presented me to the Governour of <hi>Raab,</hi> his Uncle, then Viceroy of <hi>Hungary</hi> also; who receiv'd me into his Family as one of his Pages. For it is a usual thing in <hi>Germany</hi> for Gentlemen's Sons to serve in that quality 'till five and twenty years of age, and seldom to quit that service, 'till they have a Commission for a Cornet, or Ensigns place. Four years and a half I serv'd the Viceroy, when the Prince of <hi>Mantua</hi> came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to engage the Emperour in certain
<pb facs="tcp:106224:6"/>
designs of his own without success. At that time the Count of <hi>Arc,</hi> whose Sister the Viceroy had Marry'd, was chief Minister to the Prince of <hi>Mantua;</hi> and coming to visit the Viceroy at <hi>Javarin,</hi> I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend him during his stay there. Upon his departure, he told the Viceroy, that the Prince of <hi>Mantua</hi> had no person about him that understood the Language, and that therefore he might be sure that the Prince would take it for a great kindness, to permit me to attend his person during his stay at the Emperours Court. This was a thing easily granted to the Count of <hi>Arc;</hi> who thereupon carry'd one along with him to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where having had the good fortune not to displease the Prince, he testify'd to me at his departure, that he should be glad to see me at <hi>Mantua,</hi> where he would not forget the services I had done him. This presently infus'd into me a desire of seeing <hi>Italy,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon the opportunity that offer'd it self not long after.</p>
                  <p>For Monsieur <hi>de Sabran,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Envoy to his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majesty, being to go for <hi>Venice,</hi> and desirous of one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the <hi>German</hi> Language to bear him Company, I laid hold of the occasion, so that in eight days we got to <hi>Venice.</hi> While we stay'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> I took a view to my great satisfaction, of that most Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted City, and in regard it is in many things like to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as in Situation, Greatness, Magnificence, Commerce, and Concourse of Strangers, my being there did but still reinforce my inclination to Travel.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Venice</hi> I went to <hi>Mantua</hi> with Monsieur <hi>de Sabran,</hi> where the Prince being glad to see me again, gave me my choice of an Ensign, or of a place in the Company of the Ordonnance of the Duke his Father. I accepted the latter, as being glad to be under the Command of the <hi>Conde de Guiche,</hi> who was then Captain. At the Siege of <hi>Mantua</hi> I had like to have been slain, but for the goodness of a Cuirass which I had chosen out of the Princes Magazin, being hit with two Bullets above and upon the left pap, which had enter'd, had not my Arms been excellent proof: So that after I was recover'd of my Bruises, a longer stay at <hi>Mantua</hi> did not agree with my desire to travel.</p>
                  <p>Therefore some time after the Siege was rais'd, I took leave of the Prince, who gave me an honourable Pass, by vertue whereof five or six Horse-men bore me Company back to <hi>Venice.</hi> From <hi>Venice</hi> I went to <hi>Lauretta,</hi> from <hi>Lauretta</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> from whence returning to <hi>Rome</hi> again, I stay'd there ten or twelve days. After that I went to see <hi>Florence, Pisa, Ligorn,</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> from whence I Embark'd for <hi>Marseilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Marseilles</hi> I hasted to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I could not stay long; for being desirous to see <hi>Poland,</hi> I pass'd once more into <hi>Germany</hi> through <hi>Switzerland,</hi> after I had tak'n a survey of the principal Towns of the <hi>Cantons.</hi> I went by the <hi>Rhine</hi> by Water, to visit <hi>Strasburgh</hi> and <hi>Brisack;</hi> thence by Land crossing <hi>Suabia,</hi> I passed through <hi>Ulme</hi> and <hi>Auspurgh</hi> to go to <hi>Munich.</hi> There I saw the Magnificent Palace of the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which <hi>William</hi> the fifth began, and which <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Son finish'd, in the heat of the Wars that troubl'd the Empire. From thence I went the second time to <hi>Norimbergh,</hi> and <hi>Prague,</hi> and leaving <hi>Bohemia</hi> I enter'd into <hi>Silesia,</hi> and pass'd the <hi>Oder</hi> at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eslaw.</hi> From <hi>Breslaw</hi> I went to <hi>Cracovia,</hi> one of the greatest Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> or rather a Town compos'd of three Cities, the ancient Seat of the King
<pb facs="tcp:106224:6"/>
of <hi>Poland.</hi> From thence, keeping the <hi>Vistula</hi> upon the left hand, I went to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> and saw there the Court of King <hi>Sigismund,</hi> which is a noble and splendid Habitation.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Warsaw</hi> I return'd to <hi>Breslaw,</hi> taking the Road toward the Lower <hi>Silesia,</hi> designing to visit one of the principal Officers of the Emperours Houshold, who was my particular acquaintance. But about two Leagues from <hi>Glogaw,</hi> meeting with Colonel <hi>Butler,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Colonel of one of the Emperours Regiments of Horse, who afterwards kill'd <hi>Walesteyne</hi> in pursuance of the Orders he receiv'd, I gave over my first intended journey. His Wife was a great lover of the <hi>French,</hi> so that being earnestly oblig'd by both together, I could not withstand the testimonies of their kindness. There I understood that the Emperour was going to <hi>Ratisbone</hi> with his Son <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, to Crown him King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> so that I, who had seen the Coronations of the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> being desirous to see the third Solemnity also, took leave of my Colonel, and hasted to <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that time arriv'd to <hi>Ratisbone</hi> several Jewellers, one of which came to his end by an accident so tragical, that all the whole Court pity'd his untimely fate. He was the only Son of one of the riohest Merchants of <hi>Europe,</hi> that liv'd in <hi>Frankfort,</hi> whose Father had sent him with Jewels to sell at the Coronation. For fear of being Robb'd he had conveigh'd them before into the hands of a <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> his Correspondent, to be deliver'd to his Son at his coming. This young man arriving at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> went to the <hi>Jew,</hi> who told him that he had receiv'd a small Casket of Jewels from his Father, which he might take away, when he pleas'd. At the same time the <hi>Jew</hi> invited the young man to drink, and carry'd him to a publick House upon the Key of the City, where they continu'd 'till about an hour after day was shut in. At this time, both going out together, the <hi>Jew</hi> led the young man through a private Street where few people pass'd by, and there having stabb'd him five or six times in the Belly with a Dagger, left him wallowing in his Blood. A while after, one of the Emperour's Trumpets going that way in the dark, stumbl'd at the Legs of the unfortunate youth, who still breath'd, and fell upon his Body. At first feeling his hands wet, he thought it had been some drunken fellow that had eas'd his stomach; but upon second thoughts, imaging it might be some wounded person, he ran and call'd the Officers, who coming with Lanthorns, beheld the tropick spectacle of a young man weltring in his own gore. Thereupon the Officers carrying the Body to the same publick House, as being next at hand, his face was no sooner wash'd, but the Woman and Maid of the House knew him to be the same young man that had been there drinking with the <hi>Jew</hi> not long before. But as for the young man he presently expir'd, without being able to make the least discovery. However the <hi>Jew</hi> was seiz'd that evening, and being seiz'd, cofess'd the Crime. The Imperial Laws ordain, that a <hi>Jew</hi> for killing a <hi>Christian</hi> should be hung upon a Gibbet by the Heels, and that two fierce Dogs should be hung by him in the same manner, to the end, that the Dogs in their madness should tear out his Bowels. But the <hi>Jews</hi> made such presents to the Empress that the Sentence was chang'd, though the punishment was not much less rigorous. For his flesh was torn with red hot Pincers from several
<pb facs="tcp:106224:7"/>
parts of his body, in several Streets of the City, and boyling Lead pour'd into the raw wounds; after which he was broken alive upon the wheel, at the publick place of Execution.</p>
                  <p>Being upon my departure from <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> I met with Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> Resident there for the King of <hi>France,</hi> who knowing me in <hi>Paris,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to me to go along with the Monsieur, the Abbot of <hi>Chapes,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Marshal <hi>de Aumont,</hi> and Monsieur St. <hi>Liebau,</hi> who were then intending for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and so for <hi>Palestine.</hi> I lik'd the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition well, and immediately put my self into the Society of those two Gentlemen, from whom I never separated 'till they departed for <hi>Syria</hi> from <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we left <hi>Germany,</hi> we resolv'd to see the Court of <hi>Savony,</hi> whither we got in a few days. By the way we pass'd through <hi>Frey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> a small City, but well worth seeing, for the beauty of the Electors Tombs, and most splendid and magnificent both for Materials and Workmanship in all <hi>Europe.</hi> From thence we went and view'd the stately Castle of <hi>Augustburgh,</hi> seated upon a high Mountain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in among other things there is a great Hall, adorn'd from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with nothing but Horns fasten'd to the Wall; among the rest is the Head of a Hare with two Horns, sent the Elector by the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for a great Rarity. In one of the Courts of the Palace stands a Tree so large in Body, and spreading out the Branches at so wide a distance, that they will cover three hundred sixty five Tables with their shade. And that which makes this Tree more wonderful is, that it is only Birch, that rarely grows to that Immensity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dresde</hi> is the Residence of the Elector, a little City, but a very near one, and well fortify'd; with a Stone Bridge over the <hi>Elbe,</hi> that parts the Old and New Town. The Palace is one of the largest and fairest in <hi>Germany.</hi> But it wants a <hi>Piazza</hi> before it, the principal Gate stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding just at the bottom of a narrow Lane.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Dresde</hi> we went to <hi>Prague,</hi> which was a third time that I saw that great and fair City, or rather three Cities together, only separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Molda,</hi> that throws it self into the <hi>Elbe,</hi> some five or six Leagues below.</p>
                  <p>Having travers'd <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and touch'd upon the corner of <hi>Moravia,</hi> we enter'd <hi>Austria,</hi> and came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> resolving there to Embark with all speed, because the Winter came on.</p>
                  <p>We stay'd one day at <hi>Presburgh</hi> to see the great Church, and some Relicks which they shew'd us, and from thence fell down to <hi>Altenburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Altenburgh</hi> is a City and Province belonging to the Count of <hi>Arach.</hi> It was the Childs part of one of the Queens of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who upon her death-bed bequeathed it to one of the Lords of her Court, upon condition that he and his Successors should always keep such a number of Peacocks; for defect whereof, the Territory should revert to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Thence we came to <hi>Signet,</hi> from whence I took a little Boat and hasted to <hi>Raab,</hi> where I did my Devoirs to the Viceroy, who was glad to see me, and gave noble entertainment to the <hi>Messieurs de Chapes,</hi> and <hi>de St. Liebau.</hi> Here we stay'd eight or ten days for the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi>'s Answer, whether he would give liberty to two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, to pass with their Train through his Garrison or no; which being return'd
<pb facs="tcp:106224:7"/>
such as we could desire, we Embark'd at <hi>Comorra</hi> in a sort of Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines well fitted for defence and convenience.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Javarin</hi> we laid three days upon the water, by reason of the great turnings and windings of the <hi>Dunaw.</hi> Leaving <hi>Javarin</hi> we lay at <hi>Comorra;</hi> and from <hi>Comorra</hi> we row'd to <hi>Buda</hi> in two days. For the Road by Land is seldom travell'd, in regard that the Frontiers of both Empires are full of Thieves and Boothaylers. In fair weather you may go from <hi>Bada</hi> to <hi>Belgrade</hi> in less than eight days, but we were forc'd to stay longer upon the Water, in regard of the Cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>It is the custom in <hi>Hungary,</hi> that in all Roads little frequented by Strangers, not to take any Money of the Traveller; For the Burghers lodge and entertain them civilly, for which the Burgo Master at the years end repays them out of the publick stock. But besides, that they are not troubl'd with many passengers; <hi>Hungary,</hi> which is one of the best Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> affords provision at so cheap a rate, that to <hi>Belgrade</hi> it costs us not above two Crowns a day for fourteen people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Buda</hi> stands upon the right hand of the <hi>Danaw,</hi> about half an hours travelling from the River. The <hi>Basha</hi> being advis'd of our arrival, sent his Squire with led Horses, and several Slaves in very good Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to conduct us to the Town. And though we stay'd twelve days before we could speak with him, by reason of his being sick at that time, yet he allow'd us a fair provision of Mutton, Pullets, Rice, Butter, and Bread, and two <hi>Sequins</hi> a day for small expences. He was a comely person, and of a handsom carriage; and at our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he sent six <hi>Caleshes</hi> with two <hi>Spahi's</hi> to conduct us to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> with order to defray our expences, which would by no means be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Coming to <hi>Belgrade</hi> we found the <hi>Sangiai</hi> as rude, as we had found the <hi>Basha</hi> civil before. For he made a ridiculous demand of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ducats a Head, and for fifteen days prolong'd the contest. But at length I so terrify'd him, by threatning to send our Complaints to the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Port, of his ill usage of two Gentlemen; kinsmen to the Embassador of <hi>France,</hi> that he was contented with fifty Ducats for all. <hi>Belgrade</hi> is scituated upon a point of Land, where two great Rivers, the <hi>Danaw</hi> and the <hi>Sava</hi> meet; and is furnish'd with Wine, Bread, and all sorts of provisions at a cheap rate.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Belgrade</hi> we took some Saddle Horses, some Coaches for <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi> as every one lik'd best. We pass'd through <hi>Sophia,</hi> a large and well peopl'd City, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the ancient <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> and the residence of the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Romeli.</hi> In it stands a fair <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which hath been a Christian Church, built with so much Art, that three men may go up to the top of the Steeple, and not see one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Sophia</hi> we came to <hi>Philippoli,</hi> between which Town and <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople</hi> we met with two Troops of <hi>Tartars</hi> well mounted. When they saw us, they made a Lane for us to pass through them, with a design most certainly to have fall'n upon us; since they could not hope to do any good upon us, but by surprize and number; for they were ill provided of Weapons, and we rarely well Arm'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we alighted and Barricado'd up our selves with our Chariots.
<pb facs="tcp:106224:8"/>
In the mean time we sent our <hi>Spahi's</hi> to the Commander of those <hi>Tartars,</hi> to tell them, we would not stir 'till they were gone, and that being Souldiers as they were, they could not hope for any booty from us. The Commander answer'd, that he had divided his men in that manner only to do us Honour; but since we desir'd they should be gone, they requested us but to send them a little Tobacco. A boon which we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted them, and so we pass'd on.</p>
                  <p>We came to <hi>Adrianople</hi> the three and twentieth day after we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Belgrade. Adrianople</hi> takes its name from the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> being formerly call'd <hi>Orestes.</hi> It is pleasantly situated at the mouth of three Rivers that throw themselves into the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> The old Town is not very big, but the <hi>Turks</hi> dayly enlarge the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, being a place which the Grand <hi>Signors</hi> very much delight in for the pleasures of Hunting and Hawking, especially at the wild Duck and Heron.</p>
                  <p>The fifth day after we departed from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and the forty second after we departed from <hi>Vienna,</hi> we happily arriv'd at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and crossing through the City over to <hi>Galata,</hi> went to the Ambassador's House. While we stay'd there to winter, we made a small Voyage to the <hi>Dardanells,</hi> to the Ruins of <hi>Troy,</hi> where we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held nothing but Stones, not worth the while of going so far to see. Another day we took three Barks and Sail'd to <hi>Calcedon,</hi> that lies upon the Sea. There is in it a very ancient Church; and they shew'd us the Room where the Council was held, with the same Chairs which were then made use of. Now it is only a Monastery, where two Bishops after they had shew'd us what they could, handsomly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd us.</p>
                  <p>Then we went to view <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pillar at the mouth of the <hi>Black</hi> Sea. Concerning the Channel of which Sea, I must make one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; that though there be no part of the Sea but has one Current, yet this has two quite contrary one to another. That part next to <hi>Europe</hi> carries the Vessel to the <hi>Black</hi> Sea; and that next <hi>Asia</hi> brings it back again to the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> So that you have no more to do but to cross over from one Shore to the other.</p>
                  <p>The Winter being over, the two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen pursu'd their Voyage for <hi>Alexandretta.</hi> But for my part, I having another design in my head, stay'd at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in expectation of a <hi>Caravan,</hi> which the people told me from Month to Month was coming. I was then ignorant, and did not understand that every year there were five or six <hi>Caravans</hi> that went from <hi>Bursa.</hi> Besides, that sometimes eight or ten Merchants travelling together, might go safe to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Which ignorance of mine made me stay longer than I intended. At length, after I had continu'd eleven Months in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with a fair and numerous <hi>Caravan</hi> for <hi>Ispahan,</hi> which was the first time I travell'd into <hi>Asia.</hi> After that I made five others, wherein I had time better to understand the Qualities of the Countries, and the Genius of the People. The three last times I went beyond <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> to the Island of <hi>Java;</hi> so that for the space of forty years, I have travell'd above sixty thousand Leagues by Land; never retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but once into <hi>Europe</hi> by Sea. And thus in my six Voyages, and by travelling different Roads, I had the leisure and opportunity
<pb facs="tcp:106224:8"/>
to see all <hi>Turky,</hi> all <hi>Persia,</hi> and all <hi>India;</hi> particularly the famous Diamond Mines, where no <hi>European</hi> had been before me. Of these three great Empires therefore have I resolv'd to make an ample and exact Description: and I will begin with the several Roads which may be taken from <hi>Paris</hi> into <hi>Persia.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man cannot travel in <hi>Asia,</hi> as they do in <hi>Europe;</hi> nor at the same Hours, nor with the same ease. There are no weekly Coaches or Wagons from Town to Town; besides, that the Soil of the Countries is of several natures. In <hi>Asia</hi> you shall meet with several Regions untill'd and unpeopl'd, either through the badness of the Climate and Soil, or the sloth of the Inhabitants, who rather choose to live miserably, than to work. There are vast Deserts to cross, and very dangerous, both for want of Water, and the Robberies that the <hi>Arabs</hi> daily commit therein. There are no certain Stages, or Inns to entertain Travellers. The best Inns, especially in <hi>Turkie,</hi> are the Tents which you carry along with you, and your Hosts are your Servants, that get ready those Victuals which you have bought in good Towns. You set up your Tent in the open Field, or in any Town where there is no Inn: and a good shift too in temperate weather, when the Sun is not too hot, or that it does not rain. In the <hi>Carvansera</hi>'s or Inns which are more frequent in <hi>Persia</hi> than in <hi>Turkie,</hi> there are persons that furnish you with Provisions, and the first come are best served. As for <hi>Turkie</hi> it is full of Thieves, that keep in Troops together, and way-lay the Merchants upon the Roads, and if they be not very well guarded will certainly rob them: nay many times murder them. A mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief prevented in <hi>Persia,</hi> by the well order'd convenience which is provided for Travellers. To avoid these dangers and inconveniences, you are oblig'd to stay
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106224:14"/>
for the <hi>Caravans,</hi> that go for <hi>Persia</hi> or the <hi>Indies,</hi> which never set out but at certain times, and from certain places.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Caravans</hi> set out from <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Aleppo.</hi> And it is from one of these Cities that a Traveller must set out, that intends for <hi>Persia,</hi> whether he keeps company with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> or will hazard himself alone with a Guide, as once I did.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from whence you may go either by Land or Sea: and either by Land or Sea there are two ways to go. The first of these by Land is that which I took with Monsieur <hi>Chapes</hi> and Monsieur St. <hi>Liebau.</hi> By the way take notice; that <hi>Vienna</hi> is the half-way near upon between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The second Read is less frequented, but is less inconvenient and less dangerous: for there are no need of the Emperour's Pasports, which he does not grant very freely: besides that here is no fear of the Pirates of <hi>Tunis</hi> or <hi>Argier,</hi> as when you embarque from <hi>Marseilles</hi> of <hi>Ligorn.</hi> If you intend this way, you must go to <hi>Venice;</hi> from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Ancona,</hi> from whence several Barques are bound every Week for <hi>Ragusa.</hi> From <hi>Ragusa</hi> you sail along by the Shore to <hi>Durazzo</hi> a Sea-Port of <hi>Albania;</hi> from whence you travel the rest of the way by Land. From <hi>Durazzo</hi> to <hi>Albanopolis,</hi> distant three days journey, from thence to <hi>Monestier,</hi> just as far; from <hi>Monestier</hi> you may either take the left hand through <hi>Sophia,</hi> and <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> or the right through <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guischer,</hi> three days journey from <hi>Monestier,</hi> and ten from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> from whence in five days you reach <hi>Constantinople</hi> through <hi>Selivrea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This last way is part by Sea and part by Land: but there are two other ways alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by Land, above and below <hi>Italy,</hi> according to the distinction which Antiquity made of the two Seas that almost encompass it. You may embark at <hi>Venice,</hi> and saying along the Gulf which is free from Pirates, you must double the Cape of <hi>Matapan,</hi> the most Southern Point of all <hi>Europe,</hi> to enter into the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> The other way is from <hi>Marseilles</hi> or <hi>Ligorn,</hi> from whence several Vessels are bound for the East. The safest way is to go along with the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Fleets, that usually arrive at <hi>Ligorn</hi> either in the Spring or in Autumn, and part just against the <hi>Morea,</hi> to the several parts whither they are bound. As the Wind serves, those Fleets sometimes make Sail between the Iland of <hi>Elba</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and by the Tower of <hi>Messina:</hi> sometimes below <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardigna,</hi> within sight of <hi>Malta.</hi> Thus you must come within sight of <hi>Candy,</hi> whether you are bound for <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> or <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> from whence it is but three days journey to <hi>Aleppo:</hi> from one of which three Cities, you must necessarily begin your journey, if you intend for <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some take <hi>Egypt</hi> in their way, using through <hi>Alexandria, Cairo,</hi> and <hi>Damiata,</hi> whence several Vessels are bound for <hi>Joppa;</hi> or St. <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Acra,</hi> which is not far off: from thence to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> or <hi>Damascus,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bagdat</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you will venture in a single Vessel not staying for the Fleets, you may hire a Vessel from <hi>Ligorn</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Messina,</hi> keeping along by the Shore, and lying a-shore every night. I took this way, and went from <hi>Messina</hi> to <hi>Syracuse,</hi> where are to be seen the most remarkable footsteps of Antiquity. 'Tis like a City under ground, and near to it is a great Rock which has been made hollow, at the bottom whereof if a man whisper, they that are at the top may hear him. They call this Rock <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant's Ear: for being at the top, he easily understood what the People said of him below; and discovered the Counsels of the chief Men of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> whom lie kept prisoners there. <hi>Syracuse</hi> has nothing of that splendour which renown'd it when it was the Mistress of all <hi>Sicily,</hi> and when <hi>Greece,</hi> jealous of her power, made War upon her. But the Soil is very plentiful, and the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> very often take in their Provisions there. Near the City is a fair Convent of <hi>Capuchin</hi> Friers, going out of which you may walk for half an hour between two very high Rocks, where there are several little Cells with every one a Garden, where the Friers sometimes retire, and it is certainly one of the most pleasing Solitudes in the World.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Syracuse</hi> I went to <hi>Malta,</hi> where you must wait for some Ship that is bound for the East.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Road from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> which the Author kept in his first Travels into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is seldom that any <hi>Caravans</hi> go from <hi>Constantinople</hi> into <hi>Persia;</hi> but from <hi>Bursa</hi> they go every two Months: <hi>Bursa</hi> is the Capital City of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> not above three days journey from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or a little more. These two Roads meet at <hi>Chabangi,</hi> where you may be from <hi>Bursa</hi> in two Days: and so I will only speak of the Roads from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> This Journey is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken either with the <hi>Caravan</hi> of Camels, or else ten or twelve Men in a Company, well mounted and well arm'd.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Constantinople,</hi> you cross over to <hi>Scutari,</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Setting out from <hi>Scutari,</hi> the first days journey is very pleasant, over Fields gayly painted with Flowers in their season. At first for some time together, on both sides the way, you see nothing but fair Sepulchers with their Pyramids, and you may easily discern the Womens Monuments from the Mens. For there is a Turbant upon the Pyramid of the Mens Sepulcher, but the Pyramids of the Womens Monuments are trimm'd with the Head-Attire which is worn by the Women of the Country. That Evening you must lye at <hi>Cartali,</hi> a Village of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> the next Day at <hi>Gebisa,</hi> anciently <hi>Lybissa,</hi> famous for the Tomb of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> In that place there are two good Inns, and two fair Fountains.</p>
                     <p>The third Day you come to <hi>Isnich,</hi> which is thought to be the ancient <hi>Niceae;</hi> one part of the City is built upon the descent of a Hill, the other part upon a Plain that reaches to the Sea, and makes the <hi>Golf of Isnich.</hi> The Haven consists of two Moles made of Free-stone, and three great Enclosures encompass'd with Walls, which serve instead of so many Arsenals, wherein there are Store-houses full of large Timber, for building Houses and Galleys. The Country round about being an excellent place for Hunting, and the Soil bearing rare Fruits, and rich in Wine, caus'd <hi>Sultan Amuratt</hi> to build a <hi>Seraglio</hi> in the highest part of the Town, from whence there is a prospect at the same time both over the Sea and the Country. The <hi>Jews</hi> inhabit the greatest part of the Town, dealing chiefly in Timber and Corn. When the Wind serves, you may go from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Isnich</hi> in seven or eight Hours, there being no danger in the passage.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Day you stay at <hi>Chabangi,</hi> a small Town built upon the side of a Lake, call'd <hi>Chaban-Gigul,</hi> where there are two Inns. From the beginning of the Lake for two Leagues together you travel partly over Mountains, partly by the Lake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; where in some places the Horse will be up to the Belly. This Lake is not above ten Leagues in compass; but it yields great store of large Fish, infomuch that I have bought a Pike two Foot and a half long for three Sous. Many Emperours have had a design to make a Cutt out of this Lake into the Sea, for the more easie trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting to <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Timber which grows upon the Mountains near the Lake. And if the Grand <hi>Visier,</hi> who by a Miracle dy'd in his Bed, and left his Son suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor to his Employment, had liv'd some few Years longer, he had no question added this to the rest of those famous Works that eterniz'd his Memory.</p>
                     <p>Departing from <hi>Chabandi,</hi> you come to lye at Night upon the Bank of a River call'd <hi>Zacarat,</hi> which runs Northward and falls into the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> It is a River plentiful in Fish, and you cross over it with a wooden Bridge. There is neither Town, nor Inn in that place; but a League from the River is a great Town call'd <hi>Ada,</hi> the chiefest part of the Inhabitants whereof are <hi>Armenians.</hi> Thither we sent for excellent good Wine, and other necessary refreshments.</p>
                     <p>From that River to <hi>Cancoly,</hi> where you lye the next Night, and have your choice of four Inns; you travel all the day in the Mershes, over wooden Bridges and Causeys.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tuskebasar</hi> is the next place, a small Village with two Inns. From thence to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueslar,</hi> a great Town, with one Inn; built upon a River, where there is great store of Fish taken, which the Inhabitants call <hi>Bourma-balouky,</hi> that is to say, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106224:15"/>
Fish with the long Nose: It is speckl'd like a Trout; but of a better tast, and more esteem'd. <hi>Polia,</hi> or <hi>Polis,</hi> is a City seated at the foot of several Mountains, the Inhabitants whereof are for the most part <hi>Greeks.</hi> These Mountains are very high, and extend themselves along the Road for two days journey. They are full of several sorts of Trees, which are streight and tall like Firr-trees; and divided by so many Torrents, which it would be hard to pass over, were it not for the Bridges that the Grand Visier <hi>Kuprigli</hi> caus'd to be built. In regard the soil of these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is very fat, there would be no drawing for the Horses after great Rains or the melting of the Snow, had not the same Visier caus'd all the Ways to be Pav'd and Pitch'd, even as far as <hi>Constantinople.</hi> A Work of great Charge, in regard there is not a Flint in any part of the Mountain, and for that the Stone is to be fetch'd a great way off. There are abundance of Pigeons as big as Hens, and of an excellent tast, which not only pleas'd our Appetites, but afforded us very good Pastime to shoot them. Between the City and the Mountain, there is a Plain about two Leagues in length; near to which, there glides a River that waters it, and very much contributes to its fertility. It is an excellent Soil, and produces all things necessary for Humane Life, Upon each side of the way I counted above twenty Churchyards. For it is the custom of the <hi>Turks</hi> to bury near the Highway, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Travellers pray for the Souls of the deceas'd. Upon every Tomb, there is to be seen a Marble Pillar, half fix'd in the Earth: of which Pillars there are so great a number, of various Colours, that it is from thence conjectur'd, that there were a very great number of Christian Churches in <hi>Polia,</hi> and the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. They assur'd me likewise, that there were a vast quantity of these Pillars in the Villages up and down in the Mountains, which the <hi>Turks</hi> every day pull down to set upon their Tombs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bendourlour</hi> is a Village in the Mountains, where there is one Inn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gerradar</hi> is beyond the Mountains, where there are two Inns.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Caragalan,</hi> is a Town where there are two Inns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cosizar</hi> is a Village with one Inn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tocia</hi> is a great City situated upon rising Hills, that joyn to very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Upon the Winter West, there appears a fair Champain Country, water'd by a Stream that falls into a River of a greater bigness, call'd <hi>Guselarmac.</hi> Upon the highest of the smaller Hills toward the East, there is a Fortress, where a <hi>Basha</hi> resides; and in the Town is one of the fairest Inns upon the Road. The greatest part of the Inhabitants are Christian <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have the advantage to drink ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wine, with which the Country furnishes them in abundance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agisensalou</hi> stands upon a River, and there is an Inn and a fair Mosquee in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ozeman</hi> is a little City, seated at the foot of a Hill upon which there stands a strong Castle, and below two very commodious Inns. The River <hi>Guselarmac,</hi> broad and deep, washes the South side of the City, which you cross, over one of the fairest Bridges that ever was seen. It consists of fifteen Arches, all of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and is a Work that shews the Grandeur of the Undertaker. Somewhat at a distance from the Bridge stand six Corn-Mills all together, with little wooden Bridges to go from one to another. This River falls into the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, about eight days journey from <hi>Ozeman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Azilar</hi> is a great Town, where there are two Inns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delekiras</hi> is a great Village, with one Inn.</p>
                     <p>These Four Days Journeys are very dangerous, by reason that the Ways are narrow, and commodious for Robbers. They are very numerous in this Country; and therefore understanding that we were way-laid, we sent and desir'd a Convoy of the <hi>Basha,</hi> who lent us fifty Horsemen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amasia</hi> is a great City, built upon an ascent in the hollow of a Mountain. It has no prospect, but only from the South over a fair Plain. The River that runs by it comes from <hi>Tocat,</hi> and throws it self into the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> four days journey from <hi>Amasia.</hi> You cross it over a wooden Bridge, so narrow that not above three persons can go a-brest. To bring fresh Water to the City, they have cut a League into Rocks as hard as Marble, which was a prodigious Labour. On the West-side, upon a high Mountain, stands a Fortress, where they can come by no other Water than
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106224:15"/>
what they preserve in Cisterns when it rains. In the middle of the Mountain is a fair Spring, and round about it are several Chambers cut out of the Rock, where the <hi>Dervichs</hi> make their abode. There are but two Inns, and those very bad ones, in <hi>Amasia.</hi> But the Soil is good, and bears the best Wine and Fruits in all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ainabachar,</hi> is the name of an Inn, distant a quarter of a League from a great Town where they fetch their Provisions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Turcall</hi> is a great Town near to a Mountain, upon which there stands a Castle. The River that comes from <hi>Tocatt</hi> washes the Houses, and we caught excellent Fish in it. In that place is another of the fairest Inns upon the Road.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Turcall</hi> you may travel in one day to <hi>Tocatt,</hi> where the Road from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Ispahan</hi> meets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tocat</hi> is a good fair City built at the foot of a very high Mountain, spreading it self round about a great Rock that stands almost in the midst of the Town, upon the top whereof a high Castle commands the neighbouring parts, with a good Garrison in it. It is very ancient, and the remainder of three others that stood there in former times. The City is very well inhabited with <hi>Turks,</hi> who are the Lord Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers, <hi>Armenians, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> The Streets are very narrow, but the Houses are indifferent well built; and among several Mosquees, there is one very magnificent, which seems to be newly rear'd. There was also a very fair Inn going up, which when I last travell'd that way, was not quite finish'd. There is one thing more particular and more commodious at <hi>Tocat,</hi> which is not to be found in any Inns upon the Road, That round about all the <hi>Caravansera's</hi> in the Town, there are Lodgings which they let out to Merchants, that desire to be by themselves out of the noise and hurry of the <hi>Caravans,</hi> whiles they stay at <hi>Tocat.</hi> Besides that, in those private Lodgings you have your liberty to drink Wine, and provide for the rest of your Journey; which is not so easily done in the publick Inns, where the <hi>Turks</hi> will have an eye upon the Merchants, to draw Money out of their pockets. The Christians have twelve Churches at <hi>Tocat,</hi> and there resides an Archbishop, that has under him seven Suffragans. There are also two Monasteries for Men, and two for Women; and for fourteen or fifteen Leagues round <hi>Tocat,</hi> the Country is all inhabited by <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians, but very few <hi>Greeks</hi> being intermix'd among them. The greatest part of these Christians are Tradesmen, and for the most part Smiths. A fair River runs about half a quarter of a League from the City, which rises near to <hi>Erzerom,</hi> and is cross'd at <hi>Tocat</hi> over a very beautiful stone Bridge. Upon the North-side of the City, it waters a Plain three or four days Journey in extent, and two or three Leagues broad. It is very fertil, and replenish'd with fair Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages very well peopl'd. A man may live very cheap at <hi>Tocat:</hi> the Wine is most excellent, and all sort of rare Fruit very plentiful. It is the only place in all <hi>Asia</hi> where plenty of Saffron grows, which is the best Commodity you can carry to the <hi>Indies,</hi> where a Pound, as the Years fall out, is worth thirteen or fourteen <note n="*" place="margin">Every Frank being 2 <hi>s.</hi> sterling.</note> Franks, though the Wax that preserves it, be as much in weight as the Saffron. This City, with the Lands belonging to it, usually is the Dowager <hi>Sultanesses</hi> Joynture. There is only an <hi>Aga</hi> and a <hi>Cady,</hi> that command there in the behalf of the Grand <hi>Signor:</hi> for the <hi>Basha,</hi> from whom they receive their Orders, lives at <hi>Sivas,</hi> which is the ancient <hi>Sebastia,</hi> and a very great City, some three days journey from <hi>Tocat.</hi> In short, <hi>Tocat</hi> is one of the most remarkable Thoroughfares in the East, where are continually lodg'd the <hi>Caravans</hi> from <hi>Persio, Diarbequer, Bagdat, Constantinople, Smyrna, Synopus,</hi> and other places; and here the <hi>Caravans</hi> turn off, as they are variously bound. They that are for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> take to the Winter West upon the right hand; they that are for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> incline to the Summer West, upon the left hand. When you set out either way out of <hi>Tocat,</hi> there is a Toll gatherer, that counts all the Camels and Horses that pass by, and exacts for every Camel a quarter of a Rixdollar, and for every Horse half as much. As for the Horses or Camel that carry the Passengers or their Provisions, they pay nothing. This continual concourse of the <hi>Caravans</hi> trolls the Money about at <hi>Tocat,</hi> and makes it one of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Cities of <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Setting out of <hi>Tocat</hi> to go to <hi>Erzerom,</hi> you discover a little Village so situated under a Hill, as if the Mountain lay a top of it; and between that Mountain and the River, the Road is very narrow where the <hi>Caravan</hi> is to pass. In this Road it

was, that we met the Grand <hi>Visier</hi> returning from Hunting, with a Train of four hundred men: so soon as he perceiv'd us, he fil'd off all his men to give us liberty to pass by. But among all the Company, there was not above four <hi>Franks</hi> upon which he particularly cast his Eye; which made him send for the <hi>Caravan Bachi</hi> to know who we were. The <hi>Caravan Bachi,</hi> to avoid the ill Consequences of jealousie which the <hi>Visier</hi> might have of the <hi>Franks,</hi> at a time when the Grand <hi>Visier</hi> made War in <hi>Persia,</hi> told him we were <hi>Jews;</hi> at which the <hi>Visier,</hi> shaking his Head, reply'd only that we did not look like such, and happy it was for us that he took no farther notice. For it was twenty to one, but that upon better consideration he might have sent after us to have stopt us. But when he came home to his Lodging he found a <hi>Capigi</hi> staying for him, with Orders from the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> to take off his Head, which were presently executed. For <hi>Amurath</hi> being troubl'd for the loss of his Army, had no way but to revenge himself upon the person that had the command of it.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding that the <hi>Caravans</hi> rest at <hi>Tocat,</hi> yet they stay likewise two or three days at <hi>Charkliqueu,</hi> which is not above two Leagues distant from it; for <hi>Charkliqueu</hi> is a great Town in a lovely Country, between two fertil Hills, where there grows excellent Wine. It is for the most part inhabited by Christians, who are generally Tanners. The fine blew Goat-leather Skins being drest in <hi>Tocat,</hi> and the Parts thereabout. It is thought the Water contributes very much to their Art. For <hi>Tocat</hi> is as famous for the blew Goats-leather Skins, as <hi>Diarbequir</hi> and <hi>Bagdat</hi> are for the red, <hi>Moussul</hi> or the ancient <hi>Niniveh</hi> for the yellow, and <hi>Ourfa</hi> for the black. About two thousand Paces from this Town, in the midst of a Plain rises a vast Rock, upon the North-side whereof you ascend about nine or ten steps into a Chamber with a Bed, a Table, and a Cupboard in it, all hewn out of the Rock. Upon the West-side you ascend other five or six steps that lead to a little Gallery, about five or six Foot long, and three broad, all hewn out of the Rock, though it be of an extraordinary hardness. The Christians affirm that St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> made this Rock his retiring-place during his Exilement, and that he had no other Bed or Bolster than the Rock it self, in a place where they shew you the print of a Man's Body. Hence it is, that the <hi>Caravans,</hi> consisting for the most part of Christian Merchants, stay at <hi>Charkliqueu,</hi> to pay their Devotions to this Rock, where the Bishop of the place, attended by some Priests, with every one a Taper in their Hands, goes and says Mass. But the main Reason is, because there grows excellent Wine in this place, which being cheaper by half here, than it is at <hi>Tocat,</hi> obliges the <hi>Armenians</hi> to stop here, to provide themselves for the rest of their Journey.</p>
                     <p>Two Leagues from <hi>Charkliqueu,</hi> you cross over very high Mountains, with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices on both sides. It is the custom of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> when they hear of the approach of a <hi>Caravan,</hi> to ride out two or three days journey to meet their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men and carry them fresh Provisions. Those of <hi>Charkliqueu</hi> coming to meet our <hi>Caravan,</hi> three of the <hi>Armenians</hi> took a large Mornings-draught, which made them so Pot-valiant, that they would needs ride before to the Town alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but by the way they were set upon by six Horse-men that came from the North, where there are higher Mountains than those which we were to cross. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Thieves darted their Half-Pikes at the <hi>Armenians,</hi> in so much that two of them fell down mortally wounded, and the other sav'd himself among the Rocks, but the Thieves got their Horses and Goods, which were valu'd at ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns. The <hi>Caravan</hi> at the top of the Hill beheld the misfortune of those poor men which their own folly had brought upon them, but could not help them, by reason of the narrowness of the ways; besides, that the Thieves knowing all the by-turnings, were presently out of sight. And therefore it is a dangerous thing to leave the Body of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> either by staying too far behind, or running too fast before: and some have suffer'd for distancing themselves not above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces from it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravans</hi> do not make their Journeys all alike; but come to their Stages sometimes sooner, sometimes later, according as they meet with Water and Inns, or places fit to pitch their Tents in, to which places the Natives bring Provision and Provender from the Mountains. There are some places where there is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to provide Straw and Barley for two or three days. If you travel in <hi>May,</hi> when the Grass is high, it costs nothing to seed the Horses and Camels. For as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106224:16"/>
soon as the <hi>Caravan</hi> is lodg'd, the Servants go and cut the Grass from off the Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, where it is much better then upon the Plains. But while the Beasts feed only upon Grass they are much weaker, and cannot travel so far as at other times.</p>
                     <p>From the Mountain where the <hi>Armenians</hi> were set upon, you come to <hi>Almous,</hi> a little Village upon a River, which you cross, over a Bridge of Wood.</p>
                     <p>Going out of <hi>Almous,</hi> you cross a large Plain, at the end whereof you lodge upon the Bank of a fair River, call'd <hi>Toufanlou-sou,</hi> which falls into the River of <hi>Tocat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having pass'd this River, you ascend a high Mountain, which the People of the Country call <hi>Kara-bchir-boguiendren,</hi> or, the Mountain that stops the Grand <hi>Signors;</hi> for it is very rugged, and you must of necessity alight, to ascend it. In that bad Way two Horses that carry'd each of them two Bales of <hi>English</hi> Cloth burst under their Burthen, which prov'd excellent Food for several <hi>Tartars</hi> that were before us, and were pitch'd in the place where we intended to have lodg'd our selves; so that we were forc'd to go a quarter of a League farther. These <hi>Tartars</hi> when they heard of our two dead Horses, made immediately to the Mountain fifteen or sixteen of them with all joy imaginable, to devour it. They flea'd the Horses, and when they came back (for I stay'd to see them) they brought every one a great piece of Flesh between the Saddle and their Horses backs. For by that means the Flesh mortifies, and bakes as it were, through the motion and heat of the Horse, and so they eat it without any more a-do. I saw one of them that took a piece of those Horses Flesh, and after he had beaten it soundly between two nasty Linnen Clothes, with a piece of a Stick, set his Teeth in it, and devour'd it with a very greedy appetite.</p>
                     <p>Upon the top of the Mountain which I have mention'd, there is a Plain, and in the mid'st of the Plain a Fountain call'd <hi>Chesmé-beler,</hi> or, <hi>A Fountain of Crystal;</hi> near to which, on the South-side, there stands a Village.</p>
                     <p>From the place where we lodg'd, we came to a little Town called <hi>Adras,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants whereof are all <hi>Armenians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aspidar</hi> is but two Leagues from <hi>Adras,</hi> and is but a Village.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Isbeder</hi> is another Village in the Mountains, where the <hi>Caravan</hi> generally stays one or two days; as well to pay the Custom, which is the fourth part of a Rixdollar upon every Camel, and half as much for every Horse; as for the excellency and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Wine, where every Man provides for himself.</p>
                     <p>Twice we pass'd by and paid nothing, in regard that the <hi>Caravan</hi> was too strong for the Toll-gatherers; and were it not that they stay for the Wine, they might go directly forward without paying any thing.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Isbeder,</hi> we came to another great Town in the Mountains; all the Houses are hewn out of the Rock upon which it is seated, as are also all the Stair-Cases. From this Village, having pass'd a River, over a wooden Bridge, at the end whereof there stands an Inn, you come to <hi>Zacapa,</hi> another Village, from whence through very narrow passages, where you are forc'd to unload the Camels, and carry your Goods upon Mens shoulders for thirty Paces together, you come to encamp in a little Plain. It lyes at the foot of a high Mountain, which they call <hi>Dikmebell,</hi> beyond which lies the Town <hi>Kourd-Aga,</hi> after which you cross three Rivers; one fordable, the other over two Bridges, and then you come to a Village call'd <hi>Garmeru.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Garmeru</hi> you go to <hi>Seukmen,</hi> another Village; from <hi>Seukmen</hi> to <hi>Louri;</hi> from <hi>Louri</hi> to <hi>Chaouqueu,</hi> which are two very handsom Towns.</p>
                     <p>I saw an Old Man at <hi>Chaouqueu</hi> who was above a Hundred and Thirty Years old, who when <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> besieged <hi>Bagdat,</hi> gave his whole Army as much Oats as serv'd them one whole day. In recompence whereof, the <hi>Sultan</hi> exempted him and his Children from all Taxes and Tolls for their Lives.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Chaouqueu,</hi> you come to a high craggy Mountain which is call'd <hi>Aaggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogii,</hi> or, <hi>The Bitter Mountain.</hi> The Ways being narrow, the <hi>Caravan</hi> is forc'd to travel single; and then it is that they count all the Horses, and all the Camels; every Horse and every Camel paying to the <hi>Caravan-</hi>Master a certain Duty, which amounts to a good Sum if the <hi>Caravan</hi> be numerous. One part of that Money is to pay seven or eight <hi>Armenians,</hi> that guard the <hi>Caravan</hi> all the way; another part
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106224:17"/>
defrays the Expences upon the Road; and the remainder is the Captain of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan</hi>'s Profit.</p>
                     <p>Having pass'd this Mountain, you come to lodge in a Plain which they call <hi>Gioganderesi,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Erzerom</hi> you meet only with three Villages by the way, <hi>Achikala, Ginnis,</hi> and <hi>Higia,</hi> which are the <hi>Caravan</hi>'s Stages. During these three last days journeys, you keep all along the Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> for the most part, which is yet but narrow, taking its source Northward of <hi>Erzerom.</hi> 'Tis a wonderful thing to see the vast quantities of large <hi>Asparagus</hi> that grow all along the River, with which you may load several Camels.</p>
                     <p>A League on this side <hi>Erzerom</hi> the <hi>Caravan</hi> is constrain'd to stop; for the Officer of the Custom-House accompani'd with the <hi>Basha</hi>'s Lieutenant, comes here and tyes all the Bales and Chests with a cross Cord, upon which he puts a Seal, to the end that when the Merchants come to the Town, they may not be able to take out any Bags of Money, or any pieces of Stuff on purpose to hide them till they go away. The particular Business of the <hi>Basha</hi>'s Lieutenant in meeting the <hi>Caravan,</hi> is to see whether the Merchants be well provided with Wines. And if he desire any Bottles, whether it be then, or in the City, where they are not asham'd to visit every Merchant, there is no refusing them. For there grows no Wine at <hi>Erzerom,</hi> all that is drank there being a small Wine of <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> which is always green: which forces the Merchants to furnish themselves with Wine at <hi>Tocat,</hi> which they may do sufficiently to last them into <hi>Persia.</hi> The Officer of the Custom-House generally allows the <hi>Caravan</hi> three days to rest; during which time he sends to the principal Merchants some Fruit and other small Refreshments, by which he is no loser. After the three days are over, he comes and opens all the Bales and Chests, and takes a particular account of all the Merchandizes. This Search and the changing of Beasts, causes the <hi>Caravan</hi> to stay generally twenty or five and twenty days at <hi>Erzerom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Erzerom</hi> is a frontier Town of <hi>Turkie</hi> toward <hi>Persia.</hi> It is situated at the end of a large Plain environ'd with Mountains, the Plain being beautifi'd with many fair Villages. If you take in the Castle and the Suburbs it may pass for a City, but the Houses are ill built of Wood, without any neatness or proportion. There are some Remains of Churches and of the ancient Buildings of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> by which you may conjecture that it never was very beautiful. The Fortress stands upon a high ground, with a double Wall, square Towers close one to another, and a pitiful Moat. The <hi>Basha</hi> resides there but in a very ill House, all the Buildings about the Fortress being in a bad condition. In the same Enclosure there is a little rising Ground upon which they have rais'd a small Fort, wherein the <hi>Janisary-Aga</hi> lives; and where the <hi>Basha</hi> has no Power. When the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> has a mind to the Head of this <hi>Basha,</hi> or any other considerable person in the Province, he sends a <hi>Capigi,</hi> with order to the <hi>Janisary</hi> to send for the Person to the little Fort, where the Execution is presently done. One Example hereof I saw in my last Travels into <hi>Persia:</hi> For the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Erzerom</hi> not having sent Twelve thousand Men so soon as the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> requir'd them for his Wars in <hi>Candy,</hi> the same <hi>Capigi</hi> that brought the Sentence of his Death, had the same Order for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Kars;</hi> and meeting this <hi>Capigi</hi> upon the Road in a Village, upon his return for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he would needs shew me whether I would or no, the Heads of the two <hi>Basha</hi>'s, which he was carrying to the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> in a Bag.</p>
                     <p>Between the first and second Gate of the Fortress are to be seen four and twenty Pieces of Cannon, most excellent Guns, but lying one upon another without Carriages. They lye at <hi>Erzerom</hi> to be ready upon all occasions when the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> makes War against the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Erzerom</hi> several great Inns; this City, like <hi>Tocat,</hi> being one of the greatest Thoroughfares in <hi>Turkie.</hi> The Country about it bears Wine, but not very good, and in regard the People are strictly forbid to drink Wine, the Merchants are forc'd to buy it very privately, for fear it should come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Cadi.</hi> Though it be very cold at <hi>Erzerom,</hi> Barley grows there in fourty days, and Wheat in sixty, which is very remarkable. The Customs paid there for the carrying out of the Gold and Silver, and upon all other Commodities, is very severe. Silk, that comes out of <hi>Persia,</hi> pays four and twenty Crowns for a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106224:17"/>
Camel's Load, which is eight hundred Pounds. For in the mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries a Camel's Load is no more; but in the plain and even Countries they make'em carry above ten hundred weight. A Load of <hi>Indian</hi> Calicutts pays a hundred Crowns; but the Loads of Linnen are much heavier than those of Silk. As for other Commodities, they pay Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> according to their value.</p>
                     <p>From this Stage the <hi>Caravan</hi> sets forward to a Fortress call'd <hi>Hassan Kala,</hi> where you must pay half a Piaster for every Camel's or Horses Load going from <hi>Erzerom</hi> to <hi>Erivan,</hi> but returning you pay but half as much.</p>
                     <p>Leaving this Fortress, you must go and lodge at a Bridge near to a Village which is call'd <hi>Choban-Cupri.</hi> Over this Bridge, which is the fairest in the whole Journey, you cross two Rivers which there meet, one is the <hi>Kars,</hi> and the other is a Stream that falls from a Mountain call'd <hi>Binguiel,</hi> both which disburthen themselves into the <hi>Aras.</hi> The <hi>Caravan</hi> usually stays a day or two at this Bridge; because the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> divides it self at this place, some continuing on the High-road, others taking the Road of <hi>Kars,</hi> as well to avoid fording the <hi>Aras</hi> several times, as the paying a great Duty upon the great Road, where they exact four Piasters upon every Camel's Load, and two upon every Horse-Load, whereas at <hi>Kars</hi> you are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd for half so much.</p>
                     <p>I went <hi>Kars</hi> Road twice; but it is longer, and more troublesom than the other. As soon as you leave the Bridge, for the first four days you travel over woody Mountains, and very desert Countries, where you meet but with one Village; but coming near <hi>Kars</hi> the Country is more pleasant, and well manur'd; bearing all sorts of Grain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kars</hi> is in 78 Deg. 40 Min. of Longitude, and 42 Deg. 40 Min. of Latitude; in a very good Soil. The City is very large, but thinly peopl'd, though Provision be very plentiful and very cheap. But the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> always choosing that place to rendezvouz his Army, whenever he intended to recruit it, and to lodge his People there which he sent to build Villages; the King of <hi>Persia</hi> has ruin'd all the Country, as he did at <hi>Sulfa,</hi> and in many other Frontier places, for nine or ten days journey together.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kars</hi> to <hi>Erivan</hi> the <hi>Caravan</hi> makes it nine days journey, and lyes where it can find most convenience, there being no certain Stages. The first days journey ends at a Monastery and a Village, the one no less deserted than the other. The next day you come to the Ruines of a great City, call'd <hi>Anikagaë,</hi> in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Language the <hi>City of</hi> Ani, which was the name of an <hi>Armenian</hi> King that was the Founder of it. By the Wall, on the East-side, runs a rapid Stream that falls from the Mountains of <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> and empties it self into the River of <hi>Kars.</hi> This City was very strongly situated; being plac'd in a Mersh, where are to be seen the Remains of two Causeys that only led to the Town. There are the Ruines of several Monasteries; among the rest two that are entire, suppos'd to be Royal Foundations. From thence to <hi>Erivan</hi> for two days journey, you meet with only two Villages; near the last of which you ride by the side of a Hill, whither when the <hi>Caravan</hi> passes by, the People bring Horses from several Parts to be sold. The Great Road from the Bridge, where the <hi>Caravan</hi> parts, lyes thus:</p>
                     <p>Two Leagues from the Bridge, on the right hand toward the South, lyes a great Mountain which the People of the Country call <hi>Mingol.</hi> In this Mountain there are abundance of Springs, and from one side of it falls <hi>Euphrates,</hi> from the other side the River of <hi>Kars,</hi> which empties it self into the <hi>Aras</hi> fourteen or fifteen Leagues on this side <hi>Erivan.</hi> The <hi>Aras,</hi> which the Ancients call'd <hi>Araxes,</hi> falls from other Mountains Eastward of <hi>Mingol,</hi> which after many windings through the Upper <hi>Armenia,</hi> where it receives many other Rivers that swell its Streams; it discharges it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, two days journey from <hi>Shamaki,</hi> upon the Frontiers of the ancient <hi>Medes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole Country is inter-cut by the Rivers <hi>Aras</hi> and <hi>Kars,</hi> and several other Streams that fall into them, inhabited by very few, but what are Christians; those few <hi>Mahumetans</hi> that live among them being so superstitious, that they will not drink the Water of any of those Rivers, nor wash in them; believing them impure and defil'd by the use which the Christians make of them. They have their particular Wells and Cisterns by themselves, which they will not suffer a Christian to come near.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106224:18"/>
                        <hi>Comasour</hi> is the first Village where you lodge after you leave the Bridge of <hi>Choban-Kupri,</hi> going to <hi>Erivan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Halicarcara</hi> is the next Stage to <hi>Comasour:</hi> this is a great Town also inhabited by Christians, but the Houses are built all under-ground like Caves. Coming thither the seventh of <hi>March</hi> 1655, the Snow was so deep that there was no travelling, so that we were forc'd to stay there eight days. But the Customer of <hi>Erzerom</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in what a bad condition we were, came in person with five hundred Horse to make way for us, and sent for the Country-people round about to clear away the Snow. But it was not so much out Kindness to us, as for his own Interest. For a new Officer being to succeed him upon the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and our <hi>Caravan</hi> being very numerous, he would have lost above a hundred thousand Crowns, had we not come to <hi>Erzerom</hi> before that day. Many of the Passengers were almost blinded by continual looking upon the Snow, the colour whereof very much dims the Sight: for preservation whereof the Travellers are wont to wear black Cypress Hoods, made on purpose, over their Faces. Others wear furr'd Bonnets, fring'd about with Goats-hair, which being long, falls over their Eyes, and does altogether as well as the Hood.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravan</hi> is usually twelve days upon the Road, from <hi>Erzerom</hi> to <hi>Erivan.</hi> Leaving <hi>Halicarcara,</hi> you ford the <hi>Aras</hi> three times, and cross it the next day again: for it winds exceedingly. A League and a half from the place where you ford it the fourth time, upon the top of a high Mountain stands a Fortress call'd <hi>Kaguisgan,</hi> which is the last place which the <hi>Turks</hi> possess on that side. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers that live there come to the <hi>Caravan</hi> to take their Toll, which is four Piasters for every Camel loaden, and two for every Horse loaden. In the year 1655 the <hi>Caravan</hi> lodging about a League from the Fortress of <hi>Kaguisgan,</hi> the Mountains adjoyning being inhabited by Christian <hi>Armeniaus,</hi> there came to us a poor Bishop attended by fifteen or sixteen persons, among which there were certain Priests, who brought us Bread, Fowl, and Fruit, desiring the Charity of the Merchants, who recompenc'd them to their satisfaction. About four or five Months after, this Bishop had one of his Eyes struck out by a <hi>Janisary.</hi> That wicked Fellow came to the Town where the Bishop liv'd, and lighting upon the Bishop, ask'd him for Money, which because the Bishop had none to give him, in a rage he stabb'd him im the Eye with his Dagger. Complaint was made to the <hi>Aga,</hi> who 'tis thought would have punish'd the Offender, but he fled, and left the Bishop without remedy of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>From the last place where we encamp'd near the <hi>Aras,</hi> we went and lodg'd the next day upon the same River, in the sight of a Village not above a quarter of a League. The next day we cross'd the River that runs from <hi>Kars,</hi> and parts <hi>Turkie</hi> from <hi>Persia.</hi> The next day we stop'd upon the Banks of <hi>Aras,</hi> half a League from a little Town; and this is the last time you see this River which you are constrain'd to pass so often.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Aras,</hi> we came to lodge in a Plain, in sight of a Town which is not far distant. The next day the <hi>Caravan</hi> lyes in the Field, and the next day it comes to a place where there are three Churches, whence it is but half a days journey from <hi>Erivan.</hi>

                     <p>THE first Place worthy Observation, entring into <hi>Persia</hi> thorough <hi>Armenia,</hi> is that which they call the <hi>Three Churches,</hi> three Leagues from <hi>Erivan;</hi> which <hi>Three Churches,</hi> are three Monasteries distant one from the other. The biggest and the fairest is the Residence of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> of the <hi>Armenians.</hi> There is another to the South of that, about a Musket-shot distant, and another a quarter of a League from it toward the East, which is a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106224:18"/>
Nunnery for Virgins. The <hi>Armenians</hi> call this place <hi>Egmiasin,</hi> or the <hi>Only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which is the Name of the chief Church. You may find in their Chronicles, That it began to be Built about three hundred Years after Christ, and that the Walls being rais'd to a good height, the Devil came in the Night and pull'd down what they built up in the Day; which he did for several Years: but that one Night Christ himself appear'd, and that from that time the Devil surceas'd to molest them any more; so that they finish'd the Church. It is dedicated to St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> whom the <hi>Armenians</hi> have in very great veneration. And there is a Table of Stone, whereupon, according to their Chronicles, Christ rested when he appear'd to St. <hi>Gregory.</hi> They that go into the Church, kiss this Stone with a very solemn Devotion.</p>
                     <p>The Second is built in honour of a Princess that came with forty Virgins of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to visit St. <hi>Gregory.</hi> This Lady an <hi>Armenian</hi> King caus'd to be thrown into a Well full of Serpents; but she receiv'd no harm. For she liv'd therein 14 Years by a great Miracle, and from that time to this, the Serpents that breed thereabouts never did any harm. That Idolatrous King had a design to have enjoy'd that Princess, who was very handsom, and all her Companions; but they overcame him by their Virtue: who thereupon, seeing he could not have his Will, put them all to Death.</p>
                     <p>The Custom of all the <hi>Armenians,</hi> as well those that come out of <hi>Persia,</hi> as those that travel into <hi>Persia,</hi> is to perform their Devotions at these <hi>Three Churches;</hi> and the <hi>Caravan</hi> stops usually five or six days, during which time they Confess, and receive Absolution from the Patriarch.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarch has under him forty seven Archbishops, and every Archbishop has under him four or five Suffragans, with whom he lives in a Convent, where there are several Monks under their Jurisdiction. So soon as they have said their Mass, which is generally done an Hour after Day, they all go to work, and to dig and delve for their living. The Revenue of the Patriarch is 600000 Crowns or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: for all the <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians that are above fifteen Years of age, ought to pay him yearly five Sous. However there are many that do not pay him, by reason of their poverty. Yet their defect is suppli'd by the rich, who sometimes pay him two or three Crowns a Head. But this Money does not stay in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triach's Pocket: nay he is sometimes behind-hand; for he is engag'd to relieve the poor <hi>Armenians,</hi> who have not wherewithal to pay the <hi>Carage,</hi> which is an Annual Tribute that they owe to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes, to whom they are subject: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise necessity would force them to become <hi>Mahometans;</hi> and they, their Wives and Children would be liable to be sold, which the Grand Patriarch labours all he can to prevent. Every Archbishop sends him out of his Diocess what is necessary to be rais'd for that intent. So that the Patriarch does but only receive it with one Hand, and pay it with the other; making no Profit to himself of a Revenue which he has out of 400000 Villages, which the Archbishop of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s affirm'd to me to be under his Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>As I return'd from <hi>Persia</hi> in the Year 1655, I came to the <hi>Three Churches</hi> about the end of <hi>February;</hi> the <hi>Caravan</hi> stay'd there eleven Days, as well by reason of the great Snows that stop'd up the Ways, as for that the <hi>Armenians</hi> resolv'd to keep their <hi>Carnival</hi> there, and after that to perform their Devotions. The next day I went to visit the Patriarch, who was sitting cross-leg'd upon a Mat. There were four Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, and nine Bishops sitting about him in the same posture, among whom there was one that spake very good <hi>Italian.</hi> I stay'd with him three Hours; and while we were discoursing together, in came one of the Monks of the Convent, who had not spoken to any person whatsoever in Two and twenty Years, by reason of a Penance that was impos'd upon him. Never did Man appear so meager and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but the Patriarch sent for him, and by his Authority commanded him to break Silence, which he did, by speaking at the same Instant.</p>
                     <p>The Saturday before <hi>Shrove-Sunday</hi> the Patriarch invited all the <hi>Caravan,</hi> as well Masters as Servants, to hear Mass the next day, and then to dine at the Covent. Mass being concluded, the People were brought into a long Gallery, about 15 or 20 Foot broad, there being a Table on both sides, made of several Stones, and Benches next the Walls. At the upper end of the Gallery stands a Table four Foot square, over which is a vaulted Roof sustain'd with four Pillars, which serves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106224:19"/>
for a Canopy: in the midst whereof is a Chair set for the Patriarch, who from thence has a full view of both sides the Gallery; with two other Chairs of each hand, for two Archbishops: the other Archbishops, Monks, and Guests sate at the long Tables. The Meat which they brought us was several sorts of Pilaw, and several Dishes of Fish, among the rest excellent Trouts. The Pilaw was brought in forty wide Plates, so well fill'd and so large, that they were every one as much as a Man could carry. They were all set down upon the Ground before the Patriarch; who then Pray'd and gave Thanks. Then six Bishops with Ladles took out the Meat out of the great Platters, and putting it into lesser, serv'd both the Tables. Every one had also his earthen Pot of Wine, which was very good, and was fill'd again when it was empty. The Patriarch and the two Archbishops eat nothing but two Eggs, and a few raw Herbs; no more did the other Archbishops that sate at the Table.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the Feast, a Bishop comes with a Paper and Pen and Ink in his Hand, and asks of every one what he pleases to Subscribe for the Benefit of the Church; then every one proposing, according to his Devotion, the Bishop writes down the Names of the Persons, and the Sum which they mention; which he comes and gathers the next day. There are some rich Merchants that will give two <hi>Tomans,</hi> but the meanest Servant will give an <hi>Or.</hi> The Bishop having done writing, the Table was clear'd, and then they brought us Melons and other Fruits. In a short while after the Bells rung to Evening Service, and the People went to Church.</p>
                     <p>After Evening Service the Patriarch sent for me to behold a Combat of <hi>Bufalo's,</hi> of which there are great store in that Country, some serving to Till their Ground; while the Female ones yield store of Milk, of which they make Butter and Cheese, and which they mingle with all sorts of other Milk: There are some of these female Beasts that will give two and twenty Pints of Milk a day.</p>
                     <p>They brought us into a wide Enclosure, to behold the Sport, wherein there were eight <hi>Bufalo's.</hi> To provoke them one against another, they shew them a Red Cloth, which puts them into such a Rage, that there were two that dy'd with the stroke of their Horns upon the place, and there were none of the rest which were not very much lam'd. The Sport being at an end, they bring a great quantity of Wood, which they pile together on purpose to set it on Fire. When the Wood was heap'd in as big a Pile as they intended, one of the Archbishops presented a Taper of white Wax to all the Company, both Masters and Servants, who every one agreed with him what they should give the next day for their Tapers. The Tapers being lighted, the Patriarch with a Stick like a Bishop's Crosier, march'd before, singing an Hymn, attended by all the Persons both Ecclesiastical and Secular, till they had in that manner walk'd three times about the Pile. When the Pile came to be lighted, there was great striving who should have the Honour. One of the Merchants offer'd a quantity of Oyl, for Lamps for the Church; another out did him, and a third proffer'd more than he; and the Honour of Lighting the Pile was given to him that offer'd most. Immediately upon that every one put out his Taper: For they esteem it a most precious business; believing that the lighting of one of those Tapers in a Sterm, and throwing it into the Sea, is a present Charm against Shipwrack. For say they, The Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> forty days after she was brought to Bed, went to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with <hi>Joseph</hi> and her Son; and going into the Temple met old <hi>Simeon,</hi> who taking the Child in his Arms, began to sing the Song, <hi>Lord now let thy Servant,</hi> &amp;c. the Song being ended, all the People began to cry that Christ was born, and to publish it about the City. Now in regard it was Night, every one ran out with Torches in their Hands, and some made Fires before their Doors, where Christ was to pass along. This Festival among the <hi>Armenians</hi> is like that of <hi>Candlemas-</hi>day; and they call it in their Language, <hi>Ter en Areche? Where is the Lord?</hi> The <hi>Armenians,</hi> Masters and Servants, drank all Night to make an end of their <hi>Carnival,</hi> while the Patriarch was busie in dressing up the Church with its gayest Ornaments.</p>
                     <p>I could not believe there had been so much Riches in the Christian Churches under the Power of the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> It is not a hundred Years since this Patriarchal Church was in a much meaner Condition: But since the great <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> put the <hi>Armenians</hi> upon Traffick, they have very much enrich'd themselves: For as they got great Gains; so they made great Vows, and gave largely to the Church:
<pb facs="tcp:106224:19"/>
                        <figure>
                           <pb facs="tcp:106224:20"/>

                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106224:20"/>
wherein there are now as rich Ornaments as in any Church of Christendom. The Choir of the Church was hung round with a <hi>Venetian</hi> Tissue of Gold. The Pavement also of the Choir and the Body of the Church, together with the Steps to the Altar, were spread with rich Tapestry. For they all put off their Shooes before they go into the Church; nor do the <hi>Armenians</hi> kneel as in <hi>Europe,</hi> but stand all the while upright. When they hear Mass, they sit after the Mode of the Country, but when the Lessons are reading they stand up. All the Service-time their Heads are cover'd, unless at the Elevation of the Host, for then they take off their Bonnets, and kiss the Earth three times. There was upon the Altar a Cross, with six Candlesticks of Gold; and upon the Steps to the Altar four Candlesticks of Silver five Foot high. After they had sung several Hymns, the Patriarch seated himself in a Chair cover'd with Silk Tapestry, four Archbishops sitting with their Backs to a Pillar at his right hand. The Service was solemnly perform'd by an Archbishop, with two Bishops on each side of him. After the Archbishop had made certain Prayers, he took the Book wherein he had read the Gospel and gave it the Patriarch, the Archbishops, Bishops, and all the People to Kiss. On the one side of the Cover of that Book there are two Relicks enchas'd, which are cover'd with Crystal, which was the side of the Book that was given to be Kiss'd. The Ceremony being ended, many went to Kiss the Patriarch's Hand, and so retir'd.</p>
                     <p>Ten Leagues from <hi>Erivan,</hi> toward the North, appears a great Lake, wherein there is an Iland, upon which is built a very fair Covent. The Monks that live there, live so austere a Life, that they never eat Fish or Flesh above four times a Year: neither do they speak one to another, but upon those four Days. The rest of the Year they feed only upon Herbs, which they gather out of the Garden: for say they, it is not Fasting, to eat either Butter or Oyl. The Bread which they eat is brought from the neighbouring Villages: and the Iland is replenish'd with all sorts of excellent Fruits.</p>
                     <p>On the one side of the Lake nearer to <hi>Erivan</hi> is a large Plain, wherein there are six Monasteries. One of which is entirely hewn out of the Rock, with the Pillars that sustain it, being seated in a very hard Rock. The <hi>Armenians</hi> call that Church <hi>Kickart</hi> in their Language, and the <hi>Turks</hi> in theirs <hi>Guieurghieche,</hi> that is, <hi>See and away.</hi> In this Church, according to the Traditions of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> is kept the Lance wherewith the Side of Christ was pierc'd; the Figure whereof I caus'd to be drawn upon the Place. The <hi>Armenians</hi> have this Lance in great Veneration, saying, that it was brought thither by St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Five Leagues from <hi>Erivan,</hi> towards the South-East begins the Mountain <hi>Ararat;</hi> which will be always famous for being the resting-place of <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark. Half a League from that Mountain, where the Plain begins to grow level, stands a Church upon a little Hillock, close by which are several Pits like Wells. They report that it was into one of these Wells that <hi>Cerda,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> King, caus'd St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to be thrown, because he would not Worship his false Gods. Between this Church and <hi>Erivan</hi> are to be seen the Ruines of the Ancient <hi>Artaxate,</hi> the Seat of the Kings of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which demonstrate that it has been a great City: besides, there appear the Ruines of a fair Palace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Erivan</hi> lyes in 64 Degrees, 20 Minutes of Longitude; 41 Degrees, 15 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Latitude; in a most plentiful Country of all things necessary for Humane Life, but especially abounding in good Wine. It is one of the best Provinces of all <hi>Persia,</hi> and yields the King a very large Revenue, as well by reason of the goodness of the Soil, as for being the great Thoroughfare of the <hi>Caravans.</hi> The yearly Revenue of the Governour only, otherwise call'd the <hi>Kan of Erivan,</hi> amounts to above 20000 Tomans, which make 840000 Livres. This City lying upon the Frontiers of both Empires, has been taken and retaken by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> several times. By which means the old City being ruin'd, they have built a new one, 800 Paces on this side, upon a Rock, at the foot whereof, upon the West-side runs a rapid Stream: it is call'd by the Name of <hi>Sangui-Cija,</hi> and in many places it is deep and full of Rocks. You cross it, over a fair Bridge of three Arches, in which are built little Chambers, where the <hi>Kan</hi> retires in the heat of the day. It is full of Fish, especially Trouts, which nevertheless are dear enough. This River comes from a Lake called <hi>Gigaguni,</hi> about 25 Leagues from <hi>Erivan,</hi> toward the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106224:21"/>
North, and falls into the <hi>Aras,</hi> that runs not above three Leagues off to the South. Though this City be fortified to the West by the River, yet it is never the stronger, by reason of the Hills on the other side which command it: and in regard it is built upon a Rock, the Moats of the Fort are not above three or four Foot deep. In some places the City is secur'd with a double Wall with several Towers; but the Walls being only of Earth, as are most of the Houses, the Rain does more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, than the Cannon would do. That part of <hi>Erivan</hi> to the North-West, is a kind of Suburb, but far better inhabited than the City: for there live all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Artificers, together with the Christian <hi>Armenians,</hi> who have four Churches there, with a Monastery. And of late years they have built also a very fair Inn in the same Quarter. In the City there only lives the <hi>Kan,</hi> with the Military Officers and Souldiers; the <hi>Kan's</hi> Lodgings lying upon the River. The Governour is a Person of great Power, and has always sufficient Forces about him to guard the Frontiers. The Summer being very hot at <hi>Erivan,</hi> he lyes in Tents upon the Mountains during the Heat. When a <hi>Caravan</hi> arrives, he is forc'd to give the King advice thereof: and if any Ambassador come thither, he is bound to maintain him at his own Expence, and to cause him to be conducted to the Territories of the next Governour, who is oblig'd to do the same. So that Ambassadors are not bound to be at any Expences in the Territories of the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Four Leagues from the City are high Mountains, where the Natives that inhabit the hot and Sun-burnt Countries toward <hi>Chaldea,</hi> come twenty thousand together, to seek out good Pasturage for their Cattel, and about the end of Autumn return again into their own Country. I cannot compare this Mountainous Tract, whether for its Valleys and Rivers, or for the nature of the Soil, to any Part that I have seen, better than to that portion of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which is call'd the <hi>Country of Vaux:</hi> and there is a Tradition among the Natives, That certain People that inhabited between the <hi>Alpes</hi> and Mount <hi>Jura,</hi> and which compos'd a Squadron of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army, having serv'd him in his Conquests, seated themselves in this part of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which they found so like their own Country. From <hi>Tocat</hi> to <hi>Tauris</hi> the Inhabitants are for the most part Christians. Which large Tract of Ground being that which the Ancients call'd the Province of <hi>Armenia,</hi> 'tis no wonder to meet with fifty <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for one <hi>Mahometan.</hi> There are many ancient <hi>Armenian</hi> Families in <hi>Erivan,</hi> which is their native Country; but they are ill us'd by the Governours, who being far distant from the Court, do what they please. This City not being far remote from the Province from whence the Silks come, is the place where all the Buyers and Sellers resort. But neither in <hi>Erivan,</hi> nor in any other part of <hi>Persia</hi> are the Merchants put to open their Bales at the Custom-Houses, as in <hi>Turkie.</hi> They only pay certain Duties toward securing the Highways; which Duties they call <hi>Rade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and those that gather them <hi>Raders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kans</hi> or Governours of Provinces in <hi>Persia</hi> are civil to Strangers, especially to those that they like, or that shew them any thing of Curiosity. The first time that I went into <hi>Persia,</hi> I took a young Watch-maker with me, and coming to <hi>Erivan,</hi> I carried him to the <hi>Kan</hi> who was then Governour. It was at a time when Watches were very rare in <hi>Persia;</hi> and the <hi>Kan,</hi> understanding what Trade the Young Man was of, told us he was the first Watch-maker that ever had been in <hi>Persia:</hi> Thereupon he brought the Young Man a Watch to mend, and that he might have the pleasure of seeing him work, he lodg'd us in a Chamber next his own, and made us drink with him every day; for he was a true Toper, and compell'd us to drink with him from four in the Afternoon 'till near Midnight, in a place which he had made on purpose, in his Garden, to take off his Glasses.</p>
                     <p>This was he, that having deliver'd <hi>Erivan</hi> to <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> went along with him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and became his Favourite for teaching him to Drink. <hi>Amurat</hi> left a Garrison of 22000 Men in the City; but <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King begirt it presently with a strong Army; and planting himself securely under one of the Hills that command the City, he batter'd it incessantly with eight Pieces of Cannon: the fourth day he made a Breach, and though he had the repute of a Coward, he was the first at the Assault, and took the City: and because they would not yield at his Summons, he put all the Garrison to the Sword. For which <hi>Amurat,</hi> was quit with <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> afterwards, though not in so noble a way; for entring a Victor into <hi>Bagdat,</hi> he put all the <hi>Persians</hi> to the Sword, after he had given them his Word to the contrary, and promis'd to spare their Lives.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> A Continuation of the same Road from <hi>Erivan</hi> to <hi>Tauris.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT usually takes up ten days journey for the <hi>Caravan</hi> to go between <hi>Erivan</hi> and <hi>Tauris;</hi> and <hi>Nacksivan</hi> is almost in the mid-way between both. The first days journey you travel thorough large Plains sow'd with Rice, and water'd with several Rivulets. The next day you continue to travel through Plains of the same nature, in sight of the Mountain <hi>Ararat,</hi> which is full of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, leaving it upon the South. The <hi>Armenians</hi> call this Mountain <hi>Mesesoufar, The Mountain of the Ark;</hi> because the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> rested upon it. It is as it were unfasten'd from the other Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and from the half-way to the top, it is continually cover'd with Snow. It is higher than any of the neighbouring Mountains; and in my first Travels I saw it for five days journey together. So soon as the <hi>Armenians</hi> discover it, they kiss the Earth, and lifting up their Eyes to Heaven, say their Prayers. Yet you are to take notice, that the Mountain is hid in Clouds for two or three Months together. In the Plains that you cross in this second days journey, to the Southward a League and a half from the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, is to be seen a Work of great Art; being the Ruines of a Magnificent Castle, where the Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> were wont to reside in the time of their Hunting Divertisements; more especially when they continu'd their Sports at the Mallard and Heron. The next day we lodg'd near to a Village where there was good Water, which constrain'd the <hi>Caravan</hi> to stay there; there being none to be met with for ten Leagues farther. The next day you must travel one by one through the Pass of a Mountain, and cross a large River nam'd <hi>Arpa-sou,</hi> which falls into <hi>Aras.</hi> It is fordable when it is low; but when the Snow melts and swells the Stream, you must go a League out of your way to the Southward to cross it, over a Bridge of Stone. From thence you go to lodge near a Village call'd <hi>Kalifakiend,</hi> where you are forc'd to fetch your Water a good way off. The first days journey is through a Plain, at the end whereof you meet with an Inn, call'd <hi>Kara-bagler,</hi> standing upon a Rivulet; which was finish'd in 1664. The Head of this Rivulet springs three or four Leagues higher toward the North; and half a League below <hi>Kara-bagler,</hi> the Water congeals and petrifies; and of those Stones is the Inn built. The Stone is very slight; and when they have need of it, they make Trenches all along the Stream, and fill them with the same Water, which in eight or ten Months turns into Stone. The Water is very sweet, and has no bad tast; yet the Country-men thereabouts will neither drink it, nor water their Grounds with it. The <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> say, that <hi>Sem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah</hi> caus'd the Rock to be hollow'd, out of which this River issues; which four or five Leagues from its Head, and two from the Inn, falls into <hi>Aras.</hi> From this Inn to <hi>Naksivan</hi> is but a small Journey. <hi>Naksivan,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106224:23"/>
according to the Opinion of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> is the most ancient City of the World; built about three Leagues from the Mountain upon which the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> rested: from whence it also takes its Name; for <hi>Nak</hi> in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue signifies a <hi>Ship,</hi> and <hi>Sivan, resting</hi> or <hi>reposing.</hi> 'Twas a great City, now wholly ruin'd by the Army of <hi>Sultan Amurath.</hi> There are the Remains of several rare Mosquees, which the <hi>Turks</hi> have destroy'd; for the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> destroy one anothers Mosquees as fast as they fall into one anothers possession. This City is very ancient, and the <hi>Armenians</hi> report that it was in this place where <hi>Noah</hi> went to live, when he went out of the Ark. They say further, that he was Buried here; and that his Wife has a Tomb at <hi>Marante</hi> upon the Road to <hi>Tauris.</hi> There runs a little River by <hi>Naksivan,</hi> the Water whereof is very good; the Spring whereof is not far distant from the Head of the River of <hi>Karabagler.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> drove a great Trade in Silk formerly in this Town, which is now very much abated: however, there is a <hi>Kan</hi> which has the Command there. All the Country between <hi>Erivan</hi> and <hi>Tauris</hi> was wholly destroy'd by <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the first of that Name; to the end that the Armies of the <hi>Turks,</hi> not meeting with any subsistance, might perish of themselves. To this purpose, he sent all the Inhabitants of <hi>Zulfa</hi> and the Parts adjoyning into <hi>Persia,</hi> Old and Young, Fathers, Mothers, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with which he planted new Colonies in several parts of his Kingdom. He sent above 27000 Families of <hi>Armenians</hi> into <hi>Guilan,</hi> whence the Silks come; and where the harshness of the Climate kill'd abundance of those poor People, that were accustom'd to a milder Air. The most considerable were sent to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where the King put them upon the Trade of Silk, and lent them Commodities, for which they paid upon the return of their Markets, which suddenly set the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> upon their Feet again. These are they that built the City of <hi>Zulfa,</hi> which is only separated from <hi>Ispahan</hi> by the River of <hi>Senderou,</hi> calling it <hi>New Zulfa,</hi> to distinguish it from the old City, which was the Habitation of their Ancestors. A third part of the People were dispers'd into other Villages between <hi>Ispahan</hi> and <hi>Sciras.</hi> But the old People dying, the young ones generally turn <hi>Mahumetans:</hi> so that now you can hardly meet with two Christian <hi>Armenians</hi> in all those fair Plains, which their Fathers were sent to manure.</p>
                     <p>Among the Ruines of <hi>Naksivan</hi> appear the Ruines of a great Mosquee, which was one of the most stately Buildings in the World: which some say was built in memory of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Burying-place. As you depart out of the City, near to the River that runs by it, appears a Tower, which is an excellent piece of Architecture: It is compos'd of four <hi>Duomo</hi>'s joyn'd together, which support a kind of Pyramid, that seems to be fram'd of twelve little Towers; but toward the middle it changes its figure, and lessening like a Spire, ends in a Point. The Building is all of Brick, but as well the out-side as the in-side is over-spread with a kind of Varnish of Parget, wrought into Flowers, like Emboss'd Work. 'Tis thought to have been an Edifice set up by <hi>Temur-leng,</hi> when he had Conquer'd <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Naksivan</hi> and <hi>Zulfa,</hi> on each side, as well to the North as to the South, there are ten Covents of Christian <hi>Armenians,</hi> distant about two or three Leagues one from the other. They acknowledge the Pope, and are govern'd by certain Religious <hi>Dominicans</hi> of their own Nation. And to keep up their Religion, they send from time to time, to <hi>Rome,</hi> certain Children born in the Country, to learn the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tongues, and other necessary Sciences. It is thought there are in this Quarter above six thousand Souls that absolutely follow the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> only that they sing the <hi>Office</hi> and the <hi>Mass</hi> in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue, that all the People may hear and understand them. The Archbishop, being chosen, is sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to be confirm'd. He resides at a great Town, which is one of the most lovely places in all <hi>Asia;</hi> the Wine and Fruits that grow there are very delicate, besides the abundance of all other things necessary for Humane Life. Every Covent stands near a great Village: the chiefest where I have been twice, is <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rener,</hi> the second <hi>Abraghonnex,</hi> the third <hi>Kerna,</hi> the fourth <hi>Soletak,</hi> the fifth <hi>Kouchkachen,</hi> the sixth <hi>Giaouk,</hi> the seventh <hi>Chiabonnez,</hi> the eighth <hi>Araghouche,</hi> the ninth <hi>Kauzuk,</hi> the tenth <hi>Kisouk,</hi> which lyes upon the Frontiers of <hi>Curdistan</hi> or <hi>Assyria.</hi> Here it is, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> believe St. <hi>Rartholomew</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to have been Martyr'd, of which they pretend to shew some Relicks at this day. Many <hi>Mahometans</hi> came thither out of Devotion, especially such as are troubl'd
<pb facs="tcp:106224:23"/>
                        <figure>

with Fevers. There are two or three of those Convents; where they civilly entertain such Christians as come out of <hi>Europe;</hi> though the Monks, there, are very poor. They also live very austere Lives, feeding upon nothing but Herbs. That which makes them so poor, is the often change of Tyrannical Governours, whom they are oblig'd to present with large Gifts. But in regard they cannot give much, those Governours have no kidness for them; for which reason, being instigated by those other <hi>Armenians</hi> who are able to oblige them, they use them so severely that they are often forc'd to complain to the King; which I have many times seen done at <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A League and a half from the chief of these Covents there is a high Mountain, separated from all the rest, which rises like a Sugar-loaf, as doth the Pike of <hi>Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff.</hi> At the foot of this Mountain are certain Springs, that have the virtue to heal those that are bit by Serpents; in so much that Serpents carry'd to that place will dye immediately.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Caravan</hi> is ready to set out from <hi>Naksivan</hi> for <hi>Zulfa,</hi> which is not above a days journey from thence, the principal <hi>Armenians</hi> usually go out of the way to the Covent of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> which lyes to the South.</p>
                     <p>Now the Road from <hi>Naksivan</hi> to St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s lyes first to a great Village call'd <hi>Ecclisia,</hi> where live the richest <hi>Armenians,</hi> that drive a great Trade in Silk, and have built them a very fair Church.</p>
                     <p>Two Leagues from <hi>Ecclisia</hi> you must cross the River <hi>Aras</hi> in a Ferry-Boat, being as it were squeez'd between two Mountains in that place: Once I went over upon the Ice. About two Musket-shots from thence, you must cross, over a Bridge, another River that falls into the <hi>Aras.</hi> From the foot of the Bridge you begin to ascend a little Hill, at the top whereof you meet with a great Village, call'd <hi>Shambé,</hi> all the Inhabitants whereof, as well Men as Women, grow Mad at 18 years of age; but it is such a Madness that is not mischievous. Some believe it to be the Punishment of Heaven, for that their Forefathers in these Mountains persecuted St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From hence to St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s it is not above a League, but the Way is very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fom. St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s is a Covent built not above 30 Years ago. It stands upon the Mountains, in a barren place, and of difficult access. But the reason why the <hi>Armenians</hi> chose that place before any other, is because that St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> retir'd thither in the time of their Persecution. They add, that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did a Miracle in that place: for that there being no Water there before, he only strook his Stick upon the Ground, and presently there arose a Spring. This Spring is about half a quarter of a League from the Covent, under a Vault with a good Door to it, to keep the Water from being wasted. The <hi>Armenians</hi> go to visit this Spring in great Devotion, having laid the Water into the Covent with Pipes. They also say, that in this place they found several Relicks which St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> left there, to which they add a great many others; among the rest a Cross, made of the Basin wherein Christ wash'd his Disciples Feet: In the middle of the Cross is a white Stone, which, as they report, if you lay upon a Sick person, will turn black if the person be likely to dye; and recover its former whiteness after the death of the party.</p>
                     <p>A Jaw-Bone of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr.</p>
                     <p>The Scull of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Bone of the Neck, and a Bone of the Finger of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptist.</p>
                     <p>A Hand of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was the Disciple of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A little Box, wherein they keep a great number of pieces of Bones, which they believe to be the Relicks of the Seventy Two Disciples.</p>
                     <p>The Church is built in the form of a Cross, as are all the Churches of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> in the middle whereof rises a fair <hi>Duomo,</hi> round about which stand the Twelve Apostles. Both the Church and Covent are of Free-stone, and though the whole Edifice be not very big, there has been abundance of Gold and Silver wasted upon the Walls: many <hi>Armenian</hi> Families have been very much endamag'd thereby; for the Women were so devout, that unknown to their Husbands they sold their Jewels, and their very Cloaths, to defray the Expences of Building.</p>
                     <p>The first time that I was at St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s, in the company of some <hi>Armenians,</hi> two Bishops, attended by several other Monks, came out to meet us, and led us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106224:25"/>
into a great Hall, where we were very well treated. For it is the custom of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> a little before Meals to present their Guests a large Cup of Aqua-vitae, with Sweet meats of all sorts, besides Citron and Orange-peels candy'd, in seven or eight Porcelan-dishes, laid in a great <hi>China-</hi>Basin. This is a little Prelude to exoite the Appetite; for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> both Men and Women, will empty great Cups of Aqua-vitae. After Dinner they go to Church, where they sing certain Hymns: when you return, there are a sufficient number of Mattresses or Quilts to lye upon; for they use no other sort of Beds over all <hi>Asia:</hi> only at Night you spread a Carpet upon a Quilt, and shut the Door. We saw not the Archbishop all that Evening, only at Church.</p>
                     <p>About Midnight all the Bells rang, and every body rose to go to Church. I believe it was more than usual, because it was <hi>Shrovetide;</hi> for both the <hi>Office</hi> and the <hi>Missa</hi> were both concluded by break of day. Between eight and nine in the Morning the Cloth was laid; before which time we saw abundance of the neigbouring Country People, who brought Wine, Fruits, and other Provisions, and presented all to the Archbishop.</p>
                     <p>While we were at Breakfast news came that a certain Bishop was dead, in his return to the <hi>Three Churches;</hi> whither he was sent by the Patriarch to gather certain Duties due from the Villages. Immediately the Archbishop rising from the Table with all his Assistants, and having made a Prayer for the Dead, sent a Bishop and six Monks to fetch the Corps; who returning a little after Midnight, the Body was presently laid in the Church upon a Carpet spread upon the Ground, with the Face turn'd toward the Altar. In the mean time, a great number of Wax-candles were lighted, and all the rest of the Night two Monks watch'd by turns to Pray for the Dead. Early in the Morning the Archbishop, the Bishops and all in Religious Orders, said the <hi>Office for the Dead,</hi> which lasted half an Hour; and at the end of the Mass they brought the Corps to the Altar, so that they made the Feet of the Corps to touch it. Having so done, they took off the Linnen Cloth that cover'd his Head, at which time the Archbishop anointed him in six places with the Holy Oyl, saying certain Prayers every time. Then they cover'd him again, and said other Prayers which lasted half an Hour. These Ceremonies perform'd, they carry'd the Corps out of the Church with Crosses and Banners, and every one a Taper in his Hand. As the Corps pass'd by, one of the Bishops put a Paper in his right Hand, containing these Words, <hi>I came from the Father, and I return to the Father.</hi> Being brought to the Grave, upon a little Mountain near the Covent, and set down, they said other Prayers which lasted a quarter of an Hour. In the mean time a Bishop going down into the Grave, took away all the Stones and made the place smooth, after which the Corps was let down wrapt in a large Linnen Sheet. Then the Bishop, according to their custom, rais'd his Head a little higher than his Body, turning his Face to the East. Which being done, the Archbishop and Assistants took every one a handful of Earth, which the Archbishop blest, and giving it to the Bishop, he strew'd it over the Body. Then the Bishop coming out again, the Grave was fill'd up.</p>
                     <p>From St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s there is a descent for a League together to <hi>Aras,</hi> by the side whereof you are to keep along till you come to <hi>Zulfa,</hi> where you come into the high Road again. There is another way quite over the Mountain, which is the nearer way by a League, but 'tis very troublesom and toylsom, and therefore the less frequented.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the High-Road from <hi>Naksivan;</hi> half a League from <hi>Naksivan</hi> you meet with a River which falls into <hi>Anas,</hi> which is to be cross'd over a Stone-Bridge of 12 Arches, though there be but little Water, unless it be when the Snow melts, or the Rains fall. In a Meadow, next the Bridge, where we lodg'd one time that I travell'd that way, there is a Spring of lukewarm Water, which will loosen the Bellies of them that drink it. At this Bridge it is that the Toll-gatherer comes and takes his Duties, when the <hi>Caravan</hi> stays not at <hi>Naksivan.</hi> You must pay ten <hi>Abassi's</hi> for every Camel's Loading, or nine Livres, which is for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Highways. These Duties are demanded in many places of <hi>Persia</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out searching the Packs. The Governours also in their Provinces are made to answer for every Robbery committed: which makes it so safe travelling in <hi>Persia,</hi> that you need not keep with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> unless you will your self.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106224:25"/>
From this Bridge to <hi>Zulfa</hi> is but one days journey; which Town being altogether ruin'd, shews the reason wherefore the <hi>Caravan</hi> lodges upon the Bank of the River five hundred Paces on this side.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zulfa,</hi> the ancient Habitation of the <hi>Armenians</hi> which <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> carried into <hi>Persia,</hi> is a Town squeez'd between two Mountains, through which the <hi>Aras</hi> runs; leaving but little Land on either side. It carries no Boats till about two Leagues below, (for upward it will hardly bear a piece of Timber) and in regard the Country grows low and extends it self into Plains, there is no fear of Rocks, the course of the Stream being very quiet. There was a fair Stone-Bridge, which <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> caus'd to be broken down; when he wholly destroy'd the Town, that it might be no harbour for the <hi>Turks.</hi> Neither by the Ruines, nor by its Situation, doth it appear to have been a City of any ancient Beauty; the Stones were clapt unskilfully together without Morter, so that the Houses were more like Caves than Houses. The North-West side was most inhabited, there being nothing on the other side worth taking notice of. The Lands about <hi>Zulfa</hi> being very fertil, there are certain <hi>Armenian</hi> Families return'd, who live very quietly. <hi>Cogia Nazar,</hi> one of the chief <hi>Armenians</hi> that went out of <hi>Zulfa,</hi> growing rich by Trade, and being in great reputation with <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> and <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> his Successor, who made him <hi>Kelomer,</hi> or Chief Judge of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Nation, built two great Inns, for the Honour of his Country, in <hi>Zulfa,</hi> upon each side of the River one. He spent above an hundred thousand Crowns, but dying left two remarkable Pieces of Work unfinish'd.</p>
                     <p>Half a League on this side <hi>Zulfa,</hi> before you cross a Torrent that falls into <hi>Aras,</hi> you may take your choice of two ways to go to <hi>Tauris.</hi> The one upon the right hand, leading to the South-East, which is the ordinary Road; the other upon the left hand, toward the North-East, which we took eight or ten in company together on horseback, the last time I went to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> We left the <hi>Caravan,</hi> that takes the great Road, and never goes the other way, because it is full of Rocks and Stones that spoil the hooss of the Camels. However I was willing to see a new Country, which I shall describe before I come to the great Road.</p>
                     <p>From the Torrent where we left the <hi>Caravan,</hi> we went forward, and lay at a Village not above a League and a half off.</p>
                     <p>The next day, after we had kept along by the Banks of the <hi>Aras</hi> for five or six Hours, we came to <hi>Astabat,</hi> which lyes a League from the River, where we staid above two Days to divert our selves. This is but a little City, but a very neat one; where there are four Inns, and every House has its Fountain. The great plenty of Water makes the City very fruitful in all things; more especially in good Wine. This is the only Country in the World that produces the <hi>Ronas,</hi> for which there is a vast utterance all over <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> The <hi>Ronas</hi> is a Root that grows in the Earth like Liquorice, and is not much bigger. The use of it is to dye Red, and this is that Red which gives that beautiful tincture to all the Calicuts that come out of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country. Though the Roots which are pull'd out of the Earth are very long, yet they cut them into pieces not above as long as a Man's Hand, for the better accommodation of Carriage. It is a wonderful thing to behold at <hi>Ormus</hi> whole <hi>Caravans</hi> laden with this <hi>Ronas,</hi> whith they Ship off from thence to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Root is full of Juyce, and yields a very high Tincture; for I remember that an <hi>Indian</hi> Vessel that was laden with it, being cast away in the Road of <hi>Ormus,</hi> where the Bags of <hi>Ronas</hi> floated, the Sea look'd of a red colour for several days.</p>
                     <p>Departing from <hi>Astabat,</hi> it behov'd us to provide our selves with Straw and Barley for our Horses, understanding that we should meet with none all that days journey. From thence we travell'd upon a descent for an hour together to the River <hi>Aras,</hi> which we cross'd in a Boat; and all the rest of the day we travel'd through Mountains; over Torrents and Stones. That Evening we lay upon the Bank of a small Stream.</p>
                     <p>The day following, after we had travel'd through a spacious Valley for two or three hours, we ascended a high Mountain, at the top whereof we met with two or three pitiful Houses, where we stopt that day.</p>
                     <p>The next, which was the fifth after, we left the <hi>Caravan,</hi> we travel'd upon a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106224:26"/>
descent for two or three hours, till we came to a great Village neatly situated, where there grows excellent Fruit. There we repos'd for an hour or two; and from thence we came to a great Stone-Bridge on a River where there is no Water but when the Rains fall. It falls into the Lake <hi>Roumi;</hi> but the Water of the River is so sowr and ill-tasted, especially when it is low, that it is not to be drunk. About a quarter of a League from the Bridge are three long Stones set in the Ground like Pillars: the Natives say that they were plac'd there for a Monument, in the same place where <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspes</hi> was elected King by the cunning of the Gentleman of his Horse: from whence to <hi>Tauris</hi> is but half a League. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the <hi>Medes</hi> which we cross'd in this Road, and those which run along toward the ancient <hi>Parthians,</hi> are the most fertil in all <hi>Persia.</hi> They bear Corn and Fruit in abundance; for upon the high Mountains there are fair Plains sow'd with Wheat, which are extraordinary fertil. The Springs which rise there, and Rains which fall give a fresher beauty and a higher tast to what grows there, more than in any other part of <hi>Persia</hi> that wants Water; and the products of those Fields are of a higher price.</p>
                     <p>Now for the great Road. The <hi>Caravan</hi> having cross'd the Stream where we left it, lodges the next Night upon the Banks of <hi>Aras,</hi> over which it ferries the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It does not go thorough <hi>Zulfa,</hi> though it be so near it; because that on the other side of the City there are three Leagues of Way very bad and unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented. For which reason you must leave <hi>Zulfa</hi> on the right hand, which is not much out of the way. After two hours travel you go by a Bridge which is call'd <hi>Sugiac;</hi> after which you come upon Heaths encompass'd with high Rocks. All this days journey you meet with no Water, but only one little Fountain, and the Water is so bad that the Beasts will hardly drink it.</p>
                     <p>The day following you travel through an even Country, but very barren: where you meet with nothing but a forlorn Inn; though it be a place where Cost has been bestow'd, and built all of Free-stone, that was fetch'd a great way off. The next Stage is <hi>Marante,</hi> famous for the Burying-place of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Wife. The Town is not very big; resembling rather a Thicket than a City: but the situation is very pleasant, in the middle of a fertil Plain adorn'd with several well peopl'd Villages. This Plain does not extend above a League round about <hi>Marante,</hi> the Country beyond it being all barren. However it is not altogether unprofitable: for being a continual Heath, it affords feeding for the Camels, which are there bred for the <hi>Caravans.</hi> Which is the reason that there are so many Camel-Masters at <hi>Sugiac</hi> and <hi>Marante,</hi> who furnish great part of the Road. At <hi>Marante</hi> you must pay thirteen <hi>Abassi's,</hi> or four Crowns for every Camel's Load, for the security of the Road.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Marante,</hi> you lodge the next night a League from <hi>Sophiana</hi> in a bushy Plain, where the Water is worth nothing; after you have travell'd a mix'd Country, barren enough, where you meet with but one Inn in a Valley: but it is a very fair one. <hi>Sophiana</hi> is an indifferent large City, which you cannot see till you come within it, by reason of the great number of Trees planted in the Streets and round about it, which makes it look rather like a Forest than a City.</p>
                     <p>The next day, which is usually the tenth days journey from <hi>Erivan;</hi> the <hi>Caravan,</hi> having cross'd fair, large and fertil Plains, arrives at <hi>Tauris.</hi> Those Plains are water'd with several Streams that fall from the <hi>Median</hi> Mountains; but the Water is not all of the same goodness, for there is some which cannot be drunk.</p>
                     <p>In the mid-way between <hi>Sophiana</hi> and <hi>Tauris,</hi> lyes a Hill, from whence you have a prospect over those Plains, upon which the Army of <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> Encamp'd, when he besieg'd <hi>Tauris.</hi> The news coming to <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> that he had burnt it, and was marching further into the Country with a hundred thousand Men, <hi>Let him come,</hi> said he, <hi>without any disturbance, I know how to make the</hi> Turks <hi>pay for their Invasion without any great trouble.</hi> They were then not above fifteen days march from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> when <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> turn'd the course of all the Streams both before and behind, which only run from certain Springs, and are brought in Cutts or Chanels into the Inland-parts of <hi>Persia,</hi> where there are no Rivers: By which means the whole Army of the <hi>Turks</hi> perish'd for want of Water in those vast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water'd Countries where they had engag'd themselves too far.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tauris</hi> lyes in 83 Degrees, 30 Minutes of Longitude; and 40 Degrees, 15 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Latitude, in an open place where there is not a Tree to be seen; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106224:26"/>
environ'd with Mountains on every side, but only upon the West. The furthest Mountain is not above a League from the City; but there is one which almost touches it, being only separated from it by the River. 'Tis a good Country, and fruitful in Corn; there is good Pasturage, and great store of Pulse. Some think that <hi>Tauris</hi> was the ancient <hi>Ecbatane,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Empire of the <hi>Medes.</hi> It is at this day a great City and well peopl'd, as being the Mart for <hi>Turkie, Muscovy,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi> There are an infinite number of Merchants, and vast quantities of all sorts of Merchandize: particularly of Silk, which is brought out of the Province of <hi>Guilan,</hi> and other places. There is also a great Trade for Horses, which are handsom and cheap. Wine, Aqua-vitae, and indeed all sorts of Provisions are cheap enough; and Money trolls about in that place more than in any other part of <hi>Asia.</hi> Many <hi>Armenian</hi> Families have got great Estates there by Trade, and understand it better than the <hi>Persians.</hi> A little River, the Water whereof is very good, runs through the middle of <hi>Tauris;</hi> it's call'd <hi>Schein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaie,</hi> over which there are three Bridges to cross from one part of the City to the other.</p>
                     <p>The most part of the Buildings in <hi>Tauris</hi> are of Bricks bak'd in the Sun; the Houses not being above one or two Stories high at most. The tops of the Houses are terrass'd; the Roofs within are vaulted, and plaister'd with Earth mix'd with chopt Straw, which they whiten afterwards with Lime. In the year 1638 the City was almost ruin'd by <hi>Sultan Amurath;</hi> but it is almost all rebuilt again. There are in it <hi>Bazars,</hi> or Market-houses, which are well built, and many Inns very commodious, two Stories high. The fairest is that of <hi>Mirza-Sadé,</hi> Governour of the Province, who caus'd it to be built with a Market-house adjoyning, to which he has added a Mosquee and a Colledge, with good Revenues.</p>
                     <p>The great Trade of <hi>Tauris</hi> renders it renown'd over all <hi>Asia:</hi> for it has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Traffick with <hi>Turks, Arabians, Georgians, Mengrelians, Persians, Indians, Muscovites,</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> The <hi>Bazars</hi> or Market-houses, which are cover'd, are always full of Goods: for there are some which are peculiar to the Handicraft-Trades; the most part whereof are Smiths, such as make Saws, Axes, Files, and Steels to strike Fire, with Tobacco-stoppers belonging to them. Some there are that make Pad-locks: for the Eastern People fasten their Doors only with wooden Bolts. There are also Turners, that furnish the neighbouring Parts with Spinning-Wheels and Cradles: and some Goldsmiths, that make trifles of Silver. But there is abundance of Silk-weavers that are Artists, and work very neatly; and indeed there are more of those than of any other Trade. Here it is that they dress the greatest part of the Shagrin-Skins that are vended so plentifully all over <hi>Persia;</hi> for there are none unless it be the Country-people, but wear Boots or Shooes of Shagrin-Leather. This Leather is made either of the Hides of Horses, Asses, or Mules, and only of the hinder part of the Hide: but the Asses Hide has the best grain.</p>
                     <p>There are to be seen at <hi>Tauris,</hi> Ruines of the stately Edifices round about the great <hi>Piazza,</hi> and the neighbouring Parts: they have also let run to ruine four or five Mosquees of a prodigious height and bigness. The most magnificent and the biggest stands as you go out of the Town, in the Road to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> will not come near it, but look upon it as defil'd, and a Mosquee of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, in regard it was built by the <hi>Sounnis,</hi> or the followers of <hi>Omar.</hi> 'Tis a vast Structure fairly built, the Front whereof is fifty Paces broad, with an ascent of eight Steps. It is lin'd without with Brick-work varnish'd with different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; and adorn'd within with very fair Painting <hi>A Pantique,</hi> and abundance of Cifers and <hi>Arabian</hi> Letters in Gold and Azure. Upon two sides of the Fore-front are rear'd two <hi>Minarets</hi> or Towers very high, but not very wide, yet with Stairs to go up to the top. They are lin'd with varnish'd Brick-work, which is the usual Ornament of the <hi>Persian</hi> Buildings: and at the top stand two <hi>Cupola's,</hi> form'd like the Turbants which the <hi>Persians</hi> wear. The Gate of the Mosquee is not above four Foot wide, cut out of a great transparent white Stone, four and twenty Foot high, and twelve broad. Entring at the Door of the Mosquee, you come into a spacious <hi>Duomo,</hi> thirty six Paces in Diameter, rais'd upon twelve Pillars within, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by sixteen without, which Pillars are very high, and six Foot square. Below there is a Balustrade or Rails that run round about the Building; with Doors to go
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106224:27"/>
from one side to the other: and the Foot of every Pillar, which is of white Marble, is hollow'd into little Niches equal with the Floor, where the People put their Shooes, when they go farther to their Devotions. The inside of the Walls is varnish'd in Squares of several Colours, with Flowers, Cifers, and <hi>Arabian</hi> Letters intermix'd, and wrought in Emboss'd-work, so well painted, so well gilded, that it seems to be but one piece of Work, cut out with a pair of Sciffars. From this Duomo you pass to another lesser, but more beautiful in its kind. The lower part is of transparent white Stone, of the same nature with that in the Front, cut in great Panes like a Door that never opens. This Duomo has no Pillars, but eight Foot high, it is all of white Marble, where are to be seen Stones of a prodigious length and bredth: The inside of the Vault is a violet Enamel, painted with all sorts of Flowers in Flat-work, but the outside of both the Duomo's is cover'd with vernish'd Brick-work, and Flowers emboss'd <hi>A la Moresque.</hi> Upon the first the Flowers are black upon green; upon the second, white Stars upon black: which diversity of Colours is very pleasing to the Eye.</p>
                     <p>Near the Door out of which you enter into the lesser Duomo, on the left hand, stands a Chair of Walnut-tree curiously carv'd, and fasten'd to the Wall; it stands upon a Platform rais'd six steps high, without any Canopy. On the right hand stands another Chair of the same Wood, and an exquisite piece of Workmanship; with a kind of State over it of the same Wood, fasten'd to the Wall. There is a little Rail about it; and the Platform is four steps high. On the South-side of the Mosquee there are two white transparent Stones, which when the Sun shines upon them look red: And sometimes after the Sun is set, you may read at those Stones by the reflexion of the Sun-beams.</p>
                     <p>Just against the Mosquee on the other side is another Front, which is the only Remain of a ruin'd Building. It was the abode of the <hi>Sheck-Iman,</hi> or the Chief Priest. There had been large Baths which belonging to it, but they are all destroy'd; some others there were of less note, which are not lookt after.</p>
                     <p>In the great Piazza of <hi>Tauris</hi> and in the parts adjoyning, stands a fair Mosquee, a Colledge, and a Castle, which fall to decay; these Buildings being forsaken; by reason they were made use of by the <hi>Sounni's,</hi> which were followers of <hi>Omar.</hi> Near the same Church is a ruin'd Church of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> whether they say St. <hi>Helena</hi> sent the true Cross. There is another Mosquee, which was formerly a Church dedicated to St. <hi>John</hi> Baptist, where they say one of his Hands was preserv'd a long time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capuchins</hi> have a very convenient House at <hi>Tauris;</hi> for <hi>Mirza-Ibrahim</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Province, whose credit is equal to the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Tauris,</hi> which is the chiefest Command in <hi>Persia,</hi> favours him very much with his protection. This Governour has made himself very considerable at Court, and very much respected by the King for his indefatigable pains, and his extraordinary agility in augmenting the King's Revenue: having found out such ways for that purpose as never entred into the thoughts of any that preceded him in the same Employment. He is very curious to learn all the Noble Sciences, which is a quality very rare among the <hi>Persians:</hi> He also takes great delight in the Mathematicks and Philosophy, discoursing often with <hi>Gabriel de Chinon,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Capuchins</hi> Covent in <hi>Tauris.</hi> But the great desire which <hi>Mirza-Ibrahim</hi> had to have his two Sons taught by the said <hi>Gabriel,</hi> was the chief motive that made him so favourable to that Covent. He bought the Friers a place to build their House, and liberally furnish'd them for the Expence of the Work.</p>
                     <p>When the Sun sets and rises, there are a certain Company of People who are oblig'd to make a hideous noise with Drums and Trumpets in the <hi>Meidan,</hi> or great Piazza of the City. They stand upon one side of the Piazza in a Gallery somewhat rais'd, which is a Custom observ'd in all the Cities under the <hi>Persian</hi> Government.</p>
                     <p>As you go out of <hi>Tauris</hi> upon the North-side, there is a Mountain close by, there being only the River between it. The name of it is <hi>Einali-Zeinali,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there stood upon the top of it a fair Hermitage of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have converted into a Mosquee. At the bottom of the Mountain stands a Fortress and a Mosquee, which they let go to ruine, because they were built by the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> A little farther upon the brink of the Precipice stands a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, near to which are two Caves, where are certain Sepulchers and Marble Pillars
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106224:27"/>
lying along upon the Ground. There are also in the Mosquee certain Tombs of the ancient Kings of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the Remains whereof shew that the Work was very Excellent.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Road from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> about half a League from the utmost Gardens, between several knaps of the Mountain which you leave upon the right hand, upon the top of the highest of all, where there never was any Water, and where it is impossible to bring any, appears a Bridge fifty Paces long, the Arches whereof are very fair ones, but it falls to decay. It was a <hi>Mollah</hi> that built it, out of what design no person knew: nor can you come to <hi>Tauris</hi> upon that side, but you must see that Bridge, because there is no other way, there being nothing but Water and Precipices on either hand. Afterwards he confess'd that he built it out of meer Vanity, knowing that <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> the first of that Name was to come to <hi>Tauris.</hi> The King indeed came some time after, and seeing an unprofitable Bridge upon the top of a Mountain, he demanded who built it, and what was his design. To whom the <hi>Mollah</hi> return'd this Answer, Sir, said he, I built that Bridge, that when your Majesty came to <hi>Tauris,</hi> you might inform your self from the mouth of him that built it. By which it appear'd, that the <hi>Mollah</hi> had no other ambition than to oblige the King to speak to him.</p>
                     <p>A League from <hi>Tauris</hi> to the West, in the middle of a Field stands a great Brick Tower, call'd <hi>Kanhazun.</hi> It is about fifty Paces in Diameter, and though it be half ruin'd, yet it is very high. It seems to have been the Dungeon of some Castle, there being very high Walls round about it; which though they be but of Earth, nevertheless appear to be very ancient. It is not certainly known who built this Tower, but the <hi>Arabian</hi> Letters upon the Gate afford us some reason to conclude that it was a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Structure. In the year 1651 there happen'd a terrible Earthquake in <hi>Tauris</hi> and the parts thereabout, by which many Houses were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and this Tower then cleaving from the top to the bottom, a good part of it fell down, and fill'd up the hollow within-side.</p>
                     <p>Besides the little River that runs by <hi>Tauris,</hi> there is another bigger to be cross'd, about half a League from the City, over which there is a very fair Stone-Bridge. Near to it stands a Sepulcher, cover'd with a little <hi>Duomo,</hi> where the <hi>Persians</hi> say that the Sister of <hi>Iman-Riza</hi> lyes interr'd; and they have it in great veneration. The River that runs under the Bridge comes from the Mountains of the North, and falls into the Lake <hi>Roumi,</hi> thirteen or fourteen Leagues from <hi>Tauris.</hi> They call it <hi>Aggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sou,</hi> or <hi>Bitter-water;</hi> for the Water is very bad, and without any Fish. The Lake which is fifteen Leagues in compass, has the same quality, the Water being blackish: the Fish that happen into it out of other Rivers that fall into it, presently become blind, and in a short while are found dead by the Shoar. This Lake takes its name from a Province and a little City, which are both call'd <hi>Roumi,</hi> being not above eleven Leagues from <hi>Tauris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the middle of the Lake, upon the way that leads to a little City call'd <hi>Toko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> there is a little Hill that rises insensibly, the ascent whereof is very smooth, and out of it there rise many little Springs. The farther they run from the Head, the wider grow the Streams: and the Earth which they water is of two distinct qualities: the first Earth that is dig'd serves to make Lime: the next to that is a hollow spungy Stone, that is good for nothing: but under that again is a white transparent Stone, which you may see through as through Glass, which being smooth and polish'd serves to adorn the Houses. This Stone is only a congelation of the Waters of these Streams; for sometimes you shall meet with creeping Animals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd within. The Governour of the Province sent one piece to <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> as a great Present, wherein there was a Lizard congeal'd of a Foot long. He that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it to the Governour had twenty Tomans, or three hundred Crowns; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I offer'd a thousand for the same Piece. In some parts of the Province of <hi>Mazandran,</hi> where the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea stretches farthest into the <hi>Persian</hi> Territories, these congeal'd Stones are to be found, but not so frequently as near the Lake <hi>Roumi,</hi> and you shall many times find pieces of Wood and Worms congeal'd in the Stones. I brought away a Camels-loading of these Stones, and left them at <hi>Marseilles;</hi> till I could find what use to put them to.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>A Continuation of the</hi> Constantinopolitan <hi>Road from</hi> Tauris <hi>to</hi> Ispahan, <hi>through</hi> Ardevil <hi>and</hi> Casbin.</head>
                     <p>FRom <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan</hi> the <hi>Caravan</hi> makes it generally twenty-four days journey.</p>
                     <p>The first day you cross over dry Mountains, and four Leagues from <hi>Tauris</hi> you meet with one of the fairest Inns in <hi>Persia.</hi> This Inn <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> caus'd to be built; it is very convenient, and large enough to lodge a hundred persons with their Horses. Over all <hi>Persia,</hi> especially from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ormus;</hi> you meet every day with Inns at an equal distance.</p>
                     <p>The next day you descend a Mountain, in very rugged and narrow way. At the foot of this Mountain there are two ways for the Merchants to choose that will go to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> They that will go the ordinary road and the direct way through <hi>Kom</hi> and <hi>Kachan,</hi> leave a Lake upon the left hand that parts the two Roads; and they that will go through <hi>Ardevil</hi> and <hi>Casbin,</hi> two other good Cities, leave the Lake upon the right hand, and coast along by the side of the Mountain. From <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ardevil</hi> it is not above a dozen Leagues; and having pass'd the Lake, the Country is very good: Which is the Road I intend to describe first.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ardevil</hi> being at so small a distance from <hi>Tauris,</hi> lyes almost in the same Degrees and Minutes of Longitude and Latitude. This City is famous, as well for being the first Market of Silks that come from <hi>Guilan,</hi> from which it is not far off; as also for the Sepulcher of <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> the first of that Name, King of <hi>Persia.</hi> The avenues to it are very pleasant, being as it were Alleys of great Trees, which are call'd <hi>Tchinar,</hi> planted in a streight line, at a due distance. It is of a moderate bigness, and seated in a lovely opening of the Mountains. The next to the City, which is call'd <hi>Sevalan,</hi> is the highest in all <hi>Media.</hi> The Houses of <hi>Ardevil</hi> are built of Earth, as are most of the Houses in the Cities of <hi>Persia:</hi> but the Streets are very uneven, dirty, and narrow. There is but one which is handsom, at the end whereof is built the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church. A little River runs through the middle of the City, which descending from the neighbouring Mountains runs from East to West. It is by Industry brought into many Cutts to water the Gardens, and in many places there are very fair Trees planted, which are very delightful to the Sight. The <hi>Meydan</hi> or Market-place is a very great one; more long than round; where stands a very fine Inn, upon one side, which the <hi>Kan</hi> caus'd to be built. There are several others in several parts of the City, which have the Prospect over several lovely Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, especially that which belongs to the King; to which you go through a long and stately Walk of four rows of Trees, at the end whereof stands a large Gate that gives you entrance. Though the Country about <hi>Ardevil</hi> be proper to bear Vines, yet there are none thereabouts; nor is there any Wine made till about four or five Leagues from the City. The <hi>Armenians</hi> that dwell in the City are very well stor'd with it; though there be no place in all <hi>Persia,</hi> where there is so much Caution to be us'd, either as to the Importing it, or the Drinking it; both which must be done very privately: Which proceeds from the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superstition; the <hi>Persians</hi> having so peculiar a Veneration for that place, that they believe it a Sin to suffer Wine to be publickly drank therein.</p>
                     <p>The People come in Pilgrimage from all parts of <hi>Persia</hi> to the Sepucher of <hi>Sha-Sefi;</hi> which together with the vast Trade of Silk, makes <hi>Ardevil</hi> one of the most considerable Cities of all <hi>Persia.</hi> There are several other Buildings added to the <hi>Mosquee</hi> wherein he lyes interr'd; the Entry whereof faces the <hi>Meydan,</hi> to which it is joyn'd upon the South-side with a large Portal. The Gate is chain'd with Chains fasten'd a-cross with great Rings; which if any Criminal Offender can but touch, and enter into the first Court, he is safe; for no person can apprehend him. This is a large Court, yet more in length than breadth, without the Wall whereof that looks upon the Market-place, several Shops are built for Merchants and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:106224:28"/>
Out of this Court you pass into another which is less, and pav'd with broad Stones, with a Rivulet running through the middle. The Entry into it is through a Door, fortifi'd with Iron Chains like the former, and is made at a corner of the great Court upon the left hand. It brings you presently under a <hi>Portico,</hi> where there are fair Balconies rais'd after the fashion of the Country. Those Balconies are full of several People; either Pilgrims, or persons whose Crimes constrain them thither for Sanctuary. In that place you must leave your Stick and your Sword, before you go any farther; and give something besides to a <hi>Moullah,</hi> who is always attending there with Books.</p>
                     <p>In that second Court through which the Rivulet glides, on the one side are Baths, on the other Granaries for Rice and Corn; and upon the left hand, at the end of the same Court, there is a little Door which brings you to a place where the Royal Alms are distributed to the Poor, Morning and Evening; being just against the King's Kitchin. This Gate is cover'd with Plates of Silver; and in the Kitchin there are about thirty Ovens contriv'd in the Wall, with as many great Caldrons to dress Pilaw and other Food, as well for the Poor as for the Officers of the <hi>Mosquee.</hi> While these Alms are distributing, the Master-Cook, who commands all the rest, sets upon a Chair cover'd with Plates of Silver, and sees that every thing be done in order. He sees to the measuring out the Rice every day for the Kettles, and causes the Victuals to be divided in his own sight: For there is an excellent Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy in the King's House.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the <hi>Portico</hi> beyond the first Court there are two Gates, one beyond another, both cover'd with Plates of Silver; between those two Gates on the right hand appears a little <hi>Mosquee,</hi> where are the Tombs of several <hi>Persian</hi> Princes of the Blood Royal. You must have a great care not to tread upon the Thresholds of the Gates; for it is a Crime not to be expiated without a severe Punishment. From hence through a little Ile, you come into the Body of the Church, richly hung with Tapestry, and set about with high Desks, where lye a great many Books, wherein the <hi>Moullahs,</hi> or Doctors of the Law read continually, having Stipends to Officiate in the <hi>Mosquee.</hi> At the end of the Body of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> is a little Octagonal Monument, like the Choir of a Church, in the midst whereof stands the Monument of <hi>Sha-Sefi.</hi> It is only of Wood, but curiously carv'd and inlaid. It exceeds not the height of a Man of an ordinary stature, and seems like a great Chest, having four Apples of Gold set up at each corner. It is cover'd with a Crimson Satin purfl'd with Gold; and all the other Tombs that are by it, are cover'd with Silks as rich. As well in the Choir as in the Body of the Church, there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Lamps, some of Gold, some of Silver; but the biggest of all is of Silver, gilded and vermilion'd, and neatly engrav'd. There are also six great Branches of a curious sort of Wood, cover'd with Silver, with great Wax Candles in them, which are never lighted but at their great Festivals.</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Duomo</hi> where stands the Tomb of <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> you go under a little Vault, which encloses another Monument of another King of <hi>Persia,</hi> whose Name I could not learn. It looks like another great Chest, curiously wrought, and cover'd with Satin. The Roof of the <hi>Mosquee</hi> is adorn'd within with a Painting of Gold and Azure, <hi>a la Moresque;</hi> on the outside, with a fair Varnish of several Colours, like the stately <hi>Mosquee</hi> at <hi>Tauris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the adjacent Parts round about <hi>Ardeüil</hi> are several Monuments worth a Man's sight, being very ancient; and some which are ruin'd, shew by what remains the care which they took to enrich them with curious Workmanship. A quarter of a League from the City stands a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> in which are the Tombs of the Father and Mother of <hi>Sha-Sefi.</hi> It is a fair Structure, with Gardens and Courts, in one of which there is a very clear Fountain where they keep Fish.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ardeüil</hi> is not only famous, as I have said already, for the Royal Sepulchers which are in it, and for the Pilgrimages which have been made to it from all parts of <hi>Persia;</hi> but the numerous <hi>Caravans</hi> of Silk, which sometimes consist of eight or nine hundred Camels, add very much to its Grandeur. For being near to <hi>Guilan</hi> and <hi>Shamaqui,</hi> from whence those vast quantities of Silk come; and for that the Road from both those places, to <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> lyes through this City, there is a continual confluence of Merchants, and all sorts of Merchandizes are here to be had as well as at <hi>Tauris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106224:29"/>
From <hi>Ardeüil</hi> to <hi>Casbin</hi> you travel through a good Country; for every three or four Leagues you meet with little Rivers that fall from the Northern Mountains, and water the Earth. The <hi>Caravan</hi> is usually five days between <hi>Ardeüil</hi> and <hi>Arion,</hi> between <hi>Arion</hi> and <hi>Taron</hi> two, between <hi>Taron</hi> and <hi>Casbin</hi> two more. Half a League on this side <hi>Taron</hi> you must cross a great River over a stone Bridge, and half a League beyond you come to <hi>Kalkal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arion</hi> is a little City, <hi>Taron</hi> and <hi>Kalkal</hi> are two great Towns; and there are but these three places in all <hi>Persia</hi> where there grow any Olives, or that they make any Oyl. Leaving <hi>Kalkal,</hi> you travel over a Plain for three hours, at the end whereof is a Way which you cannot get over in less than four hours. The way is so bad that the Horses and Mules can hardly get up; but for the Camels, they must take the lower Road, which is also very tedious, and full of Stones which the Torrents tumble down, and it is three or four Leagues about. When you are up, the Country is level, and you have not above three Leagues to <hi>Casbin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Casbin</hi> lyes in 87 Degrees and 30 Minutes of Longitude, and 36 Degrees and 15 Minutes of Latitude. It is a great City, the Houses whereof are low and ill built; except seven or eight, which are next to the King's Gardens. It has no Walls, and indeed the best half of the City is in Gardens. There are three Inns, with Market-places round about; one of the three being large and commodious. It is inhabited altogether by <hi>Mahometans;</hi> or if there be any Christians, they are very few.</p>
                     <p>The Soil about <hi>Casbin</hi> produces Pistaches. The Tree that bears them is never bigger than a Walnut-tree of ten or twelve years old. The great quantity of Pista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are exported out of <hi>Persia</hi> come from <hi>Malavert,</hi> a little City twelve Leagues from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> toward the East. These are the best Pistaches in the World, and the Country being of a large extent, produces them in such abundance, that it furnishes all <hi>Persia</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Casbin,</hi> you come to a little Village where there is but one Inn; and you travel that day six Leagues through Countries fertil enough, and well water'd.</p>
                     <p>The next day you travel through a good Country, and in nine or ten hours you come to <hi>Denghé.</hi> This is a great Village at the foot of a Hill, through which there runs a fair River. It abounds with excellent both White and Claret Wine, where the Travellers take care to replenish their Bottles. But generally they never lye here; being desirous to go a League farther, for a good Inn's sake, which makes it a handsom Stage.</p>
                     <p>At this Town of <hi>Denghé</hi> it is where the two Roads from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan</hi> meet: the first, through <hi>Ardeüil</hi> and <hi>Casbin,</hi> I have already describ'd. Hither also come the <hi>Caravans</hi> that go for the <hi>Indies</hi> through <hi>Meshéhed</hi> and <hi>Candahar,</hi> and where they leave <hi>Ispahan</hi> Road to take the left-hand Way, which carries them Eastward.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>The ordinary Road from</hi> Tauris <hi>to</hi> Ispahan, <hi>through</hi> Zangan, Sultanie, <hi>and other places.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE must now return again to the Lake six Leagues beyond <hi>Tauris,</hi> where they that will take the ordinary short way through <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Sultanie,</hi> leave the left hand way of <hi>Ardeüil</hi> and <hi>Casbin.</hi> This Lake is usually full of large red Ducks, which are very good Meat.</p>
                     <p>From thence, after twelve or thirteen hours travel, in which time you meet with three Inns, you come to <hi>Karashima,</hi> a large Town in a deep Valley, that seems to be well manur'd. There is in it only a small Inn built of Earth, the Doors whereof are so low, that the People are forc'd to creep upon their knees to get in.</p>
                     <p>The next day you come to another large Village call'd <hi>Turcoma,</hi> where the Soil is fertil, though it be very cold. There are several <hi>Caravansera's</hi> built like a long
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106224:29"/>
Alley cover'd, which are only of Earth, the Men lying at one end; and the Horses at another.</p>
                     <p>The next day you travel over an uneven and desert Country, and in eight hours time you come to <hi>Miana,</hi> a little City situated in a Marsh, where you pay a Toll for Guarding the Highways. In this City is one of the fairest Inns in all <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two hours after you leave <hi>Miana,</hi> you must cross a River, over a fair Bridge which runs to decay; the Arches whereof are hollow within; it is built of Brick and Free-stone, being near as long as <hi>Pont neuf</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> This Bridge stands almost at the foot of a Mountain call'd <hi>Kaplenton. Sha-Abas</hi> caus'd all the way to be Pav'd, because the Land is so fat and sloughy, that when it thaws, or that the least Rain falls, it is impossible for the <hi>Caravan</hi> to pass. Besides, there are a sort of Camels in <hi>Persia,</hi> that when it comes to rain in a deep Soil, are not able to keep their Legs: nay through the weight of the Burthens which they carry, their very Quarters will rive from their Shoulders, and their Bellies will burst. So that before the way was pav'd, they were forc'd to spread Carpets in the most slippery ways where those Camels were to pass: which must be still done in some places, where the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is worn away.</p>
                     <p>At the lower part of the descent toward <hi>Ispahan,</hi> upon the knap of a Hill which stands by it self, appears an old forsak'n Fortress: it is near the Highway, and a River, which falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, after it has cross'd the Province of <hi>Guilan,</hi> where it is cut into several Channels. But generally the Corn and Fruits which grow in <hi>Persia</hi> by the help of Water forc'd into Channels, are of little esteem, and much cheaper than those that grow in the Provinces whose Fertility is not Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. Moreover, that sort of forc'd Grain will not keep above a Year; and if you keep it longer, it breeds a Vermin that eats it. 'Tis the same thing if the Corn be grownd; and more than that, there breeds a Worm in the Flowr, that makes it so bitter that tis impossible to eat it.</p>
                     <p>On this side the Mountain <hi>Kaplenton,</hi> appear at a distance two others very high, one toward the North call'd <hi>Saveland,</hi> another toward the South call'd Sehar<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> there is a third, which cannot be seen in <hi>Ispahan-</hi>Road, being too far out of the way, near the City of <hi>Hamadan.</hi> These three Mountains are full of Springs, from whence most of the Streams do fall that water <hi>Persia:</hi> And the <hi>Persians</hi> do say, that formerly there were many more of these Springs, but that about a hundred Years ago several of them have been dry'd up, or otherwise no body can tell what is become of them.</p>
                     <p>There are several Villages near the Mountain that pay nothing to the King, but are oblig'd to send him a certain quantity of Rice and Butter, for the use of the <hi>Mosquee</hi> at <hi>Ardeüil.</hi> They have also one great Priviledge, That if a Man commits a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and flyes to any of these Villages, he cannot be apprehended, nor can the King himself punish him.</p>
                     <p>Leaving the River that runs at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Kaplenton,</hi> you come to a fair Inn call'd <hi>Tshamalava,</hi> built some years ago: and for thirteen hours after, travelling over a very barren Country, you meet with another Inn, which is call'd <hi>Sartcham,</hi> standing in a very desert place: which makes the <hi>Raders,</hi> that lye there to secure the Highways, very insolent, finding themselves so far from any Towns or Villages.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sartcham</hi> you come to a River, by the Banks whereof you travel a good while, till you come to an Inn which is call'd <hi>Digbé,</hi> near a large Village. The Structure is very handsom, the lower part being of Free-stone undulated with red and white, and very hard.</p>
                     <p>The next day you travel a very uneven Country, till you fall into a deep Valley, at the end whereof you meet with <hi>Zangan,</hi> a great Town and ill built. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it has a very fair Inn, which when I went last to <hi>Ispahan</hi> was so full, that I had like to have lain abroad in the Rain, but for the Courtesie of two <hi>Armenians.</hi> From <hi>Zangan</hi> you go, to an Inn, where you must pay the Duties due to the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Sultanie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sultanie</hi> is a very large City, which you leave half a Mile from the Road, near to a Mountain. Formerly it had in it very beautiful <hi>Mosquees,</hi> as may be easily conjectur'd by the Ruines that remain. Many Christian Churches also were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106224:30"/>
into <hi>Mosquees;</hi> and if you will beleive the <hi>Armenians,</hi> they will tell you, that there were in <hi>Sultanie</hi> near eight hundred Churches and Chappels.</p>
                     <p>Three Leagues from <hi>Sultanie</hi> stands an Inn, and a League farther a great Town call'd <hi>Ija,</hi> where there is another very commodious Inn, and most excellent Wine.</p>
                     <p>From thence you go to <hi>Habar,</hi> an ancient City and of a large extent, but very much ruin'd, inhabited by <hi>Armenians</hi> for the most part: Here, for the good Wines sake the Travellers stay to recruit their Bottles.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Habar,</hi> after seven hours travel you come to a Village call'd <hi>Partin.</hi> From <hi>Zangan</hi> to <hi>Partin</hi> you reach in two days. It stands in a fertil Plain, where there are several other Villages. It is not above three Leagues broad, being enclos'd on each side, to the East and West, with a row of high Mountains.</p>
                     <p>Having pass'd this Plain, you come to a barren Country and ill inhabited, which lasts all the day, till you come to <hi>Sexava.</hi> You pass by the Ruines of a Village, where there are but two Houses standing, with the Tower of a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which is very high and slender. Then you come to a Mud-wall'd-Inn, built some few years since; and near to that a Castle call'd <hi>Khiara,</hi> upon the peek of a Hill, but very ill built.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sexava</hi> is a little City in a Soil that bears excellent Nuts. The Inns that are there, being built of Earth, and being but little, are very handsom and convenient, their number supplying the defect of their smalness.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sexava,</hi> after seven hours travel, you come to a great Inn, call'd <hi>Idgioup,</hi> which was formerly a nobler place than now it is, standing alone in a Field. Three Leagues from thence you meet with another spacious Inn, call'd <hi>Cochkeria;</hi> and four hours farther you come to the Inn <hi>Denghé,</hi> where the two Roads meet which I spake of in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Denghé</hi> to <hi>Kom,</hi> are three days journey, over a barren, dry, and desert Country, where there is no Water but Cistem-water, except in some very few places, where it is very good. Four Leagues from <hi>Denghé</hi> is a fair Inn; and three Leagues farther stands another, about a Mile from a Village to the South, where there grows excellent good Wine, white and red. From this last Inn to <hi>Sava</hi> is not above three hours travel with the <hi>Caravan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sava</hi> is a good City in a fertil Plain, where there are several Villages. The greatest Trade of the Town is in little grey Lamb-skins, the curl whereof is very neat, of which they make Furrs. Two or three Leagues beyond <hi>Sava</hi> the Country is very well manur'd, and after you have forded a River half a League from the City, after two hours travel, you come to one of the fairest Inns in all <hi>Persia,</hi> which was finish'd when I went last to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> From thence to <hi>Kom</hi> it is about seven or eight hours journey, through a dry and sandy Road: but half a League on this side <hi>Kom</hi> the Land is very good and fruitful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kom</hi> is one of the great Cities of <hi>Persia,</hi> in a fat Country abounding in Rice. There grow also excellent Fruits, particularly large and excellent Granates. The Walls are only of Earth, with little Towers close one to another; and the Houses being only of Earth, are never the handsomer within-side. At the entry into the Town you must cross a River, over a stone Bridge, and then turning to the right hand over a fair Key, you come to an Inn very well built and very convenient.</p>
                     <p>That which is most remarkable in <hi>Kom</hi> is a large <hi>Mosquee,</hi> no less in veneration among the <hi>Persians,</hi> than the <hi>Mosquee</hi> of <hi>Ardeüil.</hi> There it is that you may see the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> and <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the Second; as also the Tomb of <hi>Sidi-Fatima,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Iman-Hoven,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Fatima-Zuhra</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The great Gate of the <hi>Mosquee</hi> answers to a <hi>Piazza</hi> more long than broad, where stands an Inn and certain Shops, which without-side are somewhat beautiful. One of the sides of the <hi>Piazza</hi> is clos'd up with a low Wall, over which appears the Shore, and a River which you cross at the end of the <hi>Piazza.</hi> Over the great Portal of the <hi>Mosquee</hi> stands an Inscription, in Letters of Gold, in the Praise of <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the Second. The first place that you enter into is a Court of more length than breadth, which may be term'd a Garden, in regard that on each side of the Alley in the middle, which is pav'd, there are several square Beds of Flowers; yellow Jasmin, and other Plants; which are rail'd in by a Rail that runs all the length of the Alley on each side. It is not an easie thing for the Christians to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106224:30"/>
get in to this Court, especially such whose Habits and Aspect they do not like: But as I cloth'd and carry'd my self, I never was deny'd entrance into any place either in <hi>Persia</hi> or <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this first Court, on the left hand as you enter, are little Chambers, where they that receive the Alms which by the Foundation of the <hi>Mosquee</hi> are to be distributed every day, come and eat their proportion, and then go their ways. Those Chambers serve as an <hi>Asylum</hi> to those that cannot pay their Debts, as at the <hi>Mosquee</hi> of <hi>Ardeüil.</hi> Neither are these Priviledg'd places like ours, where they that retire must live at their own Charge: For in <hi>Persia</hi> they are fed at the Expence of the <hi>Mosquee;</hi> and being in that manner freed from Care, their Friends more easily bring their Creditors to Composition.</p>
                     <p>Out of the first Court you pass into a second, which is larger, and all pav'd; and from that into a third, which is square, and rais'd like a Terrass. You enter into it through a large Gate, at the end of an open Passage, where stand the Lodgings of the <hi>Moullah's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of that Court by an ascent of Brickwork of ten or twelve Steps, you enter into a fair Court, which is also rais'd like a Terrass; in the midst whereof is a fair Fountain. It is continually fill'd by little Pipes of Water which run into it, and is empty'd by others that carry the Water into several parts of the whole Enclosure. There are some Buildings in this Court, but one of the sides of it is taken up with the Front of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which is no displeasing Structure. There are three large Gates belong to it, very well expanded, according to the mode of the Country; with a Brick-wall before, about the height of a Man, with Holes in it for Light, made like a Lozange. The Threshold of the middle Gate is cover'd with a plate of Silver; and between these three Gates and that of the <hi>Duomo,</hi> are several Doctors, that hold Books in their hands, and read perpetually.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Mosquee</hi> is Octagonal, and at every angle is a small wooden Door of Walnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, varnish'd with grey and yellow. The Tomb of <hi>Sidi-Fatima</hi> is at the farther part of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> there being only room for one Man to pass between the Wall and the Tomb. It is encompass'd with a large Silver Grate, sixteen Foot square; the Bars whereof are round, and knob'd in those places where they cross each other; it is lighted by several Lamps of Gold and Silver: which altogether is very pleasing to the Eye. The inside of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> to the elevation of the Angles that support the <hi>Duomo,</hi> is compos'd of square Tiles varnish'd over with divers Colours; and the <hi>Cupola</hi> of the <hi>Duomo,</hi> as also the Vault of the <hi>Portico</hi> of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> is a <hi>Moresco</hi> piece of Painting in Or and Azure. Upon each side of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> and near the side where the Tomb of <hi>Sidi-Fatima</hi> stands, appears a great Hall, where the Royal Alms are distributed to the Poor, which consist of Pilaw and other diet, very well drest. From this Tomb you turn to the left hand toward an Ascent, distant five and twenty or thirty Paces; and at the top of this Ascent is a Door, over which there an is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in Honour of <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the Second. The Door being open'd, shews you the place where the Body of that King reposes: and through another Door with a Grate in it, you may discover, under a small <hi>Duomo,</hi> the Tomb of <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> his Father; which is cover'd with a Carpet of Cloth of Gold. They were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at work upon the Tomb of <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> which they said, they would make very famous.</p>
                     <p>I had not been two hours in <hi>Kom,</hi> but a multitude of People ran by the Inn Gate, all in extraordinary hast. Asking what the matter was, they answer'd me, that it had been a day long design'd for the two <hi>Prophets</hi> to fight. Thereupon I went to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> which was so crowded, that I had much ado to get to see. In the first place a sufficient number of Tumblers and Puppet-players, divided into two Bands, kept the middle of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and made a sufficient Ring for the Combat. Each Band held a Bull by the Horns, one of which they call'd <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and the other <hi>Haly:</hi> and whether it were by accident, or by the cunning of the Bull-Masters, after an obstinate Combat, wherein the Beasts foam'd again with heat and rage; <hi>Mahomet</hi> at length quit the Field, and yielded <hi>Haly</hi> the Victory. Then all the People shouted for joy, and all the <hi>Piazza</hi> was fill'd with the noise of Flutes and Hautboys; and every one coming as if it were to adore <hi>Haly,</hi> cry'd out, <hi>Behold the Works of God, that</hi> Haly <hi>has made!</hi> At length they bring the Bull <hi>Haly</hi> under a Gate, with his Head turn'd toward the People; where after they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106224:31"/>
have rub'd him to refresh him, after a Combat so courageously maintain'd, every one sends him Presents, which are all the Tumblers profit. The <hi>Kan</hi> or Governour of <hi>Kom,</hi> who was present with a hundred Horses richly trap'd to behold the Sight, sent the Bull a Present of 50 <hi>Tomans,</hi> or 750 Crowns. They who accompany'd him, and the chief Inhabitants of <hi>Kom,</hi> gave him some a Garment, others a Girdle. Neither did the meanest of the People spare to send or carry him Fruits, or other things, according to their abilities.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kan</hi> was a Lord who was very civil, and there was no Stranger that did not commend his behaviour, in regard he was so obliging.</p>
                     <p>So soon as I came to the place, whether it was that he perceiv'd me with a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that I had brought along from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or whether any one had inform'd him that there were Strangers near him, he sent for us, and after he had ask'd us some Questions concerning the occasion of our Travelling, he sent for a Seat and caus'd us to sit down. Then he ask'd us whence we came, and what we did at <hi>Ispahan;</hi> to which when we had answer'd him, that we went to wait upon the King, he approv'd our Intention, complaining that we had not given him advice of our Arrival. In the Evening he sent us several Delicacies, among the rest, six fair Melons, and four Bottles of excellent Wine.</p>
                     <p>He appear'd to me so brave and generous a Person, that I was very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled afterwards for his being in dis-favour with the King, and his death, which ensu'd. For this <hi>Kan</hi> finding the Walls of the City, which were only of Earth, and the Bridge over the River to be out of repair, without writing to the King, of his own head, laid a slight Imposition upon every Basket of Fruit that was brought into the City. Now there are in all the Cities of <hi>Persia,</hi> persons who are hir'd to take an account every Week what the Commodities may be worth, and to take care that no more than such a Toll be laid upon any thing; which they tax among themselves, and when they have set the Rate, they cause it to be cry'd at the beginning of every Week. <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> then reign'd, it being the year 1632. The King being inform'd by these people of the Impost which the <hi>Kan</hi> had set upon Fruit without his knowledge, was so enrag'd against him, that he caus'd him to be brought in Chains to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where he us'd him with a strange severity. For at that time the Son of the <hi>Kan</hi> stood at the King's Elbow, it being his Office to give him his Pipe and his Tobacco, which is a very honourable Employment in <hi>Persia.</hi> When the <hi>Kan</hi> came, the King caus'd him to be carry'd to the Gate of the Palace, in the presence of all the People, and then commanded his Son to pull the Hair of his Father's Mustaches by the roots from his Skin. After that he commanded him to cut off his Nose and his Ears; after that to put out his Eyes, and lastly to cut off his Head. When he had done the Execution according to the King's pleasure, he commanded him to go and take possession of his Father's Government, and allowing him an experienc'd Old Man for his Lieutenant, he sent him to <hi>Kom</hi> with these words; <hi>If thou govern'st no better than this dead Dog has done, I will put thee to a more cruel death than this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Kom,</hi> for four hours you travel over a fair Champain Country, after which you come to a fair Village with five or six Inns in it. Beyond that is nothing but Sand, till you come to a place call'd <hi>Abschirim,</hi> or <hi>Fresh-water,</hi> where there are three Inns at a distance from any Villages. From <hi>Abschirim</hi> to <hi>Cachan</hi> is six hours journey through a Corn Country, and stor'd with great Villages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cachan</hi> is a large City, well peopl'd, and furnish'd with all things necessary for humane subsistance: There is an old Wall about it which is faln down in many places, so that there is no need of seeking for Gates to get into the City. On that side which looks toward <hi>Ispahan</hi> the Soil is good, and produces great store of Fruit and Wine, which the <hi>Jews</hi> take care to make. It is reckon'd that there are in <hi>Cachan</hi> a thousand Families of <hi>Jews;</hi> in <hi>Ispahan</hi> about six hundred; but in <hi>Kom</hi> there are not above nine or ten. Not but that there are many <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> but those that live in <hi>Ispahan, Cachan</hi> and <hi>Kom,</hi> boast themselves particularly of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are an abundance of Silk-Weavers in <hi>Cachan</hi> that are very good Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which make all the best purfl'd Sattins mix'd with Gold and Silver, that come out of <hi>Persia.</hi> There they also coyn Money, and make Copper-vessels, which they vend in great quantities at a good distance off. The Market-houses are very fair
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106224:31"/>
ones, and well vaulted, the Inns large and convenient: but there was one among the rest which was very magnificent, near the King's Gardens, at the entry of the City. As well the Inn as the Gardens were made by the order of <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> the first of that Name, who was at a vast charge. The Inn is above a hundred Paces square, built of Brick two Stories high, containing twenty-six vaulted Chambers of a reasonable bigness. It was a Structure too fair to be so little regarded, as now it is, being much faln to decay. In the middle of the Court was a Fountain to receive Water, which is spoil'd. The <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> are of that bad humor, rather to build new Houses than to repair old Buildings. For which reason they have since built at <hi>Cachan</hi> four or five Inns, as fair and commodious as that of <hi>Sha-Abas.</hi> This Custom is grown to that height, that the Children are so far from taking care to repair the old Houses where their Parents liv'd, that they will not so much as live in them after their decease, covetous of the honour of building Houses for themselves.</p>
                     <p>Before we leave <hi>Cachan</hi> you must take notice, that as you travel from that City to <hi>Guilan</hi> you cannot avoid travelling thorough Plains for twelve hours together, which are all pure Salt; and there is nothing to be met with by the way, but one Cistern; nor can the Water which is in it be otherwise than very bad.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Cachan,</hi> you cross a Plain of three Leagues, after which you enter in among the Mountains, where you come to a very fair Inn of Brick. From thence you descend a pleasant Vale, where you travel a long time by the side of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, over a very narrow way. At the end of the Valley you meet a great Wall, which crosses it, and joyns the two Mountains together. This Wall is above a hundred Paces long, above thirty Foot thick, and fifty high. It was the Work of the Great <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> whose design it was to stop the Waters that fall from the Mountain, and to make a Receptacle for Water in that place, to serve his occasions. At the foot of the Wall there is a Sluce, which being let down keeps in the Water; but is pull'd up to let out the Water over all the neighbouring Lands to the Plain of <hi>Cachan.</hi> From this Receptacle to <hi>Corou,</hi> is about two hours travel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Corou</hi> is a very large Village, and well peopl'd, in a Soil environ'd with high Mountains, and planted with great store of Walnut-trees. The Houses consist but of one low Story, being built of Flint-stones; but the Inn therein is very fair and commodious. This Village consists but of one Street, but it is almost half a League long, and very troublesom in the Winter, by reason of a great River that runs through it, and the great quantity of Stones that lye in the way. All about this Village, as in several other places of <hi>Persia,</hi> there are a great number of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cales;</hi> which are a kind of Foxes, that in the night time make an ugly noise; for if but one cry, all the rest will make answer, and set up a howling.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Corou</hi> you must travel three Leagues between Mountains, after which you have but twelve Leagues to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> It is a continued Plain that extends it self beyond the City, and in many places the Soil is very good. At every three Leagues end you meet with Inns. The first is call'd <hi>Achaha-Agakamala;</hi> the second, which is the half-way between <hi>Corou</hi> and <hi>Ispahan,</hi> is call'd <hi>Michiacour.</hi> This place consists not only of one Inn, for there are many others, so that it resembles a large Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. From <hi>Michiacour</hi> you come to <hi>Aganura,</hi> another Inn, but ill built; and from <hi>Aganura,</hi> after you have travel'd three Leagues through a fat and fertil Country, you come to <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Road from</hi> Smyrna <hi>to</hi> Ispahan, <hi>through</hi> Natolia.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SMyrna</hi> is at this day for Trade, whether it be by Sea or Land, one of the most celebrated Cities of all the <hi>Levant,</hi> and the greatest Market for all sorts of Commodities which are transported out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> or out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Asia.</hi> Hither all the Western Fleets are most regularly bound, that came formerly no farther than <hi>Ligorn,</hi> and from whence, at times most regularly appointed, the fairest <hi>Caravans</hi> set out.</p>
                     <p>This City lyes in 50 Degrees of Longitude; and 38 Degrees, 45 Minutes of Latitude; at the bottom of a Gulf in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which is seven Leagues in length, upon the right side of the <hi>Isthmus</hi> which begins to form the <hi>Peninsula</hi> of <hi>Clazomene,</hi> right against the Iland of <hi>Schio.</hi> It lyes in that part of the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> possess'd, under the Name of <hi>Iconium;</hi> at a distance almost equal, between <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Sardis;</hi> and was one of the seven Churches mention'd in the Revelation of St. <hi>John.</hi> It is at this day a great City, built like an Amphitheater, upon the descent of a Hill that looks toward the Summer-West. But it is neither so great, nor so beautiful as formerly it was, as may be easily conjectur'd by the Ruines of certain Edifices that remain upon that Hill, which from the middle to the top, where the ancient City stood, are altogether uninhabited. There are also to be seen the Walls of a fair Castle, and above that the Ruines of an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater, where they say St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> was expos'd to fight with Lions. This Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater was not in the form of those other, which are usually round; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd but half a Circle, being left open to the Sea-side. The <hi>Turks</hi> have almost quite destroy'd it: making use of the Stones to build a Fort two Leagues from the City, upon the Gulf, where the passage is very narrow; which the Ships are forc'd to salute as they enter in, and to speak with when they sail out. Moreover, that they might not be put to send for Stones a-far off, they consulted whether they might not make use of the Stones of the Christians Monuments, as also of those of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are near the Shore: But they took very few, whether out of kindness to the Tombs, or whether they did not think them so proper for use as the Stones of the Amphitheater. This Castle had not been long built, but upon an occasion very remarkable. In the last Wars of the <hi>Turks</hi> with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet having been beaten in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> resolv'd to re-fit another to Sea, and thereupon sent to all the parts of his Empire, where he knew any <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Vessels usually were wont to ride, to solicit them to serve him for his Pay. More particularly he aim'd at those Vessels which were in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where there were generally more than in any other Port. But the Captains, who rejected his Proposition of fighting against the <hi>Venetians,</hi> believing that he would put some force upon them, suddenly hois'd Sail and got away; it being at a time when he could not keep them in, having no Castle then built to command them. The Grand <hi>Visier</hi> nettl'd at the refusal of the Captains, as an affront done to his Master, and to see that the Ships could come in and go out, without any let or molestation, bethought himself (to the end he might keep them for the future under subjection) of building a Fort upon the Gulf, in such a part where the Vessels must necessarily touch; where now there lye great Cannons level with the Water, which no Vessel can escape. Ever since the Convoys will not come to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as they were wont to do, but lye out at Sea, out of the reach of the Fort.</p>
                     <p>Near to the Sea are yet to be seen some Remains of a Church, two sides whereof seem to have been distinguish'd into Chappels by little Walls, which are yet standing: But the Natives doubt whether they be the Ruines of a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp,</hi> or of an ancient Temple of <hi>Janus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Smyrna</hi> has been oftentimes ruin'd either by the Wars, or by the Earthquakes which often happen there. One time that I staid there, there happen'd one, which did not last long, but was very terrible. About sixty Paces from the Sea are to be discern'd the Ruines of great Walls two Foot under Water; and at the end of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106224:32"/>
City that looks toward the Winter-West, near to the Sea, appear the Ruines of a Mole, and certain ancient Magazins.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>English</hi> Merchants have dig'd among the Ruines of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and have found great store of fair Statues, which they transported into their own Country. There are still found some or other every day; but when the <hi>Turks</hi> find any, they disfigure them presently. It may be conjectur'd, that there was one of a prodigious bigness, by a great Toe broken off of some one, and for which I paid sufficiently, out of the desire I had to buy it. I sent it to <hi>Paris</hi> to a Person of Quality, who look'd upon it as a great Curiosity. This Toe was of a hard white Stone, and well shap'd, and by the proportion whereof, the Figure could not be judg'd to be less than the <hi>Colossus</hi> of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon that side of the City where the Mole was, stands an old Castle of no defence, at the foot whereof the Sea makes a small Creek, where sometimes the Gallies of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> lye.</p>
                     <p>The City is well peopl'd, containing no less than fourscore and ten thousand Souls. There are reckon'd no less than 60000 <hi>Turks,</hi> 15000 <hi>Greeks,</hi> 8000 <hi>Armenians,</hi> and about six or seven thousand <hi>Jews.</hi> As for the <hi>European</hi> Christians that Trade there, their number is very small. Every one of these Nations has the exercise of their Religion free to themselves. The <hi>Turks</hi> have in <hi>Smyrna</hi> fifteen <hi>Mosquees,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> seven Synagogues, the <hi>Armenians</hi> but one Church, the <hi>Greeks</hi> two, and the <hi>Latins</hi> three. There are also <hi>French</hi> Jesuits, and <hi>Italian</hi> Observantins, or a sort of Grey <hi>Franciscans.</hi> The <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> live upon the Hill; but all the lower part toward the Sea is inhabited only by the <hi>European</hi> Christians, <hi>English, French, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> have also in the same Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an old Church, and some few small Houses, where Sea-men make merry.</p>
                     <p>All these different People of <hi>Europe</hi> are generally known in <hi>Smyrna</hi> by the Name of <hi>Franks.</hi> Every Nation has its <hi>Consul:</hi> and the <hi>French Consul</hi> has two <hi>Vice-Consuls</hi> under him; the one at <hi>Scalanova,</hi> the other at <hi>Chio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scalanova,</hi> or the <hi>New Port,</hi> is two Leagues beyond <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and being a good Haven, the Vessels were wont to unlade there; but the <hi>Turks</hi> would not permit it any longer. For that Place being the Dowry of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Mother, the <hi>Vice-Consul</hi> agreed with the Governour of <hi>Scalanova,</hi> who permitted the Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Goods to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which is not above three little days journey with the <hi>Caravan:</hi> A thing that spoil'd the Trade of the City, and injur'd the Officers of the Custom-House. Whereupon they Petition'd the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> that no more Goods might be unladed at <hi>Scalanova:</hi> so that now no more Vessels go thither, unless it be to take in fresh Victuals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chio</hi> is one of the greatest Ilands in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> of which in another place: but the <hi>Vice-Consul</hi> that lives there has no more business there than the other at <hi>Scalanova;</hi> for the Vessels that touch there, neither unlade nor export any Goods from thence.</p>
                     <p>The Quarter of the <hi>Franks</hi> is only a long Street, one side whereof lyes upon the Sea; and as well for the Prospect, as for the convenience of Unlading Goods, the Houses upon the Sea are much dearer than those that lye upon the Hill.</p>
                     <p>The Soil about <hi>Smyrna</hi> is fertil, and abounds in all things necessary for humane support; but particularly in good Oyl and good Wine. There are Salt-Pits also half a League from the City, toward the North. The Sea affords great store of good Fish; Fowl is very cheap; and in a word, <hi>Smyrna</hi> is a place of great plenty. There is a lovely Walk all along the Sea to the Salt-Pits, where generally abundance of People walk in the Summer-time to take the fresh Air: and there being more liberty at <hi>Smyrna</hi> than in any other part of <hi>Turkie,</hi> there is no necessity of taking a <hi>Janisary</hi> along, when a man goes abroad. If a man loves Fowling, it is but taking a Boat, which lands him two or three Leagues from the City, toward the Mountains, where there is so much Game that he can never return empty. For the value of three <hi>Sous</hi> you may buy a red Partridge at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and all other Fowl is proportionably cheap.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Smyrna</hi> have these great advantages, it has also its inconveniences: the Heats are very excessive in Summer, and indeed they would be insupportable, were it not for the Breezes that come off the Sea: these Breezes rise about ten in the Morning, and continue till the Evening; but if they fail, tis very bad for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106224:33"/>
Inhabitants. Besides, there hardly passes a Year but the City is infested with the Plague, which however is not so violent as in Christendom. The <hi>Turks</hi> neither fear it nor flie it, believing altogether in Predestination. Yet I believe, if the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Smyrna</hi> would take care to drain away the standing Puddles that gather in the Winter about the City, they would not be so frequently molested with the Plague as they are. It is most rife in <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> but the malignant Fevers that succeed it in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> are more to be fear'd, more People dying of them than of the Pestilence. In all my Travels I never was in <hi>Smyrna</hi> at these unfortunate Seasons. There is no <hi>Basha</hi> in that City; it being govern'd only by a <hi>Cady,</hi> who is not so severe to the Christians as in other places: For should he abuse his Office, <hi>Constantinople</hi> is at hand, where you may complain to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and have relief; who for some good Present may be easily perswaded to depose the <hi>Cady,</hi> as being glad of the opportunity to displace him, and to put another in his room.</p>
                     <p>The Customs of <hi>Smyrna</hi> yield a great Revenue to the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> being paid there very exactly. But were there a certain Rate put upon Commodities, the Merchants, who would otherwise be losers, would not study so many ways as they do to deceive the Customers: For those Customers lay what Price they please upon Commodities, valuing that at a thousand Crowns, which perhaps is not worth three hundred, being absolute Masters of the Rate. In my last Voyage to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> four <hi>Dutch</hi> Women that went thither in our Ship from their own Country, carry'd a-shoar under their Coats whatever I had of rich Merchandize: for the <hi>Turks</hi> have such a respect for that Sex, that they will not so much as offer to search them. If a man be tak'n in stealing Customs, there is no other punishment than to pay double.</p>
                     <p>The Trade of <hi>Smyrna</hi> is very great, and the principal Merchandizes which the <hi>Franks</hi> transport from thence, are raw Silk, which the <hi>Armenians</hi> bring out of <hi>Persia;</hi> Chamlet-yarn, and Chamlet or Goats-hair, which come from a little City call'd <hi>Angouri,</hi> fifteen or sixteen days journey from <hi>Smyrna;</hi> Cotton twisted; Skins and Cordovans of several colours; Calicuts, white and blew; great quantities of Wool for Mattresses, Tap'stries, quilted Coverlets, Soap, Rhubarb, Galls, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanede, Scammony, and Opium; which four last Commodities are to be had in the Countries near to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but not in great quantities. The <hi>Caravans</hi> come generally to this Town in the Months of <hi>February, June,</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> and depart again to the Countries from whence they came the same Months.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ephesus</hi> not being above a day and a halfs journey from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> on Horse-back I took an opportunity to go thither. There were twelve of us that joyn'd together, <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who took three <hi>Janisaries</hi> along with us, and three Horses to carry our Provision.</p>
                     <p>We travel'd this little Journey in the Summer, and setting out of <hi>Smyrna</hi> about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, we rode through a Country part Plains, and part Hills, till we came to a great Viliage, where we sup'd.</p>
                     <p>After we had staid there three hours, we took Horse and travel'd till Midnight, to avoid the Heats: By the way we met with nine or ten Arches, very narrow; which we could not conjecture to be any thing else than the Ruines of some Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. From thence to <hi>Ephesus</hi> the way is very pleasant, through little Thickets watred with Rivulets.</p>
                     <p>A quarter of a League from <hi>Ephesus</hi> you meet with another <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which was formerly a Christian Church, built out of the Ruines of the Temple of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> This <hi>Mosquee</hi> stands enclos'd with Walls, and you must ascend up to it by two Ascents of twelve Steps a-piece, which bring you to a large Passage. From thence you enter into a large Cloyster, the Arches whereof are sustain'd with Marble Pillars of several co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, delicately wrought; and the lower part of the Gallery, which runs along three of the sides, that consists of great Squares of Stone. The <hi>Mosquee</hi> takes up the fourth side upon the left hand, the Gate being in the middle. The <hi>Mosquee</hi> it self is a wide Arch, supported by five Columns, all of most exquisite Work. There are four of Marble, and every one of a different Colour; but the fifth is a most rare piece, being of Porphyry, and the bigness of it makes it so much the more to be admir'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ephesus</hi> does not look like a City, being so absolutely ruin'd, that there is not a House standing. It was built upon the descent of a Hill, in a situation not much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106224:33"/>
unlike that of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> at the foot whereof runs a Rivulet, after it has made a thousand <hi>Maeanders</hi> in the Meadows. The City seems to have been very large, for you may discern upon the top of the Gates the compass of the Walls, with several square Towers, some of which are still standing: and there is one very remarkable, having two Chambers in it, one of which is a very fair one, the Walls and Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof are Marble.</p>
                     <p>The famous Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> stood at the bottom of the Hill, near one of the Gates of the City. There remains nothing of it at present but the great Portal, which is entire. The Vaults of the Arches under ground stand to this day, and are very large, but all full of nastiness. We went in with Lanthorns; and though you must creep to get in, by reason that the Wind has almost stopt up the Hole, by gathering the Dust about it, yet when you are in, you may go upright; for the Arches are high and fair, and little the worse. Near the Gate lye four or five Columns upon the Ground, and near to that a Fountain, ten Foot in Diameter, and two deep. The People of the Country report, that it was the Fountain wherein St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiz'd the Christians. For my part, as I have seen in the <hi>Indies</hi> several <hi>Pagods</hi> and Edifices much more beautiful than ever the Temple of <hi>Ephesus</hi> could be; I believe it rather to have been a Basin wherein the People put their Offerings, of which there are several such that belong to the <hi>Indian Pagods.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> but above all the <hi>Franks,</hi> when they go to <hi>Ephesus</hi> always endeavour to break off some piece of that Basin, to carry it away with'em as a Relick: but the Stone is so hard, that they can break off but very little at a time.</p>
                     <p>Not far from the Temple appears another Gate of the City, over which there lyes a great Stone seven or eight Foot square, with an emboss'd Figure of <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> that Famous <hi>Roman,</hi> who threw himself, Horse and Arms into the gaping Earth, for the good of his Country. Many Merchants have offer'd Money for liberty to carry it away, but cannot obtain leave. About five hundred Paces from <hi>Ephesus</hi> is the <hi>Grotto</hi> which they call the <hi>Seven Sleepers,</hi> at the bottom of the same Hill where the City was built.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ephesus</hi> we went to <hi>Scalanova,</hi> which is not above two Leagues off. By that time you come half the way, the little River that runs by <hi>Ephesus</hi> falls into the Sea; in the mouth whereof there are always a great number of <hi>Greek</hi> Barks fishing for Sturgeon. Of the Spawn of this Fish they make <hi>Gaveare,</hi> and drive a great Trade in it in those Parts: then they take the most delicate and smallest Entrails of that Fish, which they fill with the same Spawn, of which they make a kind of a flat Pudding, as long as a Bisket, which they call <hi>Botargo.</hi> This they dry in the Smoak, and cut it afterwards in slices to eat. Upon this and the Cuttle-fish the <hi>Greeks</hi> generally feed during their <hi>Lent,</hi> which is very austere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scalanova</hi> is a Port of which I have already spoken, and thither we came by seven a Clock in the Evening; where the Governour of the Place, more civil than usually the <hi>Turks</hi> are accustom'd to be, made us very welcom.</p>
                     <p>In the Evening one of our <hi>Janizaries</hi> had quarrel'd with one of our Servants, who thereupon had beaten him; and therefore he complain'd to the Fellow's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who not giving him that satisfaction which he desir'd, thereupon the <hi>Turk</hi> study'd to be reveng'd upon the whole Company. For this reason, upon some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or other, he went before, the better to bring about his design. We staid till the Morning, and then departed early from <hi>Scalanova,</hi> and by Noon we came with good Stomachs to the <hi>Mosquee</hi> near <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where we had been the day before: And some of the Company thought it a very convenient place to dine in, i'the shade; thereupon we sent for our Provisions, with a Boracho of Wine, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Water, and fell to eating in the Passage into the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> not dreaming any harm. We had not been long at it, when we perceiv'd two or three <hi>Turks</hi> about two hundred Paces off, who came from a Village very near to the <hi>Mosquee.</hi> I knowing the custom of the Country better than they, told them, that they were certainly coming to pick a quarrel with us, and therefore caus'd them to hide the Bottle of Wine immediately; for it was then the <hi>Turks Ramezan,</hi> or <hi>Lent;</hi> during which time Wine is strictly forbidden. These two ill-contriv'd and ill-clad Fellows were the <hi>Janizaries</hi> of the place, whom the <hi>Cadi</hi> had sent, upon the information of our <hi>Janizary</hi> (who knowing we had eaten in the same place before, as indeed we had done, made no question but we would do so again) thinking to surprize us
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106224:34"/>
as we were drinking Wine, in a place which they esteem Sacred, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was among them accounted an act of Sacriledge. <hi>Christian Dogs,</hi> cry'd they, when they came near us, <hi>to eat and drink in a</hi> Mosquee, <hi>and profane a holy place as you do, at a time that renders the offence more criminal! No,</hi> cry'd I, answering for the rest, <hi>we drink no Wine, we drink nothing but Water, and you may tast it,</hi> said I to him that was the most busie; with that I caus'd a Glass to be pour'd out and giv'n him; and I gave one of the <hi>Turks</hi> a private wink, who understanding it was a promise of gratuity, turn'd about to his Comrades, and cry'd, <hi>'Tis very true, they drink no Wine.</hi> However in regard they had Orders to bring us before the <hi>Cady,</hi> there was no contending. Thereupon I and three others undertook to and answer for all the rest. The <hi>Cady</hi> revil'd us as bad as the <hi>Janizary</hi> at first; but he was not only surpriz'd, but very much troubl'd, when they all unanimously affirm'd that we drank no Wine, believing they were confederates with us. But I had cunningly slipt eight Ducats into the Hand of the <hi>Turk</hi> to whom I had made a sign with my Eye, who over-joy'd at so plentiful a gratuity, had over-perswaded his Comrades not to say any thing against us. The <hi>Cady</hi> though he did not like their Testimony, yet call'd for <hi>Coffee</hi> for us, according to the custom of the Country, and sent us to his Lieutenant; who having been often greas'd in the Fist by the <hi>Smyrna-</hi>Merchants, receiv'd us very kindly, and told us that the <hi>Cady</hi> was but newly come to his Place, and was needy; however a small matter would content him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we gave the Lieutenant twenty-five Ducats, who most certainly went snips with the <hi>Cady,</hi> and so return'd us to our Company, who were much afraid we would not have come off so.</p>
                     <p>We were resolv'd to return to <hi>Smyrna</hi> not the same way we came, and so we took another Road, which was a very pleasant way, partly over firm Sands, and partly thorough Meadows, where we met with several narrow Dikes very well Pav'd. Then we cross a rugged high Mountain, and lay in a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Barn.</p>
                     <p>The next day we return'd to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> having finish'd our small Journey to <hi>Ephesus</hi> in five days. When we told the <hi>Consuls</hi> how the <hi>Janizary</hi> had betray'd us, they made their Complaint to the <hi>Janizary Aga</hi> and the <hi>Cady,</hi> who, for his punishment put him out of the <hi>Consul</hi>'s service, which is an advantageous Employment. For besides that the <hi>Consul</hi>'s <hi>Janizaries</hi> are exempt from the Duties of War, they are well plac'd; for there is never a Merchant that is not beneficial to them some way or other; especially at good times, as <hi>New-years-day</hi> and other Festivals. Nor could the <hi>Janizary</hi> have been more severely punish'd; for the <hi>Turks</hi> love Money above all things in the World.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our matter. The Rendezvouz of all the <hi>Caravans</hi> is generally two Leagues from the City, near a Town call'd <hi>Pongarbachi.</hi> The day of their setting out being fix'd, every one provides himself for his Journey, and meets the Evening before at the place appointed, to be ready at the hour.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Tocat,</hi> is thirty-five days journey with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> and the last time I went we made it thirty-eight from <hi>Pongarbachi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first day we travel'd eight hours through a Country whose prospect was not unpleasing, leaving some Villages more than a League from the Road; and we lodg'd in a Park, near the River <hi>Pactolus;</hi> which is a small River, the Sand whereof shines, and is of several colours. Which caus'd Antiquity to call <hi>Pactolus</hi> Golden-Sanded. It falls from the Mountain <hi>Tinolus,</hi> and after it has water'd the Territory of <hi>Sardis,</hi> mixes with the River <hi>Hermus,</hi> that throws itself into the <hi>Archipelago</hi> through the Gulf of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> The Mouth of it is not above two or three Leagues from the City, toward the North.</p>
                     <p>The next day in six hours we came to <hi>Durgout,</hi> a little City in a Plain. All Christians that live not in the Territories of the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> and pass that way, once a Year pay <hi>Carrage,</hi> or a Tribute of four or five Crowns: but the <hi>Franks</hi> are exempt, both at <hi>Durgout</hi> and over all <hi>Turkie.</hi> There resides a <hi>Basha</hi> in this City; and we were constrain'd to stop there a whole day, because the <hi>Caravan</hi> that comes from <hi>Persia</hi> arriv'd at that time, so that they were forc'd to change their Camels.</p>
                     <p>The third day, after five hours travel in extremity of Heat, we came to lodge near a paltry Village.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106224:34"/>
The fourth day we travel'd six hours, and stop'd near to a small River. In the Morning we pass'd over the Ruines of the ancient <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and Seat of King <hi>Croesus.</hi> There were still to be seen the Ruines of a large Palace and two fair Churches, with a great number of Pillars and Corniches of Marble. This City having held out six Years against the Army of <hi>Temur-leng,</hi> who besieg'd it; so soon as he had taken it, in revenge he utterly destroy'd it. There is a Village near <hi>Sardis</hi> of the same Name, where stood the City, which was one of the Seven Churches mention'd in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> The fifth day we rode for seven hours through a Country but ill manur'd, and took up our Stage in a Plain upon the side of a River.</p>
                     <p>The sixth day we pass'd by the Walls of the ancient <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> call'd at present <hi>Allachars,</hi> which was also one of the Seven Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi> There is something of Beauty still remaining in those Walls, and the City is very large, but ill peopl'd. It is situated upon four little Hills, at the foot of a high Mountain over-looking a fair Plain to the North, that produces excellent Fruit. To witness its Antiquity, there is yet the Ruines of an Amphitheater, with certain Sepulchers, from whence the Inhabitants report that the <hi>European</hi> Christians took out the Bodies that were buried there, and transported them into <hi>Europe,</hi> believing them to be the Bodies of Saints. It is now all destroy'd, but re-built of Earth by the <hi>Turks</hi> after their mode. It was formerly one of the principal Cities of <hi>Mysia,</hi> and in regard it was alway very subject to Earthquakes, the most part of her Inhabitants liv'd in the Country. The last time I travel'd that way, in the year 1664, the seventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> were feasting and rejoycing upon the News, as they said, which they had receiv'd, of the defeat of the Christians in <hi>Candy.</hi> But the News was false, and only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd to encourage the People; for the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> was then making Levies in those Parts. We lodg'd that day, after seven hours travel, upon the Bank of a small River, a League and a half from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The seventh day we travel'd eleven hours over a Mountain, where those Trees plentifully grow that bear Galls, and Valanede, which is the shell or rind of an Acorn, that Curriers make use of to dress their Leather. We lodg'd in a Meadow on the top of a Mountain which is call'd <hi>Ijagli-bogase,</hi> or, <hi>The Mountain of Robbers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eighth day we continu'd our Journey over the same Mountain, which is a very barren Country where there is no Provision to be had. We travel'd but six hours, and lodg'd near a River in a Plain call'd <hi>Sarrouc abaqui.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ninth day the <hi>Caravan</hi> travel'd thorough dry Lands, where there is not one Village to be seen, and lodg'd near a Bridge built over a River call'd <hi>Copli-sou,</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Inahi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The tenth day, after we had travel'd eight hours over an uneven and barren Country, we stopt in a Valley near a River call'd <hi>Bana-sou,</hi> the Water whereof is not good. In the Night there arose a Tempest that put us all in a disorder, and the Rain that fell was as cold as is it had been in the depth of Winter. We were wet to the Skins, and were forc'd to throw Coverlets over the Bales to keep the Goods from being spoyl'd.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh day we travel'd through a pleasant Country, between Vales adorn'd with a most delightful Verdure; and we were in view as we pass'd along of certain hot Baths, though very little regarded. We lodg'd upon the Banks of a small River, by the side whereof we had travel'd for some hours.</p>
                     <p>The twelfth day we continu'd our Road for six hours between the same Vallies, and lodg'd by a River.</p>
                     <p>The thirteenth day we travel'd eight hours, and stop'd near to a Village in a Country call'd <hi>Doüagasse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourteenth, after a Journey of seven hours we pass'd by the Walls of <hi>Aphiom-Carassar,</hi> that is, <hi>The Black City of Aphiom</hi> or <hi>Opium;</hi> because it has a Prospect over a fair and large Country well cultivated, where they sow great store of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, whence they draw their <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Aphiom,</hi> as the <hi>Turks</hi> call it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aphiom-Carassar</hi> is a great City, dirty and ill built, the ancient Name whereof I could never learn, for the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> are very ignorant. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all probability and the situation of the place, it ought to be the ancient <hi>Hierapolis</hi> situated upon the <hi>Maeander,</hi> a famous River of the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106224:35"/>
winds and turns the most of any River in the World. And indeed we are the more to seek, in regard the <hi>Turks</hi> change the ancient Names according to their own custom and pleasure, and give no other Names to Rivers than that of the principal City through which they pass; or else deriving their Names from the Colour of their Sands. There is to be seen in that City an ancient Castle of Free-stone upon the Point of a high Rock, separated from the Mountains that are next it toward the South, which make a Semicircle. All the <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians, Subjects to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> passing thorough <hi>Aphiom-Carassar</hi> must there pay <hi>Carage,</hi> from which they are not exempted, though they have paid it before at <hi>Erzerom</hi> or elsewhere. The <hi>Caravan</hi> does not stop at <hi>Aphiom-Carassar,</hi> as well for that there are no Inns but what are ruin'd, as for that about a League farther there is a place where you have excellent Fish, and very cheap, and they of the City bring Barley, Straw, and other things which the <hi>Caravan</hi> wants. The <hi>Caravan</hi> therefore that day lodges upon the Banks of <hi>Maeander,</hi> which is to be cross'd over a Bridge not far distant from a small Village. In this River are great store of Crawfish and Carps; and the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will be sure to attend upon the <hi>Caravan.</hi> I have seen some Carps there above three Foot long.</p>
                     <p>The fifteenth our <hi>Caravan</hi> began to part it self, some for <hi>Tocat,</hi> some for the Road to <hi>Aleppo;</hi> the one part taking the right-hand Road toward the Winter-East, for <hi>Syria;</hi> the other the left-hand Road North-East, for <hi>Armenia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After we were parted, we travel'd two or three hours in sight of one another. They that go to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> fall into <hi>Tarsus,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> was born, and from <hi>Tarsus</hi> to <hi>Alexandretta.</hi> But we continu'd our Road to <hi>Tocat,</hi> and after we had cross'd a great Plain, having travel'd six hours, we lodg'd in a Mershy place near a small Village. There is one thing remarkable in this Road as in many others, which manifests the Charity of the <hi>Turks.</hi> For in most of the high Roads, that are far from Rivers, they have set up Cisterns, whither when the Rains fail, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Villages bring Water for the Travellers, who would else be very much distress'd.</p>
                     <p>The sixteenth we travel'd eight hours through a very even Country, but ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd; where we saw a little City call'd <hi>Boulavandi.</hi> There are some <hi>Mosquees,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> have built out of the Ruines of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, from which they have taken Pillars of Marble, and other pieces of Architecture, to adorn their Sepulchers without any order at all, which you meet with very often upon the high Roads; the number is the greater, because they never lay two Bodies in one Grave. There is also in this City an Inn, cover'd with Lead, which is all the Beauty of it; nor do Travellers make any use of it but only in foul weather. We lodg'd a League and a half from the City, and staid there all the next day.</p>
                     <p>The seventeenth we travel'd eleven hours through a mix'd and uneven Country, and came to lodge in a Village where there are not above three or four Houses, though there be excellent Pasturage about it. There is no Water, but what is drawn out of three deep Wells; for which reason the place is call'd <hi>Euche-derin-giu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eighteenth we travel'd not above five hours through desert Countries, and took up our Stage in a kind of a Bog, near a pitiful Village.</p>
                     <p>The nineteenth, after we had travel'd eight hours through spacious desert Plains, we pass'd through a large Village, the Inhabitants whereof were gone with their Cattel into the Mountains, for the cool Air, during the Summer time, according to custom. There is an indifferent handsom <hi>Mosquee</hi> of Free-stone; and indeed the Village, the Name whereof the People told me was <hi>Tshaciclou,</hi> has been much bigger than now it is, as may appear by the Ruines. In two hours after we came to lodge beyond it in a Meadow, near a Rivulet.</p>
                     <p>The twentieth we cross'd over desert Plains, but which seem'd to have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly well manur'd; and after ten hours travel, we stop'd in a Bottom near a bad Water.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-first, for ten hours the Country was all barren and desert, and we came to lodge at the end of a long Plain, near two Wells, the Water whereof was good for nothing.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-second we travel'd through the fore-mention'd Plain, and met with little Valleys where there was very good Pasturage. The <hi>Caravan</hi> stop'd near to a pitiful Village, and a nasty Well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106224:35"/>
The twenty-third we travel'd not above five hours; because it was the time of the <hi>Turks Beiram,</hi> or <hi>Easter,</hi> which our <hi>Caravan,</hi> consisting of <hi>Turks,</hi> would needs solemnize. That day we travel'd through an indifferent good Country, and well till'd, where we discover'd several fair Villages; and we lodg'd upon a rising Ground, from whence we had a very fair and far distant Prospect.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fourth we travel'd six hours, and came to lodge in a Meadow where the Water was bad. Near to that place, we discover'd a Plain that extends it self eight or ten Leagues in length, though it be not above one or two in bredth: it seem'd like a Lake; and indeed it is only a salt Water congeal'd, and thickn'd into Salt, which you can hardly dissolve but in fair Water. This Lake furnishes almost all <hi>Natolia</hi> with Salt; where you may buy a Wagon-load drawn by two <hi>Bufalo's</hi> for 45 Sous. It is call'd <hi>Deuslag,</hi> or <hi>The Place for Salt;</hi> and the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Coushahar,</hi> about two days journey from it, gets by it 24000 Crowns a Year. <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> caus'd a Dike to be cut quite thorough it when his Army march'd to the Siege of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> which he took from the <hi>Persian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-fifth we travel'd nine or ten hours, and met not with one Village, the Country being all desert. We lodg'd upon a rising Ground, near a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain call'd <hi>Cara-dache-cesmé,</hi> or, <hi>The Fountain of the Black Stone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-sixth we pass'd through a great Village call'd <hi>Tshekenagar,</hi> in a pleasant situation, but very ill built; and after we had travel'd eight hours, we came to lodge in a delightful Meadow, near another Village call'd <hi>Romcouché.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-seventh we travel'd nine hours through Countries full of Licorice, and having pass'd a great Town call'd <hi>Beserguenlou,</hi> we lodg'd in a Meadow.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-eighth we cross'd a great River, call'd <hi>Jechil-irma,</hi> over a long well built stone Bridge. At the end of the Bridge call'd <hi>Kessré-kupri</hi> stands a great Village, wherein the greatest part of the Houses are built under Ground, like Foxes Holes. We put on farther, and after seven hours travel, we lodg'd below another great Village call'd <hi>Mouchiour,</hi> where there are abundance of <hi>Greeks,</hi> which they constrain ever and anon to turn <hi>Turks.</hi> The Country being inhabited by Christians, and fit for the Plantation of Vines, there is Wine good store, and very good, but it has the scent of the Wines of <hi>Anjou.</hi> The Village is well situated but ill built, most of the Houses being under Ground, in so much that one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany riding carelesly, had like to have faln into a House.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-ninth we rode for seven hours through a pleasant Country, where we saw several Villages; near to one of which the <hi>Caravan</hi> lodg'd in a Meadow, close by a Fountain.</p>
                     <p>The thirtieth we rode through a flat Country, well manur'd, and stop'd near a River wherein there was but very little Water: it is call'd <hi>Cara-sou,</hi> or, <hi>The Black River.</hi> For two or three days together, at every two Leagues distance we observ'd little Hillocks of Earth artificially rear'd, which they told us were rais'd during the the Wars of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to build Forts upon, for Watch-Towers.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-first we travel'd a very uneven Country, but abounding in Wheat, and after we had travel'd nine hours, we lodg'd in a Meadow near a River, which we cross'd next Morning before day, over a stone Bridge.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-second, after we had travel'd eight hours, we lodg'd by a River, where we saw a great number of <hi>Turcomans:</hi> They are a People that live in Tents like the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and they were then leaving that Country to go to another, having their luggage in Wagons drawn by <hi>Bufalo's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The thirty-second we met again with Mountains and Woods, which we had not seen in 18 days before, which had constrain'd us to carry Wood upon our Camels to dress our Provision: We were very sparing of it, and sometimes made use of dry'd Cows dung or Camels dung, when we came near the Waters where they were wont to drink. We travel'd eight hours that day, and lodg'd in a Meadow where the Grass was very high, yet where there had been Houses formerly standing.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-fourth we forded a deep and rapid River call'd <hi>Jangou,</hi> from the Name of the Town next to it. A little above the place where we forded it, we saw a ruin'd Bridge, which had been built over it.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-fifth we travel'd eight hours through a fair Valley well manur'd, and upon the left hand we left a Castle rais'd upon a Rock. The <hi>Caravan</hi> lay that night upon a rising Ground near a Village.</p>

The thirty-sixth we travel'd through the same Valley for eight or nine hours longer; in this Valley were several pleasant Villages, but we lay by a small Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-seventh we travel'd six hours among the Mountains, where there are some very narrow Passages, but store of Water; and we lay in a Vale abounding in Pasturage.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-eighth we rode for four or five hours over a rugged Mountain in craggy way, at the foot whereof we met with a Village call'd <hi>Taquibac;</hi> from whence it is but five Leagues to <hi>Tocat.</hi> And these are all the Roads from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> through the Northern Territories of <hi>Turkie.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How the Author was robb'd near <hi>Tocat,</hi> and of a certain sort of rare and fine Wool which he first brought into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>TAquibac</hi> is the place where the <hi>Persian Caravan</hi> uses to meet, when it departs from <hi>Tocat</hi> to <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and this is the only place in all the Road where a Traveller ought to stand upon his guard; by reason of Thieves who haunt these Quarters, and are great Masters in their Trade. Once as I came out of <hi>Persia</hi> they would needs give me a tast of their Art, notwithstanding all the care I took. There were three or four of us that would needs ride before with our Servants to <hi>Taquibac,</hi> in expectation of the <hi>Caravan</hi> which was to come the next day; where we set up our Tents upon the Bank of a small River. I had then a good many Bales of Wool, with which I made as it were a double Wall about my Tent: so that there was but one passage between the Bales, for one Man. In four of these Bales I had a quantity of Musk in lead'n Boxes, to the value of ten or twelve thousand Crowns: which Bales I put within-side, so that they touch'd the Tent and my Beds-head. Next Night, it being very dark, the Thieves came, and finding the outward Bales smell so strong of Musk, they thought one of those Bales would be a considerable Booty. The Bales were all ty'd together with a Cord that kept them fast; nor was it easie to undo them, without a noise. They wak'd me with their bustle at first, and I sent out my Servants to see if they could catch them; but they will lye so close upon their Bellies, that in such a dark Night as that was tis impossible to discover them. Thereupon my Servants went to sleep again, and the Thieves to their work; and having with a great deal of ingenuity cut the Cord, they carried away the two Bales. In the Morning four or five of us with a Camel-driver for our Guide pursu'd them, and in half an hour we met with the marks of the Robbery; for the Rogues being mad that they found nothing but Wool, which they thought to be of no great value, scatter'd it in the High-way for two or three Leagues together: so that I caus'd it to be pickt up again, and lost not above fifteen or twenty Pound, I speak this to caution the Merchants that carry Bales of Silk or other rich Commodities, to beware of these Thieves; for they will come creeping upon their Bellies, and then cutting the Bales with great Razors, will presently empty a Bale of one half of the Goods.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the Wool was of no great value for their use; but it was a sort of rare and very fine Wool, which I carry'd out of <hi>Persia</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> where such fine Wool was never seen. As to the place where it is to be had, I met with one of the <hi>Gaures,</hi> or <hi>Persians</hi> that adore the Fire, who when I was at <hi>Ispahan</hi> in the year 1647 shew'd me a Sample of it, and inform'd me that the greatest part of this Wool comes from the Province of <hi>Kerman,</hi> which is the ancient <hi>Caramania;</hi> and that the best Wool is to be met with in the Mountains that are next to the City that bears the name of the Province: That the Sheep in those Parts have this particular property, that when they have fed upon new Grass from <hi>January</hi> till <hi>May,</hi> the Fleece falls off, of it self, and leaves the Sheep naked, and their Skins smooth, like a Pig's that is scalded off; so that there is no need of shearing them, as with us: after they have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106224:36"/>
gather'd it, they beat it, and the course Wool breaking, the fine only remains. That if you transport it, before you make it into Bales, you must throw Salt-water upon it, which keeps the Worms out of it, and preserves it from rotting. Now you must take notice that they never dye this Wool, it being naturally of a clear Brown, or a dark Ash-colour; and that there is very little of it White, which is also much dearer than the other, as well for that it is scarce, as because that the <hi>Mufti's,</hi> the <hi>Moullah's</hi> and other persons belonging to the Law, never wear any Girdles or Vails (wherewith they cover their Heads when they pray) but White: for at other times they wear them about their Necks, as the Women do their Scarfs.</p>
                     <p>Into this Province of <hi>Kerman</hi> almost all the <hi>Gaures</hi> are retir'd, and they are they that only Trade in this Wool, and have the whole Manufacture of it. They make those Girdles of it which they use in <hi>Persia;</hi> and some Pieces of Serge, which are almost as fine and transparent, as if they were of Silk. I brought over two Pieces into <hi>France,</hi> and presented one to the late Queen Mother, the other to the Princess of <hi>Orleance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could not drive any Trade in this Wool till the year 1654, returning out of the <hi>Indies</hi> by Sea from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Ormus.</hi> To which purpose, I departed from <hi>Ormus,</hi> and took Guides along with me to shew me the way to <hi>Kerman,</hi> whither I could not get on Horseback in less than twenty-seven days. I dare say that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did not march this way into the <hi>Indies:</hi> for in the whole extent of the the Country there is no Water to be met with but in some certain places, and in the hollow of some Rocks, where there is not enough neither to water eight or ten Horses. Besides, in some places a man is constrain'd, by reason of the Mountains, to fetch a great compass about; for a Foot-man that makes his way through those Rocks, shall go farther in half an hour than a Horse-man can do in four.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kerman</hi> is a large City, which has been often ruin'd by being several times taken and re-taken; nor is there any thing handsom in it, but only one House and a Garden, upon which the last <hi>Kans</hi> have bestow'd a vast expence to make the place delightful. They make there a sort of Earthen-ware which comes very near to <hi>Porcelan,</hi> and looks as neat and as fine. As soon as I arriv'd, I went to visit the <hi>Kan,</hi> who made me very welcom, and gave order to the <hi>Gaures</hi> to furnish me with Bread and Wine, Pullets and Pigeons, which in those parts are fat, and as large as little Capons. The <hi>Gaures</hi> are they that make the Wine; and to make it more sweet and pleasant, they take away the Stalks, and never press any thing but the meer Grape.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kan</hi> was but newly entred into the possession of his Government, and being desirous, according to the custom of the new Governours, to have a noble Sword and Dagger, with a rich Furniture for his Horse, which requir'd some Jewels, I presented him with a Diamond worth eight hundred Crowns, which he caus'd to be set in the end of the handle of his Dagger. He also desir'd to have of me as many more Jewels as came to seven or eight hundred Livres: and by the Present and the Bargain I facilitated my purchase of the Wool which I intended to buy. Two days after he invited me to his Entry-Feast, which he made for the chief of the City; and knowing I wanted a Mule, he sent me one well worth a hundred Crowns. This is the Noblest Carriage in all <hi>Persia,</hi> which the great Personages choose before Horses, especially when they are in years. But it was not the <hi>Kan</hi> alone who was civil to me. A young Lord, who liv'd in <hi>Kerman,</hi> and was at the Feast, whose Father had been formerly <hi>Kan</hi> himself, took great delight to discourse with me concerning my Travels; and offer'd me his service in a very obliging manner. Now the <hi>Persians</hi> are very curious, and great admirers of the Rarities of Forein Countries: which inclination led the young Lord to enquire of me whether I had any Fire-Arms, telling me he would content me for them to my satisfaction. The next Morning I presented him with a Carbine, and a pair of Pistols that pleas'd him exceedingly; and a little Watch, for which I would take no Money, whereat he seem'd to be not a little troubl'd. However he sent me a stately Horse worth about two hundred Crowns, or twelve <hi>Tomans.</hi> This young Lord was of a clear humour, civil, accomplish'd, generous, and did every thing with a good grace. So that when he sent me the Horse, he sent to entreat me withal, if I did not like that Horse, to come and choose which I lik'd best in his Stable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106224:37"/>
By the favour of this Lord and the <hi>Kan,</hi> I made good the Purchase that I intended. For the People began to murmur (knowing what a Parcel I had got together) and told the <hi>Kan</hi> that I would carry away all the Cloth out of the Country, so that they should have none to set the Poor on work. Thereupon the <hi>Kan</hi> sent for me, and for those reasons told me I must buy no more. To send off the blow, I made answer, That it was the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s desire to try if we could make as fine Cloth of his Wool in <hi>France,</hi> as they did in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and that if it succeeded, I should bring <hi>French</hi> Workmen into <hi>Persia,</hi> and so by setling the Trade in his own Country, free him from the Charge of forein Manufactures. This silenc'd the <hi>Kan,</hi> so that I still bargain'd for more. But when I was return'd to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> the People of the Country would not keep touch with me. However, I wrote so home to the <hi>Kan,</hi> threatning withal to complain to the King, that he fearing the King's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, forc'd the Natives to send me my Bargain to <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>FRom <hi>Kerman</hi> to <hi>Ispahan</hi> is no less than five and twenty days on Horseback. In those places where there is any Water, the Country is very good; but those places are very rare; for the Road is generally Sandy, and offensive to the Eyes. The chiefest comfort to a Traveller is, that every Evening he meets with an Inn, where there are Cisterns, which is a great refreshment in those desert Countries. The most part of those Inns were built some Years since by the special care of <hi>Mahomet-Ali-Beg, Nazar,</hi> or Grand Master of the King's House and Treasury; a Person the most Virtuous of any that <hi>Persia</hi> can boast of for many Years. He was Generous, and favour'd the <hi>Franks</hi> in all things, for he lov'd them exceedingly. He faithfully serv'd his King, and defended the People against the Oppression and Insolencies of the Great ones; which drew upon him the hatred of many: but still he preserv'd himself by his sincerity and prudence; as by the following Story will remarkably appear.</p>
                     <p>The Great <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the First, being one day a Hunting in the Mountains far out of sight from his followers, met a young Lad playing upon a Pipe by an Herd of Goats. The King asking him some Questions, he answer'd him to the purpose to every one, not knowing who he was. The King surpriz'd at his Reparti's, made a sign to <hi>Iman-couli-Kan</hi> Governour of <hi>Schiras,</hi> who was just come up to him, not to tell the Goat-herd who he was. After that he proceeded to ask him other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions; to which the young Man answer'd so smartly, that the King could not choose but stand in an amaze. Thereupon the King ask'd the <hi>Kan</hi> what he thought of the Goat-herds Wit? Who answer'd, that he believ'd if the Boy were taught to Write and Read, he might do good service to his Majesty. Upon that the King immediately caus'd him to be sent to School, where the young Lad being naturally of a solid Wit, clear Judgment, and happy Memory, grew so accomplish'd, and so well acquitted himself of several Employments which his Majesty bestow'd upon him, that the King advanc'd him to the Office of <hi>Nazar,</hi> or Grand Master of the House, and did him the Honour to call him <hi>Mahomet-Ali-Beg.</hi> The King ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his fidelity, and good management of all things, sent him twice Ambassador to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and both times was extremely pleas'd with his Negotiation. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> lov'd Justice, and would not stoop to be corrupted by Presents: A thing which is very rare among the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> This great Integrity of his made all the Lords of the Court his Enemies, especially the Eunuchs and the Women, who have always the King's Ear. But while <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> liv'd, there was no person that durst open his lips against the <hi>Nazar,</hi> so much was he in favour, and that justly, with the King. <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> succeeding his Grandfather <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> and being very young, the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Adversaries thought they had now a fair Game to play. Thereupon the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106224:37"/>
Eunuchs, who are always at the King's Ear, suggested to him many things to the disadvantage of the Grand Master; but whatever they said, the King gave little heed to their Tales. At length, one day when the King was looking upon certain Skains and Daggers set with precious Stones, one of the Eunuchs told him those were trifles, and then desir'd his Majesty to send for a Scimitar that the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> had sent <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> all over set with Diamonds. True it is, that the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> had sent a rich Scimitar to <hi>Sha-Abas;</hi> but <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> had defac'd it long before <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s time, and had made a noble Jewel of the Stones that adorn'd it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this Scimitar was sought for in the Treasury, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> was chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; but not being to be found, the King was troubl'd, finding it registred in the Book of Presents. Then certain Eunuchs and Grandees of the Court took their opportunity to rip up <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Life; they represented to the King how many Inns, Bridges, and Dikes <hi>Mahomet</hi> had built at his own charge; what a House he had rear'd for himself, fitting for his Majesty to live in: and aggravated withal, that he could not do such great things as those, without purloining notably from the Publick Stock; for which he should do well to call him to an account. As they were thus discoursing, <hi>Mahomet</hi> came into the Presence, to whom the King (not receiving him as he was wont to do) spoke some hard words about the Scimitar that could not be found: telling him withal, that he would see if all the rest of the things in the Treasury were agreeable to the Register, and then gave him fifteen days time to give in his Account. <hi>Mahomet</hi> not at all mov'd, reply'd to the King, that if his Majesty pleas'd he might come to the Treasury to morrow: and withal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him so to do, though the King a second time gave him fifteen days. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King did go to the Treasury next morning, according to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s desire, and found all things in good order; having heard before what became of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar. From thence he went to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s House, who made the King a mean Present: For it is the custom, that he whom the King honours with a Visit, must make a Present to his Majesty. After the King had receiv'd it, he walk'd up and down, and view'd the Chambers, Halls, Parlours and Rooms of State; and wonder'd to see them so ill set out with plain Felts, and course Carpets; whereas in other Lords Houses a man could not set his Foot upon any thing but Cloth of Gold and Silk. For the King, as they had set the <hi>Nazar</hi> out, expected to have found other things; which made him admire at so great a Moderation in so high a degree of Honour. Now at the end of a Gallery there was a Door lockt with three great Padlocks. Of this the King took no notice: whereupon the <hi>Meter,</hi> who is the White Eunuch, and chief of his Chamber, as he came back, shew'd the King the Door that was so strongly Padlock'd; which made the King curious to have it open'd: withal, asking <hi>Mahomet</hi> what he had got there lock'd up with so much care? Oh Sir, said he, it behoves me to keep that lockt, for there is all the Estate I have in the World. All that your Majesty has seen in this House is yours, but all that is in that Chamber is mine, and I dare assure my self, your Majesty will be so gracious as never to take it from me. Those words inflam'd the King's curiosity so, that he commanded the Door to be open'd: But he was strangely surpriz'd, when he saw nothing more within than <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sheep-hook, that lay upon two Nails, his Scrip wherein he us'd to put his Victuals, his Bottle for his Water, his Pipe, and his Shepherd's Weeds, all hanging against the Wall. The <hi>Nazar</hi> beholding the King's astonishment at such a Sight, Sir, said he, when the King <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> found me in the Mountain keeping Goats, then that was all I had, and he took nothing from me: I beseech your Majesty that you would not deprive me of these things neither; but rather, if you please, let me resume them again, and fall to my old Calling. The King touch'd at so high a piece of Virtuo, caus'd himself to be disapparel'd, and gave his Habit to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> which is the greatest Honour that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> can bestow upon a Subject. Thus <hi>Mahomet</hi> continu'd, and dy'd honourably in his Employment. This brave Person was the Protector of all the <hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Persia:</hi> and if any one had done them wrong, upon complaint he did them Justice immediately. One day as I was shooting Ducks, upon the River of <hi>Ispahan</hi> near the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Gardens, with two Servants, some of the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s people that did not know me set upon me, and would have taken away my Gun; which I would not let go till I had broke the Stock about the Shoulders of the one, and flung the Barrel at the other's Head. Thereupon I took some of the <hi>Franks</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106224:38"/>
along with me, and complain'd to the <hi>Nazar:</hi> He testifi'd his sorrow for what had happen'd, and gave us evident Proofs thereof, by the blows which he caus'd to be laid upon those that had done me the injury.</p>
                     <p>Another time, <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> being upon his return from <hi>Guilan,</hi> his Tents were set up near <hi>Zulfa</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> where the King staid to hunt two or three days. Now among the rest of the Courtizans that follow'd the Court, to divertise the King with Dancing and Mummery, there was one who was perfectly handsom, to whom the King had already sent Presents; which could not be unknown to any Lord i'the Court. But the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Son, for all that, being in the heat of Youth, got this Courtizan to his Tent, and there lay with her: which came to his Father's Ears next day. The <hi>Nazar,</hi> whether out of his zeal to the Ring, or whether it were an effect of his prudence to prevent the King's anger, which would have certainly been the death of his Son, caus'd him to be drub'd, after the manner of the Country, and bastinado'd all over, till the Nails of his Toes dropt off, and that his Body was almost a perfect Gelly. Which when the King understood, together with the Young Man's Crime, he said no more, but that the <hi>Nazar</hi> had done wisely by punishing his Son himself, to prevent his Justice.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Road from <hi>Kerman</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> The first day that I set out from <hi>Kerman,</hi> at my Stage in the Evening I met with a rich <hi>Moullah,</hi> who seeing I had Wine, civilly offer'd me some of his Ice to cool it. In retaliation, I gave him some of my Bottle. He invited me to his House, which was well built, with a handsom Garden with Water in it. He entertain'd me with Spoon-meat, according to the mode of the Country; and when I took my leave, he fill'd my <hi>Boracho</hi> with very good Wine.</p>
                     <p>The following days I saw nothing worthy observation; the Country being as I have already describ'd it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yezd</hi> lyes in the Road, almost in the mid-way between <hi>Kerman</hi> and <hi>Ispahan,</hi> in 93 Deg. 15 Min. of Longitude, and 13 Deg. 45 Min. of Latitude. It is a great Town in the middle of the Sands, that extend themselves for two Leagues round it: so that when you leave <hi>Yezd</hi> you must take a Guide, for upon the least Wind the Sand covers the Highway, whereby a man may be apt to fall into Holes, which seem to have been either old Cisterns, or the Ruines of ancient Buildings. Between the Town and the Sands there is a little good Soil, which produces excellent Fruits, but above all, Melons of several sorts: the Pulp of some is green, of others yellow and vermilion; and some there are, the meat whereof is as hard as a Renneting. There are also very good Grapes, and good Wine; but the Governour will not permit the Inhabitants to make Wine. Some therefore they dry, and of the rest they make a kind of Confection to cat with Bread. There are also abundance of Figs, which are large and well tasted. They distil vast quantities of Rose-water, and another sort of Water with which they dye their Hands and Nails red, which they squeeze out of a certain Root call'd <hi>Hina.</hi> There are three Inns i'th' City, and several <hi>Bazars</hi> or Market-places cover'd and vaulted, which are full of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Workmens Ware-houses. They also make at <hi>Yezd</hi> several Stuffs of Silk intermix'd with Gold and Silver, which they call <hi>Zerbaste;</hi> and another sort of Stuff of all pure Silk, call'd <hi>Daraï,</hi> like our smooth strip'd Taffata's. Other Stuffs they make, half Silk half Cotton; others all of Cotton, like our Fustians. They make also Serges of a particular Wool, which is so fine and delicate, that it looks hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer, and is much better than Silk.</p>
                     <p>Though I had nothing to do, I staid in <hi>Yezd</hi> three days, because I met with some <hi>Armenians</hi> of my acquaintance. In which time I found the general Opinion to be true. For certainly the Women of <hi>Yezd</hi> are the handsomest Women in all <hi>Persia.</hi> There is no Feast made, but five or six of them come to divertise the Guests with Dancing, who are generally none of the meanest Beauties and Conversations among them. However it comes to pass, the <hi>Persian</hi> Proverb is, <hi>That to live happy, a Man must have a Wife of</hi> Yezd, <hi>cat the Bread of</hi> Yezdecas, <hi>and drink the Wine of</hi> Schiras.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Caravansera's</hi> are the Eastern Inns, far different from ours; for they are neither so convenient, nor so handsom. They are built square, much like Cloysters, being usually but one Story high; for it is rare to see one of two Stories. A wide Gate brings ye into the Court; and in the midst of the Building, in the front, and upon the right and left hand, there is a Hall for Persons of the best Quality to keep together. On each side of the Hall are Lodgings for every man by himself. These Lodgings are rais'd all along the Court two or three Steps high, just behind which are the Stables, where many times it is as good lying as in the Chamber. Some will rather lye there in the Winter, because they are warm, and are roof'd as well as the Chambers. Right against the Head of every Horse there is a Nich with a Window into the Lodging-Chamber, out of which every man may see how his Horse is look'd after. There Niches are usually so large, that three men may lye in them; and there it is that the Servants usually dress their Victuals.</p>
                     <p>There are two forts of Inns. For some are endow'd; where you may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for Charities sake; others, where you must pay for what you call for. There are none of the first, but between <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Nor is it lawful for any others to build such, but only the Mother and Sisters of the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> or such <hi>Viziers,</hi> and <hi>Basha's</hi> as have been three times in Battel against the Christians, In these Inns, which are built out of Legacies, there is a very good allowance of Diet to Travellers, and at your departure you have nothing to do but to thank the Benefactor. But from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Persia,</hi> there are none of those endow'd Inns; only such where you have nothing but bare Walls. It is for you to provide Utensils for your Kitchin, and a Bed to lye on: as for Provision, the people bring Lambs, Pullets, Butter, and Fruits in their feasons: or else you may buy it, provided before-hand by the Master of the House. There you also meet with Barley and Straw for the Horses, unless it be in some few places that I have been at upon the Road. In the Country you pay nothing for your Chambers; but in the Cities you pay something, though it be but a small matter. Usually the <hi>Caravans</hi> never go into the Towns, which are not able to contain so many People and Horses. When you come to your Quarters every one looks after his own Chamber, for there is no regard to Poor or Rich: sometimes out of Breeding, or out of Interest, an ordinary Tradesman will give way to a great Merchant; but no man is permitted to leave the Chamber which he has once made choice of. In the night the Inn-keeper shuts up his Gates, being answerable for all things that shall be lost; for which reason he keeps a Guard about the Inn.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Persian Caravansera's,</hi> they are more commodious, and better built than those of <hi>Turkie,</hi> and at more reasonable distances, throughout almost all the Country. By which description of Inns it is easie to observe, that though these <hi>Caravansera's</hi> are not so commodious for the Rich as our <hi>European</hi> Inns, yet they are more convenient for the Poor, to whom they never refuse to give admittance: no person being oblig'd to eat or drink more than he pleases; but every one being allow'd to spend according to his Stock, without grumbling.</p>
                     <p>You may travel in <hi>Turkie</hi> or <hi>Persia,</hi> either with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> or else in company, ten or twelve together, or else alone with a Guide. The safest way is to go with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> though you are longer upon the Road, by reason of the slowness of their march, especially when the <hi>Caravans</hi> consist of Camels.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravans</hi> are as it were great Convoys, which consist of a good number of Merchants, that meet at certain times and places, to put themselves into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend themselves from Thieves, that are very rise in Troops in several desert places upon the Road. These Merchants choose among themselves a <hi>Caravan-Bashi,</hi> who orders them how they shall march, assigns the places of lodging at night, and who with the chief of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> is a kind of Judge of the differences that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106224:39"/>
fall out by the way. There is no honest man that covets the employment; for the <hi>Caravan-Bashi,</hi> being to discharge several small duties upon the Road, however he behave himself, is still suspected for his fidelity. When the <hi>Turks</hi> are most nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they make choice of a <hi>Turk;</hi> when the <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants are most, they choose an <hi>Armenian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Caravans.</hi> There are <hi>Caravans</hi> which consist of Camols, which are the most usual; in regard that Camels are cheap, and for that some Camels will carry as much as three Horses, others as much as four or five. But among the <hi>Caravans</hi> of Camels, there are several Horses and Mules, which the Merchants themselves ride upon; it being very tedious to ride upon a Camel when he only goes a foot-pace, but very pleasant when he goes upon his large trot. There are other <hi>Caravans</hi> that consist only of Horses; and among these, if the Merchant have none of his own, he may hire one. The Servants ride upon those Horses that are least laden; but at <hi>Smyrna</hi> you may meet with several good Horses very cheap, from thirty to sixty Crowns. As for those persons that are either unwilling or unable to be at any expence, they make use of Asses, of which there are enow to be had. Above all things, you must take care to provide Pack-Horses to carry your Wine; for the Camel-Masters being <hi>Mahometans,</hi> will not permit you to lade their Camels with any such Liquor; that Beast being particularly consecrated to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who so strictly forbad the use of Wine. You put your Wine in Bottles made of wild Goats Skins, with the hairy side turn'd innermost, and well pitch'd within. There are some of these Bottles from which they take off the Hair; but they are not so good, as being seldom without holes.</p>
                     <p>These Camel-Masters are an insolent sort of people, which you shall never know how to deal with, unless you can bring them to punishment. There was one that play'd me some of his jades tricks in the Road from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Tauris;</hi> but when I came to <hi>Escrivan,</hi> I complain'd to the <hi>Kan,</hi> who presently caus'd a hundred Bastnado's to be giv'n him upon the spot. Nor is there any other way to bring those Scoundrels to reason, especially at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and such other places, where the Merchants have their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,</hi> who upon the least complaint to the <hi>Cady</hi> have Justice done them immediately. The examples of some of these Camel-drivers that have been paid off, keep the rest in good <hi>decorum;</hi> and they will be very tractable for a good while after.</p>
                     <p>The Journies of the <hi>Caravans</hi> are not equal; sometimes not above six hours travel, sometimes ten, and sometimes twelve; it being the convenience of Water, which is not every where to be met with, that is the Rule of Lodging the <hi>Caravan.</hi> At all times the <hi>Caravan</hi> travels more by night than by day; in Summer to avoid the heat, and at other times, that you may be sure to have day enough to set up your Tents. For if the <hi>Caravan</hi> should come to pitch in the night, it would be impossible for them to find where to set up their Tents, to dress and look after their Beasts, make ready their Kitchins, and provide things necessary for so large a Company. True it is, that in the depth of Winter and in the great Snows, they seldom set out till two or three hours after midnight; and that sometimes they stay till day-break. But in Summer, according to the Journey which they intend, they set out either at midnight, or an hour after Sun-set. The last time I went from <hi>Smyrna</hi> the <hi>Caravan</hi> consisted of six hundred Camels, and almost the same number of Horse. Sometimes their number is greater, so that the Camels going but by one and one after another, a <hi>Caravan</hi> seems to be an Army; and whether it be in travelling or lodging, they take up a world of Ground. Now by reason they travel all night in <hi>Asia,</hi> it happens that the Air is indifferent wholsom; and that the Travellers, that lye for the most part upon a Carpet spread upon the Ground, find themselves very little inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienc'd by it.</p>
                     <p>The Camels that go into <hi>Persia</hi> through the Northern Provinces of <hi>Turkie,</hi> travel like Horses in a Cart, by seven and seven; they are ty'd together by a Cord about the bigness of a Man's little Finger, and a Fathom long; fasten'd to the Pack-faddle of the Camel that goes before, and to the Head-harness of the Camel that follows. Those little Cords are made no stronger, to the end that if the Camel before should chance to fall into any hole, the Camel behind should either keep him up, or else not be pull'd in after the other. And to the end that the Camel-driver who leads the foremost, may know whether the other six follow him or no, the last Camel has a Bell about his Neck, which if it cease to ring, 'tis a sign that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106224:39"/>
some one of the small Cords is broken, and that a Camel has got a mischance. The seventh Camel generally carries the Provisions. For if a Merchant have six Camels laden he is generally allow'd one to carry his Provision; if he have but three, he is allow'd but half a Camel's load; but if he have nine or twelve, he pays nothing for the carriage of his Provisions of Food, or any thing else that he pleases. Every Merchant with his Servants rides by the Camels that are laden with his Goods, especially in the dark nights; for there are a subtil sort of Thieves, that have a trick to cut the two Cords behind and before, and without any noise drive the Camel out of the way; for having no Hoofs, his Feet cannot be shod, and consequently he makes no noise. As well Merchants, as others, Camel-drivers and Servants, keep themselves from sleeping sometimes by singing, and sometimes by taking Tobacco, and sometimes by discourse.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravan</hi> lyes in such places as they think most convenient, chiefly near to the Water-side. When the Sun is set, the <hi>Shaoux,</hi> who are a sort of poor people, are diligent to guard the whole Field, and take care of the Goods. They walk up and down, and either in the <hi>Arabian</hi> or <hi>Armenian</hi> Dialect they cry one to another, <hi>God is one, and he is merciful;</hi> adding from time to time, <hi>Have a care of your self.</hi> When they see that the time grows near to set out, they give notice to the <hi>Caravan-Bashi,</hi> who gives order to bid them cry, <hi>Saddle your Horses;</hi> and after that, to cry again, <hi>Load.</hi> And it is a strange thing to consider, that upon the second Cry of the <hi>Shaoux</hi> every thing is ready upon an instant, and the <hi>Caravan</hi> begins to set forward in great order and great silence. Every one takes care to be ready, for it is dangerous to be left behind, especially in those Countries which are haunted with Thieves. The Wages of these <hi>Shaoux</hi> is the fourth part of a Piaster, for a Bale, from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Erivan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Stages are long, and that they believe that they shall not get thither by ten or twelve in the morning, every one carries two small Wallets on each side his Horse, and when they come to the place where they intend to Break-fast, they spread a Carpet upon the Ground and fall to.</p>
                     <p>When you go from <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> or <hi>Aleppo</hi> with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> it be hoves all people to carry themselves according to the mode of the Country; in <hi>Turkie</hi> like a <hi>Turk,</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi> as a <hi>Persian;</hi> else would they be accounted ridiculous, nay sometimes they would hardly be permitted to pass in some places, where the least miscarriage makes the Governours jealous, who are easily perswaded to take Strangers for Spies. Always, if you have upon the Road but an <hi>Arabian</hi> Vest, with a mean Girdle, whatever Clothes you wear under, there is no danger of passing any where. If you wear a Turbant, you must of necessity shave off your Hair, else it will never stay upon the Head. As for Beards, they never mind them in <hi>Turkie,</hi> the greatest being accounted the handsomest; but in <hi>Persia</hi> they shave their Chins, and wear their Mustaches: and I remember I have seen one of the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Porters, whose Mustaches were so long, that he could tye them behind his neck, for which reason he had a double Pension. More than that, you must provide your self of Boots according to the custom of the Country; they are made of red, yellow, or black Cordovan, lin'd with Linnen cloth; and in regard they never reach higher than the Knee, they are as convenient to travel in as Shooes. As for Spurs, they never wear any; for the Iron at the upper end of the stirrop, which is four-square, serves to spur the Horse: so much the better, because it is the custom of all <hi>Asia</hi> to ride very short.</p>
                     <p>Before you set out, you must provide your self of several Houshold Goods, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of those Bottles that are call'd <hi>Matares,</hi> which are made of <hi>Bulgary-</hi>Leather; every man carries his own at the Pummel of his Saddle, or else fasten'd to the Crupper of the Saddle behind. Besides these you must buy <hi>Borracho's;</hi> the most serviceable things in the World; for they will never break, and will hold above fifty Pints at a time. The smaller Bottles serve to put Aqua-vitae in: and the Leather whereof they are made, has that peculiar to it self, that it keeps the Water fresh. Then you must provide Food, and make a provision of Rice and Bisket as far as <hi>Tacat;</hi> For as for Pullets, Eggs, and such like things, you meet with them almost every where; as also with Provision for your Horses, and new Bread, unless in some few places. You must also carry a Tent with all its appurtenances, with a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress; and Clothes to cover the Horses at night, especially in the time of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106224:40"/>
deep Snows, wherein you shall find them almost buried the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Caravan</hi> comes near the place where it intends to stop, every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant rides before to take up a convenient place for himself and his Goods, for which he covets a rising Ground, that if it should happen to rain, the Water may run from the Bales. They also in that case lay Stones under the Bales, and a Cloth over them; and the Servants make a Ditch about the Tent for the Water to run into. But if it be fair weather, there is no care tak'n to set up the Tent: or if it be, 'tis folded up after Supper; to the end the Owners may have the more liberty to look about them, and may be in a better condition to look after the Thieves. But if there be any likelihood of foul weather, the Tent is let stand till the first Cry of the <hi>Shaoux.</hi> The Horses are ty'd before the Tent with Cords fasten'd to a Nail, and their hinder Legs are ty'd with other Cords, to the end they may not stir out of their places. If it be not seasonable for them to eat Grass, you must buy Barley and Straw of the Country-men that come to serve the <hi>Caravan</hi> there being no Oats, neither in <hi>Turkie</hi> nor <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In dressing your Victuals, you must follow the custom of the Country; which is, to make a Hole in the Ground, and then kindling a Fire in it, to set the Pot over it.</p>
                     <p>But the greatest inconvenience which Travellers suffer with the <hi>Caravans,</hi> is this, that when they come to Waters, which are only Wells, or Cisterns, or Springs, where only two or three can lade up Water at a time. For after the <hi>Caravan</hi> is lodg'd, the Merchants shall be forc'd to stay for Water two or three hours together; for they that belong to the Beasts of Carriage, will not suffer any person to take any Water, till the Camels, Horses, Asses, and Mules are all serv'd. Nor is there any contending with these Camel-drivers and Muleters; for as they are a rude sort of people, a Man runs the hazard of his Life by contesting alone: of which one Example may suffice for all.</p>
                     <p>Setting out one day from <hi>Bander-Abassi,</hi> for <hi>Ispahan,</hi> with a Merchant of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as we came to the Inn where we lay the first night, which was call'd <hi>Guetchy,</hi> the Merchant commanded one of his Slaves who was a <hi>Cafer</hi> of <hi>Mozambique,</hi> to fetch him some fresh Water, at the Cistern, to drink: The <hi>Cafer</hi> went thither, and return'd without any Water, telling his Master, that the Camel-drivers and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leters threaten'd to beat him, and would not let him come near the Cistern. The Merchant either ill advis'd, or not knowing the custom, bid him go back, and kick those that refus'd him. Whereupon the <hi>Cafer</hi> returning, and finding the fame resistance as before, began to give ill language to the Camel-drivers, so that one of them happen'd to strike him. Upon that the <hi>Cafer</hi> drawing his Sword, ran him into the Belly, so that he fell down dead: Thereupon the whole Rabble fell upon him, bound him, and carry'd him back to <hi>Bander-Abassi</hi> for the Governour to put him to death. The Master of the <hi>Cafer,</hi> accompany'd by several Merchants, went to the Governour and represented to him the insolence of those people, and how the business had happen'd. Upon which the Governour took the poor fellow out of their hands, and caus'd him to be kept safe; after that, he caus'd ten or a dozen of those Muleters to be seiz'd, and order'd them to be soundly bastinado'd, for hind'ring a Merchant's Servant from fetching Water for his Master. He also put others in Prison; who had not been releas'd so soon, but at the request of those Merchants whose Goods they carry'd, and who stood in need of their service. The Governour spun out the business, on purpose that the rest might be gone: but as soon as they were all departed except the two Brothers of the party slain, he told them, he could not do them Justice, because their Brother belong'd to <hi>Schiras;</hi> so that all that he could do, was to send the Criminal thither. The Master of the <hi>Cafer</hi> being rich, and loving the Slave, made hast to <hi>Schiras,</hi> to tell his Story first to the <hi>Kan.</hi> And I remember, two days journey on this side <hi>Schiras,</hi> we met in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way abundance of poor people, the kindred of the party slain, who were staying for the <hi>Cafer,</hi> to carry him before the <hi>Kan,</hi> and to demand Justice. Two or three Leagues also from <hi>Schiras</hi> I met the Father and Mother, together with the Wife and Children of the deceas'd, who seeing me pass along, fell at my Feet and recounted to me their Grievances. I told them by my <hi>Kalmachi,</hi> that their best and surest way was to take a piece of Money of the <hi>Cafer</hi>'s Master, and so to put up
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106224:40"/>
the business. This Proposal, that would have been accepted in Christendom, was rejected by those poor <hi>Mahometans;</hi> in so much that the Father tore his Beard, and the Women their Hair, crying out, That if it were the custom of the <hi>Franks</hi> to sell the Blood of their Kindred, it was not their custom so to do. When the rest of the kindred came with the <hi>Cafer</hi> to <hi>Schiras,</hi> the <hi>Kan</hi> did all he could to persuade the Widow to take Money; but not being able to over-rule her, he was forc'd to give the <hi>Cafer</hi> into their hands: and how they us'd him I cannot tell, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd at the same time, to pass from <hi>Schiras</hi> for <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the breeding, nature, and several sorts of Camels.</head>
                     <p>THE Female Camel bears her Burthen eleven Months; and her Milk is a sovereign Remedy against the Dropsie. You must drink a Pint of it every Day for three Weeks together: and I have seen several Cures wrought thereby at <hi>Balsara, Ormus;</hi> and in other places in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, upon several <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Mariners.</p>
                     <p>So soon as a Camel comes into the World, they fold his Feet under his Belly, and make him lye upon them; after that they cover his Back with a Carpet that hangs to the Ground, laying Stones upon each side, so that he may not be able to rise; and thus they leave him for fifteen or twenty days. In the mean time they give him Milk to drink, but not very often; to the end he may be accustom'd to drink little. This they do also to use them to lye down, when they go about to Lade them; at which time they will fold their Legs and lye down so obediently, that it is an admirable thing to consider. So soon as the <hi>Caravan</hi> comes to the place where it is to lye, all the Camels that belong to one Master will range themselves in a Circle, and lye down upon their fore Feet; so that it is but untying one Cord that holds the Bales, and they will slide off gently from each side of the Camel. When 'tis time to lade again, the same Camel comes and crouches down between the two Burthens, and when they are fasten'd, gently rises up with the Burthen again; which is done without any trouble or noise. When the Camels are unladen, they let them go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field to feed upon the Heath and Bushes, and half an hour before Sun-set they return of themselves, unless any one happen to wander, which they will call again with a certain Cry which is natural to them. When they return, they range themselves in a Circle, and the Muleters give to every one little Balls of Barley-meal kneaded, as big as two Fists. The Camel though he be of a large bulk, eats very little, contented with what he meets with upon the Heaths; where he more especially looks for Thistles, of which he is a great lover. But it is more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to consider with what patience they endure drowth: For one time that I cross'd over the Deserts, where we were 65 days upon the Road, our Camels were nine days without Drink. But what is more wonderful is this, that when the Camel is in the heat of Generation, he neither eats nor drinks for 40 days together; and he is then so furious, that without great care you cannot avoid being bitten by him: And where-ever he bites, he carries away a piece of the Flesh. At that time issues out of their Mouths a white Foam, besides that there appears on each side of their Chops two Bladders large and swell'd, like the Bladder of a Boar.</p>
                     <p>In the Spring time all the Camel's Hair falls off in three days. The Skin remains bare, and then the Flies are very troublesom. There is no way but to Tar them all over: though it be a ventrous thing to come near them at that time.</p>
                     <p>A Camel must be drest as well as a Horse; but the Camel-keeper never uses any Curry-comb, but only beats him all over with a small Wand, as Carpets are wont to be dusted. If a Camel be hurt or gall'd under the Pack-saddle, they never apply any thing to it, but only wash it well with Urine, without using any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106224:41"/>
There are two sorts of Camels; the one which is proper for hot Countries, the other for cold Countries.</p>
                     <p>The Camels in hot Countries, such as go from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> cannot travel if the Ground be dirty and slippery; for their Bellies burst, while their hinder Quarters rive from their Bodies. These are small Camels, that carry not above five or six hundred Pound weight; but they are kept for little, and endure Thirst a long time. They do not tye them Head to Tayl, as they do the great ones, but let them go as they please themselves, like a Herd of Cows. The Camel-driver follows them singing, and sometimes playing upon his Pipe: the louder he sings and pipes, the faster the Camels go; nay they will stand still when he gives over his Musick. When the Camel-drivers come to a Heathy Ground, they will give them leave to feed for half an hour, taking their Tabacco the while; and then singing them together again, they set forward. The Camels bred in the Deserts are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, but very tender, so that they must be gently us'd, and never be put upon long Journies. However, they eat and drink less than others, and endure thirst more patiently.</p>
                     <p>The Camels of cold Countries, such as those that travel from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> are large Camels, that carry great Burthens, and will pull themselves out of the dirt: But in fat Grounds and slippery Ways the Drivers are fain to spread Carpets, sometimes an hundred one behind another; otherwise their hinder Quarters are also apt to rive from their Buttocks: but if the Road be slippery for too great a distance together, there is no way but to tarry 'till it be dry'd up and fair. These Camels usually carry a thousand Pound weight: but if the Merchant has any hank upon the Camel-driver, he will lay upon every Camel fifteen hundred weight, thereby making two of three Burthens. This the Merchants do, when they come near the Custom-Houses, especially that of <hi>Erzerom,</hi> which is the most severe. The Merchant does this for his own Profit: So that when the Customer mistrusting, demands how so many Camels come to travel empty, he makes answer, that they were Camels that carry'd Provision: But the Customer most commonly winks at that good Husbandry of the Merchant, for fear of losing his Custom, and obliging the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to take another Road.</p>
                     <p>There is as much knavery among the Camel-drivers, as among our Horse-Coursers. For I remember, that being once at <hi>Casbin,</hi> a <hi>Persian</hi> Merchant, thinking he had bought eight good Camels, was deceiv'd in four which he thought the best: He verily believing they had been fat and in good case, but they were only blown up. For those Cheats have a trick to cut a Hole near the Tail, of which the Purchaser takes no notice, and which they know neatly how to sow up again: In this Hole they will blow till they have puft up a lean Camel, that he shall appear as fat and plump as the soundest that ever fed: whereby they often deceive the quickest sights, especially when the Hair is all off, and that the bare Skin is all rub'd over with Tar.</p>

                     <p>IN the first place, you must take notice that there are no Pieces of Gold coyn'd in <hi>Persia,</hi> but only some few, to be thrown among the People when a new King ascends the Throne: which Pieces are neither currant among the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, nor of a certain Price.

Merchant enters into <hi>Persia,</hi> whether it be at <hi>Erivan</hi> or <hi>Tauris,</hi> where the Money is coyn'd, he is oblig'd to tell what Silver he carry's, to the end it may be melted down and stamp'd with the King's Stamp; under a great Penalty, if discover'd to be a concealer. But if a Merchant's affairs will not permit him to stay at <hi>Erivan,</hi> or at <hi>Tauris,</hi> and that he think it better to carry his Money to the Mint of <hi>Ispahan;</hi> 'tis but taking a Note from the Master of the Mint either at <hi>Tauris</hi> or <hi>Erivan,</hi> to attest that he has declar'd the truth of what he carries, and it is excuse enough.</p>
                     <p>But they that can cunningly carry their Silver to <hi>Erivan,</hi> when the Season is to go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> make a great profit of the Real; for the Merchants that go to the <hi>Indies</hi> will give them thirteen and a half, or fourteen <hi>Shayez</hi> a piece, for as many as they have. But there are few Merchants that carry their Silver to <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han;</hi> in regard the Masters of the Mints upon the Frontiers will be sure to present them with a good piece of Silver Plate, rather than let them carry away their Bullion to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> to have the benefit of Coynage themselves.</p>
                     <p>They that traffick into <hi>Guilan</hi> for Silks carry their Silver to <hi>Teflis,</hi> where the Master of the Mint gives them 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> profit for their Silver. The reason is, because that which he gives them for it is a little sophisticated; but it passes currant all over <hi>Guilan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the third place, you must observe, That upon the pieces of Silver, as well for the King's Duty as the Coynage of the Money, there is requir'd 7½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> But upon the Copper Money, not above one half, or 1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> at most. Whence it comes to pass, that when a Workman has need of Copper, rather than lose time in going to buy it, he will melt down his <hi>Casbeké's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are four several pieces of Silver Coyn; <hi>Abassi's, Mamoudi's, Shaet's,</hi> and <hi>Bisti's:</hi> but as for the <hi>Bisti's,</hi> there are very few at present.</p>
                     <p>The Copper pieces of Coyn are call'd <hi>Casbeké,</hi> of which there are single and double.</p>
                     <p>The single <hi>Casbeké</hi> is worth five Deniers and a Half-peny of our Money.</p>
                     <p>The double <hi>Casbeké</hi> is valu'd at eleven Deniers.</p>
                     <p>Four single <hi>Casbeké's,</hi> or two double ones, make a <hi>Bisti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ten single <hi>Casbeké's,</hi> or five double ones, make one <hi>Shayet</hi> in value.</p>
                     <p>Two <hi>Shayet's</hi> make a <hi>Mamoudi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two <hi>Mamoudi's</hi> make an <hi>Abassi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Real or Crown of <hi>France</hi> is worth three <hi>Abassi's</hi> and one <hi>Shayet;</hi> and counting a Real at sixty Sous, an <hi>Abassi</hi> is worth eighteen Sous, six Deniers. Though to say truth, three <hi>Abassi's</hi> and one <hi>Shayet</hi> make three Half-pence more than the Crown.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Number</hi> 1, and <hi>Number</hi> 2.

                        <hi>Num.</hi> 2. Makes two <hi>Abassi's</hi> and a half of our Money, or forty-six Sous and one Farthing.</p>

                        <hi>Num.</hi> 7. The Copper Coyn, call'd <hi>Casbeké,</hi> worth five Deniers, one Half-peny.</p>
                     <p>These Coyns, unless it be the <hi>Casbeké,</hi> bear no other Inscription, but only the Name of the King reigning when they were coyn'd; the Name of the City where they were coyn'd; with the Year of the <hi>Hegyra</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though all Payments are made in <hi>Abassi's,</hi> as well at <hi>Ormus</hi> and other parts of the Gulf belonging to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> as in the Iland of <hi>Bahren,</hi> where is the great Fishery and Market for Pearls; yet there is no mention made but only of <hi>Larins.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:106224:43"/>
The <hi>Larin</hi> is describ'd in the Money of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Eight <hi>Larins</hi> make an <hi>Or;</hi> four and twenty make a <hi>Toman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An <hi>Or</hi> is not the name of a Coyn, but of a Sum in reck'ning among Merchants. One <hi>Or</hi> is five <hi>Abassi's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Toman</hi> is another Sum in payment: For in all <hi>Persian</hi> Payments they make use of only <hi>Tomans</hi> and <hi>Ors;</hi> and though they usually say that a <hi>Toman</hi> makes fifteen Crowns, in truth it comes to forty-six Livres, one Peny and ⅓.</p>
                     <p>As for pieces of Gold, the Merchant never carries any into <hi>Persia,</hi> but <hi>Alman-</hi>Ducats, Ducats of the Seventeen Provinces, or of <hi>Venice;</hi> and he is bound to carry them into the Mint so soon as he enters into the Kingdom; but if he can cunningly hide them, and sell them to particular persons, he gets more by it. When a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant goes out of the Kingdom, he is oblig'd to tell what pieces of Gold he carries with him; and the King's people take a <hi>Shayet</hi> at the rate of a Ducat, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they value the Ducat at more. But if he carry's his Gold away privately and be discover'd, all his Gold is confiscated.</p>
                     <p>The Ducat usually is worth two Crowns, which in <hi>Persia</hi> justly comes to twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>six <hi>Shayets;</hi> but there is no price fixt in that Country for Ducats. For when the season is to go for the <hi>Indies,</hi> or that the <hi>Caravan</hi> sets out for <hi>Mecca,</hi> as well the Merchants as the Pilgrims buy up all the Ducats they can find out, by reason of their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and then they rise to twenty-seven, and twenty-eight <hi>Shayets,</hi> and sometimes more, a piece.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The second Voyage of the Author from</hi> Paris <hi>to</hi> Ispahan: <hi>and first; of his Embarking at</hi> Marseilles <hi>for</hi> Alexandretta.</head>
                     <p>THE Road from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Erivan,</hi> which with all those other Roads through the Northern Provinces of <hi>Turkie,</hi> the first time I travel'd into <hi>Persia,</hi> I have amply describ'd. It behoves me now to treat of the Southern Provinces, and of those through the Deserts, where there are several <hi>Emirs,</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, of which several are very potent: For there are some of them that can bring 30000 Horse into the Field, five of which I have had the honour to discourse, and to oblige them with small Presents; in recompence whereof they sent me Rice, Mutton, Dates, and Sherbet, as long as I staid among them.</p>
                     <p>I embark'd at <hi>Marseilles</hi> in a <hi>Holland</hi> Vessel that carry'd five and forty Guns, from thence we set sail for <hi>Malta.</hi> At <hi>Malta</hi> we staid twelve days to carine the Vessel, and to take in fresh Victuals. Among the rest we bought two thousand Quails, for there are a prodigious quantity in the Iland: but in two or three days we found five or six hundred of them destroy'd by the Vermin that pester'd the Ship.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Malta</hi> we set sail for <hi>Larneca,</hi> a good Road in the Iland of <hi>Cypras,</hi> to the West of <hi>Famagosta,</hi> which is not above a days journey from it by Land. As we were making into the Road, about two or three hours after midnight, we perceiv'd a Vessel close upon us, and both the Ships Company began to cry out, for fear of falling foul one upon another, but the Vessel sheer'd clear without any harm on either side.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106224:44"/>
In the morning we cast Anchor, and went a-shoar. It is a good half League from the Road where the Consuls and Merchants, both <hi>English, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> live in a very pitiful Village. However there is a little Monastery of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> who officiate in the Chappel of the <hi>French</hi> Consul; and another of Religious <hi>Italians,</hi> that depend upon the Guardian of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> We staid but two days at <hi>Larneca;</hi> the Captain having nothing to do but to inform himself what business they might have for him at his return; it being usual to then to take in spun and unspun Cottons, together with course Wool for Mattresses.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Larneca</hi> 'till we came in view of the Coast of <hi>Syria,</hi> we had the Wind very favourable; but at length coming to prove a little contrary, instead of carrying us to <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> it cast us to the Northward, two or three Leagues higher, upon the Coast of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> toward a Town call'd <hi>Païasses.</hi> Half a League from that City lyes a vast Rock, and between that Rock and the Land runs a very high Sea: And here it was that the people of the Country believe that the Whale cast up <hi>Jonas</hi> again; though the common Opinion reports it to have been done near <hi>Joppa</hi> in <hi>Palestine.</hi> All along that Coast from <hi>Alexandretta</hi> to <hi>Païasses,</hi> and farther, the way is so narrow and straiten'd by the Mountain, that in some parts the Camels and Horses must dip their Feet in the Sea: and yet you must pass that way of necessity, travelling from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Between <hi>Alexandretta</hi> and <hi>Païasses</hi> it was, that the <hi>Chevalier Paul,</hi> in a Vessel that carry'd only three hundred Men, miss'd but little of surprizing the <hi>Caravan</hi> that every Year carries the Tribute of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which since hath never been sent by Sea for fear of the <hi>Maltesi.</hi> This Knight had landed his Men, and laid them in Ambuscade; but unfortunately his Design was discover'd, so that the <hi>Caravan,</hi> that might have been easily surpriz'd, stood upon their Guard.</p>
                     <p>We were near the Coast, when we discover'd a Skiff with fifteen or sixteen <hi>Turks,</hi> that were sent by him that commanded four Galleys of <hi>Rhodes</hi> to demand the Customary Present from our Captain. Those Galleys then anchor'd at <hi>Païasses,</hi> and had there discharg'd themselves of their Provisions of War for <hi>Bagdat,</hi> which the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> was going to besiege. And it is the custom, that when the Great <hi>Turk</hi>'s Galleys are out at Sea, that whatever strange Vessel passes by them must send them a Present, either willingly or by force. When the <hi>Basha</hi> of the Sea, who is the Admiral of the <hi>Turks,</hi> is in Person at Sea, the Vessel which he meets is not excus'd for 2000 Crowns: so that when he sets out from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to cruise, the Vessels of the <hi>Franks</hi> do all they can to avoid him. There are some that will seek to escape in sight of the Galleys, but it has cost them dear. And it happen'd, that one day the Wind slackning, they boarded a Vessel of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> the Captain and Notary whereof were both seiz'd, and drub'd 'till their Bodies were almost bruis'd to a Gelly, and they had like to have dy'd upon it, without being the better in their Purses; for the rudeness of the Chastisement did not excuse them from paying the Money which was demanded. Whether our Captain knew any thing of this Example, or whether it were out of his natural heat of Valour, he laugh'd at the Skiff-men, bidding them be gone, and telling them he had no Presents for them but Cannon-Bullets. Thereupon the Men return'd to their Galleys, who soon deliver'd us from the true fear we were in, that the gallantry of the Captain had drawn us into an inconvenience. For while we kept the Sea close by the Coast, to observe the Countenances of the <hi>Turks,</hi> they weigh'd Anchor, and turn'd their Prows toward <hi>Rhodes.</hi> However, before they left us they sent us a Broad-side, and our Captain, whatever we could say, sent them another, which render'd us more guilty. For the <hi>Turks</hi> pretend that when their Navy is at Sea, or only one Squadron, and that a strange Vessel is in fight, she is bound to come as near as the Wind will permit her without being hal'd, for which they will otherwise make the Commander pay very severely. The Consuls and Merchants of <hi>Aleppo</hi> understanding what had pass'd, very much blam'd the Captain, fearing a worse consequence of the business: But by good fortune, the miscarriage was stifl'd and never went farther.</p>
                     <p>The same day the Wind veering to the West-North-West, we sail'd into the Road of <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> where we came to an Anchor, about a quarter of a League from the Land. Upon the advice which they have out of Christendom, so soon as they of <hi>Alexandretta</hi> discover a Vessel, and know what Colours she carries, the Vice-Consul of the Nation to which the Vessel belongs, fails not to advertise the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106224:44"/>
Consul of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> by a Note which is carr'yd in four or five hours; though it be more than two or three days journey on Horse-back. For they tye a Note under the Wing of a Pigeon, who is taught what to do, and she flies directly to the place whence she was brought. For more surety, they usually send two, that if the one should miscarry i'the dark, which has many times happen'd, the other may supply the defect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexandretta</hi> is nothing else but a confus'd heap of paltry Houses, inhabited by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who keep little Fudling-schools, for the Mariners and others, the meaner sort of the people: for the Merchants lye at the Vice-Consuls of the Nation. There were but two then, the <hi>English</hi> Vice-Consul and the <hi>French;</hi> who had each of them a very convenient dwelling. However they must be Men who love Money at a strange rate, that accept of those Employments. For the Air, like that of <hi>Ormus,</hi> is generally so bad, especially in the Summer, in so much that they who do not dye, cannot avoid very dangerous Distempers. If there be any so strong that they can hold out for three or four Years, and can accustom themselves to bad Air, they do well to stay there; for for them to betake themselves to a good Air, is to hazard their Lives. Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Consul has been the only Person that ever liv'd two and twenty Years at <hi>Alexandretta:</hi> but you must know he was a brisk merry Man, and of an excellent temper of Body; and yet for all that he had been forc'd to be cauteriz'd. That which renders the Air so bad, is the great quantity of standing Pools and Plashes in the neighbouring Plains, extending to the East and South; but when the great Heats begin to approach, the most part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants retire to a Village call'd <hi>Belan,</hi> upon the next Mountain to the City, where there are very good Waters and excellent Fruits. They come also thither from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> when there is any appearance of a Pestilence; and yet there are few people in this Village who are not troubl'd with a sort of Fever, that makes their Eyes look yellow and hollow; which they never can remedy as long as they live.</p>
                     <p>About half a League from <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> on the right band of the High-way, just against the Mersh on the other side, is a Tower whereon are to be seen the Arms of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloign.</hi> In all likelihood it was built for the defence of the High-way, which is enclos'd between these two Mershes, whose Exhalations are very noxious.</p>
                     <p>It is but three little days journey from <hi>Alexandretta</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and some well mounted have rid it in two. The <hi>Franks</hi> are not permitted to go thither on Foot. For before that Prohibition, in regard the way was short, every Sea-man that had a hundred Crowns, more or less, went on Foot to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and got easily thither in three days, with little expence. Now because they had but little Money to spend, and were willing to dispatch their business, they would not stand to give Four or Five in the Hundred extraordinary for what Goods they bought, which was of dangerous consequence to the Merchants. For you must observe, that when the Ships arrive, the first Man that either out of rashness or ignorance, gives two Sous more for a Commodity that is not worth a Crown, sets the Price, and causes all the whole Commodity to be sold at that rate. So that the Merchants that lay out ten or twelve thousand Crowns together, are very careful lest those Saylors should get before them, and enhance the Price of the Market.</p>
                     <p>To remedy which inconvenience, the Merchants obtain'd an Order, That no Strangers should be permitted to go a-foot from <hi>Alexandretta</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> but that they should be bound to hire Horses, and to give for every Horse six Plasters thither, and six back; which expence would soon eat out the Profit of a poor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner's small Sum.</p>
                     <p>Usually you stay at <hi>Alexandretta</hi> three or four days, as well to rest your self, as to make some little Provisions for your Journey to <hi>Aleppo.</hi> For though you meet with good Stages at Evening, yet the <hi>Janizaries</hi> will be very glad to eat by the way.</p>
                     <p>Setting out from <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> we travel'd over a Plain to the foot of a Mountain which is call'd <hi>Belan.</hi> There is a wide Gap in the midst of this Mountain, which giving liberty to the North-East Wind, when it blows hard, doth so enrage the Road of <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> which is otherwise very calm, that no Ship can ride there at that time. In so much that all Ships that happ'n to be there when the Wind rises, presently weigh, and get out to Sea, for fear of being cast away. Almost at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106224:45"/>
the top of the Mountain you meet with an Inn; but though it be a very fair one, with Fountains round about it, yet Merchants never stop there, but go on a little farther to a <hi>Grecian</hi> that speaks good <hi>Italian,</hi> and whose entertainment is indifferent good, considering the Country. When you go away, you give him a Crown for your accommodation, which is the manner at other Stages, by a custom, which the <hi>Franks</hi> themselves having establish'd, will never be left off.</p>
                     <p>Descending down the Mountain you discover the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> built upon a Hill. Formerly the Road lay through that City, but the <hi>Janizaries</hi> of the place exacting a Piaster from every person that travel'd that way, that Road is now disus'd. <hi>Antioch</hi> once made more noise in the World, being fal'n to ruine ever since the Channel, that ran from the City to the Sea, where Galleys might ride, has been stop'd up by the Sands that have encroach'd upon the Mouth of the Haven.</p>
                     <p>When you are at the bottom of the Hill toward the North, you discover a Castle built upon a Hill standing by it self, from whence you have a prospect over a good part of the Plain of <hi>Antioch.</hi> It is about fifteen Leagues long, and three broad, in that part where the Road lyes. Somewhat more than half the way, you meet with a long Causey parted by several Bridges, by reason of certain Rivulets that cross it, without which the Road were hardly passable. The frequent Revolts of <hi>Bagdat</hi> and <hi>Balsara,</hi> which the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> has been forc'd so often to besiege, caus'd the Grand <hi>Visier</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Achmat</hi> to undertake this Causey, which together with the Bridge was finish'd in six Months, that was lookt upon as a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. This was done for the more easie passage of the Artillery, and other Provisions of War, that were brought out of <hi>Romania</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> to the Siege of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> which could never have been done, but for this Causey. At the end of this Causey stands a Bridge, very long and strongly built, under which runs a River, which, with the other Rivulets that wind about the Plain, forms a Lake toward the South, that is call'd the Lake of <hi>Antioch.</hi> This Lake affords a great Revenue, by reason of the Eels that are caught there, which are taken two Months before <hi>Lent,</hi> and transported to <hi>Malta, Sicily,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Plain is very full of Olive-Trees; which produces that great Trade of Soap, that is made at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and transported into <hi>Mesopotamia, Chaldea, Persia,</hi> and the Desert; that Commodity being one of the most acceptable Presents that can be made to the <hi>Arabians.</hi> Sallet-Oyl is also in great esteem among them: so that when you make them a Present of it, they will take off their Bonnets, and rub their Heads, their Faces, and their Beards with it, lifting up their Eyes to Heaven, and cry in their Language, <hi>God be thank'd.</hi> Therein they have lost nothing of the ancient custom of the Eastern People, of which there is often mention made in Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>About a League and a half beyond the Plain, you meet with a Rock, at the foot whereof is a little deep Lake, wherein they catch a world of Fish that are like our Barbels. I have kill'd them with my Pistol; and found them to be of an excellent tast; though they are not regarded at <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two hours after, you ford a River which is call'd <hi>Afrora;</hi> though if it have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to rain, you must stay 'till the Waters are fal'n. Having past the River, upon the Banks whereof you stay to feed your self and your Horses, you come to lye at a poor Village call'd <hi>Shaquemin,</hi> where there is an Inn. Here the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people bring Provisions of Food to the Travellers; and whether you eat or no, you must pay a Piaster, according to the custom which the <hi>Franks</hi> have establish'd. After you have pass'd the Plain of <hi>Antioch</hi> as far as <hi>Shaquemin,</hi> the Horses in Summer are so terribly tormented with a sort of great Flies, that it were impossible to travel three or four hours together, were it not for going out of the Road, either to the right, or to the left, and riding through the Fields, which are full of those Burrs that our Clothworkers make use of: For in regard they grow as high as the Crupper of the Horse, they keep the Flies off from stinging and tyring the Horses.</p>
                     <p>Leaving the Village of <hi>Shaquemin,</hi> the Road lyes among Stones; and for half this tedious way, for two or three Leagues round about, you see nothing but the Ruines of ancient Monasteries. There are some of them which are built almost all of Free-stone; and about half a days journey toward the North, quite out of the Road, stands the Monastery of St. <hi>Simeon</hi> the <hi>Stylite,</hi> with the remainder of his so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106224:45"/>
famous Pillar, which is still to be seen. The <hi>Franks</hi> that travel to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> usually go out of their way to see that place. That which I find most entire, and worthy observation among the Ruines of those Monasteries, is the number of arch'd Cisterns of Free-stone, which time has not defac'd.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Shaquemin</hi> you come to dine at a Village call'd <hi>Angare,</hi> where every Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler isentertain'd for his Piaster, as at the other Stages. Between the other Villages it is ten hours journey; but between <hi>Angare</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> but three. We alighted at the <hi>French</hi> Consul's House, at what time the Customers came presently to search our Cloak-bags; after which we went to the <hi>Quaissery,</hi> which is a place where all Strangers are at the expence of half a Crown a day for themselves, and a quarter so much for every Servant, and are well entertain'd.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Description of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> now the Capital City of <hi>Syria.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>A <hi>Leppo</hi> is one of the most famous Cities in all <hi>Turkie,</hi> as well for the bigness and beauty of it, as for the goodness of the Air, and plenty of all things; together with the great Trade which is driv'n there by all the Nations of the World. It lyes in 71 Deg. 41 Min. of Longitude, and 36 Deg. 15 Min. of Latitude, in an excellent Soil. With all the search that I could make, I could never learn how it was anciently call'd. Some would have it to be <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> others <hi>Beroea:</hi> and the Christians of the Country agree with the latter. The <hi>Arabian</hi> Historians that record the taking of it, call it only <hi>Aleb,</hi> not mentioning any other name. Whence this Observation is to be made, That if the <hi>Arabians</hi> call it <hi>Aleb,</hi> others <hi>Alep;</hi> the reason is, because the <hi>Arabians</hi> never use the Letter <hi>P</hi> in their Language. This City was tak'n by the <hi>Arabians</hi> in the fifteenth Year of the <hi>Hegyra</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which was about the Year of <hi>CHRIST</hi> 637, in the Reign of <hi>Heraclius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The City is built upon four Hills, and the Castle upon the highest that stands in the middle of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> being supported by Arches in some places, for fear the Earth should tumble and moulder away from it. The Castle is large, and may be about five or six hundred Paces in compass. The Walls and Towers, though built of Free-stone, are of little defence. There is but one Gate to enter into it from the South, over a Draw-bridge, laid over certain Arches cross a Moat about six or seven Fathom deep. There is but one half of it full of Water, and that a standing Puddle to boot; the rest is a meer dry Ditch: so that it cannot be accounted a wholsom place. However there is Water brought into the Castle through a large Pipe from the Fountains in the City: and there is a strong Garrison kept in it.</p>
                     <p>The City is above three Miles in circuit, and the best half of it is unmoated; that Moat there, is not above three Fathom deep. The Walls are very good, and all of Free-stone; with several square Towers, distant one from the other about fourscore Paces; between which there are others also that are less. But these Walls are not all of them of an equal height, for in some places they are not above four Fathoms from the Ground. There are ten Gates to enter into the City, without either Moat or Draw-Bridge; under one of which there is a place that the <hi>Turks</hi> have in great veneration; where they keep Lamps continually burning, and report that <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet liv'd for some time.</p>
                     <p>There is no River that runs through <hi>Aleppo;</hi> and but only a small one without the City, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Coïc.</hi> However, though indeed it be but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Rivulet, yet it is very useful to water the Gardens, where grows an abundance of Fruit, particularly Pistaches, much bigger, and better tasted than those that comes from the parts near <hi>Casbin.</hi> But though there be no River, yet there are store of Fountains and Receptacles of Water, which they bring from two places distant from the City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:106224:46"/>
The Edifices, neither publick nor private, are very handsom, but only within<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; the Walls are of Marble of several colours, and the Cieling of Foliage Fret-work, with Inscriptions in Gold'n Letters. Without and within the City there are six and twenty <hi>Mosquees,</hi> six or seven whereof are very magnificent, with stately <hi>Duomo's,</hi> three being cover'd with Lead. The chiefest and largest of all, was a Christian Church which they call'd <hi>Alhha,</hi> or <hi>Listen'd unto:</hi> which is thought to have been built by St. <hi>Helen.</hi> In one part of the Suburbs also stands another <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which was formerly a Christian Church. In that there is one thing worthy observation. In the Wall upon the right side of the Gate, there is a Stone to be seen two or three Foot square, wherein there is the figure of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Chalice, and a Sacrifice over the hollow of it, with a Crescent that covers the Sacrifice, the two Horns whereof descend just upon the brims of the mouth of the Chalice. One would think at first that those Figures were in <hi>Mosaïc-</hi>Work: but it is all Natural, as I have found with several other <hi>Franks,</hi> having scrap'd the Stone with an Iron Instrument, when the <hi>Turks</hi> were out of the way. Several Consuls would have bought it, and there has been offer'd for it 2000 Crowns; but the <hi>Basha's</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> would never suffer it to be sold. Half a League from the City lyes a pleasant Hill, where the <hi>Franks</hi> are wont to take the Air. On the side of that Hill is to be seen a Cave or <hi>Grotto,</hi> where the <hi>Turks</hi> report that <hi>Haly</hi> liv'd for some few days; and for that there is an ill-shap'd figure of a Hand imprinted in the Rock, they farther believe it to be the Hand of <hi>Haly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are three Colledges in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> but very few Scholars, though there be Men of Learning that belong to them, who have Salaries to teach Grammar, and their odd kind of Philosophy, with the Grounds of their Religion, which are the Principal Sciences to which the <hi>Turks</hi> apply themselves.</p>
                     <p>The Streets of the City are all pav'd, except the <hi>Bazar's,</hi> where the Merchants and Handicraft-Tradesmen keep their Shops. The chiefest Artists, and the most numerous, are Silk and Chamlet-Weavers.</p>
                     <p>In the City and Suburbs there are about forty Inns; and fifty publick Baths, as well for Women as for Men, keeping their turns. 'Tis the chiefest Pastime the Women have to go to the Baths; and they will spare all the Week long to carry a Collation, when they go at the Weeks end to make merry among themselves, in those places of privacy.</p>
                     <p>The Suburbs of the City are large and well peopl'd, for almost all the Christians have their Houses and Churches there. Of which Christians there are four sorts in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> I mean of Eastern Christians, that is to say, <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Jacobites</hi> or <hi>Syrians,</hi> and <hi>Maronites.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> have an Archbishop there, and are about fifteen or sixteen thousand in number; their Church is dedicated to St. <hi>George:</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> have a Bishop, whom they call <hi>Vertabet;</hi> and are about twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand in number; their Church is dedicated to the Virgin. The <hi>Jacobites</hi> being about ten thousand, have a Bishop also; and their Church is likewise dedicated to the Virgin, as is that of the <hi>Armenians.</hi> The <hi>Maronites</hi> depend upon the Pope, not being above twelve hundred; their Church being consecrated to St. <hi>Elias.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have three Churches, serv'd by the <hi>Capuchins, Carmelites,</hi> and <hi>Jesuites.</hi> They reckon that in the Suburbs and City of <hi>Aleppo</hi> there are about 250000 Souls.</p>
                     <p>There is a vast Trade at <hi>Aleppo</hi> for Silks and Chamlets; but chiefly for Gall-Nuts, and <hi>Valanede,</hi> which is a sort of Acorn-shell without which the Curriers cannot dress their Leather. They have also a great Trade for Soap, and for several other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; the Merchants repairing thither from all parts of the World. For not to speak of the <hi>Turks, Arabians, Persians, Indians,</hi> there are several <hi>English, Italians, French,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> every Nation having their Consul to carry on their Interests, and maintain their Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>Nor does this place happ'n to be so great a Mart, through the convenience of the two Rivers of <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> as some have writt'n; by which they say such vast quantities of Commodities are transported and imported out and into the City. For had that been, I should never have cross'd the Desert, coming from <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Aleppo;</hi> nor at another time, going from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Balsara.</hi> And as for <hi>Euphrates,</hi> certain it is, that the great number of Mills built upon it, to bring the Water to the neighbouring Grounds, have not only render'd it unnavigable, but made it very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:106224:46"/>
I must confess, that in the year 1638 I saw a great part of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Army, and several Boats full of Warlike Provisions fall down the Stream, when he went to besiege it: but then they were forc'd to take away all the Mills that are upon the River; which was not done without a vast trouble and expence. As for <hi>Tigris,</hi> it is not navigable 'till beyond <hi>Babylon</hi> down to <hi>Balsara;</hi> where you may take Water, and be at <hi>Balsara</hi> in nine days. But the Voyage is very inconvenient, for at every Town which the <hi>Arabs</hi> have upon the River, you must be hal'd, and be forc'd to leave some Money behind you. Sometimes indeed the Merchants of <hi>Moussul</hi> and <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and others that come out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> to Trade at <hi>Balsara,</hi> carry their Goods by Water from <hi>Bagdat;</hi> but in regard the Boats are only to be tow'd by Men, it takes them up a Voyage of seventy days. By this you may judge of the time and expence of carrying Goods by Water up the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> to <hi>Bir,</hi> where they are to be unlad'n for <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In short, if the convenience of <hi>Morat-sou</hi> (for so the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Euphrates)</hi> were to be had, and that Goods might be transported by that River, the Merchants would never take that way: for the <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, with their People and their Cattel, lying all the Summer long upon the Banks of the River, for the sake of the Water and the Grass, would make the Merchants pay what Toll they pleas'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>I saw an Example of this, coming one time from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Aleppo.</hi> In all which Road we met but with one of those <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, who lay at <hi>Anna:</hi> yet he made us pay for every Camel's Load forty <hi>Piasters.</hi> And which was worse, he detain'd us above five Weeks, to the end his Subjects might get more of our Money by selling us their Provisions. The last time I pass'd the Desert, I met another of these <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes together with his Brother, both young Men: He would not let us go a step farther, unless we would exchange two hundred <hi>Piasters</hi> in specie for <hi>Larins,</hi> the Money of the Country; and he forc'd us to take them, what-ever we could urge to make it appear how much we should lose by them. And indeed we said as much as we could, for the dispute lasted two and twenty days to no purpose; might overcoming right. By this you may guess what the other <hi>Arabians</hi> would do, who are not a jot more civil; and whether the Merchants would get by taking the Road of <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The City is govern'd by a <hi>Basha,</hi> who commands all the Country from <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta</hi> to <hi>Euphrates.</hi> His Guard usually consists of three hundred Men, and some years ago he was made a <hi>Vizier.</hi> There is also an <hi>Aga</hi> or Captain of the Cavalry, as well within the City as without, who commands four hundred Men. There is another <hi>Aga</hi> who has under him seven hundred <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who has the charge of the Gates of the City; to whom the Keys are carry'd every Evening, neither has he any dependance upon the <hi>Basha.</hi> The Castle is also under another Commander, sent immediately from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who has under him two hundred Musketeers, and likewise the charge of the Cannon; of which there are about thirty Pieces; eight great Guns, the rest of a small size. There is also another <hi>Aga</hi> or Captain of the City, who commands three hundred Harquebuzes; beside a <hi>Sou-Bashi,</hi> who is a kind of Provost of the Merchants, or Captain of the Watch, going the round every Night with his Officers through the City and Suburbs. He also puts in Execution the Sentences of the <hi>Basha,</hi> upon Criminal Offenders.</p>
                     <p>In Civils there is a <hi>Cadi,</hi> who sits sole Judge, without any Assistants, of all Causes as well Civil as Criminal; and when he has condemn'd any Man to Death, he sends him to the <hi>Basha,</hi> together with his Accusation, with whom the <hi>Basha</hi> does as he pleases. This <hi>Cady</hi> makes and dissolves all Contracts of Marriage; all Acts of Sale and Purchase pass in his presence. He also creates the sworn Masters of every Trade, who make their inspection that there may be no deceit in the Work. The Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Duties are receiv'd by a <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> or Treasurer-General, who has under him several Receivers in divers places.</p>
                     <p>In matters of Religion, the <hi>Mufti</hi> is the Chief, and the Interpreter of the Law, as well in relation to the Ceremonies, as in all Ecclesiastical differences. Among these Interpreters of the Law there is a <hi>Chieke</hi> or Doctor, appointed to instruct those that are newly converted to <hi>Mahumetanism,</hi> and to teach them the Maxims and Customs of their Religion.</p>
                     <p>Three days after I arriv'd at <hi>Aleppo, Sultan Amurat</hi> made his Entry, going to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106224:47"/>
his Army, which was upon its march to the Siege of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now you must take notice, that not far from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> toward the East, there stands a House inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Dervies,</hi> which are a Religious Order among the <hi>Turks;</hi> though it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belong'd to the Monks of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and was a fair Covent. It is still in good repair, the Walls of the Chambers, Halls, and Galleries being all of Marble. All the <hi>Dervies</hi> of this House went half a League from the City, as far as Mount <hi>Ozelet,</hi> to meet the Grand <hi>Signor;</hi> and the Superiour, at the Head of the rest, having made a Speech to his Highness, two <hi>Dervies</hi> came and made their obeisance in particular. Which being perform'd, from that place to the Castle of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> for half an hours march together; they went just before the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Horse, turning round continually with all their might, 'till they soam'd again at the Mouth, and dazl'd the Eyes of those that beheld them. There are some of these <hi>Dervies</hi> that will turn in that manner for two hours together, and glory in that which we account folly.</p>
                     <p>While the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> staid at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Cayro</hi> came thither with a thousand <hi>Janizaries:</hi> And indeed, there never was a sight of Men more active, or better order'd. Every one of them had Scarlet Breeches that reach'd down to their Ancles, with a <hi>Turkie-</hi>Robe of <hi>English</hi> Cloth, and, a Wast-coat of Calicut painted with several Colours. The most part had Buttons of Gold and Silk; and as well their Girdles as their Scimitars were adorn'd with Silver. The <hi>Basha</hi> march'd at the Head of this Magnificent Regiment in a modest Garb; but the Harness of his Horse was as rich as his Habit seem'd to be careless, having spar'd for no Cost to appear before the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> in a stately Equipage.</p>
                     <p>There is a necessity for a Man to stay some time at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> as well to dispose of his Affairs, and in expectation 'till the <hi>Caravan</hi> be ready, unless he will venture himself alone without a Guide, which I have done more than once. And thus much for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> next to <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Cayro,</hi> the most considerable City in all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of several Roads in general from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Road through the great Desert.</head>
                     <p>THere are five principal Roads from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> which being added to those other Roads which I have describ'd, through <hi>Natolia,</hi> make seven Roads into <hi>Persia,</hi> parting from <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> or <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of the five Roads, setting out from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> is upon the left hand, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Summer-East, through <hi>Diarbek</hi> and <hi>Tauris.</hi> The second directly East, by <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> through <hi>Moussul</hi> and <hi>Amadan.</hi> The third upon the right hand, toward the Winter-East, through <hi>Bagdat</hi> and <hi>Kengavar.</hi> The fourth somewhat more to the South, crossing a little Desert, through <hi>Anna, Bagdat,</hi> and <hi>Balsara.</hi> The fifth through the great Desert, which is an extraordinary Road, never travel'd but once a year, when the Merchants of <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> go to buy Camels. Of these Roads I intend to treat distinctly, and in several Chapters. And first of the Road through the great Desert.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravans</hi> that go to <hi>Balsara</hi> this way never set out 'till the Rains are fal'n, that they may not want Water in the Desert: and the Rain seldom holds up 'till <hi>December.</hi> This <hi>Caravan,</hi> with which I travel'd, set out upon <hi>Christmas-</hi>day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about six hundred Camels, and four hundred Men, Masters and Servants together: the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> being only on Horse-back, and riding before, to find Water, and convenient places to lodge in.</p>
                     <p>I must confess I had the convenience my self to ride my own Horse, which I kept all the while I was at <hi>Aleppo.</hi> A liberty permitted the <hi>Franks</hi> only at <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Aleppo:</hi> for at <hi>Damas, Seyde,</hi> or <hi>Cayro,</hi> none but the Consuls are suffer'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106224:47"/>
to keep Horses: others can only keep or hire Asses, which stand ready in the publick Streets at all times.</p>
                     <p>The next day we dislodg'd by day-break, and by noon we came to a place where there were five Wells, about five hundred Paces distant one from the other. The Water was excellent, and eaus'd us to replenish our <hi>Borache's:</hi> and about four a Clock in the Afternoon, we lay at a place where there was no Water.</p>
                     <p>The next day near noon we met with two Wells, but the Water was not good, and only the Camels drank of it; there we also lodg'd that night.</p>
                     <p>Having now travel'd two days in the Desert, I will describe it in a few words. You begin to enter upon it two or three Leagues from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where by degrees you meet with nothing but Tents instead of Houses. It stretches out to the Winter-East, all along the <hi>Euphrates</hi> to <hi>Balsara,</hi> and the Shoar of the Gulf of <hi>Persia;</hi> and upon the South to the Chain of Mountains that divides it from <hi>Arabia Petraea</hi> and <hi>Arabia the Happy.</hi> These Deserts are almost quite thorough nothing but Plains of Sand, which in some places lye looser than in others; and are hardly passable 'till the Rains are but newly fal'n, and have knit the Sands together. 'Tis a rare thing to meet with a Hill or a Valley in these Deserts; if you do, there is as surely Water, and as many Bushes as will serve to boyl a little Rice. For throughout the whole Desert there is no Wood to be found; and all the Bavins and Charcoal that you can load upon Camels at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> will not last above eight or ten days. Therefore you must take notice, that of six hundred Camels that pass through the Desert, there are searce fifty laden with Merehandize, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally course Cloth, some little Iron Ware, but chiefly black and blew Calicuts, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> make use of without ever whitening them. All the other Camels are only laden with Provision, and all little enough; so many People being to travel for so many days through so long a Tract of Ground where there is nothing in the World to sustain Life and Soul together.</p>
                     <p>For the first fifteen days travel we met with Water but once in two days, and sometimes not above once in three days. The twentieth day after we set out from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the <hi>Caravan</hi> lay at a place where there were two Wells, and the Water very good. Every one was glad of the convenience of washing his Linnen, and the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> made account to have staid there two or three days. But the News that we receiv'd, caus'd us to alter our Resolutions. For we had no seener giv'n order to dress our Suppers, when we saw a Courier with three <hi>Arabs,</hi> all mounted upon Dromedaries, who were sent to carry the news of the Taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Aleppo</hi> and other Cities of the Empire. They stop'd at the Wells to let their Beasts drink; and immediately the <hi>Caravan-Bashi,</hi> and the principal persons of the <hi>Caravan</hi> made them a small Present of dry'd Fruits and Granates. Who thereupon were so kind as to tell us, that the Camels which carry'd the Baggage belonging to the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> and his Train being tyr'd, his Officers would be sure to seize upon ours, if they should chance to meet with us: they advis'd us moreover not to come near <hi>Anna,</hi> lest the <hi>Emir</hi> should stop us.</p>
                     <p>Upon this news, we departed three hours after midnight; and keeping directly to the South, we put our selves into the midst of the Desert.</p>
                     <p>Eight days after we came to lye at a place where were three Wells, and three or four Houses. We staid there two days to take fresh Water, and we were just setting forward again, when thirty Horsemen well mounted came from one of the <hi>Emirs,</hi> to tell the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> that he must stop his <hi>Caravan.</hi> We staid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently for him three days; and at length he came, and was presented by the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> with a piece of Satin, half a piece of Searlet Cloth; and two large Copper Cauldrons. Now although those Cauldrons could not but be very acceptable to an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, who most certainly had none such in his Kitchin, yet he did not seem contented with his Present, and demanded above four hundred Crowns. We contested seven or eight days to have kept our Money in our Pockets, but in vain; so that we were forc'd to rate one another, and to raise him his Sum; which being paid, he treated the chief of the <hi>Caravan</hi> with Pilaw, Honey, and Dates, and when he went away, gave them five or six Sheep ready boyl'd.</p>
                     <p>Three days after we had left this <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, we met with two Wells near certain old decay'd Brick Buildings. The Water of those Wells was so hitter, that the Camels would not drink it: however we fill'd our <hi>Borache's,</hi> thinking
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106224:48"/>
it would have left its bitterness by being boyl'd: but we found the contrary.</p>
                     <p>From those two Wells that were good for nothing, we travel'd six days before we met with any Water, which with the three days before, made nine; and all that time the Camels never drank, as I have hinted already. At the end of nine days we cross'd a Hilly Country for three Leagues together, at the feet of three of which Hills there were three standing Pools. The Camels, that smelt the Water half a League off, put themselves upon their great trot, which is their manner of running, and no sooner came to the Pools but they crouded in all together, which caus'd the Water to be thick and muddy. Thereupon the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> resolv'd to stay there two or three days together, 'till the Water was setl'd. Here we had also the opportunity to boyl us some Rice, there being good store of Bushes that grew about the Lake. But above all, the People were over-joy'd that they had an opportunity to make Bread, which they do after the following manner. First they dig a round Hole in the Ground, half a Foot deep, and two or three in diameter, which they croud full of Bushes, and then set them on fire, covering them with Bricks or Stones 'till they are red-hot. In the mean while they prepare their Dough upon a <hi>Sofra,</hi> or round piece of Copper, which serves at other times for Table and Table-Cloth to eat upon. Then they take away the Ashes and Bricks, and making the Hole very clean, put in their Dough, and cov'ring it again with the hot Bricks or Stones, leave it so 'till the morning. The Bread thus bak'd is very well tasted, not being above two Fingers thick, and as big as an ordinary Cake.</p>
                     <p>While we stay'd at the three Ponds, I spent my time in killing Hares and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, of which there was very great plenty in those parts. The night before we departed we fill'd our <hi>Boracho's</hi> again, the Water being very good and clear; though it be nothing but Rain-water preserv'd in those Cavities, which in the Summer are dry again.</p>
                     <p>But now the <hi>Caravan-Bashi,</hi> seeing we had travel'd already nine days without finding any Water, resolv'd to leave the South, and to keep to the West; and if he met not with Water in two or three days, to take to the North-East, or Winter-East, in quest of the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two days after we had chang'd our Road, we pass'd between two little Hills, where we met with a Pond, near to which were two <hi>Arabians,</hi> each with his Wife and Children, tending a Herd of Goats and a Flock of Sheep. They told us they were going toward <hi>Moussui,</hi> and put us in the best Road to find Water; and indeed, from that place to <hi>Balsara,</hi> we never travel'd three days together, but we met with enough.</p>
                     <p>Five days after we had left those two <hi>Arabians,</hi> we discover'd a large Palace all of Brick; which shew'd some probability, that the Country had been formerly sow'd, and that the Bricks had been burnt with the Straw. To the Palace belong'd three large Courts; in every one of which were fair Buildings, with two Stories of Arches, one-upon another. Though this large Pile was standing, yet no body liv'd in it, nor could the <hi>Arabians,</hi> very ignorant in Antiquity, tell us by whom it was built. Before the Gate of the Palace there is a Lake with a Channel, the bottom whereof is brick'd, as also the Arch, which is even with the Ground. This the <hi>Arabians</hi> believe to have been a conveyance of Water from <hi>Euphrates:</hi> which surely could never be, in regard that <hi>Euphrates</hi> is above twenty Leagues distant.</p>
                     <p>From that Palace we kept to the North-East, and after we had travel'd five days, we arriv'd at a pitiful Town, formerly call'd <hi>Cufa,</hi> now <hi>Meched-Ali,</hi> where <hi>Ali, Mahomet</hi>'s Son-in-law lyes buried in a plain <hi>Mosquee.</hi> Generally there stand four Tapers lighted about the Tomb, and certain Lamps burning over-head, which are fasten'd to the Roof.</p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Persians</hi> have <hi>Ali</hi> in so much veneration, yet they rarely go in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to his Tomb. The reason is, because that there being no way to come at it, but through <hi>Bagdat,</hi> which is under the Dominion of the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> there is a demand of eight <hi>Piaesters</hi> from every Pilgrim; which is an Imposition that no way pleases the King of <hi>Persia. Sha-Abas</hi> scorning that his Subjects should be tributary to the <hi>Turks,</hi> endeavour'd to divert them from this Pilgrimage by another sort of Devotion, which he set up at <hi>Meshéed,</hi> upon the Road from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Candahar.</hi> Nor have the Kings his Successors been less unwilling to give their Subjects leave to visit their Prophet <hi>Ali,</hi> taking it for an Affront to pay Tribute to the Grand <hi>Signor.</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:106224:48"/>
Which is the reason that this <hi>Mosquee</hi> is no more enrich'd by the <hi>Persians.</hi> For besides the Lamps and Tapers that burn continually, there are only two <hi>Moullah's</hi> that read the <hi>Alcoran</hi> according to custom. In this Town there are only three or four bad Wells of brackish Water, and a dry Channel, which they say <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> made to bring the Water of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to the Town for the benefit of the Pilgrims. As for Food, we met with nothing but Dates, Grapes, and Almonds, which the people sold at a dear rate. When any Pilgrims come thither, which is very rare, and that they want Victuals, the <hi>Sheck</hi> causes a distribution to be made among them of Rice boyl'd with Water and Salt, and a little Butter pour'd a top. For there is no Pasturage for Cattel, and by consequence there can be no store of Food.</p>
                     <p>Two days journey from <hi>Ali</hi>'s Town, by nine of the Clock in the morning we met two young <hi>Arabian</hi> Lords that took upon them the name of <hi>Sultans.</hi> They were two Brothers, one of the age of seventeen years, the other of thirteen; and as we pitch'd our Tents, they pitch'd theirs close by us; which were of a very fine Scarlet Cloth; and among the rest there was one cover'd with Purple Velvet, lac'd with a rich Galoon-lace. So soon as they were setl'd in their Tents, the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> and I went to wait upon them; who understanding that there were <hi>Franks</hi> in the <hi>Caravan,</hi> ask'd me whether I had any Curiosities to sell them; but when I made them answer that I had nothing worthy their purchase, they would not believe me, and therefore commanded the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> to fetch my Trunks, that they might be open'd in their presence. While they were opening, one of the chief persons about those Princes would not suffer any of the rest of the <hi>Arabs</hi> to come near, for though most of the <hi>Arabs</hi> are great Thieves, yet some of them are persons of great integrity. Now I had in my company a young Painter, who had in his Chest several engrav'd Cuts, part Landskips, part Figures, together with the Pictures of certain Courtisans drawn to the Wast. The young Lords made choice only of twenty of those Courtisans, which I would have presented to them; but they gave me to understand, that they knew how to pay for what they had, and especially the youngest, who seem'd to be very generous; him I pleas'd in an extraordinary manner; for his Teeth being very foul, I order'd a Chirurgeon that I carry'd along with me at the same time to clean them, which he did to the great satisfaction of the young Prince. Thereupon they sent me and my Train, of their best Victuals they had. The <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> presented them with half a piece of Scarlet, and two pieces of Tissue of Gold and Silver. When we were ready to go, the young <hi>Sultan</hi> gave me twelve Ducats for my Pictures, and sent the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> and my self two Frails of the best Dates that we had met with since we lest <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About midnight the Princes dislodg'd, and took to the North, toward <hi>Euphrates.</hi> We set forward after them, driving Northward toward the same River. After we had travel'd four days we met one of the most potent <hi>Emirs</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who coming from the South, and going Northward, was to cross the Road that we kept. He was about fifty years of age, well made, and of a comely presence. He had not then above two thousand Horse, of thirty thousand which we heard had pass'd by some days before. Behind the two thousand Horse were fifty Camels that carry'd his Women; their <hi>Cajavas</hi> being cover'd with Scarlet-cloth fring'd with Silk. In the midst of these Camels there were six encompass'd with Eunuchs, the Fringes of the <hi>Cajavas</hi> being Silk, Silver, and Gold. The <hi>Arabians</hi> do not seem to be jealous of their Wives, as in <hi>Turkie</hi> and other places; for they led their Camels by our <hi>Caravan,</hi> never requiring us to retire, as is the custom in other places. They lodg'd a quarter of a League off, where we thought to have pitch'd, for the conveniency of two or three Ponds, which they depriv'd us of. This <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince had a great number of lovely Horses richly harness'd: others he had that were neither sadl'd nor bridl'd, yet the Riders would turn them with a Wand which way they pleas'd, and upon a full gallop would stop 'em, by only holding them by the Hair. He had some Horses of an excessive price; and this is to be observ'd, that they are never shod.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> believing he should not escape scot-free from so powerful a Prince, among the Merchants of the <hi>Caravan</hi> found out a rich Saddle, with Bridle and Stirrups, which were all set out and garnish'd with massy Silver, with an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106224:49"/>
embroider'd Quiver full of Arrows, together with a Buckler, the whole coming to about eleven or twelve hundred Livers; and adding to these of his own a piece of Scarlet, four pieces of Tissue of Gold and Silk, and six pieces of Tissue of Silver and Silk, made a Present of all together to the <hi>Emir.</hi> But he refus'd all, demanding only two hundred thousand <hi>Piasters</hi> for <hi>Larins:</hi> which exchange being no way for the Merchants profit, rais'd a great dispute. But at length, considering that it was in his power to stop and starve us there, we only endeavour'd a Composition; which was obtain'd. Thereupon he took the Present, which perhaps he would not else have done. For two days that we staid to weigh the Money, he sent Provisions to the chief of the <hi>Caravan;</hi> and at our departure, he sent us twelve Frails of Dates, and four young Camels that might be worth about forty Crowns a-piece.</p>
                     <p>Two days after we met a <hi>Schek,</hi> who among the <hi>Arabians</hi> is one of the chief of the Law. He was going to <hi>Mecca,</hi> cross some part of <hi>Arabia the Happy,</hi> with a Train of ten or twelve Camels. He staid all night with us, and one of his Servants having been dangerously wounded about two days before with a Musket-bullet, my Chirurgeon drest him, and gave him Salve and Tents, for which he was extremely thankful. He sent me to Supper a great Dish of Pilaw, and the next day a whole Sheep. The <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> likewise presented him with two Ells of Scarlet.</p>
                     <p>The next we met with nothing worth observation, but the day following we met another <hi>Emir,</hi> of about Five and Twenty years of age, who came from <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and was travelling into the <hi>Happy Arabia.</hi> He had with him about five hundred Horse, and three hundred Camels that carry'd his women. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sent to know what <hi>Caravan</hi> it was, and understanding that it consisted of many <hi>Franks,</hi> among whom there was a <hi>Chirurgeon:</hi> He sent again to desire the <hi>Caravan Bashi</hi> to follow with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> to the place where he intended to pitch his Tents, which was not far out of the way. We did not think to have gone so far that day, but he led us to the best water in all the Desert. The Princes Tent being set up, he sent for my <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> with whom I went along to know what his pleasure was. He had upon his left Arm a Tetter, with a most filthy Scab as broad as a Crown piece; and this went and came at certain times in the year. He presently ask'd the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> whether he could cure him? to whom the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> made answer, that the cure was not impossible, provided he knew where to get such remedies as were convenient: For had he said, he could have abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely cur'd him, the <hi>Emir</hi> would have carry'd him away with him, without any farther Ceremony. Thereupon he would have giv'n the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns to have bought Medicines. But I made answer, that the cure would not cost so much, and that if the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> could meet with proper Drugs, I would lay out the Money my self. The <hi>Emir</hi> content with that answer, sent one of his chief People to <hi>Balsara,</hi> to come back with the <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> when he had bought his Medicines. He himself stay'd three days in expectation of him; but after we had pretended to seek for what we wanted, up and down the Town (for we enquired for such things as we knew were not to be had) we sent him back word that we could not find what we look'd for, and desir'd his excuse, in regard the attendance of the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> would be of no use, where he had not proper remedies; which was the only way we could think of, to get cleverly rid of him.</p>
                     <p>The next days Journey after we had left the <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, was through a Country altogether uninhabited; but the day following, which was the sixty-fifth and last day of our being in the Desert, we met after some time, with the ruines of some houses on both sides the way; which made us conjecture, that some great City had stood formerly in that place.</p>
                     <p>At length we came to <hi>Balsara,</hi> which I shall describe in another place.</p>
                     <p>While I stay'd at <hi>Balsara,</hi> which was about three weeks, an Ambassador from the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> arriv'd there, who from <hi>Constantinople</hi> went to <hi>Bagdat</hi> to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> for the Conquest of that City which he had taken in so short a time. The Emperour presented him with three stately Horses, and a little Watch, the Case whereof was set with Diamonds and Rubies. But the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador not knowing what belong'd to that little Engin, winding it up the wrong way, broke the string. Coming to <hi>Balsara</hi> he sent to the <hi>Carmelites</hi> to desire them to mend his Watch; for he fear'd the loss of his head, should he return to his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106224:49"/>
Master and not shew him the Watch entire. It wat at their House that I then lay; and therefore not knowing what to do with it, they desir'd me to shew my skill: Thereupon I put on a new string. But the Ambassador when he understood to whom he was beholding, though it were but a trifle, profer'd me all the service and kindness imaginable. Thereupon the <hi>Carmelites</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> Fryars desir'd me to request of the Ambassador in their behalf, that he would obtain the Great <hi>Turks</hi> protection for them, in case he took <hi>Balsara,</hi> that their Houses and Churches might be preserv'd; which I did, and obtain'd by his means full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Grand <hi>Visier.</hi> But they had no need of it, for the <hi>Turks</hi> did not make any attempt upon <hi>Balsara,</hi> hearing that the <hi>Persians</hi> were advancing; besides that the rainy season was at hand, which will not permit an Army to keep the Field: So that had <hi>Bagdat</hi> held out eight days longer; the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> would have been constrain'd to have rais'd the Siege.</p>
                     <p>Having spoken of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Horses; I must needs say, that there are some that are valu'd at a very high rate. The <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Ambassador gave for some three, four, and six thousand Crowns, and for another he offer'd eight thousand Crowns, but the Horse would not be sold under ten, and so he left it. When he was got home into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and had presented the <hi>Mogul</hi> those Horses which he had carry'd along with him, being very lovely Creatures; he told his Master how he had offer'd eight thousand Crowns for a Horse more beautiful than any of them; but because the Owner would not let him go under ten, he left him. The King incens'd that his Ambassador had stood for so small a Sum, when it was for one of the greatest Monarchs in the World, upbraided the poorness of his Spirit, and banish'd him for ever from his presence, into a Province far distant from the Court. Thereupon the King wrote to the <hi>English</hi> to buy him the Horse, who accordingly did so, and brought him to <hi>Surat,</hi> where the Governour re-paid them their Money. But the Horse dy'd at <hi>Brampour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor must I forget, that while I was at <hi>Balsara,</hi> twice there flew by such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of Locusts, that a-far-off they appear'd like a Cloud, and darkn'd the Air. They pass by <hi>Balsara</hi> four or five times in the year, the Wind carrying them into the Desert, where they alight, and most certainly dye. Should they not be thus wind-driv'n, there could nothing live upon the Earth in some parts of <hi>Chaldea.</hi> They swarm all along the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, and when the Vessels come to <hi>Ormus</hi> at the time of the year, there are little Shops where people sell Locusts fry'd in Butter to those that love that sort of Diet. Once I had the curiosity to open the Belly of a Locust six Inches long, and found therein seventeen little ones that stirr'd; whence it is easie to guess how those Insects come to be so numerous, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in hot Countries.</p>
                     <p>There are several Barks that go from <hi>Ormus</hi> to furnish both sides of the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, where the people eat neither Bread nor Rice. I agreed with the Master of one of these Barks, and made my agreement that the Bark should not be above half laden; for generally they lade them too deep, and in foul weather they are forc'd to throw half the Freight over-board, to save the rest.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Balsara</hi> to the mouth of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it is reck'nd to be twenty Leagues of Fresh-water. We staid seven whole days for a Wind, which proving favourable, we came to <hi>Brander-ric,</hi> in forty-eight hours. This is the place where you must land, if you intend for <hi>Persia,</hi> unless you are bound for <hi>Ormus. Brander-ric</hi> consists only of five or six little Fishers Hutts; which Hutts are only Hurdles set one against another, and cover'd over, where they and their Families live. To the same place come Asses lad'n with Dates, which I was forc'd to hire for want of Horses.</p>
                     <p>We were six days upon the Road from thence to <hi>Cazerom.</hi> This is a Mountainous Country, where there is Wood enough; but you must lodge in the Fields, for there are no Inns upon the Road. The way is pleasant in some places, along the Banks of several Rivulets, and through verdant Groves stor'd with great quantities of Turtles. We kill'd a good many; which we eat, part with Pilaw, instead of Henns; some we rosted; making Sticks to serve for Spits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cazerom</hi> is a little City ill built, where there is but one Inn, and that none of the most inviting to Strangers neither.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Cazerom</hi> to <hi>Schiras</hi> it is five days journey. The Road lyes over very craggy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106224:50"/>
Mountains, which had been impassable, but for the Liberality of <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Schiras.</hi> He made Ways where there were none before, and joyn'd Mountains together by Bridges, in Countries which otherwise had been inaccessible. In the midst of the Mountains is a wide gap or discontinuance, from whence a Plain extends it self of about twenty Leagues in circuit. It is inhabited by <hi>Jews</hi> only, who are Silk-Weavers. In these Mountains you meet with Tents, where the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> sojourn, that come for cool Air and Pasturage in the Summer.</p>
                     <p>Coming to <hi>Schiras,</hi> I took Horse there for <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where I arriv'd in nine days. The Country over which you travel, between these two Cities, is part Plains, part Mountains; part wild, and part manur'd. Three days journey from <hi>Schiras</hi> you pass the Mountain of <hi>Mayen,</hi> a little City where there is nothing worthy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Two days journey from thence you enter upon the Plains of the Province of <hi>Cuscuzar,</hi> where the King of <hi>Persia</hi> keeps his Race-Horses. The next day I arriv'd at <hi>Yesdecas,</hi> where the best Bread in <hi>Persia</hi> is made. This is a little City upon a Rock, wherein there is a very fair Inn: at the foot whereof runs a little River that glides into the Valley, wherein grows that excellent Corn which is utter'd in Bread from that City.</p>
                     <p>In three days I went from <hi>Yesdecas</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> This was the first Road from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                     <p>I Departed from <hi>Paris</hi> in my third Voyage to the <hi>Indies</hi> upon the sixth of <hi>December</hi> 1643, and went to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> where I found the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet ready to set Sail for the <hi>Levant.</hi> The Vessel wherein I embark'd seeming rather a Man-of-War than a Merchant-Man. We pass'd through the Channel of <hi>Messina,</hi> and lay there at an Anchor four days before the City. From thence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the <hi>Morea,</hi> we enter'd into the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where the Fleet parted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as every Ship was bound. Our Ship sayl'd directly for the Port of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta,</hi> but though the Wind were favourable, we were stop'd for some time by a Pirate that met with us off the Eastern Point of <hi>Candy.</hi> We endeavour'd to have got clear of him; but the Pirate gaining upon us, we made ready. Thereupon the Pirate gave us three Broad-sides, that went over the Ship without doing us any harm: which we answer'd by as many from our Ship, the first whereof brought his Fore-mast by the Board; and the third Shot went through the Fore-castle and kill'd him some Men, as far as we could discern. At that very instant one of our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cry'd out from the Top-mast-head, <hi>A Sail from the South.</hi> Thereupon the Pirate left us, and made Sail after her: and we, glad of such an escape, pursu'd our Voyage to <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> where we happily arriv'd; from whence I took Horse for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> as I have already describ'd.</p>
                     <p>The sixth of <hi>March</hi> I departed from <hi>Aleppo</hi> in the company of two <hi>Capuchin</hi> Friars, Father <hi>Raphael</hi> and Father <hi>Yves,</hi> and a <hi>Venetian</hi> whose name was <hi>Dominico de Sanctis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Bir,</hi> where you cross the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it is four days journey for the Horse-<hi>Caravan.</hi> The Country is well wooded, and well manur'd.</p>
                     <p>The seventh of <hi>March</hi> the great Rains that fell hinder'd us from getting to the usual Stage, so that we could not gain <hi>Telbechar,</hi> another Town, where there is no Inn: which constrain'd us to stop a League on this side, and to go to a Cave that was able to contain three hundred Horse. This is a Cave where the <hi>Bedouins</hi> or Feeders of Cattel thereabouts oft retire, who live after the manner of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> either in Rocks or in poor Hutts. The Cave has been hollow'd from time to time, there being several Niches in it like little Chambers. Our <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> fearing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106224:50"/>
some <hi>Ambuscade,</hi> rode thither before to view the place, but finding it empty and free, we rested there that night, and the next night came to lye at <hi>Mezara,</hi> which is only a small Village without an Inn: Neither was there any thing remarkable upon that Road. Only that near the Cave, in the Mountain, there is very good Water: And formerly upon the Mountain stood a Castle, of which some ruines are still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. From the top of the Mountain there is a fair Prospect as far as you can see, over very fair Plains on every side, and in several places very good Land, water'd by divers Channels which are brought from the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> All the Rivolets also that you cross from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Bir</hi> come from the same River.</p>
                     <p>The fourth day after we parted from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> being the ninth of <hi>March,</hi> we came to the banks of <hi>Euphrates. Bir</hi> is on the other side of the River; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that sometimes the Goods cannot be unladen all in a day; there is a fair and large Inn, to defend the Merchants from the <hi>Bedoüins,</hi> which would else disturb and rob them, were not they and their Goods in that manner secur'd.</p>
                     <p>You cross the <hi>Euphrates</hi> in large Ferry Boats, and as soon as you are got over the other side of the River, the Customer and his Officers comes and tells the Bales, and writes down the names of the Merchants to whom they belong. The <hi>Caravan</hi> does not lye in the Town, which is built like an <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> upon the brow of a very craggy Mountain, but passes forward over a scurvy Road to an Inn upon the top of the Mountain. Near the Inn there are several Chambers cut out of the Rock, where they that cannot get room in the Inn are forc'd to lye. That Evening the Custom-Officer comes to receive his duties, being two <hi>Piasters</hi> upon every load of Goods, whether upon Horse or Mule, though the Mules carry more than the Horses; and half a <hi>Piaster</hi> for every Beast that carries Provisions. But for Saddle Horses or Mules there is nothing demanded.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bir,</hi> or <hi>Berygeon,</hi> as the Natives call it, is a large City for an Eastern City, scituated upon the brow of a Hill. Below upon the River stands a Castle that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares its Antiquity; it is half as long as the City, but narrow, and without any other Fortification, saving only a Tower that scours the River, in which there are eight or nine pitiful Culverins. In the highest part of the Town stands another Castle where the Governour resides, who is an <hi>Aga,</hi> whom some call a <hi>Basha,</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him two hundred <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and four hundred <hi>Spahi's.</hi> The City is ill built, as are the most part of the Cities of <hi>Turkie:</hi> But there are an extraordinary plenty of all things, excellent Bread, good Wine, and great store of the best sort of Fish.</p>
                     <p>The tenth day after we had travel'd elev'n hours in the first Lands of <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> that lyes between the two Rivers <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigre,</hi> which at present they call <hi>Diarbek,</hi> we came in the evening to <hi>Sharmely.</hi> This is a very good Town, with a fair Inn, and Baths round about it. About twice Musquet-Shot from thence, stands a Mountain alone by it self, like <hi>Montmartre</hi> near <hi>Paris:</hi> Round about it are Plains, and at the top of it stands a Fortress, with a Garrison of two hundred <hi>Spahi's,</hi> by reason that the <hi>Arabs</hi> sometimes cross <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and make incursions upon that side. In the year 1631, the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from <hi>Bagdat,</hi> where he had lost the greatest part of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Army, not being able to take the City; fearing the loss of his head if he return'd to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and knowing himself to be in great esteem among the Souldiers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to quarter himself upon this Mountain, and to erect a Fortress to secure himself from the tempest that threaten'd him. No doubt but'l if he could have brought about his design, he might have made himself Master of all <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and would have put the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> to a great deal of trouble. For if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> whither it be from <hi>Tauris, Mossul,</hi> or <hi>Bagdat,</hi> unless you travel tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Desert, you must pass through <hi>Sharmely,</hi> under the command of this Fortress, for Provision and Waters sake. The work was gone so far forward, that there was a good defence rais'd, and the <hi>Vizier</hi> had already enclos'd all the Mountain together with the Inn, with a Wall almost twenty foot thick, and three fathom high, when he was strangl'd by those in whom he most confided, the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> having gain'd them either by threats or by rewards.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh, after a Journey of ten hours we came to <hi>Ourfa,</hi> where the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> usually stays eight or ten days; for here it is that they live that hire the Horses and the Mules, who have always some business in this place. We lay at an Inn
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106224:51"/>
three or four hundred paces distant from the City toward the North. When the Inn is full, the rest retire into the <hi>Grotto's</hi> which are near at hand, and are very good quarters. Here the Toll-gatherer presently comes and counts the Bales without op'ning them. They that carry any Sacks must pay for half a Load; if not, he op'ns the Sack to see if there be any Merchandise therein, for then the Merchant must pay the whole duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ourfa</hi> is the Capital City of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> built as they say, in the same place where <hi>Abraham</hi> liv'd, and where stood the ancient <hi>Edessa,</hi> where the people of the Country report, that King <hi>Abagarus</hi> generally kept his Court. There are still to be seen the ruines of a Castle; from whence they add, that the same King sent to <hi>CHRIST</hi> for his Picture, and offer'd him his Kingdom and his people to defend him against the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he understood to be his Enemies. The Chronicles of the <hi>Armenians</hi> report, that <hi>Abagarus</hi> was their Country-man, and that in his Reign they began to be Christians, and to be Baptiz'd by the hands of an Apostle, whom <hi>CHRIST</hi> sent to that Prince after his Resurrection. * Neither is this Castle yet so far ruin'd, but that there is still to be seen a spacious Hall, and three or four hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Rooms with some relicks of Mosaick work. I was curious to see what ever was remarkable in this City. And first they led me to a large Fountain which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles a Fish-pond, the Spring whereof is under the Foundations of the principal <hi>Mosquèe,</hi> which was built in the honour of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Christians of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try say, that it was in that place where he pray'd, before he went about to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> and that two Springs of Water arose from the two places where he rested his knees, which now feed the large Fountain I have made mention of. It is pav'd with Free-stone, and so full of fish, that if you throw them in a little Bread, they will follow you from place to place as you walk by the side of the Pond. There is no medling with them; for the <hi>Turks</hi> have a great veneration for those Fish which they call <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fish. Besides that, the place about the Fountain where the water wid'ns it self to water all the City, is cover'd with very fair Carpets, for about twenty paces in bredth. This Fountain at length falls into a little River that runs by the Walls. As for the <hi>Grotto</hi> where the two Springs rise, there is no going into it before you have pull'd off your Shooes, and it is a great favour for a Christian to see it; such a favour as cost me six Piasters. I also saw the Church, under the portal whereof, they say, St. <hi>Alexis</hi> liv'd seventeen years a private life. It stands in the middle of a Church-yard, in the highest part of the Town, in the possession of the <hi>Armenians.</hi> But their principal Church is about a quarter of an hours walking from the City, built by St. <hi>Ephren,</hi> who is there buried. The Monastery stands yet entire, enclos'd with fair Walls. In the Church I saw a large Bible in <hi>Armenian</hi> Characters. The Sepulchre of St. <hi>Ephren</hi> is in a Cave at the foot of the Mountain, to which there also belongs a Chappel, where they keep three or four Lamps continually burning. There are other <hi>Grotto</hi>'s up and down the Mountain, where are to be seen very ancient Sepulchers of the Christians. The City of <hi>Ourfa</hi> is seated in a good soil, very well manur'd, which extends it self out of sight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the East. There are several pleasant Gardens near the walls, water'd by little Channels brought thither by Art. The soil produces good Wine, so that a man may live as well at <hi>Ourfa,</hi> as in any part of <hi>Turkie.</hi> While I stay'd there, I kill'd abundance of Feldfares in those Gardens; and indeed there is great store of wild Fowl all the Country over. The Walls of the City are of Freestone, with Battlements and Towers; but within, the houses are small, ill built, and ruinous: And there are several void spaces in the City, which makes <hi>Ourfa</hi> to look rather like a Desert than a Metropolis. The City is Govern'd by a <hi>Basha,</hi> who has under him a hundred and fifty <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and six hundred <hi>Spahi's,</hi> standing more in need of Cavalry than Infantry, by reason of the Incursions of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> especially in Harvest time. In short, <hi>Ourfa</hi> is the place were they dress such great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Cordovan Skins, by reason of the waters particular to the Country, which give them that peculiar beauty. The Yellow Skins are drest at <hi>Ourfa,</hi> the Blew at <hi>Tocat,</hi> and the red Rat <hi>Diarbequir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> we set out of <hi>Ourfa,</hi> and after a Journey of six hours, we lay at a pittiful Village where the Inn was fal'n all to decay. There is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of excellent water by it, which is all the convenience of the place, for there is no Provision to be had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106224:51"/>
The twenty-first we travel'd nine hours, and came to lye near several Caverns which are very deep; at the entry whereof there are little Rooms, which are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be the places where the People of the Country liv'd that fed their Cattel thereabouts. There is also Rain-Water to be had in some of the Concavities of the Rock. Half this days journey you must pass over Rocks, where it is almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and very dangerous to keep your Horses back.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-second, having travel'd eleven hours, we lodg'd near a Cavern, having forded a River that runs at the foot of it. There are two great <hi>Grotto's</hi> on each side, where Travellers take up their Quarters, and whither the Natives of the Country bring Provisions both for Horse and Man. The Toll-gatherers, coming from a Fort about three Leagues distant from these Caverns, here exact two <hi>Piasters</hi> and a half for every Horse and Mules Load; and search your Sacks, to see if there be no Merchantable Goods therein. About half the way of this days journey you meet with a City quite deserted by the Inhabitants; and about an hours march after that, with Tombs of Stone, in the middle whereof stands a Cross, with <hi>Armenian</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-third we travel'd elev'n hours, and lay at <hi>Dadacardin.</hi> This appears to have been a great Town, but is all ruin'd: nor is there any thing remaining but a long Stone-Bridge very well built, under which runs a River that is very broad when it overflows. The People of the Country have no other Habitations than the Hollows of Rocks; yet they bring to the Travellers Hens, Butter, Cheese, and other Provisions which they sell very cheap.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fourth we travel'd nine hours, and lay at a place call'd <hi>Cara,</hi> built upon a Hill. The <hi>Caravan</hi> lay at the Inn; but the two <hi>Capuchins</hi> and I lay at a private Christian's House, who carry'd us to the Church, where was then the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabet</hi> or Bishop of <hi>Merdin.</hi> It was a pitiful poor Church, where they had nothing but two Planks supported with four Sticks instead of an Altar. They dare not leave any Furniture in it; but as soon as the Priest has said Service, he must have a care to take away every thing, as well the Planks as the Covering of the Altar, which was only a Painted Cloth: For the <hi>Turks</hi> that travel that way, if it be foul weather, will break open the Door, put their Horses there, burn the Altar, and take away whatever they find.</p>
                     <p>In the Village where we lay, there was a Pond, the sides whereof were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with fair Free-stones, which were fetch'd from the Christian Churches, and the Tombs of the Christians thereabouts. Among the rest, there was one very large Stone, with an Epitaph upon it in large <hi>Latin</hi> Letters; whereby we knew it to be the Tomb-stone of a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman, who had been a Captain of Foot. The Bishop inform'd us, that it is recorded in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Stories, that the <hi>French</hi> were a long time in this Country, at what time the Christians were Masters of <hi>Syria.</hi> This Country is all a large Plain, about twenty Leagues in length; which might be well manur'd, and make the Inhabitants rich, did not the Tyranny of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Incursions of the <hi>Arabs</hi> reduce them to the utmost degree of Poverty.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fifth, after we had travel'd eight hours, we lay at a Village call'd <hi>Cousasar,</hi> where there was no Inn. There were formerly three great Monasteries, a quarter of a League one from the other. The <hi>Turks</hi> have ruin'd two, all but the Steeples of the Churches that belong'd to them. The third, which stands all entire, and is the fairest Pile of Building, serves for a <hi>Mosquee.</hi> They have made Shops round about the Cloysters, in the middle of which is a fair Spring of Water.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-seventh we lay still at <hi>Cousasar,</hi> being the place where you must pay the Customs of <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> which is not above two days journey off, amounting to two <hi>Piasters</hi> and a fourth part, for every Load of Merchants Goods.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Merdin</hi> is not above two Leagues from <hi>Cousasar.</hi> This is a little City seated upon a Mountain, with good Walls, and a fair Fountain replenish'd from the Castle; which stands upon the North side, in a place yet higher, that commands the City; where there lives a <hi>Basha,</hi> who has under him two hundred <hi>Spahi's,</hi> and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Janizaries. Merdin</hi> is the place where was born the Lady <hi>Maani Gioerida,</hi> the first Wife of <hi>Pietro de la Valle,</hi> so well known for his famous Travels.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Cousasar,</hi> which is a large Village, it is inhabited for the most part by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> Christians and <hi>Nestorians.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> perform Divine Service in their own Language; the <hi>Nestorians</hi> in the <hi>Chaldaïc.</hi> The latter shew'd me two Bibles
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106224:52"/>
in a large Volume, in the same Language, writt'n in Vellum, all the Capital Letters being in Gold and Azure. They seem'd to be very old; and one of their Priests told me, that it is 937 years ago since one of them was writt'n; the other not above 374 since. When Service is done, they put them in a Chest, and hide them under Ground. I would have giv'n 200 <hi>Piasters</hi> for the oldest, but they durst not sell it, in regard it belong'd to the Church, and was not at their disposal.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-seventh, after we had travel'd nine hours, we arriv'd at <hi>Karasara,</hi> which had been formerly a great Town, and no doubt inhabited by Christians; as appears by seven or eight Churches half ruin'd, though the Steeples are little the worse. They stand at a good distance one from the other; and upon the North-side of one of those Churches there is a Gallery, at the end whereof, through a little Door you descend about a hundred Steps, every Step being ten Inches thick. When you come under the Church, you meet with a larger and bigger Vault, supported with Pillars. The Building is so contriv'd, that there is more light below than in that above; but of late years the Earth has stop'd up several Windows. The great Altar is in the Rock; on the right side whereof is a Room, which receives the light from several Windows contriv'd in the Rock. Over the Gate of the Church was a great Free-stone, wherein were certain Letters that I could not read. On the North-side of the same Church under Ground are to be seen two great Cisterns, each four hundred and fifty Paces long; with two great Arches, sustain'd with several Pillars. Every year they fill them with the Water that falls from the next Mountain, and makes a kind of a River. A quarter of a League from the Church, you descend the Mountain for above a hundred Paces together among the Rocks, on each side whereof are Rooms cut out of the Rock. Upon every Door there is a Cross; and in every Room as it were a Bench, and a Table, with a little place about the length of a Man, like a Bedsted, all cut out of the Rock. At the bottom of the Rock is a Hall, round about the Wall whereof is a Bench to sit on. The Roof is all plain, without any Arch; in the middle whereof there is a Hole to the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: but in regard it gives no light, 'tis very probable 'twas only made to let out the Smoak when they drest their Meat; or else to let in the fresh Air, as I have seen in many Villages upon the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf. Upon the highest of those Mountains stands a paltry Village, where they buy their Victuals. But before the <hi>Caravan</hi> arrives, certain Merchants ride before to inform themselves from the Herdsmen, whether they know of any Thieves in the <hi>Grotto's,</hi> that often hide themselves there in expectation of Prey.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1638, <hi>Sultan Amur at</hi> going to besiege <hi>Babylon,</hi> march'd this very way, as well to see these Ruines, as to give order for the demolishing a Fort that stood not above two Leagues off of <hi>Karasera,</hi> which the Thieves of the Country made their place of retreat. He also at the same time caus'd the Road to be clear'd for four days journey, by ord'ring the Stones to be pickt up and laid in heaps, all along the Road. He also built a Bridge over the River. And indeed, that March of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> was very advantageous to all Travellers that pass this way.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-eighth we travel'd eight hours, and came to <hi>Nesbin,</hi> anciently <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibis.</hi> Two or three hours travel on this side, near the Road, is a kind of Hermitage, being a small Room enclos'd with Walls, the Door whereof is so low, that a Man must creep upon his Belly to get in. Three or four <hi>Jews</hi> went and perform'd their Devotions at this Hermitage, believing it to be the place where the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> was buried.</p>
                     <p>The Country from <hi>Cousasar</hi> to <hi>Nesbin</hi> is a large Plain, where for the first days journey you shall see no other green Herb upon the Ground but only Pimpernel; the Roots whereof are so large, that there are some a Foot and a half in diameter. The next day, the Fields are cover'd with a large thick Leaf, the Root whereof is bulbous, and as big as an Egg. There are also great store of yellow, red, and violet Flowers, Tulips of several colours, Emonies, and single Daffadillies. But in general <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> is a very barren Country, and there are very few places that can be better'd by Art or Industry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nesbin</hi> is only the Shadow of the ancient <hi>Nisibis,</hi> being now only a large Village; the Inhabitants whereof are Christians, both <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Nestorians.</hi> Our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan</hi> lodg'd a little beyond, in a Church-yard adjoyning to one of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches. The next day, hearing people sing, I went to the Church with the two
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106224:52"/>
                        <hi>Capuchins,</hi> where I saw an <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishop, with his Miter, and a wooden Crosier, accompany'd with several Priests and a good Congregation. When Service was done, after some few Compliments between us, he led us down under the Church into a Chappel, where he shew'd us the Sepulcher of St. <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nisibis.</hi> In the Church-yard is a Stone about a Foot thick, and six high; upon which were laid several Candles of Wax and Tallow, which the Poor Offer in their Necessities, but especially in their Sicknesses. They believe that Stone to have been the Pedestal for the Statue of some Saint, which the <hi>Turks</hi> have defac'd: so that they give the same Honour to the Pedestal, as they would have giv'n to the Statue. There are also some <hi>Roman</hi> Characters to be seen, but half worn out, and spaces brok'n off in some parts: so that I could not learn, in Honour of whom that Statue was erected. Half a League from <hi>Nisbin</hi> runs a River, which you cross, over a Stone-Bridge. In the way to the River are several pieces of Wall, with an Arch, which made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that formerly the City extended as far as the River.</p>
                     <p>Twice Musket-shot from the River, you meet with a Stone, half buried, upon which are written certain <hi>Latin</hi> Words; whereby it appears that it was the Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the General of an Army that was a <hi>French-man:</hi> but I could not read his Name, which time had desac'd. The same Bishop inform'd us, that formerly the <hi>Moors</hi> having besieg'd the City, there came such a prodigious company of strange Flyes, and did so torment both Men and Horses, that they were forc'd to raise the Siege. You must pay the same Toll at <hi>Nisbin</hi> as in other places, that is, two <hi>Piasters</hi> and a half, for every Mule or Horses Load. We lay there three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to furnish our selves with Provisions 'till we came to <hi>Moussul,</hi> which is five days journey from <hi>Nisbin;</hi> the Country between being altogether desert and uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. There is no Water to be found but in two places, and that not very good neither; near to which you shall see some few Herdsmen grazing their Cattel.</p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>April</hi> we departed from <hi>Nisbin;</hi> and after we had travel'd eleven hours, we lay near to a River, whither certain Shepherds brought us Hens to sell.</p>
                     <p>The second we travel'd ten hours, and lay at a paltry Town, where we met with nothing to eat.</p>
                     <p>The third we travel'd thirteen hours, and lodg'd by a pitiful Fountain, the Water whereof was hardly good enough for our Horses.</p>
                     <p>The fourth we travel'd ten hours, and came to lodge by the Bank of a little River, near to which appear'd the Ruines of a Bridge and a Castle.</p>
                     <p>The fifth we travel'd eleven hours, to reach <hi>Moussul,</hi> which is not far from the ancient <hi>Niniveh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moussul</hi> is a City that makes a great shew without, the Walls being of Free-stone; but within it is almost all ruin'd, having only two blind Market-places, with a little Castle upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> where the <hi>Basha</hi> lives. In a word, there is nothing worth a Man's sight in <hi>Moussul,</hi> the place being only considerable for the great concourse of Merchants; especially the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Curds,</hi> which are the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the ancient <hi>Assyria,</hi> now call'd <hi>Curdistan,</hi> where there grows great plenty of Galls, and for which there is a great Trade. There are in it four sorts of Christians, <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Nestorians,</hi> and <hi>Maronites.</hi> The <hi>Capuchins</hi> had a pretty Dwelling upon the <hi>Tigris;</hi> but the <hi>Basha</hi> laying a Fine upon them, because they went about a little to enlarge it, they were forc'd to quit it. The City is govern'd by a <hi>Basha,</hi> that has under him, part <hi>Janizaries,</hi> part <hi>Spahi's,</hi> about three thousand Men.</p>
                     <p>There are only two scurvy Inns in <hi>Moussul,</hi> which being full when we came, I caus'd my Tent to be set up at the <hi>Meydan,</hi> or great Market-place.</p>
                     <p>Now to say something in general of the difference of the two Rivers, <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in reference to their Course and Waters: I observ'd that the Water of <hi>Euphrates</hi> appear'd somewhat red; and that the Stream was not so swift as that of <hi>Tigris,</hi> which seem'd to be whitish, like the <hi>Loire.</hi> As for its Course, <hi>Euphrates</hi> runs a far longer way than <hi>Tigris.</hi> But now let us cross the <hi>Tigris,</hi> over a Bridge of Boats, to view the sad Ruines of a City that has made such a noise in the World; though there be now scarce any appearance of its ancient splendour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Niniveh</hi> was built upon the left Shoar of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> upon <hi>Assyria-</hi>side, being now only a heap of Rubbish extending almost a League along the River. There are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106224:53"/>
abundance of Vaults and Caverns uninhabited; nor could a man well conjecture whether they were the ancient Habitations of the people, or whether any houses had been built upon them in former times; for most of the houses in <hi>Turkie</hi> are like Cellars, or else but one Story high. Half a League from <hi>Tigris</hi> stands a little Hill encompas'd with Houses, on the top whereof is built a <hi>Mosquée.</hi> The people of the Country say 'twas the place where <hi>Jonas</hi> was bury'd; and for that place they have so great a veneration, that no Christians are suffer'd to enter into it, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and for Money. By that means I got in with two <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryars; but we were forc'd to put off our Shooes first. In the middle of the <hi>Mosquée</hi> stood a Sepulchre, cover'd with a <hi>Persian</hi> Carpet of Silk and Silver, and at the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, great Copper Candlesticks with Wax Tapers, besides several Lamps and Ostridge-Shells that hung down from the Roof. We saw a great number of <hi>Moores</hi> without, and within sat two <hi>Dervi's</hi> reading the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About a Musket-Shot from <hi>Moussul</hi> toward the North-East, stands a great Ruin'd Monastery, enclos'd with high Walls, the greatest part whereof is still to be seen.</p>
                     <p>We stay'd ten days at <hi>Moussul,</hi> and having provided all things ready for the rest of our Journey, we set forward for <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>A Continuation of the Road from</hi> Nineveh <hi>to</hi> Ispahan: <hi>Together with the Story of an Ambassador, call'd</hi> Dominico de Santis.</head>
                     <p>HAving pass'd the <hi>Tigris,</hi> we stay'd three quarters of an hours Journey from <hi>Nineveh</hi> for some Merchants that were to go along with the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi> The way which we took was not the usual Road to <hi>Persia;</hi> but it was a way wherein there were less Duties to be paid; and besides, it was a short cut, the <hi>Caravan</hi> making but fifty-eight days Journey between <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Ispahan.</hi> From the very banks of the River to the place where we Lodg'd that Evening, we saw nothing but continu'd Ruines, which makes me believe, it was the place where the ancient <hi>Nineveh</hi> stood.</p>
                     <p>We stay'd two days near the <hi>Mosquée,</hi> where according to the tradition of the <hi>Turks, Jonas</hi> was bury'd, and made choice of a <hi>Curd,</hi> or <hi>Assyrian</hi> for our <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van-Basbi,</hi> though the people are generally Thieves, and must be carefully look'd after. But it was a piece of Policy, because we were to cross the ancient <hi>Assyria,</hi> now call'd <hi>Curdistan;</hi> the Language of which Country is a particular Speech.</p>
                     <p>In the two first days Journey we cross'd two small Rivers that fall from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and empty themselves into <hi>Tigris.</hi> Our first Journey was through a plain Country all along by the side of a little River; and the second Evening we lodg'd by the side of a great River that falls from the Mountains toward the North, and running to the South, discharges it self into <hi>Tigris.</hi> It is call'd <hi>Bohrus,</hi> being a very rapid Stream, full of Fish, but more especially excellent Trouts. The <hi>Caravan</hi> was two days passing that River, by reason there were no Boats. For the people are forc'd to tye long Perches four or five together one upon another, which the Natives call a <hi>Kilet.</hi> They make it four-square, and put underneath it about a hundred Goat-Skins full of wind, to the end the <hi>Kilet</hi> may not touch the water. Besides the Merchant must be careful to spread good store of thick Felts over the <hi>Kilet,</hi> of which he must be provided to keep off the Water, least the Bales that sink the <hi>Kilet</hi> should take wet. At the four corners are four Perches that serve for Oars, though they avail but little against the force of the Tide; so that you must be forc'd to hale the <hi>Kilet</hi> four or five hundred Paces a' this side up the River, and then row down the Stream to the place where you intend to Land the Goods. When the Goods are Landed, the men are forc'd again to draw the <hi>Kilet</hi> by main strength out of the water, to take away the Goat-Skins which are then to be lad'n upon the Mules appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to carry them. As for the Horses, Mules, and Asses, as well those that carri'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106224:53"/>
the Goods, as those upon which the Men ride; so soon as the Herds-men thereabout see a <hi>Caravan</hi> coming, they stock to the River-side. Those people that wear nothing but a course piece of Linnen or a Goat-skin to cover their nakedness, take off their Cloaths and wind them about their Heads, like a Turbant. Then every one tyes a Goat-skin blow'd up under his Stomach; and then two or three of the most expert mounting the same number of the best Horses, which are bridl'd, put themselves first into the Water, while others follow them swimming, and drive the Horses before them; holding the Beast by the Tayl with one Hand, and switching him with the other. If they find any Horse or Ass that is too weak, they tye a Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin under his Belly to help him. Considering which difficulties, it cannot take up less time than I have mention'd to get over a <hi>Caravan</hi> of five or six hundred Horses.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravan</hi> being thus got over, for two or three days has but a very bad Road. The first days journey, the Horses were continually in the Water up to the mid-leg; and the second, and part of the third we travel'd through a very desert Country, where we met with very little food, for our Horses, and only a few Brakes to boyl our Rice. Having got over this bad way, we came to a River call'd the great <hi>Zarbe,</hi> over which we pass'd upon a Stone-Bridge of nine Arches. They report that this Bridge was built by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, in his March against <hi>Darius.</hi> A quarter of a League to the South-East, two Rivers meet, which empty themselves into <hi>Tigris.</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bridge, we came to a Town call'd <hi>Sherazoul,</hi> built upon a rising Ground, upon three Redoubts. There resides a <hi>Basha,</hi> who must be brib'd with a small Present to let the <hi>Caravan</hi> pass; we lay by the Banks of a River, and staid there two days. From thence we travel'd one days journey over dry Mountains, not finding any Water. But the next day we came into a pleasant Plain, stor'd with Fruit-trees. This was the Plain of <hi>Arbele,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi> defeated <hi>Darius;</hi> containing about fifteen Leagues in all. It is water'd with several Rivulets, and in the middle of the Mountain rises a little Hill about half a League in circuit. It is all over cover'd with the fairest Oaks that ever were seen; and on the top are the Ruines of a Castle, that seems to have been a sumptuous Structure. The Country-people say that <hi>Darius</hi> staid there while his Captains gave Battel to <hi>Alexander.</hi> Three Leagues from thence, near a great Mountain toward the North, are to be seen the Ruines of another Castle and several Houses, where they add, that <hi>Darius</hi> secur'd some of his Wives when he lost the Battel. This Castle is seated in a most lovely Prospect. At the foot of the Mountain rises a Spring, which a quarter of a League off swells into a River that bears good big Boats. It runs winding about the Mountains to the Southward; so that two days journey from the Hill, you cross it near a Town call'd <hi>Sherazoul,</hi> over a fair Stone-Bridge of nine Arches, whereof the Great <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> caus'd three to be brok'n down, after he had tak'n <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This City of <hi>Sherazoul</hi> is built after another manner than any other of the Cities in those parts, being all cut out of a steep Rock for a quarter of a League together, so that you must go up to the Houses by Stairs of fifteen, or twenty steps, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, sometimes less, according to the situation of the place. The people have no other Doors to their Houses than only a thin round Stone, like a Mill-stone, which they will roll away when they go in or out, the sides of the Wall being so cut as to receive the Stone like a Case, being level with the Rock.</p>
                     <p>The tops of their Houses are like Niches in the Mountain, where the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have contriv'd Caves to keep their Cattel in: So that we judg'd it to be built for a place of safety to secure the Inhabitants from the Incursions of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Bedouins</hi> of <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We came to <hi>Sherazoul</hi> upon <hi>Easter-</hi>Eve, and staid there three days to refresh our selves, after a <hi>Lent</hi> which we had kept very sparingly. Here I found certain Springs that rose up in large Bubbles, which after I had mix'd with two Glasses of Wine and drank up, I found to have a Purgative quality, having a kind of Mineral tast. These Springs boyl up near the side of a River call'd <hi>Altun-sou,</hi> or, <hi>The River of Gold,</hi> that falls into the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> three days journey on this side <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day we lay at a pitiful Town, upon the Frontiers of <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day, being the fifth after we set out from <hi>Niniveh,</hi> we pass'd over
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106224:54"/>
several Fenns and hot Waters, that part the two Empires. Entring thus into <hi>Persia,</hi> we met with a high Mountain cover'd with fair Oaks, which bear the Gall-Nuts, so high, that the <hi>Caravan</hi> was some hours ere it could get to the top. As we ascended, but especially when we were up, we heard several Muskets go off. At first we thought the people had been hunting the wild Boars or Stags, of which the Mountains are full: but the report of the Guns being too loud and too thick for Hunters, we stood upon our guard; and I believe we should have mended our paces, had we known what was intended us. Besides, I remember'd that the Country-people would not sell any thing but for Powder and Bullet, which the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> advis'd me not to let them have, for fear they should make use of it against our selves. From the Mountain we descended into a fertil Plain, water'd with several Rivers; and night approaching, we set up our Tents, not fearing any thing, because we were in the Dominions of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> where there is so much security in travelling. After that we sent our Servants to the Tents of the Country-men, but they brought us nothing but Bread made of Acorns, than which the poor people thereabouts eat no other. This Acorn is about the bigness of our Nuts; and once I met with a Branch that had thirty Acorns, and twenty-three Gall-Nuts, all at one time growing upon it.</p>
                     <p>The Province which we travel'd through then, compos'd the greatest part of the ancient <hi>Assyria.</hi> But now to come to the Story of <hi>Dominico de Santis</hi> the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian.</hi> He had Letters of Credence from the Pope, the Emperour, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> to the King of <hi>Persia;</hi> and he went in the <hi>Caravan</hi> through the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Territories, never discovering himself who he was; but coming into <hi>Persia,</hi> he took upon him without fear the Title of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Plain where we lodg'd, it is two days journey to a good big Town, to which belongs a Fortress, where the Governour of the Province has a Lieutenant, with about two thousand Horse under his Command. The Fortress is upon the right hand toward the South, after three hours riding upon the High-way. To this Lieutenant, the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> was according to duty bound to give notice of the Arrival of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> and an account of the Persons and their Merchandize. This <hi>Venetian</hi> was a person ill fitted for the quality of an Ambassador, being a person of no Parts; which made me wonder that such great Princes, and so wise a Commonwealth should send such a person upon a Concern of that importance. For the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> then assailing <hi>Candy,</hi> he was sent to excite the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to engage him in a War against the <hi>Turk,</hi> thereby to keep off the Storm that threaten'd Christendom. Thereupon I told the Ambassador, that it was necessary for him to give the Commander of the Fort first notice of his coming, to the end he might give advice thereof to <hi>Solyman-Kan</hi> Governour of the Province, whose duty it was to advertise the King. Thereupon he requested me to send my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, which I did. Upon whose intelligence the Lieutenant of the Fort came to Compliment the Ambassador on the behalf of the chief Commander, and to conduct him to the Castle.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon the Ambassador, my self, and my Interpreter, together with some <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants went with him, travelling for three hours over the Mountains. By that time we came half the way, as we pass'd through a Wood, we heard as it were some person give a Whistle; at which when the Lieutenant perceiv'd us to be somewhat startl'd, he carry'd us to the place from whence the Whistle came, where we saw a Serpent about as big as a Man's Thigh, and about twelve Foot long, whose head was squeez'd between two Trees, that put him to pain. From that Mountain we descended into a pleasant Plain, where the Commander of the Fortress staid for us under his Tent. He had set it up by the side of a River, under the shade of several great Walnut-trees. So soon as he saw us, he rose from his great Silk Tapestry Coverlet, and saluted us in a most civil manner, telling us, that assuredly <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> his Master, would be very glad to hear that the Monarchs of Christendom had sent him an Ambassador, and that he would write to <hi>Solyman-Kan,</hi> whose duty it was to advertise the Emperour. Thereupon he wrote and dispatch'd away a Messenger, giving him order to tell the <hi>Deroga,</hi> or Judge of the Town, through which we were to pass, that he should make Provision for us and our Horses 'till we came to the Governour. After he had ask'd us several Questions
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106224:54"/>
concerning the War between the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men he had as well by Sea as Land, and what number of Galleys and Ships? wherein we satisfy'd him according to the best of our knowledge. After he had civilly treated us, he sent his Lieutenant back with us again to the <hi>Caravan.</hi> About ten a Clock the next night we dislodg'd, and the Lieutenant and six Souldiers attended upon us; who told us he had order not to leave us, 'till he had brought us to <hi>Solyman Kan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next night we lodg'd between two Hills, among several Tents of Herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Here it was that the Commander had order'd that we should be treated by the <hi>Deroga.</hi> A <hi>Deroga,</hi> as I have said, is the Judge of a Village: But this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga</hi> was chief of many Families, some of which were of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> others of <hi>Arabia.</hi> These are all Herdsmen that never live in Houses, but retire with their Cattle to the holes in the Rocks, where partly Nature, partly Art, have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to make them convenient Habitations.</p>
                     <p>So soon as we were alighted, four ancient men came and led the Ambassador and my self to the <hi>Deroga</hi>'s Tent. It seem'd to consist of many Rooms, with a Hall in the middle, spread with fair <hi>Persian</hi> Carpets. He caus'd us to sit down upon Cushions, and then presented us with a Pipe of Tobacco, and Water to wash our Feet. After he had nobly treated us, and that we were upon taking our leaves, the <hi>Deroga</hi> was very much troubl'd that we had made a small Present to his Son; telling us, that it was a crime for him to take any thing of the King's Guests, especially from Strangers that had come so long a Journey.</p>
                     <p>The next day we lodg'd in a place where there was such a prodigious quantity of Lillies that the Ground was almost cover'd with them. There were none that were white, being for the most part of a fair Violet colour, with a streak of Red in the middle of every leaf; they are like our Lilly's, but much bigger. And to drink the infusion of the Roots of these Lilly's, especially those whose Leaves are blackest, for fifteen days together, is a most Soveraign remedy against the Pox. Not long after came a Person of a goodly Aspect, who seem'd to be an <hi>Arabian,</hi> but he spoke the <hi>Persian</hi> Language, whom <hi>Solyman Kan</hi> had sent to Compliment the Ambassador. He carry'd us to the Tent which the Governour had caus'd to be set up in a Garden near the Town, where he also Lodg'd the <hi>Capuchins.</hi> The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor also sent to Compliment the <hi>Kan</hi> by my interpreter; and when the hour was come that we were to set forward, he gave order to six of the Captains of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry to accompany the Ambassador. The House where the Governour liv'd in, was one of the most beautiful in <hi>Persia.</hi> And as for the Governour himself, we found him in a Gallery that look'd upon the Garden, the Floor being all spread over with a Tapestry of Gold and Silk, with large Cushions of Cloth of Gold all along the Wall. After some Questions and discourse concerning the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> they serv'd in Supper, which consisted of several Dishes; but no Wine was to be had; our drink being only Sherbet and the juice of Granates, with Sugar for those that desir'd it. We were a long time at Supper, for 'tis the custom of <hi>Persia</hi> that when one man rises, another takes his place and falls too, in so much that the Master of the Feast must have the Patience to stay 'till several have tak'n their turns; and when every one has done, the Cloth is tak'n away without any more to do. Here the Ambassador committed an absurdity; for there are no Silver or Gold Spoons in <hi>Persia,</hi> but only long Wooden Ladles that reach a great way. Now the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor reaching his Ladle to a Purslane-Dish full of Pottage that was scalding hot, clap'd it presently into his mouth; but finding it so hot that he could not endure it, after several scurvy faces, he threw it out of his mouth again into his hand, in the presence of all the Company.</p>
                     <p>After we had stay'd five days at <hi>Sneirne,</hi> the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> signifi'd his desire to pursue his Journey. Thereupon the Ambassador took his leave of the Governour, presenting him with a Watch and a pair of Pistols; who in retaliation presented the Ambassador with a stately Horse, and a Colt of two years old. The next day we dislodg'd, and pursu'd our Road to <hi>Amadan,</hi> which is not above three days Journey from <hi>Sneirne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amadan</hi> is one of the largest and most considerable Cities of <hi>Persia,</hi> seated at the foot of a Mountain, where do arise an infinite company of Springs that water all the Country. The Land about it abounds in Corn and Rice, wherewith it furnishes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106224:55"/>
the greatest part of the neighbouring Provinces. Which is the reason that some of the <hi>Persian</hi> States-men hold it very inconvenient for the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to keep <hi>Bagdat,</hi> as well by reason of the vastness of the Charge, as also for that it draws from <hi>Amadan</hi> that which should supply other Provinces. On the other side, it is easie for the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> to hold it, by reason of the neighbourhood of <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia, Assyria,</hi> and the <hi>Arabs,</hi> Enemies to the <hi>Persians:</hi> by which means Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are very cheap, which the people would not know where to put off, if the King of <hi>Persia</hi> were Lord of <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We staid at <hi>Amadan</hi> about ten days, by reason of the Rains; during which time the <hi>Caravans</hi> cannot travel. While we tarry'd there, we were visited by several <hi>Babylonian</hi> Christians, who were glad to see that we had escap'd the Clutches of the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> who had giv'n order to the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Karkou,</hi> and the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Sharassou</hi> that commands the Frontiers of <hi>Turkie,</hi> to seize us, and carry us back to <hi>Bagdat.</hi> For which we might have thank'd the Ambassador, and a malicious <hi>Rabbi,</hi> that came along with us in the <hi>Caravan</hi> from <hi>Aleppo;</hi> who finding the Feast of the Tabernacles to be at hand, and that we had a great way to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> left us at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh,</hi> to keep the Festival with the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Where that he might insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himself into the <hi>Basha</hi>'s favour, he inform'd him that there was a <hi>Fringuiz</hi> in the <hi>Caravan,</hi> whom he look'd upon as a Spy, and that he was an Envoy into <hi>Persia</hi> from the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice;</hi> for he carry'd no Merchandize, but had three Chests full of rich Habits, and several other things which he took for Presens to the <hi>Persian</hi> King. For out of vanity or folly, the <hi>Venetian</hi> had several times open'd his Chest and expos'd his Gallantry to view. And yet he was so clutch-fisted and niggardly in every thing, that when there was any occasion to reward the <hi>Kan</hi>'s Servant, or any of the Country-men that brought us the Dainties of the place, it came all out of my Pocket. So that I left him to my Interpreter and the two <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins;</hi> and with three Servants and a Guide, after I had staid at <hi>Amadan</hi> three days, I took Horse for <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I came there, the <hi>Nazar</hi> or Master of the King's Houshold hearing I had left an Ambassador behind me with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> enquir'd of me what manner of Person he was, but I pretended I had had little converse with him, unwilling to discover his mean Spirit. The Evening before his Arrival the <hi>Nazar</hi> sent to give the <hi>Fringuiz</hi> notice in the King's Name, that they should be ready to go meet the Ambassador the next day; which we did, and brought him into the City and through <hi>Ali</hi>'s Gate, that joyns to the King's Palace. Now 'tis the custom for all Ambassadors to salute that Gate, by reason of a white Marble Stone made like an Asses back, and which serves for a Step: being, as they report, brought anciently out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where <hi>Ali</hi> liv'd. So soon as you have strid over that Stone without touching it, which were a great crime, you enter into a kind of a Gallery, where there are Rooms on each side, which serves for a Sanctuary for Criminals, which the King himself cannot fetch out of that place. That day that the new King receives his Ensigns of Royalty, he goes to stride over that Stone; and if by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he should chance to touch it, there are four Guards at the Gate, that would make a shew of thrusting him back again.</p>
                     <p>But now the Master of the Ceremonies being ready to conduct the Ambassador to the Apartment alotted him, as an Ambassador that came from three great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and a potent Commonwealth, he desir'd to lodge at the House of one <hi>Pietro Pentalet,</hi> descended from <hi>Venetian</hi> Parents; whereupon the Master of the Ceremonies conducted him thither, and caus'd his Dinner to be brought him. While we were eating, I counted thirteen Languages spoken at the Table; <hi>Latin, French, High-Dutch, English, Low-Dutch, Italian, Portuguez, Persian, Turkish, Arabic, Indian, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Malaye,</hi> which is the Language of the Learned, that is spoken from the River <hi>Indus</hi> to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> and in all the Ilands of the East, like <hi>Latin</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> not reck'ning the little <hi>Moresco</hi> or Gibbrish of the Country. So that it is a difficult thing to observe what is talk'd in one Company, where the Discourse begins in one Language, is pursu'd in another, and finish'd in a third: and for the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> they never speak above three or four Languages at most.</p>
                     <p>Now to shew you the Civility of the <hi>Persians;</hi> the Master of the Ceremonies came to the Ambassador and told him, that if he did not like the Cookery of the <hi>Persians,</hi> he had Order from the <hi>Atemadoulet,</hi> who is as the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> in <hi>Turkie,</hi> to offer him
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106224:55"/>
Money instead of Diet, to the end he might dress his own Meat as he pleas'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Upon which the covetous Ambassador accepted his offer, and two hours after there was a Bag brought him of 50 <hi>Tomans,</hi> which amount to about 800 Crowns. The <hi>Franks</hi> being offended at his baseness, slighted the Ambassador, and left him to keep House by himself, which was poor enough God knows; an Onion or a Turnep serving his turn for a Meal. Some days after, he had Audience of the King, to whom he presented his Letters Credential from the Pope, the Emperour, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice.</hi> Those from the three last were well receiv'd, because the Seals were of Gold, and for that the Paper was embelish'd with curious Flourishes: but the Pope's Letters were rejected with scorn, because the Seals were only of Lead, as the Bulls are usually seal'd; and for that the Writing was very plain. For the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> who are very nice, love things that are gay to the Eye; otherwise they look upon themselves to be affronted. <hi>Dominico de Santis</hi> had better have tak'n upon him the meaner quality of an Envoy, than the title of an Ambassador, unless he had known better how to behave himself; especially being so eclips'd as he was by a real Ambassador that arriv'd at <hi>Ispahan</hi> some time after. All the <hi>Franks</hi> went forth to meet him, and the Master of the Ceremonies made him the same proffers as he had done to the <hi>Venetian:</hi> but he nobly answer'd, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> sent him, he should take it for a very great Honour: otherwise, if he would have eaten Gold, the King his Master would have allow'd him 30 Mules Load. Such persons as behave themselves with decency and a good grace, are the persons that the Christian Princes should send into <hi>Persia,</hi> who are the most refin'd Wits, and the best Politicians of all <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude the Story of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> I will give you his Character. An <hi>Indian</hi> naturally of a good Wit having embrac'd Christianity and an Ecclesiastical Life, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to complete his Studies which he had begun at <hi>Goa;</hi> whither, the Pope, taking an affection to him, sent him afterward as his Vicar. <hi>Dominico de Santis</hi> being then at <hi>Rome,</hi> put himself into his service, and follow'd him into the <hi>Indies,</hi> where I saw him the first time I went, in a mean condition. Upon his return to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he was in no credit before, he made people believe that he understood the Trade of <hi>Asia;</hi> whereupon some particular Merchants trusted him with some Goods, which were cast away at <hi>Seide.</hi> Thus poor and bare he return'd to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he got 800 Crowns by a charitable Contribution. From thence he travel'd to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where he fell into the acquaintance of Father <hi>Rigordi</hi> a Jesoite, with whom he went into <hi>Poland:</hi> where making his brags of the great knowledge he had of the Affairs of <hi>Persia,</hi> the King gave him that Commission which I have already mention'd. The Emperour follow'd his Example, and the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> did the same: and to give the more lustre and authority to his Embassy, they got the Pope to joyn with them. But alas! both <hi>Dominico de Santis,</hi> and all such persons as he, that go into <hi>Asia</hi> without Brains and good Behaviour, do out prostitute the Reputation of the Princes that send them. Such another was Father <hi>Rigordi,</hi> who after he had been thrust out of <hi>Goa</hi> by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> went to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where he insinuated himself by a Proposition which he made of Marrying the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was then a very young Prince, to the Dutchess of <hi>Orleanoe.</hi> Under which pretence he was well receiv'd and treated by the King; from whom he also recerv'd some Presents by virtue of that Proposal, which was good sport to the Dutchess when she heard of it.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Venetian,</hi> the <hi>Atemudoulet,</hi> who was very glad to be rid of him, desir'd the <hi>Muscovite</hi> Ambassador, who was then upon his return home, to take him along with him, which he did as far as the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, where they take Shipping for <hi>Astracan;</hi> but there the <hi>Muscovite</hi> told him he could carry him no further: thereupon he was forc'd to come back to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and so to travel to <hi>Goa,</hi> whence the <hi>Portugals</hi> shipt thim home for Charities sake. But when he came to <hi>Venice,</hi> has was so far from being well receiv'd, that the Senate had like to have punish'd him severely for giving so bad an account of his Negotiation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Road which the Author kept, when he Travell'd the fourth time into <hi>Asia,</hi> to go from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Ormus.</hi> And first of his Voyage from <hi>Marseilles</hi> to <hi>Alexandretta.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ISet out from <hi>Paris</hi> in the company of Monsieur <hi>d'Ardiliere</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>June,</hi> 1651. and arriv'd at <hi>Marseilles</hi> the sixteenth of <hi>July.</hi> On the twenty-sixth of <hi>August</hi> we set Sail, with a favourable North-West Wind that blew very briskly the two next days; but at length it grew so very slack, that coming about to the North. North-East, we made for <hi>Sardinia.</hi> Upon the second of <hi>September</hi> by Sun-rising, we discover'd the Western Coast of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> six Leagues from the Land. About Noon the Wind chopping about again to the North-West, we held on our first Course; and upon the third of <hi>September,</hi> we descry'd the Island <hi>Galita</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Africa.</hi> On the fourth we discover'd the Island of <hi>Zambino</hi> before <hi>Tunis,</hi> and about Evening <hi>Cape Bon,</hi> which is the most Southerly Point of all <hi>Africa.</hi> The fifth we had a sight of the Island of <hi>Pantalaria,</hi> and the Coast of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The sixth we discover'd the Island of <hi>Goza,</hi> and the seventh the Castle that bears the same name.</p>
                     <p>We landed at <hi>Malta</hi> upon the day of the Nativity of the Virgin, which is a great day among the <hi>Maltesi,</hi> upon which they give thanks to God, for that the <hi>Turks</hi> rais'd their Siege upon that day.</p>
                     <p>The Grand-Master goes to the Church of St. <hi>John,</hi> accompany'd with all the chief Commanders in their Robes of Command, and the greatest part of the Knights. All the Country-men and Citizens are up in Arms upon that day, and march to the Inn call'd the <hi>Auvernian-house,</hi> with the Knight that goes to fetch the Standard. This Knight is clad in a Cassock of Crimson-Velvet, with a Cross of the Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind. He wears a Helmet upon his head, and carries the Standard upon his shoulders; and by him marches the Grand-Master's Page, who carries a Sword in one hand, and a Dagger in the other, both very richly Embellish'd, and giv'n to the Order by <hi>CHARLES</hi> the fifth. The Page that carry'd the Sword and Dagger was the youngest Nephew of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the tenth. The Souldiers and Citizens marching before to the Church door, make a Lane for the Knight and the Page to pass on to the Altar, where the Knight makes three bows, and having done as much to the Grand-Master, places himself on the right hand of the Grand-Masters Chair, and the Page on the left. Then the Mass and the Musick begins, and while the Gospel is reading, the Grand-Master takes the Sword and the Dagger out of the Page's hand, and holds them with the points upward all the remaining part of the Mass. During the Elevation of the Host, the Knights repeats the same Ceremony as at the beginning; and then the Bells ring, the great Guns go off, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers give three Vollies. Mass being ended, the Grand-Master retires, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd as before, only that he is then attended by all the Ecclesiastical persons of the City, and coming out of the Church, he proceeds with all the Infantry marching before him toward our <hi>Lady's of Victory,</hi> where they all go in procession. While they make a stand in that place, the Souldiers give another Volley, which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by all the Canons in the Town, as also from the Ships and Galleys. After that they return to St. <hi>John's;</hi> and the Infantry Guard the Standard back to the Inn, while the Grand-Master goes to his Palace.</p>
                     <p>The ninth we view'd the Fortifications, which are stor'd with very fair pieces of Canon.</p>
                     <p>The tenth we saw the Pages perform their Exercises before the Grand-master, which are generally vaulting and handling their Arms, both Musquet and Pike.</p>
                     <p>The elev'nth we view'd the Arsenal, where I was assur'd that there were Arms for twenty thousand men, being in good order, and rarely well look'd after.</p>
                     <p>The next day we visited the Infirmery, where the sick are serv'd in Plate, as well the poor as rich.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:106224:56"/>
The twentieth we set Sail, having the Wind at West-South-West, and a fresh gale; so that upon the twenty-third we discover'd the Coast of the <hi>Morea,</hi> to which we approach'd so near, as to descry <hi>Navarin.</hi> In the Evening we saw the City of <hi>Coron,</hi> where there is a great Trade for Sallet-Oyl. From thence it was that the Great <hi>Turk</hi> Embarqu'd for <hi>Candy</hi> in the year 1645.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fourth the Wind was at East-North-East. In the Morning we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Cape of <hi>Matapan,</hi> which is the most Southern Point of Land in <hi>Europe,</hi> lying in the <hi>Morea,</hi> and at Noon the Iland of <hi>Cherigo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-fifth we drew near <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and descry'd a Mountain in that Iland, call'd <hi>Canteliere,</hi> with some other Promontories toward the South.</p>
                     <p>From the twenty-seventh day 'till we came to <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> we perceiv'd the Sea to be all over cover'd with Pumice-stones, which happ'nd from an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake that had for some time before swallow'd up the Iland of <hi>Santorini.</hi> Some think that it proceeded from the abundance of Sulphur, of which that Country is full, which took Fire, and was the death of above 750 of the Ilanders, that were partly buried in the Ruines, and partly dy'd out of fear. They that remain'd alive, became black like Charcoal; and the Vapours that ascended out of the Abyss fully'd all the Silver as far as <hi>Constantinople;</hi> the noise of the Earthquake being heard as far as <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-ninth, by break of day we discover'd the Iland of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>October</hi> by eight in the Morning we came to an Anchor before <hi>Salines,</hi> which is one of the Ports of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where our Consuls live. Here I ask'd several of the Christians of the Country, how they did to live and pay their <hi>Carage?</hi> Who told me that it was with a great deal of difficulty, in regard the Iland was very bare of Money; which was the reason that many Christians turn'd <hi>Mahometans,</hi> to avoid paying their <hi>Carage,</hi> which is a Tribute that the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> Iayes upon all Christians throughout his Dominions. He exacts from the poorest six <hi>Piasters</hi> a Head; but there are some that pay a hundred, or a hundred and fifty: and this Tribute is due so soon as ever they come to be eighteen years of age.</p>
                     <p>The Iland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> is one of the most considerable in the Mediterranean Sea, more to the East than any of the rest; bearing the title of a Kingdom, as being 500 Miles in circuit. It is not all of the same bredth, being of a triangular form, the sides whereof are very unequal. To it there belong several Capes or Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, the principal whereof are, St. <hi>Epiphanio,</hi> toward the West; Cape <hi>de Gate,</hi> toward the South; Cape <hi>Diegrega,</hi> toward the North-East; Cape <hi>Cormachiti,</hi> toward the North; and Cape St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> upon the most Eastern Point of the Iland. The principal Roads are that of <hi>Salines</hi> or <hi>Larneca,</hi> that of <hi>Paphos,</hi> and that of <hi>Cerines</hi> or <hi>Cerigni.</hi> The Haven of <hi>Famagosta</hi> signifies nothing as to great Ships, there being none but small Vessels that can ride there. The <hi>Venetians</hi> had formerly made a small Mole there to harbour their Gallies, but it is now quite ruin'd. The Road of <hi>Cerines</hi> is that where the Barks and Galliots lye that come from <hi>Caramania,</hi> and <hi>Payasses;</hi> and where the <hi>Basha's</hi> land that are sent as Governours of the Iland from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who reside generally at <hi>Nicosia.</hi> That City is almost in the middle of the Iland, and was formerly a very large one, as appears by the compass of the ancient Walls. The new Walls are well terrass'd within-side, and in a good posture of defence. There are three Gates belong to the City; that of <hi>Famagosta,</hi> that of <hi>Paphos,</hi> and that of <hi>Cerines.</hi> The City it self is no uncomely place; the <hi>Venetians</hi> having adorn'd it with many fair Palaces, which the <hi>Turks</hi> demolish every day, out of hopes to find hidd'n Treasure therein, and sell the Stones to build new Houses. The Cathedral that goes by the name of <hi>Santa Sophia</hi> is an ample and fair Structure, of which the <hi>Turks</hi> have now made a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> together with one more, which was formerly a Monastery belonging to the <hi>Austin-</hi>Fryars. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have there four Churches, and the <hi>Franks</hi> two; that is to say, the <hi>French</hi> Missionary <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and the <hi>Italian</hi> Missionary <hi>Soccolans.</hi> The first have a Church dedicated to St. <hi>James,</hi> the others another, which is call'd <hi>Holy Rood Church.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> also have another belonging to them, which is a very neat Building, which was formerly a Monastery of the <hi>Carthusians.</hi> There it is that there is a Tomb, adorn'd with several Sculptures of Religious Nunns, especially an Abbess with a Cross in her Hand, the Writing about the Stone being in <hi>French</hi> Characters. The City is seated in a temperate Air and a fertil Soil, abounding with Water. It extends more in length than bredth,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106224:57"/>
having been anciently nine Miles in compass; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> to make it stronger, reduc'd it to the circuit of three. The Work of the Fortification was so neat, and such a proportion observ'd in all things, that the most famous Engineers esteem'd it one of the most stately Fortresses in the World, when <hi>Sclim</hi> the Second sent an Army against it, under the Command of <hi>Mustapha</hi> his Grand <hi>Vizier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Famagosta</hi> is a Sea-Town upon the East-side of the Iland, and the chief Bulwark of it. It is kept in good repair, the Castle within being in form of a Cittadel. The <hi>Turks</hi> have converted into <hi>Mosquees</hi> the Churches of the Christians, who are not suffer'd to dwell in the City. They have only the liberty to come thither in the day, and to open Shops, which they shut up again at night, and then go home to their Houses in the neighbouring Villages. The City is govern'd by a <hi>Bey,</hi> who has no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Governour of the Iland, who is oblig'd to maintain a Galley for the guard of the Coast.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cerines</hi> is another little City, but without any defence, the Walls thereof being all tumbl'd to ruine. Only there is a Fortress toward the Sea, well built, with a Garrison in it. There is also a handsom Monastery of Religious <hi>Greeks,</hi> built somewhat after the <hi>French</hi> manner; wherein there are some of the Cells which stand so upon the Sea, that they can fish out of the Windows. The Fields about it bear Cotton, which is the chief Revenue of the Monastery. There is only the Fort of <hi>Cerines</hi> upon the North, where the Iland does not lye so open, as toward the South and East; which besides by that of <hi>Famagosta,</hi> are guarded by the Forts of <hi>Salines, Limisso,</hi> and <hi>Paphos.</hi> The Inhabitants of the Iland are for the most part <hi>Greeks,</hi> especially in the Villages. They are clad after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, both Men and Women; the Men wearing Hats like the <hi>Franks,</hi> and retaining their ancient Customs as much as is possible for them to do. The Trade of the Iland lyes in Cotton-wool, which is the best in all the East; and some Silk, which is neither good, nor very plentiful. However the Iland is fertil enough, did it not want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants enow to till it. As for Bread, Wine, Cheese, and Milk, they are all very cheap, and there is Oyl enough to serve the Iland. But for the Wine, it is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the Iland to all the places of Trade not far distant. The best grows at the foot of <hi>Olympus,</hi> and is a delicious sort of Drink. The Country between <hi>Nicosia</hi> and <hi>Famagosta</hi> produces Cotton, of which there grows also some between <hi>Paphos</hi> and <hi>Limisso.</hi> The chief place where the Silk is made is call'd <hi>Cytherea,</hi> a large Town water'd with a fair River that runs from the Mountain of <hi>Venus.</hi> This River turns several Mills, which are the chief Revenue of the Iland. There is Silk also made between <hi>Paphos</hi> and <hi>Limisso;</hi> upon the Road between which two places you meet with a Town call'd <hi>Piscopi,</hi> where are to be seen several Aquaeducts, that carry'd the Water into the Rooms and Magazines where the people formerly made Sugar. But since the Iland was tak'n from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> one of the <hi>Basha's</hi> that was sent as Governour, burnt up all the Sugar Canes in the Country. Toward the Sea-shoar near <hi>Limisso,</hi> is to be seen one of the fairest Gardens of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which they call <hi>Shiti;</hi> to which there belongs a magnificent House, and a Grove of Orange-Trees. It was built by a rich <hi>Venetian,</hi> who had a good Estate in Lands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Cyprus</hi> the people take a vast number of Birds as big as a Lark, especially near the <hi>Mountain of the Holy Cross.</hi> In the Months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> the Country-people of the adjacent Villages make themselves little Hutts in the Fields, where usually those Birds are wont to light, and feed upon the Seed of an Herb that grows there; which when it is dry, the people daub over with Lime-twigs. But this they never do but when the North-West Wind blows, and that the weather be very cold; for with a Southerly Wind they never take any. These Birds are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted great Dainties by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who make no great Feasts in <hi>Carnival-</hi>time wherein they do not set these Birds upon the Table, pil'd up in Dishes like a Pyramid. They buy them up every year; being first prepar'd fit for exportation by the people, who having pull'd off their Feathers, parboyl them, and pickle them up in Barrels with Vinegar and Salt. When they are to be eat'n, they are set upon a Chafing-dish, between two Dishes. Sometimes there are above a thousand Barrels exported out of the Iland; and indeed, were it not for this Trade, the poor people would see but very little Money.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Mountain of the <hi>Holy Cross</hi> stands a Church of the same name; upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106224:57"/>
which the report of the Country goes, that St. <hi>Helena</hi> returning from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> left a piece of our Saviour's Cross with the Christians of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who built a Church there, by means of the Liberality of the same Princess. Afterwards those of the Town of <hi>Leucara</hi> took it from hence, and carry'd it to their Church, where I saw it. The piece is as big as the Palm of a Man's Hand, set in a great Cross of Latten, emboss'd with several Figures.</p>
                     <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus</hi> there is an Archbishop and three Suffragans. The Arch-bishop takes upon him the Title of <hi>Nicosia;</hi> to which <hi>Famagosta</hi> belongs with all the Country between <hi>Nicosia</hi> and <hi>Famagosta,</hi> with the Territories of <hi>Nicosia</hi> and all the Villages round. He has a House about a League from <hi>Nicosia,</hi> where the chiefest of his Revenue lies. Some years since he caus'd the high Altar of the Church to be painted and guilded, being a neat piece of Workmanship. Thus the Arch-bishop has under his Jurisdiction all the middle part of the Island, and some part toward the East. The Bishops are the Bishops of <hi>Paphos, Larneca;</hi> and <hi>Cerines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> are very much addicted to the observation of their ancient Customs and Ceremonies; and generally their Masses are very long. Upon Sundays and Holy-days they rise between one and two of the Clock in the Morning to Sing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins. To which purpose there is a Clerk that goes from door to door and knocks with a Hammer, to wake the people, and then cries out with a loud voice, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians go the Church.</hi> The men and old women fail not to go as being more zealous; but the maids and young women never go out of doors in the night for fear of the <hi>Turks.</hi> There are seven or eight Villages, the Inhabitants whereof are <hi>Maronites,</hi> who came from Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and speak <hi>Arabic</hi> at home, but <hi>Greek</hi> among the Islanders. They follow the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and have their Churches peculiar to themselves.</p>
                     <p>The Island of <hi>Cyprus</hi> is no wholesom Air, being subject to the spoyl of a sort of Locusts, that some Summers destroy all their Fruit aud Corn. During the heats they hover in the Air, which they will dark'n with their number like a thick Cloud; but when the North Wind blows, it carry's them into the Sea, where they perish.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Cyprus</hi> three sorts of colour'd Earth, a Grey-black, a Red, and a Yellow; of which the <hi>Venetians</hi> fetch away great quantities for their courser sort of Painting. There's also a Mine of White Alome, which is the stone call'd <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antlius.</hi> 'Tis thought that the Ancients had a way to spin this Alome into a kind of Cotton, and so to make out of it a certain sort of Cloth that would not consume in the Fire, but only be the more perfectly whiten'd thereby. The <hi>Indians</hi> formerly bury'd the dead bodies of their Kings deceas'd in Shrouds of this kind of Linnen, and then putting them into the Fire, found the bodies all reduc'd to ashes, but the Cloth whole; out of which they took the ashes, and carefully put them into an Vrne, which was prepar'd for their preservation.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Cyprus</hi> has a mind to view the Fortress of <hi>Famagosta,</hi> he sends to give the <hi>Bey,</hi> who is Governour thereof, notice of it. For it is at the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours choice whether he will give him admission or no. The <hi>Basha Hali-Giorgi,</hi> being a comely old man of above a hundred and two years of age, setting out of <hi>Nicosia</hi> in his Litter with about two hundred Horse, when he was come within half a League of <hi>Famagosta,</hi> the Governour of the place sent his Lieutenant with a hundred Horse to Compliment him, and to conduct him to the Town. Immediately they took upon them the Guard of the <hi>Basha</hi>'s Litter, who was not permitted to take along with him above eight or ten of his principal Officers. The Cannons roar'd at his entry, and he was treated magnificently, but he lay not in the Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conducted back by the same party to the place where they met him in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>Upon the third day of <hi>October</hi> we set Sail about three a Clock in the Morning with a West-North-West Wind, and about Noon we were within sight of <hi>Famagosta,</hi> into which place we could by no means be admitted, by reason of the Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Venetians.</hi> But as far as I could discern a far off, there is no easie access to the Port, and for the City I could descry no part of it.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, by break of day we got sight of the Coast of <hi>Syria,</hi> Cape <hi>Canger,</hi> and the Golf of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and about Evening we arriv'd in the Road of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andretta.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106224:58"/>
From thence we went to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and stay'd there from the seventh of <hi>October;</hi> to the thirtieth of <hi>December.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the thirtieth we set forward for <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and with little variation of the Road which I have already describ'd in my third Voyage from <hi>Paris.</hi> We arriv'd the second day of <hi>February</hi> at <hi>Moussul</hi> or <hi>Nineveh,</hi> where we stay'd 'till the fifteenth, 'till the <hi>Kilets</hi> or Boats of the Country could be got ready. Our <hi>Kilet</hi> carry'd thirty Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, and sixty hundred of <hi>Aleppo</hi> Weight, or thirty three thousand pound of <hi>Paris</hi> Weight, upon which the <hi>Tigris</hi> bore us from <hi>Moussul</hi> to <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> A Continuation of the Road which the Author kept in the fourth Voyage into <hi>Asia,</hi> and particularly of his passage upon the <hi>Tigris</hi> from <hi>Nineveh</hi> to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> we put off from <hi>Moussul,</hi> and after we had swam six hours, we came to lye near a hot Bath, about a Musket-shot from the <hi>Tigris.</hi> It was throng'd with Sick people that came thither for their Recovery. We kept our selves upon the Watch all night; but for all we could do, the <hi>Arabs</hi> stole two Coverlets from a Merchant, and a <hi>Turk</hi>'s Cloaths that was gone into the Bath.</p>
                     <p>The sixteenth, after we had row'd about five hours, we came to a huge Dam; it is 200 Foot wide, and makes a fall in the River of about 20 Fathoms steep. The <hi>Arabians</hi> said that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great made it to turn the course of the River; others will have it, that <hi>Darius</hi> caus'd it to be made to hinder the passage of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> by Water. However, we were forc'd to land our selves and our Goods, and to lade them upon Horses which the <hi>Arabs</hi> brought us.</p>
                     <p>The passing this Dam is worthy observation. For it is a thing of wonder to see the <hi>Kilet</hi> all of a sudden fall above sixscore Foot, and yet to be kept by the Leather-Bottles still above Water. The Water-men that guide the Boat, tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Oars fast to a Pearch bent like a Semicircle, to defend themselves from the force of the Water. And indeed this is the Dam that renders <hi>Tigris</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kilet</hi> being come to the place where we expected it, we put our Goods aboard, and lay in the same place upon the Bank of the River. For the <hi>Arabs,</hi> if they perceive the Merchants asleep, cut the Cords of the <hi>Kilet,</hi> and setting it a-drift, swim after it, and rifle away what they please.</p>
                     <p>The seventeenth, after three hours rowing we met with the River <hi>Zab,</hi> that empties into the <hi>Tigris,</hi> upon <hi>Chaldea-</hi>side. Half a League above the River stands a fair Castle of Brick upon a little Hill; but no body dwelling in it, it runs to ruine. We were twelve hours that day upon the Water, and came to lye at a place which was full of Wood, where we made great Fires, and shot off our Muskets often in the night to scare the Lions.</p>
                     <p>The eighteenth we were upon the Water eighteen hours, and lay upon the Bank of the River, upon <hi>Assyria-</hi>side. That Evening the <hi>Arabs</hi> brought us Milk-Meats, and fresh Butter. They swim from the other side of the River with a <hi>Boracho</hi> under their Stomachs, and another upon their Heads, wherein they bring their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; for which they will have no Money, but only Tobacco, or Bisket, or Pepper.</p>
                     <p>The nineteenth, in four hours time we met with a River call'd <hi>Altum-sou,</hi> or <hi>The River of Gold.</hi> It flows from the Mountains of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and I travel'd by the side of it for three days together, returning from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and passing the <hi>Tigris</hi> to <hi>Mesia.</hi> The Water of the River is of an excellent tast, and it falls into <hi>Tigris</hi> upon <hi>Assyria-</hi>side. All along the <hi>Tigris,</hi> on the same side, are great store of Bituminous Springs, and other Streams of hot Water that smell of Sulphur. All that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106224:58"/>
day we saw none but <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Curds</hi> marching along the Banks of the River, the <hi>Curds</hi> upon <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> side, and the <hi>Arabs</hi> upon <hi>Assyria</hi> side. They were at War, and both sides march'd in very good order. The Young men went formost with Bows and Arrows, and some Muskets, but several Half-Pikes. Next to them their Wives, Virgins, and Children, with their Cattel, Herds, and Camels; after which march'd the Old men in the rear. As well the <hi>Curds</hi> as the <hi>Arabians</hi> sent out Horse-men to scout upon the high Grounds; for as soon as they find any advantage, they presently swim their Horses over the River and fall on. Now because we would not trust those sort of People, we row'd nineteen hours to avoid 'em.</p>
                     <p>The twentieth we were eleven hours upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and came to lye at a Town call'd <hi>Tegrit,</hi> upon <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> side. There belongs to the Town a Castle half ruin'd, and yet there are still some handsom Chambers to be seen. Upon the North and East, the River serves for a Moat; but upon the West and South it has a deep Artificial one pav'd with Free-stone. The <hi>Arabians</hi> say that formerly it was the strongest place in all <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> though it be commanded by two Hills not far from it. The Christians dwelt half a League from the City, where the Ruines of a Church and part of a Steeple are still to be seen, whereby it appears to have been a considerable Pile of Building.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-first, after we had row'd three hours, we met with a Town upon <hi>Assyria</hi> side, which was call'd <hi>Amet-el-tour,</hi> from the name of a person that lyes inter'd in a Monastery, whom the people account to be a Saint. Therefore is it a place of great Devotion among them, so that great numbers of Votaries go thither in private. That day we were twelve hours upon the Water, and lay upon the Banks of the River.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-second, having been upon the Water two hours, we met with a great Channel cut out of <hi>Tigris</hi> to water the Lands, which runs up as far as just over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and there falls into the <hi>Tigris</hi> again. Coming thither, we landed upon <hi>Chaldea</hi> side, by reason that there were certain <hi>Turks</hi> with us, who would of necessity perform their Devotions at a place call'd <hi>Samàtra.</hi> In the same there is a <hi>Mosquee</hi> not above half a League from the River; to which many <hi>Mahometans</hi> pay their Devoirs, especially <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who believe forty of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to be buried there. When they knew us to be Christians, they would not permit us, no not for Money, to set our Feet in it. About five hundred Paces from the <hi>Mosquee</hi> stands a Tower very ingeniously built. There are two Stair-cases without, that belong to it, made twirling like a Periwinkle-shell: one of which Stair-cases was built deeper into the Tower than the other. I would have taken better notice of it, could I have been permitted to have come nearer it. Only I observ'd that it was made of Brick, and that it seems to be very ancient. Half a League from thence appear three great Portals, that look as if they had been the Gates of some great Palace. And indeed it is not improbable but that there was some great City thereabouts; for, for three Leagues all along the River there is nothing to be seen but Ruines. We were twelve hours that day upon the Water, and lay upon the Banks of <hi>Tigris,</hi> according to custom.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-third, we were twenty hours upon the Water, and all the day long we saw nothing upon either side of the River but pitiful Hutts made of the Branches of Palm-trees, where live certain poor people that turn the Wheels, by means whereof they water the neighbouring Grounds. We also met that day with a River call'd <hi>Odoine,</hi> that falls into <hi>Tigris</hi> upon the side of the ancient <hi>Chaldea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-fourth, we were twenty-two hours upon the Water together, never stirring off from the <hi>Kilet.</hi> The reason is, because the Merchants having tak'n out of the <hi>Kilet</hi> all their Money and the best part of their Merchandizes, give them to the Country-people, who carry them very faithfully to <hi>Bagdat,</hi> whither they go to sell their own Commodities: which the Merchants do, to avoid the payment of Five in the Hundred, in the City. I trusted them also with several things of which they gave me a very good account, as they did to others, being contented with a small matter for their pains.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fifth, about four of the Clock in the Morning we arriv'd at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> which is as usually call'd <hi>Babylon.</hi> They open the Gates by six, and then the Customers come to take an account of the Merchandize, and to search the Merchants themselves. If they find nothing about 'em, they let the Merchants go: but if
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106224:59"/>
they have any thing about 'em which ought to pay, they carry the persons to the Custom-House, where they write down the quantity of the Goods, and let them go. All the Merchandize upon the <hi>Kilet</hi> is carry'd thither also, which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant fetches away again in two or three days, paying the Custom: All which is done in very great order, without any noise or disturbance in the least.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Bagdat</hi> usually bear the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet it is at a great distance from the ancient <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereof in due place. But now for <hi>Bagdat,</hi> as it stands at this day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bagdat</hi> is a City seated upon the River of <hi>Tigris,</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Persia,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> by the same River. It lyes in 33 Deg. 15 Min. of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Chronicles of the <hi>Arabians</hi> report that it was built by one of their <hi>Califfs</hi> nam'd <hi>Almansour,</hi> in the year of the <hi>Hegyra</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> 145, and of Christianity 762, or thereabouts. They call it <hi>Dar-al-sani,</hi> that is, the <hi>House of Peace.</hi> Some say it deriv'd its name from a Hermitage that stood in a Meadow where the City now stands, whence it was call'd <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or, a <hi>Garden bequeath'd.</hi> About forty years ago digging up the Foundations of an Inn, the Work-men found a Body entire, habited like a Bishop, with a Censor and Incense by him. And in the same place several Cells of Religious Houses shew'd themselves: which makes it very probable, that where <hi>Bagdat</hi> is built there was anciently a great Monastery, with several Houses where the Christians inhabited. The City is about fifteen hundred Paces long, and sev'n or eight hundred broad, and cannot possibly be above three Miles in circuit. The Walls are of Brick, and terrass'd in some places, with large Towers like Bastions. Upon all these Towers there are mounted about sixty pieces of Cannon, the biggest whereof carries not above a five or six Pound Ball. The Moats are wide, and about five or six Fathom deep. There are not above four Gates; three upon the Land-side, and one upon the River, which you must cross, over a Bridge of thirty-three Boats, distant one from the other about the bredth of one Boat. The Castle is in the City, near to one of the Gates call'd <hi>El-Maazan,</hi> upon the North side. It is partly built upon the River, encompass'd only with a single Wall, terrass'd in some places; and adorn'd with little Towers, upon which are planted about a hundred and fifty Cannon, but without Carriages. The Moat is narrow, and not above two or three Fathom deep, neither is there any Draw-Bridge before the Gate. The Garrison consists of three hundred <hi>Janizaries,</hi> commanded by an <hi>Aga.</hi> The City is govern'd by a <hi>Basha,</hi> who is generally a <hi>Vizier.</hi> His House is upon the side of the River, making a fair shew; and he has alway ready at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand six or sev'n hundred Horse. There is also an <hi>Aga</hi> that commands three or four hundred <hi>Spahi's.</hi> They have besides another sort of Cavalry which is call'd <hi>Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guliler,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Men of Courage,</hi> commanded by two <hi>Aga's;</hi> and usually there are about three thousand in the City and the Towns adjoyning. The Keys of the Gates of the City and the Bridge-Gate are in the custody of another <hi>Aga,</hi> who has under him two hundred <hi>Janizaries.</hi> There are also six hundred Foot-men, who have their particular <hi>Aga,</hi> and about sixty Cannoneers, who were at that time commanded by an expert Artist that went by the name of <hi>Signor Michaël,</hi> who pass'd for a <hi>Turk,</hi> though he were born in <hi>Candy.</hi> He put himself into the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s service, when he went to besiege <hi>Bagdat,</hi> in the year 1638. Though the <hi>Turk</hi> had the good fortune to carry the City in a small time; not so much by virtue of the Breach which <hi>Signor Michaël</hi> had made in the Wall, as the Sedition and Revolt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at the same instant, the Story whereof was thus in short.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kan</hi> that sustain'd the brunt of the Siege at first, was originally an <hi>Armenian,</hi> and his name was <hi>Sefi-couli-Kan.</hi> He had commanded the City a long time, and had defended it twice from the Army of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were not able to take it before. But the King of <hi>Persia</hi> having sent one of his Favourites to command in his room, who had enter'd upon his Command before the Cannon had made the Breach, the old <hi>Kan</hi> finding himself displac'd by the Commission of the new Governour, rather chose to dye, than survive the Affront which was put upon him. To which purpose he sent for his Servants, the Officers of the Army, his Wife and Son, and taking three Cups of Poyson in his Hand, he commanded his Wife, if ever she lov'd him, now to shew the marks of her affection by generously dying with him. He gave the same exhortation to his Son; and so all three together drank up the Poyson, which procur'd their speedy death. The Souldiers, who had a great love for their Governour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106224:59"/>
having beheld so dismal a Spectacle, and knowing the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> was preparing for a general Assault, would not obey their new <hi>Kan,</hi> but began to act like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volter's; and to that purpose they agreed to deliver up the City, upon condition they might march away with their Arms and Baggage: but the <hi>Turks</hi> did not keep their words. For so soon as the <hi>Turks</hi> were got into the City; the <hi>Basha's</hi> told the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> that to weak'n the force of the <hi>Persian,</hi> it was necessary for him to put to the Sword all the Souldiers that were in the City: and thereupon there were above twenty thousand massacr'd in cold Blood. The <hi>Turks</hi> had seiz'd upon the <hi>Capuchins</hi> Mansion, but <hi>Signor Michaël</hi> chief of the Canoneers, got it to be restor'd them again.</p>
                     <p>As to the Civil Government of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> there is none but a <hi>Cady,</hi> who does all, acting even the <hi>Mufti,</hi> with a <hi>Shiekelaslon</hi> or <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> who receives the Revenues of the Grand <hi>Signor.</hi> There are in it five <hi>Mosquees,</hi> of which two are indifferently well built, and adorn'd with <hi>Duomo's</hi> cover'd with varnish'd Tiles of different colours. There are also ten Inns, all ill built, except two, which are reasonably convenient. In general, the City is ill built; there being nothing of beauty in it but the <hi>Bazars,</hi> which are all arch'd; else the Merchants would not be able to endure the heats. They must also be water'd three or four times a day; for which office several poor people are hir'd upon the publick charge. The City is full of Trade, but not so full as it was, when in the hands of the King of <hi>Persia:</hi> for when the <hi>Turk</hi> took it, he kill'd most of the richest Merchants. However there is a great confluence thither from all Parts; whither for Trade, or for Devotions sake, I cannot tell: because they that follow the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> do believe that <hi>Haly</hi> liv'd at <hi>Bagdat.</hi> Besides, all they that are desirous to go to <hi>Mecca</hi> by Land, must pass through <hi>Bagdat,</hi> where every Pilgrim is forc'd to pay four <hi>Piasters</hi> to the <hi>Basha.</hi> You must take notice that there are in <hi>Bagdat</hi> two sorts of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> the first are call'd <hi>Rafedi's,</hi> or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; the second, Observers of the Law, in all things like those at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The <hi>Rafedi's</hi> will by no means eat or drink with a Christian, and very hardly with the rest of the <hi>Mahometans:</hi> or if they do happ'n to drink out of the same Cup, or to touch them, they presently wash themselves, as believing themselves unclean. The others are not so scrupulous, but eat and drink and converse with all the World. In the year 1639, after the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> had tak'n <hi>Bagdat,</hi> a <hi>Rafedi</hi> who was a Carrier of Water not only refus'd to give a <hi>Jew</hi> to drink, who desir'd it of him in the Market-place, but abus'd him also in words. Thereupon the <hi>Jew</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to the <hi>Cady,</hi> who immediately sent for him, and caus'd his <hi>Boracho</hi> and his Cup to be brought along with him; when he came before him, he ask'd for his Cup, and gave the <hi>Jew</hi> to drink, and then made the Porter drink also out of the same Cup: After that, he order'd the <hi>Rafedi</hi> to be Bastinado'd, and this Lesson to be taught him while he was chastising, That we are all God's Creatures, as well <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> as Christians and <hi>Jews.</hi> This has made them less zealous in their Superstition, though they are the chiefest part of the Inhabitants of the City.</p>
                     <p>As to their Funerals, I have particularly observ'd, that when the Husband dyes, the Wife pulls off all her Head-gear, and lets her Hair fall about her Ears; then she all besmears her Face with the Soot of a Kettle, and having so done, frisks and leaps about after such a ridiculous manner, as from others would rather produce laughter than tears. All the kindred, friends and neighbours meet at the House of the deceas'd, and stay for the Celebration of the Funeral. At what time the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men strive to out-vie one another in a thousand Apish tricks, clapping their Cheoks, yelling like mad people; and then of a sudden setting themselves to dance to the sound of two Drums, like those which the Tabor-and-Pipe-Men carry, upon which the Women beat for a quarter of an hour. Among them there is one more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to this fool'ry than the rest, that fills your Ears with mournful Dinns: to which other Women make answer, by redoubling their Cries, which may be heard at a great distance. It would then be a vain thing to seek to comfort the Children of the deceas'd; for they seem to be so much beside themselves, that they are not in a condition to hear any thing. And they are oblig'd to carry themselves in that manner, unless they intend to run the reproach of not having any kindness for their Parents. When the Corps is carry'd to the Grave, abundunce of poor people go before with Banners, and Crescents at the ends of Sticks, singing most dismal Dirges all the way. The Women are not to be at the Interrment, who are not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106224:60"/>
to go abroad but only upon Thursdays, when they go to the Sepulchers to Pray for the Dead. And because that by their Law the Husband is oblig'd to lye with his lawful Wife upon Thursday-night or Fryday-night, upon Wednesday-morning the Women go to the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ths, where they perfume their Heads and Bodies with a sweet Water. They may go abroad sometimes at other seasons, when their Husbands give them leave to visit their Kindred; but then they are to be wrapt up from Head to Foot, that it is impossible for their Husbands themselves to know them if they meet 'em i'the Streets. By the way take notice, that the <hi>Persian</hi> Women, unless they be such as are very poor, would rather stay within all the days of their Lives, than go abroad without a Horse. And it is a certain sign to know a Curtisan from an honest Woman; for that the Curtisans put their Feet in the Stirup, and the honest Women only in the Stirup-leathers. The Women of <hi>Bagdat</hi> are very richly habited, after their fashions; but they are not contented to wear their Jewels about their Necks and Wrists, for they hang them like Bracelets about their Faces, and will bore holes in their Ears to put in a Ring. The <hi>Arabian</hi> Women only bore the separation between the two Nostrils, where they wear hollow Rings, as well to spare cost, as for lightness; for some are so big, that you may almost thrust your Fist through them. Beyond all this, the more to beautifie themselves, they make a round Ring about their Eyes with a certain sort of Blacking: And as well Men as Women, in the Desert, put the same near their Eyes, to preserve them, as they say, from the heat of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Of Christians there are three sorts: <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who have a Church; <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who have none, but go to the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> who administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them. The Christians go in Devotion to a Chappel, about a short quarter of a League from the City, dedicated to a Saint whom they call <hi>Keder-Elias,</hi> paying a small Fee, for admission, to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who keep the Keys. Two days journey from the City stands another ruin'd Church in a pitiful Village, where they say, that St. <hi>Simon</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi> were both Martyr'd and Buried. If a Christian dyes, all the rest come to his Burial, and returning home, find a Supper prepar'd to welcom them; the next day they return to the Grave, and pray for the deceas'd; and the third day there is a Dinner for all comers and goers. Sometimes there will be a hundred and fifty persons at a Burial. They repeat the same Ceremonies for the seventh, fifteenth, thirtieth and fortieth days afterwards; having a great veneration for the Dead, for whom they pray too often. This custom of Feasting is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient for the Poor; for they being desirous to imitate the Rich, run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sometimes so far in Debt, that they are forc'd to sell their Children to the <hi>Turks</hi> to discharge themselves.</p>
                     <p>There are several <hi>Jews</hi> also in <hi>Bagdat,</hi> but more that come every year in Devotion to visit the Sepulcher of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is a day and a halfs journey from the City. In short, since the taking of <hi>Bagdat</hi> by <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> the number of Inhabitants cannot be less than fifteen thousand Souls; which shews that the City is not peopl'd according to its bigness.</p>
                     <p>About a day and a halfs journey from the Point of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> at distance almost equal between <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> there appears a vast Heap of Earth, which the people call to this day <hi>Nemrod.</hi> It stands in the midst of a wide Plain, and may be discover'd a great way off. The vulgar sort believe it to be the Remains of the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> but there is more probability of the <hi>Arabians</hi> Opinion, who call it <hi>Agartouf,</hi> and believe it to have been built by an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, who always kept a Beacon at the top to assemble his Subjects together in time of War. This Heap of Earth was about three hundred Paces in circuit; but it is not easie to guess at the ancient height, the rest being fal'n to ruine, but only eighteen or twenty Fathom. It is built of Brick dry'd in the Sun, every Brick being ten Inches square, and three thick. The Building is thus rais'd. Upon every row of Canes or Reeds bruis'd to pieces and mix'd with Wheat-straw, and spred an Inch and a half thick, lye seven orders of these Bricks with a little Straw between each; then another Bed of Reeds, and six rows of Bricks; then a third with five rows, decreasing in that manner 'till you come to the top. The form of it seems to have been rather square than round; and in the highest part of that which remains there appears a Hole like a Window; if it were not rather an Out-let for Water, or a Hole for the Scaffolding. In short, according to the Description of <hi>Moses</hi> there
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106224:60"/>
is no likelihood that this should be the Remains of the ancient Tower of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> A Continuation of the Road from <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Balsara;</hi> and of the Religion of the Christians of St. <hi>John.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> we hir'd a Bark from <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Balsara.</hi> And we observ'd, that a little beyond <hi>Bagdat</hi> the River <hi>Tigris</hi> divides it self into two Arms; the one which runs through the ancient <hi>Chaldea,</hi> the other keeps its course toward the Point of <hi>Mesopotamia;</hi> these two Arms making a large Iland, cross'd by several small Channels.</p>
                     <p>When we came to the place where <hi>Tigris</hi> divides it self, we beheld as it were the compass of a City that might have formerly been a large League in circuit. There are some of the Walls yet standing, upon which six Coaches may go a-brest. They are made of burnt Brick, every Brick being ten Foot square, and three thick. The Chronicles of the Country say, that these were the Ruines of the ancient <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We follow'd that Arm of <hi>Tigris</hi> that runs along the Coast of <hi>Chaldea;</hi> for fear of falling into the hands of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who were then at War with the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> denying to pay the ordinary Tribute to the Grand <hi>Signor.</hi> We were ten days upon the Water in our passage from <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Balsara,</hi> and lay every night upon the Water, dressing our Victuals in the Bark. For when we came to any Villages, we sent our Servants a-shoar to buy Provisions, which we had very cheap. Now the Towns we met with upon the Shoar were these. <hi>Amurat,</hi> where there stood a Fort of Brick bak'd in the Sun; <hi>Mansoury,</hi> a great Town; <hi>Magar, Gazer,</hi> and <hi>Gorno.</hi> At this last place <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> meet together: where are also three Castles to be seen; one upon the Point where the two Rivers meet, which is the strongest, and where the Son of the Prince of <hi>Balsara</hi> then commanded; the second upon <hi>Chaldea</hi> side; and the third upon <hi>Arabia</hi> side. Though the Customs be there exactly demanded, and paid, yet they never search any person. The Tides come up to that place: so that having but fifteen Leagues to <hi>Balsara,</hi> we got thither in sev'n hours, having both Wind and Tide.</p>
                     <p>All the Country between <hi>Bagdat</hi> and <hi>Balsara</hi> is inter-cut and parted by Dikes, like the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> the two Cities lying a hundred and sixty Leagues one from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106224:61"/>
the other. It is one of the best countries in the possession of the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> being stor'd with large Meadows and excellent Pasturage, where are bred infinite numbers of Beasts, especially Mares and Bufalo's. The Female Bufalo's go twelve Months, and yield so much milk, that there are some which will give two and twenty Pints. And there is so large a quantity of Butter made, that in some Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> we saw sometimes five and twenty, sometimes twenty Barks lad'n with Butter, which the people sell all along the Gulf of <hi>Persia,</hi> as well upon <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Persia</hi> side.</p>
                     <p>Half the way between <hi>Bagdat</hi> and <hi>Balsara,</hi> we perceiv'd several Pavilions set up in the Meadows along by the side of the River. Upon enquiry we heard that the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> was come from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to gather the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s duty's. For from <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Gorno,</hi> for all the Bufalo's as well Male as Female, there is to be paid a <hi>Piaster</hi> and a quarter for every head once a year; which is worth yearly to the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> a hundred and fourscore thousand <hi>Piasters.</hi> Every Mare also pays two <hi>Piasters,</hi> every Sheep ten <hi>Sous;</hi> which if the Country people were not very cunning, would be worth fifty thousand <hi>Piasters</hi> more than it is.</p>
                     <p>After this we came to <hi>Gorno,</hi> a Fortress upon the point where the two Rivers meet, besides two other small Castles upon each side, so that there is no passing without leave. Upon the Fort of <hi>Gorno</hi> which was well furnish'd with Cannon, we saw the Prince of <hi>Balsara</hi>'s Son, who was Governour of the Fort. And here it is that the Account of the Customs is taken. But though they are very exact in searching the Barks, they are very civil, for they search no body. However lest any Goods should be hid between the Planks of the Ships, over which they generally throw Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and Canes, the Customers bring a great Piercer, with which they bore the sides of the Bark quite through for the discovery of conceal'd Goods. The Goods are Register'd at <hi>Gorno,</hi> but the Customs are always paid at <hi>Balsara,</hi> according to the accompt giv'n from the Fort.</p>
                     <p>The same day entring into the Channel that is cut out of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to <hi>Balsara,</hi> we met the chief of the <hi>Holland</hi> Factory taking his pleasure in a Boat cover'd with Scarlet, who took me with him to <hi>Balsara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Balsara</hi> stands upon the side of <hi>Arabia deserta,</hi> two Leagues from the Ruines of a City, which was formerly call'd <hi>Teredon,</hi> and anciently stood in the Desert, to which the Water was formerly conveigh'd out of <hi>Euphrates</hi> in a Brick Channel still to be seen.</p>
                     <p>By the Ruines it appears to have been a great City, from whence the <hi>Arabians</hi> fetch away the Bricks and sell them at <hi>Balsara.</hi> The City of <hi>Balsara</hi> is half a League from <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> in their Language call <hi>Shetel-areb,</hi> or the River of <hi>Araebia.</hi> The Inhabitants of the City have made a Channel to it about half a League long, which bears Vessels of 150 Tun; at the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of stands a Fort, so that no Vessel can get into the Fort without leave. The Sea is above fifteen Leagues off, but the Tide comes up to the Channel, and fills the River other fifteen Leagues upward beyond <hi>Gorno.</hi> The Country is so low, that were it not for a Dam that runs along the Sea-shoar, it would often be in danger of being drown'd. The Dam is above a League in length, and built all of Free-stone so strong, that the fury of the waves can do them no injury, though it lie open to a Boystrous Sea.</p>
                     <p>It is not above a hundred years since <hi>Balsara</hi> belong'd to the <hi>Arabians</hi> of the Desert, and had no commerce with the Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> For those people were contented to eat their own Dates, having so great a quantity, that they only live upon them. 'Tis the same thing all along the Gulf on each side; for from <hi>Balsara</hi> to the River <hi>Indus</hi> for above six hundred Leagues together, and all along the Coast of <hi>Arabia</hi> to <hi>Mascaté,</hi> the poor sort of people know not what it is to eat Rice, but live upon Dates and Salt-fish dry'd in the wind. The Cows eat no Grass, and though they go abroad in the fields, they find little or nothing among the bushes which is proper for them to eat. But every Morning before they drive them to the Field, and when they return home, they give them heads of fish and Date-nuts boil'd together.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> having had War with the <hi>Arabians</hi> took <hi>Balsara;</hi> and yet because the <hi>Arabians</hi> always hover'd about the Town, and made booty of all they could lay their hands on, they were forc'd to come to an agreement with them, that the <hi>Arabs</hi> should quietly enjoy all the Desert 'till within a League of the City; and that the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106224:61"/>
                        <hi>Turks</hi> should remain peaceable Masters of the City, where they have a <hi>Basha</hi> for Governour. But this Treaty endur'd not long; for in the middle of the City there is a Cittadel, call'd <hi>Aushel Basha,</hi> or the <hi>Basha</hi>'s <hi>Court,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> built; so that the Garrison being <hi>Turks</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>Arabians,</hi> who could not endure to be curb'd, they oft-times quarrell'd with the <hi>Turks</hi> and came to blows. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Arabians</hi> of the Desert came to the relief of the Citizens and besieg'd the <hi>Basha</hi> in the Fortress. At length because there could be no such agreement made, but that one party or other took an occasion presently to break it, there was one <hi>Basha</hi> whose name was <hi>Aiud,</hi> who after many contests and revolts which had almost tyr'd him, resolv'd to rid himself of the trouble, and sold his Government for forty thousand <hi>Piasters</hi> to a rich Lord in the Country, who presently rais'd a sufficient number of Souldiers to keep the people in awe. This great man took upon him the name of <hi>Efrasias Basha,</hi> being the Grandfather of <hi>Hussen Basha,</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at the time when I pass'd through before. This <hi>Efrasias</hi> threw off the <hi>Turkish</hi> voak, and took upon him the title of Prince of <hi>Balsara.</hi> As for the <hi>Basha</hi> that sold his Government, he no sooner arriv'd at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but he was strangl'd. But after <hi>Amurath</hi> had taken <hi>Bagdat,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Balsara</hi> was glad to feed him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with Presents that chiefly consisted in Horses, which are very beautiful in that Country. The Great <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> having taken <hi>Ormus,</hi> sent a powerful Army under the Command of <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> Governour of <hi>Shiras,</hi> to take in <hi>Balsara.</hi> Whereupon the Prince finding himself too weak to resist so great a Pow'r, made an agreement with the Desert <hi>Arabians</hi> to break down the Dam that stops the Sea. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, in came the Sea tumbling fifteen Leagues to <hi>Balsara,</hi> and four Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, which constrain'd the <hi>Persians,</hi> surrounded with water, and hearing at the same time of the death of <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> to raise their Siege. Since that inundation, several Lands and Gardens have been utterly barren, or have born very little, by reason of the Salt which the Sea has left behind.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Balsara</hi> has enter'd into Leagues with several strange Nations, so that whencesoever you come, you may be welcom. There is so much liberty and so good order in the City, that you may walk all night long in the Streets without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> bring Spices thither every year. The <hi>English</hi> carry Pepper and some few Cloves; but the <hi>Portugals</hi> have no Trade at all thither. The <hi>Indians</hi> bring Calicuts, Indigo, and all sorts of Merchandize. In short, there are Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of all Country's, from <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo, Damascus, Cairo,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Turkie,</hi> to buy such Merchandizes as come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> with which they lade the young Camels which they buy in that place; for thither the <hi>Arabians</hi> bring them to put them to sale. They that come from <hi>Diarbequir, Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssul, Bagdat, Mesopotamia,</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> send their Merchandizes up the <hi>Tigris</hi> by Water, but with great trouble and expence. In regard the Boats are to be tow'd by men, that cannot go above two Leagues and a half in a day, and against the Wind they cannot stir, which makes them oft-times between <hi>Balsara</hi> and <hi>Bagdat</hi> to be above sixty days, nay there have been some that have been three months upon the Water.</p>
                     <p>The Customs of <hi>Balsara</hi> amount to five in the hundred, but generally you have some favour shew'd you, either by the Customer or the Prince himself, that the Merchant does not really pay above four in the hundred. The Prince of <hi>Balsara</hi> is so good a Husband, that he lays up three millions of <hi>Liuers</hi> in a year. His chiefest Revenue is in four things, Money, Horses, Camels, and Date-trees; but in the last consists his chiefest wealth. For all the Country from the meeting of the two Rivers to the Sea, for the space of thirty Leagues together, is all cover'd with these Trees; nor does any one dare to touch a Date, 'till he has paid for every Tree three fourths of a <hi>Larin,</hi> or nine <hi>Sous French.</hi> The profit which the Prince makes upon money, proceeds from this, that the Merchants that come from abroad are oblig'd to carry their <hi>Reals</hi> to his Mint, where they are Coyn'd and converted into <hi>Larins,</hi> which is worth to him eight in the hundred. As for his Horses, there is no place in the world, where there are more fit for travel, or handsomer shap'd; for there are some that will travel thirty hours together and never draw bit, especially the Mares. But to return to the Palm-trees it is worth observation, that there is more Art to bring up those Trees than any other. The Natives dig a hole in the ground, wherein they heap a great quantity of Date-nuts in a Pyramidical form, the top
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106224:62"/>
whereof ends in one single Nut, which being cover'd with Earth produces the Palm-tree. Most of the people of the Country do say, that in regard there is among the Palm-trees the distinction of Male and Female, that therefore they must be planted one by another, for that otherwise the Female Tree will bear no Fruit. But others affirm that nicety to be unnecessary; and that it susfices, when the Male is in Blossom to take a Flower from the Male, and put it into the Heart of the Female a little above the Stem; for unless they should do so, all the Fruit would fall off before it came to maturity.</p>
                     <p>There is at <hi>Balsara</hi> a <hi>Cady</hi> that administers Justice, and who is establish'd by the authority of the Prince that commands there. In the City are also three sorts of Christians, <hi>Jacobites, Nestorians,</hi> and Christians of St. <hi>John.</hi> There is also a House of <hi>Italian Carmelites;</hi> and there was a House of <hi>Portugal Austin-</hi>Friars, but they have forsak'n the Town ever since their Country-men quitted the Trade.</p>
                     <p>The Christians of St. <hi>John</hi> are very numerous at <hi>Balsara,</hi> and the Villages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; who anciently liv'd by the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> where St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiz'd; and from whom they took their Name. But since the time that <hi>Mahomet</hi> conquer'd <hi>Palestine,</hi> though <hi>Mahomet</hi> formerly gave them his Hand and his Letters of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that they should not be molested, nevertheless they that succeeded the false Prophet resolv'd to extirpate them all; to which purpose they ruin'd their Churches, burnt their Books, and exercis'd all manner of cruelties upon their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: which oblig'd them to retire into <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and for some time they were under the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whom they separated about a hundred and sixty years ago. Then they remov'd into <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the Towns round about <hi>Balsara;</hi> as <hi>Souter, Despoul, Rumez, Bitoum, Mono, Endecan, Calufabat, Aveza, Dega, Dorech, Masquel, Gumar, Carianous, Balsara, Onezer, Zech, Loza.</hi> Nor do they inhabit City or Village by which there does not run a River. And many of their Bishops have assur'd me, that the Christians in all the foregoing places make above five and twenty thousand Families. There are some among them who are Merchants; but the most part of them are Trades-men, especially Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, Joyners, and Lock-smiths.</p>
                     <p>Their Creed is full of fables and foul errours. The <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> call them <hi>Sabbi,</hi> a People that have forsak'n their own Religion, to take up a new one. In their own Language they call themselves <hi>Mendai Jahia,</hi> or <hi>Disciples of St.</hi> John, from whom, as they ascertain us, they have receiv'd their Faith, their Books, and their Traditions. Every year they celebrate a Feast for about five days, during which time they go in Troops to their Bishops, who Baptize them according to the Baptism of St. <hi>John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They never Baptize but in Rivers, and only upon Sundays. But before they go to the River they carry the Infant to Church, where there is a Bishop who reads certain Prayers over the Head of the Child; from thence they carry the Child to the River, with a Train of Men and Women, who together with the Bishop go up to the knees in Water. Then the Bishop reads again certain Prayers out of a Book which he holds in his Hand, which done he sprinkles the Infant three times, saying, <hi>Beesmebrad er-Rabi, Kaddemin, Akreri, Menhal el gennet Alli Koulli Kralek;</hi> or, <hi>In the Name of the Lord, first and last of the World and of Paradise, the high Creator of all things.</hi> After that, the Bishop reads something again in his Book, while the God-father plunges the Child all over in the Water; after which they go all to the Parents House to feast. If any tax their Baptism for insufficient, in regard the Three Persons of the Divinity are not nam'd therein, they can make no rational defence for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Nor have they any knowledge of the Mystery of the Holy Trinity, only they say that Christ is the Spirit and Word of the Eternal Father. They are so blind as to believe the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to be the Son of God, begotten upon Light; yet will not believe the Eternal Generation of Christ, as God. Yet they confess he became Man, to free us from the Punishment of Sin: and that he was conceiv'd in the womb of a Virgin without the knowledge of Man, by means of the Water of a certain Fountain which she drank of. They believe he was crucifi'd by the <hi>Jews;</hi> that he rose the third day; and that his Soul ascending up to Heaven, his Body remain'd on Earth. But like the <hi>Mahometans</hi> they corrupt their Faith, by saying, that Christ vanish'd when the <hi>Jews</hi> came to take him, and that he deluded their cruelty with his Shadow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106224:62"/>
In the Eucharist they make use of Meal or Flow'r, kneaded up with Wine and Oyl: For, say they, the Body of Christ being compos'd of the two principal parts; Flesh and Blood, the Flowr and the Wine do most perfectly represent them; besides, that Christ at his Supper made use of Wine only, and not of Water. They add Oyl, to signifie the benefit we receive by his favour of the Sacrament, and to put us in mind of our Love and Charity towards God and our Neighbour. To make this Wine, they take Grapes dry'd in the Sun, which they call in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Zebibes,</hi> and casting Water upon them, let them steep for so long a time. The same Wine they use for the Consecration of the Cup. They make use of Raisins, in regard they are more easie to be had than Wine; the <hi>Persians,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Arabians,</hi> under whose Government they live, not permitting, nor indeed allowing them the use of it. Of all people that follow the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> there are none so opposite to other Religions, as these <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> about <hi>Balsara.</hi> The words of their Consecration, are no other than certain long Prayers, which they make to praise and thank God, at the same time blessing the Bread and Wine, never making mention of his Body and Blood; which they say is not at all necessary, because God knows their intentions. After all the Ceremonies are ended, the Priest takes the Bread, and having eaten some of it, distributes the rest to the People.</p>
                     <p>As to their Bishops and Priests, when any one dyes, who has a Son, they choose him in his place; and if he have no Son, they take the next a-kin that is most capable and best instructed in their Religion. They that make the Election, say several Prayers over him that is elected. If he be a Bishop, after he is receiv'd, and that he go about to Ordain others, he ought to fast six days, during which time he continually repeats certain Prayers over him that is to be ordain'd Priest, who also for his part fasts and prays all the said time. And whereas I say the Father succeeds the Son, it is to be observ'd, that among the Christians in those Parts, both Bishops and Priests marry, as do the rest of the people; only if their first Wife dye, they cannot marry another unless she be a Virgin. Moreover, they that are admitted to Ecclesiastical Functions, must be of the race of Bishops or Priests; and their Mothers must have been always Virgins when they were marry'd. All their Bishops and Priests wear their Hair long, and a little Cross wrought with a Needle.</p>
                     <p>When there is any Wedding to be, the kindred and persons invited go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Bridegroom, to the House where the Bride lives. Thither comes the Bishop also, and approaching the Bride, who is sitting under a Canopy; he asks her if she be a Virgin. If she answer that she is so, he makes her confirm it by an Oath. After which he returns to the Guests, and sends his Wife with some other skilful Women to make an inspection. If they find her to be a Virgin, the Bishop's Wife returns and makes Oath of it; and then they all go to the River, where the Bishop re-baptizes the Couple to be marry'd. Then they return toward the House, and making a stop before they come quite near it, the Bridegroom takes the Bride by the Hand, and leads her seven times from the Company to the House, the Bishop following them every time, and reading certain Prayers. After that they go into the House, and the Bride and Bridegroom place themselves under the Canopy, where they set their Shoulders one against another, and the Bishop reads again, causing them to lay their Heads together three times. Then op'ning a Book of Divination, and looking for the most fortunate day to consummate the Marriage, he tells them of it. But if the Bishop's Wife do not find the Bride to be a Virgin, the Bishop can proceed no farther, so that if the young Man have still a mind, he must go to some meaner Priest to perform the Ceremony. Which is the reason that the people take it for a great dishonour to be marry'd by any other than the Bishops; for when a Priest marries, 'tis an infallible sign that the Bride was no Virgin. The Priests also, in regard they take it to be a great Sin for a Woman to marry not being a Virgin, they never marry any such but by constraint, and to avoid ensuing inconveniencies; for sometimes in despite they will turn <hi>Mahometans.</hi> The reason of the Inspection is, that the Husbands may not be deceiv'd, and to keep the young Girls in awe.</p>
                     <p>As to what they believe touching the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> they say, that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> undertrking to create the World according to the command which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106224:63"/>
God gave him, took along with him three hundred thirty-six thousand Demons, and made the earth so fertile, that it was but to Sow in the Morning and Reap at Night. That the same Angel taught <hi>Adam</hi> to Plant and Sow, and all other necessary Sciences. Moreover that the same Angel made the seven lower Spheres, the least whereof reaches to the Center of the World, in the same manner as the Heavens do, all contriv'd one within another. That all these Spheres are of different Metals, the first next the Center is of Iron, the second of Lead, the third of Brass, the fourth of Laten, the fifth of Silver, the sixth of Gold, and the seventh of Earth. The seventh is that which contains all the rest, and is the chiefest of all, as being the most fruitful and profitable to Man, and the most proper to preserve Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whereas the rest seem rather to be fram'd for its destruction. They believe that over every Heaven there is Water, whence they conclude that the Sun swims in a Ship upon that Water, and that the Mast of his Ship is a Cross, and that there are a great number of Boys and Servants to guide the Ships of the Sun and Moon. Besides, they have the Picture of a Barque, which they say belong'd to the Angel <hi>Becan,</hi> whom God sends to visit the Sun and Moon, to see whither they move right or no, and keep close to their duty.</p>
                     <p>In reference to the other World and life to come, they believe there is no other World, but where Angels and Devils, the Souls of good and bad reside. That in that World there are Cities, Houses, and Churches, and that the Evil Spirits have also Churches, where they pray, singing and rejoycing upon Instruments, and Feasting as in this World. That when any one lies at the point of death, three hundred and sixty Demons come and carry his Soul to a place full of Serpents, Dogs, Lyons, Tygres, and Devils; who, if it be the Soul of a wicked man, tear it in pieces; but being the Soul of a just man, it creeps under the bellies of those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into the presence of God, who sits in his seat of Majesty to judge the World. That there are Angels also that weigh the Souls of Men in a Ballance, who being thought worthy, are admitted immediately into Glory. That the Angels and Devils are Male and Female, and beget Children. That the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> is the Son of God engender'd upon Light, and that he has a Daughter call'd <hi>Souret</hi> who has two Sons. That the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> has several Legions of Demons under him, who are instead of Souldiers, and others that are his Officers of justice, whom he sends from Town to Town, and from City to City, to punish the wicked.</p>
                     <p>In reference to Saints, they hold that Christ left twelve Apostles to Preach to the Nations. That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is not dead, but that she lives somewhere in the World, though there be no person that can tell where she is. That next to her St. <hi>John</hi> is the chiefest Saint in Heaven, and next to them <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of whom they recompt several miracles and Apocryphal tales. For they believe that they two begat St. <hi>John</hi> only by embracing; that when he came to be of age they Marry'd him, and that he had four Sons which he begat upon the waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi> That when St. <hi>John</hi> desir'd a Son, he pray'd to God, who drew him one out of the water; so that St. <hi>John</hi> had no more to do with his Wife but only to give her the Child to bring up. That he dy'd a natural death, but that he commanded his Disciples to Crucifie him after his death, that he might be like Christ. Lastly, that he dy'd in the City of <hi>Fuster,</hi> and that he was bury'd in a Chrystal Tomb, brought by miracle to the City, and that this Sepulchre was in a certain House near the River <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They highly honour the Cross, and sign themselves with it; but they are very careful of letting the <hi>Turks</hi> observe them; and during their Ceremonies, they set a Watch at their Church doors for fear the <hi>Turks</hi> should enter, and lay some unjust Fine upon them. When they have ador'd the Cross, they take it in two pieces, which they never put together again, 'till their Service rebegins. The reason why they so adore the Cross is drawn out of a Book which they have, Entitul'd <hi>The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi> Where it is written that every day early in the Morning, the Angels take the Cross and put it in the middle of the Sun, which receives his light from it, as the Moon also doth hers. They add, that in the same Book are Pictur'd two Ships, one of which is nam'd the Sun, the other the Moon; and tha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in every one of these Ships there is a Cross full of Bells: And moreover, that if there were not a Cross in those two Ships, the Sun and Moon would be depriv'd of Light, and the Ships would suffer Shipwrack.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106224:63"/>
Their chief Festivals are three. The one in Winter, that lasts three days, in memory of our first Parent and the Creation of the World. The other in the Month of <hi>August,</hi> that also lasts three days, which is call'd the Feast of St. <hi>John.</hi> The third which lasts five days in <hi>June,</hi> during which time they are all re-baptiz'd. They observe <hi>Sunday,</hi> doing no work upon that day. They neither Fast nor do any penance. They have no Canonical Books, but a great number of others that treat of nothing but Witchcraft, in which they believe their Priests to be very crafty, and that the Devils are at their beck. They hold all Women to be unclean, and that it is not at all available for them to come to the Church.</p>
                     <p>They have one Ceremony, which they call the Ceremony <hi>of the Hen,</hi> of which they make great Accompt, which is not lawful for any to perform but a Priest Born of a Virgin at the time of her Marriage. When a hen is to be kill'd, the Priest puts off his ordinary habit, and puts on a Linnen Cloth, girding his waste with a second, and throwing a third about his shoulders like a Stole. Then he takes the Fowl, and plunges it in the water to make it clean; after which he turns toward the East and cuts off the head, holding the Body in his hand 'till it has bled out all the blood. While the Hen bleeds, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, as if he were in an extasie, he repeats in his own Language these words following: <hi>In the name of God, may this flesh be profitable to all that eat of it?</hi> They observe the same ceremony when they kill Sheep. For first, they cleanse the place very carefully where the Sheep is to be kill'd, washing it with water, and strewing it with boughs, nor is the number of people small that assists at this Ceremony, as if it were at some solemn Sacrifice. If you ask them why it is not lawful for the Laity to kill Fowls? They answer that it is no more lawful for them to kill than to consecrate them; and that is all the reason which they bring. They eat of nothing drest by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and if a <hi>Turk</hi> ask them for drink, so soon as he has drank, they break the Cup. And to make the <hi>Turks</hi> more hateful, they Picture <hi>Mahomet</hi> like a great Gyant, shut up in Prison in Hell with four more of his Parents; and they say, that all the <hi>Turks</hi> are carry'd into the same place full of wild Beasts to be there devour'd.</p>
                     <p>They pretend all to Salvation. For say they, after the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> had fram'd the World by the command of God, he thus discours'd him. <hi>Lord God,</hi> said he, <hi>behold I have built the World as thou didst command me. It has put me to a great deal of trouble, and my Brethren also, to raise such high Mountains that seem to sustain Heaven. And who indeed was able to make way for Rivers through Mountains without vast labour, and to give every thing its proper place? Moreover, great God, by the aid of thy powerfull Arm, we have brought the World to so much perfection, that men cannot think upon any thing needful for them, which is not to be found therein. But instead of that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which I ought to have for having accomplish'd so great a work, I find no reason but to be altogether griev'd.</hi> When God demanding the cause, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> answer'd: <hi>My God and Father, I will tell you what afflicts me; because that after the making of the World as I have done, I foresee that there will come into it a prodigious number of</hi> Jews, Turks, <hi>Idolaters, and other Infidels, Enemies of your Name, who will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to eat and enjoy the Fruits of our Labours.</hi> To whom God thus reply'd: <hi>Never grieve, my Son, there shall live in this World which thou hast built, certain Christians of St.</hi> John <hi>who shall be my friends, and shall be all sav'd.</hi> Upon which the Angel admiring how that should be! <hi>What,</hi> said he, <hi>will there not be several Sinners among those Christians, and by consequence will not they be your Enemies?</hi> To whom God thus concluded: <hi>That at the day of Judgment the Good should Pray for the Wicked, and by that means they should be all forgiv'n, and obtain Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Christians have a strange Antipathy against the Blew Colour call'd Indigo, which they will not so much as touch. For certain <hi>Jews</hi> dreaming that their Law should be abolish'd by St. <hi>John,</hi> told it their Country-men. Which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and seeing that St. <hi>John</hi> prepar'd to Baptize Christ, in a great rage, fetch'd a vast quantity of Indigo, which they call <hi>Nill</hi> in their Language, and flung it into <hi>Jordan.</hi> They add also that those waters continu'd unclean for some time, and had hinder'd the Baptism of Christ, had not God sent his Angels with a large Vessel of water, which he caus'd them to fill out of <hi>Jordan</hi> before the <hi>Jews</hi> had defil'd it with Indigo; for which reason God particularly Curs'd that Colour.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> A Continuation of the Road from <hi>Balsara</hi> to <hi>Ormus.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe tenth of <hi>April</hi> we set out from <hi>Balsara</hi> for <hi>Bander-Congo,</hi> for which passage we hir'd a <hi>Terrade</hi> or a Barque for the purpose; for they which are laden with Dates are generally so overcharg'd, that if a Storm rises, they are in danger of being overset. The River of <hi>Balsara</hi> is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by reason of the Sands which also lie up and down the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, and are very prejudicial to Navigation in that place. On both sides the Gulf that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates <hi>Persia</hi> from <hi>Arabia the Happy,</hi> live a sort of poor people that follow no other Trade than fishing; so poor, that when they bring fish to your Vessel, they require nothing for it but Rice; and not the best neither, but such course stuff as we feed our Hens and Pigs withall. I gave them a Sack of thirty or forty pounds, and bid them make merry with it, but they told me, they must be careful how they spent such Rice as that, unless it were for their Sick, or at their Weddings; so that if the rest of <hi>Arabia the Happy</hi> be like that, assuredly 'tis rather a most unfortunate Country.</p>
                     <p>There are several Isles in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, but the chiefest of all is the Isle of <hi>Baharen,</hi> where they fish for Pearls, of which I have spoken in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Near to the place where <hi>Euphrates</hi> falls from <hi>Balsarae</hi> into the Sea, there is a little Island, where the Barques generally come to an Anchor, in expectation of the wind. There we stay'd four days, whence to <hi>Bandar-Congo</hi> it is fourteen days Sail, and we got thither the twenty-third of <hi>April.</hi> This place would be a far better habitation for the Merchants than <hi>Ormus,</hi> where it is very unwholesom and dangerous to live. But that which hinders the Trade from <hi>Bandar-Congo,</hi> is because the Road to <hi>Lar</hi> is so bad, by reason of the want of Water, and craggy narrow ways, which only Camels can endure; but from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Lar</hi> the way is tollerable. We stay'd at <hi>Bandar-Congo</hi> two days, where there is a <hi>Portugais</hi> Factor, who receives one half of the Customs by agreement with the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> By the way take notice, that they who will go by Water from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Balsara,</hi> must take the Natives for their Pilots, and be continually sounding besides.</p>
                     <p>The thirtieth, we hir'd a Vessel for <hi>Bander-Abassi,</hi> and after three or four hours Sailing, we put into a Village upon the Sea-side, in the Island of <hi>Keck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Keckmishe</hi> is an Island three Leagues about, and about five or six from <hi>Ormus.</hi> It exceeds in Fertility all the Islands of the East, that produce neither Wheat nor Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; but at <hi>Keckmishe</hi> is a Magazine of both, without which <hi>Ormus</hi> would hardly subsist, in regard it furnishes that City with most of their Provision for their Horses. There is in the Island a Spring of good Water, for the preservation of which, the <hi>Persians</hi> have built a Fort, least the <hi>Portugals</hi> when they held <hi>Ormus,</hi> should get it into their Possession.</p>
                     <p>In 1641. aud 1642. the <hi>Hollanders</hi> falling out with the King of <hi>Persia</hi> about their Silk Trade, besieg'd this Island. For the Ambassadors of the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> were jealous that they came to fetch away all the Silk; and thereupon enhanc'd the Market from forty-two to fifty <hi>Tomans.</hi> When the Ambassadors were gone, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would pay no more than forty-four, which was two <hi>Tomans</hi> more than they were us'd to do. The King netl'd that they would not stand to their words, forbid that they should make sale of their Goods 'till they had paid their Customs, from which 'till that time they were exempted. Thereupon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> besieg'd the Fortress of <hi>Keckmishe,</hi> but the Heats were so intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they were forc'd to quit their design with great loss of their Men; and at length by great Presents to the chief Courtiers, they obtain'd to pay no more than forty-six <hi>Tomans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Larec</hi> is an Island nearer to <hi>Ormus</hi> than <hi>Keckmishe,</hi> well inhabited, and so stor'd with Stags and Hinds, that in one day we kill'd five and forty.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Keckmishe</hi> we Sail'd for <hi>Ormus,</hi> where we arriv'd the first of <hi>May.</hi> I had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106224:64"/>
put my choicest Goods in a Chest directed for the <hi>Hollaad</hi> Commander at <hi>Ormus,</hi> by which means I got the Custom free.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf is the most dangerous Gulf I know, by reason of the shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sharp Promontories that point out into the Sea; and therefore the best way is to take a Pilot at <hi>Ormus</hi> or <hi>Bander-Congo,</hi> and the most proper Pilots are the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are only skill'd in that Sea and no farther. The Soyl about the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf is dry Sand and without Water, so that it is impossible to Travel by Land from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Balsara.</hi> The Merchants would be glad to find a way through the Coast of <hi>Arabia</hi> to get to <hi>Mascaté,</hi> whence there might a cut be made to <hi>Sindi, Diu,</hi> or <hi>Surat,</hi> which are the three chief Ports of <hi>India.</hi> During the difference between the King of <hi>Persia</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Vodana</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince; offer'd to shew them an easie Road from <hi>Mascaté</hi> to <hi>Balsara.</hi> But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fearing to break with the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> where they vended above fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand pounds of their Pepper, and paid therewith for all their Silk, did not think it worth their while to quit <hi>Ormus</hi> to settle themselves at <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caté.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had it been yielded to, the way had been from <hi>Balsara</hi> to <hi>Elcatif</hi> a Sea-Town in <hi>Arabia the Happy,</hi> where there is a Fishery for Pearls that belongs to the <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Elcatif.</hi> From <hi>Elcatif</hi> to <hi>Mascalat,</hi> another City of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the residence of another <hi>Emir.</hi> From <hi>Mascalat</hi> to <hi>Vodana,</hi> a good handsom City seated upon the meeting of two little Rivers that carry Barques to the Sea, and run together by the single name of <hi>Moyesur.</hi> The Soyl about <hi>Vodana</hi> produces no Corn, and very little Rice; but it abounds in Fruits, especially Prunes and Quinces, which are not so sour as ours, and are eaten by the Natives as Pears. There are extraordinary good Melons and great Store of Grapes, of which the <hi>Jews,</hi> who inhabit the best part of the City, are permitted to make Wine. From <hi>Vodana</hi> to the Gulf, the County of each side is full of Palm-Trees, the Dates being the Food of the common people, who have not Money to buy either Corn or Rice. From <hi>Vodana</hi> to <hi>Mascatè</hi> it is but fifteen Leagues, though by the Maps, which are Erroneous, the way is describ'd to be much longer.</p>
                     <p>Being at <hi>Ormus,</hi> the <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Vodana</hi> shew'd me a Pearl transparent and perfectly round, that weigh'd seventeen <hi>Abas,</hi> or fourteen <hi>Carats</hi> and seven <hi>Eights;</hi> for in all the Pearl Fisheries of the East they use no other weights but <hi>Abas,</hi> which make seven Eights of a <hi>Carat.</hi> I offer'd him 300000 <hi>Piasters,</hi> or 60000 <hi>Roupies</hi> for the same Pearl, but the <hi>Emir</hi> refus'd to take it, telling me that he had been offer'd more Money for it by several Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> who had sent to him to buy it, but that he was resolv'd never to part with it.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Departed out of <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1657, and Embark'd at <hi>Marseilles</hi> for <hi>Ligorn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We set Sail from <hi>Ligorn</hi> seven Vessels together, two bound for <hi>Venice,</hi> one for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> one for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and three for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in one of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Dutch</hi> Vessel I Embark'd. But before I leave <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to begin my Journey from <hi>Tauris,</hi> give me leave to relate the story of four <hi>French-men,</hi> the various acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents whereof will much enlight'n the Reader into the Customs and Manners, as well of the <hi>Turks</hi> as <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While I stay'd the departure of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> which could not be ready in five or six Weeks, as also upon the advice of a rich <hi>Jew</hi> and a Merchant of Jewels at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> who had several Pearls to sell, as well for their beauty as their bigness, the best Commodity a man can carry to the <hi>Indies,</hi> I sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> a person that I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106224:65"/>
carry'd along with me, one that was well vers'd in that sort of Commodity. There was a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman nam'd <hi>de Reville</hi> then at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who would needs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany my Factor, so that they went both together in a Vessel that carry'd the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador and his Lady to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This Gentleman had two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Ducats</hi> in his Purse, wanting neither wit nor courage, besides a good presence; but perhaps he was more hasty in his proceedings than the reserv'dness of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try requir'd. He had left the Service of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> thinking to find an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Service of the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Candy;</hi> but failing in his expectations, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to travel into <hi>Persia.</hi> While he was at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> who lay hold upon all opportunities of gain, soon found out my Factor; and besides the Pearls which he desir'd to see, they shew'd him several other rich Stones to try whether they could draw him in; for he had refus'd the Pearls because they held them at too high a Rate. The <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman fell into their acquaintance; and picking out the richest, told him, that being resolv'd for the <hi>Indies,</hi> he had a mind to lay out four thousand <hi>Ducats</hi> in Pearls. He added also, that he would pay him half in Money, half in Goods, and at the same time shew'd the <hi>Jew</hi> two thousand <hi>Ducats,</hi> which the <hi>Jew</hi> had already devour'd with his eyes. Some four days after, the <hi>Jew</hi> brought the Gentleman four fair Pearles with some Emraulds; and you may be sure they easily agreed upon the price, in regard the Gentleman had a design to put a trick upon the <hi>Jew.</hi> Thereupon he shews his <hi>Ducats</hi> a second time, which the <hi>Jew,</hi> who thought he had a Cully, presently told out as his own. After that the <hi>Jew</hi> desiring to see the Goods, which made up the other part of the payment, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman without any more ado told him, that all the Merchandize which he had to pay him, was a good strong Quartan Ague which had held him a long time, and indeed such a one, that he could not possibly meet with a better, but that he would not over-rate it, in regard he ask'd but two thousand <hi>Ducats</hi> for it. The <hi>Jew</hi> who was rich and in great credit at Court, was so incens'd at his raillery, that he had like to have made a wicked stir about it. For as he had heard him say, that the Gentleman was going into the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> he might have easily caus'd him to have been apprehended for a Spy. But in regard the <hi>Jews</hi> can do nothing in point of Trade without the assistance of the <hi>French</hi> Merchants, he adviz'd with some of them, who perswaded him that it was an Act of folly, which it better became him to excuse, and desir'd him to take his Goods again, and put up the business; which with much ado they perswaded him to condescend to. The Gentleman fearing least the <hi>Jews</hi> underhand should do him a private mischief, stole away with what speed he could, and return'd to <hi>Smyrna.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>De Reville</hi> being thus return'd to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> put himself into an <hi>Almadier,</hi> which is a small Vessel of War, that generally touches at <hi>Chio</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> being bound for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> from whence there is always some convenience or other to get to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Aleppo;</hi> and while he stay'd there he met with two <hi>French</hi> men, the one whose name was <hi>Neret,</hi> the other <hi>Hautin,</hi> who was an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptant. They had four wooden Chests full of false Stones ready set, by which they flatter'd themselves to be great gainers in <hi>Persia.</hi> They went from <hi>Marseilles</hi> to <hi>Seyde,</hi> from <hi>Seyde</hi> to <hi>Damas,</hi> hearing that there was an opportunity to Travel to <hi>Bagdat</hi> with the <hi>Topigi-Bashi.</hi> This <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> or chief of the Engineers, was he that assisted <hi>Amurath</hi> in the taking of <hi>Bagdat;</hi> in recompence whereof the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> gave him a <hi>Timar,</hi> or Lordship in <hi>Damas</hi> worth four thousand Crowns a year. Now it was his custom every year to visit <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and to stay there during the Season, that there was any probability of the King of <hi>Persia's</hi> besieging it; which Season not lasting above three or four Months, when that was over, he return'd to <hi>Damas.</hi> He usually had about thirty Horse with him, with which he never made it above eighteen or twenty days, taking the shortest cut directly through the Desert, where the <hi>Arabs</hi> are commanded to bring him Victuals upon the Road. And he is willing at any time when he has this opportunity, to conduct the <hi>Franks</hi> that desire it that way, in regard they are never ungrateful to him for it. These two <hi>Franks</hi> therefore having desir'd that they might be taken into his Company, the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> readily consented, provided they could stay 'till he went, which would not be 'till two or three Months; with which answer they were well satisfi'd. But the two <hi>Franks</hi> had not stay'd at <hi>Damas</hi> above seven or eight days but they fell acquainted with a <hi>Spahi,</hi> a <hi>Renegado</hi> of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> who proffer'd to carry them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106224:65"/>
through the Road of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> so that they should be at <hi>Ispahan</hi> before the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> set out from <hi>Damas.</hi> Thereupon they privately departed out of <hi>Damas</hi> without acquainting the <hi>Topigi-Bashi,</hi> who understanding they were gone after the courtesie he had offer'd them, was so enrag'd at their uncivillity, that he sent two of his <hi>Arabian</hi> Servants directly through the Wilderness to the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> to give him advice of two <hi>Franks</hi> that were to pass that way; who were most certainly Spies, describing them withall from head to foot.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while the two <hi>Franks</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Ourfa,</hi> the <hi>Spahi,</hi> as he had contriv'd his own design at <hi>Damas,</hi> goes to the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Ourfa,</hi> and informs him that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted thither two <hi>Franks,</hi> who could be no other than Spies. Thereupon the <hi>Basha</hi> seiz'd upon them and all their Goods, among the rest he laid his paws upon seven hundred Piasters, of which the <hi>Spahi</hi> no doubt had his share. And this may serve for instruction to Travellers to have a care how and with whom they Travel in <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While the two <hi>French</hi> men were in hold at <hi>Ourfa</hi> by one sort of Treachery, the <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman and his Companion arriv'd at <hi>Bagdat.</hi> But they had no sooner set their feet upon the shore, when the <hi>Basha</hi> verily believing them to be the persons, of whom the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> had giv'n him notice, caus'd them to be brought before him, and seiz'd upon their Goods and Letters, of which they had several for the <hi>Consul</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and other rich Merchants for <hi>Persia.</hi> The <hi>Basha</hi> sent for the <hi>Capuchins</hi> to read those Letters, but not believing them, he sent for a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Physitian which he had in his Service, and his Treasurer who had been a Slave tak'n in <hi>Candy.</hi> But neither Physitian, Treasurer, nor <hi>Capuchins</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret any thing in prejudice of the <hi>French</hi> men; yet all that could not preserve them from being shut up in a Stable full of dung, and from being threaten'd to be Shot out of a Cannon's mouth if they would not confess the truth. Thereupon the <hi>Capuchins</hi> and the <hi>Cadi</hi> beg'd him to suspend his Sentence 'till the Arrival of the chief of the Cannoniers, to which he readily consented.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> came, the <hi>Basha</hi> commanded the Prisoners to be brought before him. But when the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> deny'd them to be the persons, the <hi>Basha</hi> grew into such a rage, that he no less reproach'd the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> for Treachery, than he had accus'd the others. Which so incens'd the <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> on the other side, that he never left 'till he had obtain'd the release of the two <hi>French</hi> men; yet not so, but that the <hi>Basha</hi> would have his due; so that <hi>Reville</hi> was forc'd to leave some of his <hi>Ducats</hi> behind which the <hi>Jew</hi> should have had.</p>
                     <p>But now to return to <hi>Smyrna</hi> where I expected the <hi>Caravan</hi> for some time in order to my Journey into <hi>Persia.</hi> Every thing being provided, we set forward in the Road for <hi>Tauris,</hi> which I have at large describ'd, nor was there any thing worthy observation all the way. I will only take notice, that when we departed from <hi>Tocat,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the heat was so extream, we left the common Road toward the North, and took the way through the Mountains, where there is always a fresh Breeze and store of shady Lanes. In many of which high Mountains we met with Snow, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent Sorrel; and upon the tops of some of those Mountains, we met with several sorts of shells, as it had been upon the Sea shore, which is very extraordinary. From <hi>Erzerom</hi> we went to <hi>Cars;</hi> from <hi>Cars</hi> we came to <hi>Erivan,</hi> The <hi>Kan</hi> was not there then, being retir'd during the heat into the Mountains, a days Journey from the City. His Lieutenant telling me that I could not well pass farther without paying my duty to the <hi>Kan;</hi> I follow'd his advice, and found him in his Tent in a fair Dale, where there was a great quantity of Snow: and where when it began to melt, appear'd several beautiful Flowers, so that Summer and Winter seem'd to lodge both in the same place. The <hi>Kan</hi> entertain'd both me and all my Company most nobly for ten days. I drove also a small Trade with him. For I durst not shew him the rarities I had, being design'd for the King. For as in <hi>India,</hi> so in <hi>Persia,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the King look upon any thing which his Subjects have seen before, nor will the Subject buy any thing which the King has seen, it being an affront to present any thing to the King which he had formerly view'd, and the Subject buys nothing rare but what he intends to present.</p>
                     <p>Being past <hi>Erivan</hi> you may leave your <hi>Caravan</hi> when you please, by reason of the security of the Roads in <hi>Persia.</hi> And indeed I intended to have visited the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Gengéa,</hi> but finding the Road so full of Rocks and Precipices, where a man was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106224:66"/>
continually in danger of breaking his Neck, I turn'd my Horses head and met the <hi>Caravan</hi> at <hi>Nacksivan</hi> in the Road to <hi>Tauris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan</hi> I met with nothing worthy observation. When I came to the Court I was well receiv'd by the King, and I sold him as many Jewels and other Goods of great value, as came to sixty-two thousand Crowns. But of this more in another place.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Authors sixth and last Voyage from his setting out of <hi>Paris,</hi> to his Landing at <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Set out of <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1663. for <hi>Lyons,</hi> with six several Servants of several professions, which I thought most proper for my business. I carry'd with me the value of about four hundred thousand <hi>Livers,</hi> part in Jewels, part in <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> work and other curiosities, which I design'd for the King of <hi>Persia</hi> and the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> Being at <hi>Lyons</hi> I bought a Steel Mirrour round and hollow, about two foot and a half in Diameter, would immediately melt a Half-Crown by the heat of the Sun-beams: and if you set a Candle by it in the night, you might read, two hundred Paces off in your Bed by the reflection.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Lyons</hi> I rode to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and set Sail for <hi>Ligorn</hi> the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> 1664. in a small Bark, but being scar'd by a great Vessell that we saw off at Sea, we came to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Agaïe,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Frejus,</hi> where there stood a pittiful Fort with two or three Houses. There we also went ashore and saw a Garden, the Alleys of which were distinguish'd with rows of Citron and Orange Trees, which look'd as Green in the depth of Winter as in the midst of Summer, with several other curiosities after the mode of <hi>Italy.</hi> We were no sooner got aboard again, but we perceiv'd another Vessel making into the same Port with sull Sail. It was a Vessel which the Masters of the Forein Office at <hi>Toulon,</hi> had set out
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106224:67"/>
to force all Ships that were bound into <hi>Italy</hi> to pay certain Customs, which those of <hi>Marseilles</hi> would not pay when they came into the Port of <hi>Toulon.</hi> Thereupon foreseeing that there would be mischief done, I call'd for my little Chests that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd my Goods of greatest value, carrying some part my self, and giving the rest to one of my most trusty Servants, thinking to have skipt into a <hi>Genoa</hi> Bark that lay hard by us; but instead of leaping a-board, I fell into the Sea: where by reason of the Tumult I had perish'd without relief, had I not by good fortune laid hold of a Cable and redeem'd my self. At what time one of my Servants luckily coming to my ayd, with much ado drew me up safe again.</p>
                     <p>Having escap'd this danger, I got a-shoar with such of my Servants as I had about me, and meeting with a Bark of <hi>Frontignan</hi> that carry'd <hi>Languedock-</hi>Wine to the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> I hir'd him for <hi>Ligorn;</hi> and setting Sail, we first touch'd <hi>Villa-franca,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Monaco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At <hi>Monaco</hi> I went a-shoar, and went to wait upon Madam the Princess, who shew'd me the Rarities in the Castle; among the rest, several pieces of extraordinary Painting, several pieces of Clock-work and Goldsmiths-work. But among all her Curiosities she shew'd me two pieces of Crystal, about the bigness of two Fists each, in one of which there was above a Glass full of Water, in the other a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Moss; which were clos'd in by Nature when the Crystal first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Monaco</hi> is a Castle situated upon a steep Rock, advancing out into the Sea; which advantage, together with others which it receives from Art and Nature, renders it one of the most considerable Forts in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day finding the <hi>Frontignan-</hi>Vessel to be deep-laden, and that it made little way, I took a Faluke, and kept along by the Shoar, which was most pleasantly adorn'd with beautiful Villages and Houses, as far as <hi>Savona;</hi> where I chang'd my Faluke, to compleat the rest of the way which I had to <hi>Genoa.</hi> Half the way we did very well, but the Wind rising, we were forc'd to put in to a great Town, where we landed; and from thence, having but nine Miles, I got in good time by Horse to <hi>Genoa.</hi> There can be no Prospect certainly more pleasing than that nine Miles riding. For on the one side you see nothing but a continu'd Row of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Buildings and lovely Gardens; on the other a calm Shoar, upon which the Waves seem not to beat, but lovingly to kiss.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at <hi>Genoa,</hi> I met with the rest of my Servants; and at the end of two days I embarqu'd for <hi>Ligorn,</hi> where we arriv'd in four and twenty hours.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ligorn</hi> I went to the Court of <hi>Florence,</hi> to wait upon the Grand Duke. By whom I had the honour to be admitted into his Chamber, where I found no body attending but one Mute, who had a long time serv'd his Highness: and I observ'd that they understood one another by Signs, as perfectly as if the Mute had had his Speech and Hearing. So that when-ever the Duke sent him into his Closet for any Papers or other thing whatsoever, he never fail'd to bring the right.</p>
                     <p>After I had tak'n my leave of the Duke, he sent me a noble Present of Wine and Fruits; but that which I valu'd more than all the rest, was a Case of Medicaments and Counter-poysons, in the composition whereof the <hi>Italians</hi> are very exquisite. And yet they did me no service; for when I came into the hot Countries their fermentation was so strong, that all the Oyls and Treacles broke their several Boxes, that I could save nothing of that precious Present.</p>
                     <p>The next day, being the twenty-sixth of <hi>March</hi> 1664, I embarqu'd with all my Servants in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Vessel call'd <hi>The Justice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-seventh we staid in the Road, expecting the rest of the Fleet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of eleven Ships, two Men of War, and nine Merchant-mon; four of which were bound for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> three for <hi>Ancona,</hi> and two for <hi>Venice.</hi> About seven that evening we set Sail, and all that night the Wind was favourable, but blew hard and veer'd often; which was the reason that two of our Fleet separated from us, steering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Isle of <hi>Elbe</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> while we kept on between the Isle of <hi>Elba</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-eighth by eight in the Morning we found our selves between <hi>Porto Ferraro</hi> and <hi>Piombino,</hi> and it being fair Weather, we had a pleasant prospect of those two places. From thence we steer'd between two Ilands, the one call'd <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majela,</hi> the other being nameless. About six hours after we saw <hi>Portolongone,</hi> afterwards at a distance we descry'd <hi>Monte-Christo.</hi> An hour after Noon we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106224:67"/>
                        <hi>Castiglon-sore,</hi> all the rest of the day we coasted by the Ilands of <hi>Gigio</hi> and <hi>Sanuti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-ninth, with the same Wind at North-West, by Morning we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Ilands of <hi>Pontia</hi> and <hi>Palmerola,</hi> and about Evening those of <hi>Ventitione</hi> and <hi>Ischia.</hi> Night approaching, and there being no news of the Ships we had lost, instead of making the <hi>Pharo</hi> of <hi>Messina,</hi> it was resolv'd that we should steer a Course round about <hi>Messina,</hi> where we expected to overtake them. At eleven a Clock in the Evening we had but little Wind at North-North-West, so that we made not above fourteen Leagues of way.</p>
                     <p>The thirty-first the same Wind continu'd, with a high Sea; but about nine at Night the Wind chopping about to the West, we kept our former Course.</p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>April,</hi> by eight of the Clock in the Morning we discover'd the three Ilands that lye before <hi>Trepano, Levanzo, Maretima,</hi> and <hi>Favagna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second and third the Weather was ill, and the Wind unconstant, so that we made but little way.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, by break of day we discover'd the Iland of <hi>Pantalarea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth by Morning we found our selves within a League and a half of the Coast of <hi>Sicily,</hi> just against <hi>Cape Passaro,</hi> at what time, the Weather being fair, we had a view of Mount <hi>Gibello,</hi> all cover'd with Snow. Doubling the Cape in the Afternoon, we discover'd the Coast of <hi>Saragossa.</hi> The sixth we had little or no Wind. But the seventh in the Morning, the Weather being fair, we discover'd Cape <hi>Spartivento;</hi> and the same Wind continuing all that day, toward Evening we sail'd in view of other Ilands of <hi>Calabria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eighth we found our selves near to Cape <hi>Borsano,</hi> and all the rest of the day we sail'd in view of Cape <hi>Stillo</hi> and Cape <hi>delle Colonne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ninth we made little way. But on the tenth in the Morning the Wind coming about to the South, we found our selves at the Entry of the Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> between Cape St. <hi>Mary</hi> and the Coast of <hi>Greece,</hi> where the Mountains were cover'd with Snow. About ten of the Clock we tack'd to our own Course, while the Ships that were bound for <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Ancona</hi> entred the Gulf.</p>
                     <p>The tenth by Morning we saw two little Islands, the one call'd <hi>Fauno,</hi> the other <hi>Merlera;</hi> and were in sight of <hi>Corfu.</hi> About Noon, the Wind being at East, we kept out at Sea: and about Evening abundance of little Birds lighted upon our Cordage, of which we caught enow to make a lusty Fricassie. We also caught four Falcons, Owls, and good store of Turtles.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh and twelfth the Wind being at East, we lay hovering about the Shoar, without making any way.</p>
                     <p>The fourteenth and fifteenth having the Wind at North-West, we were two days without seeing Land, yet we caught good store of Birds.</p>
                     <p>The sixteenth the same Wind continuing, we found our selves near the Island of <hi>Zant.</hi> From eight in the Morning 'till three in the Afternoon we were becalm'd; but then a good brisk West Wind carry'd away all our little Birds.</p>
                     <p>The seventeenth and eighteenth we were becalm'd.</p>
                     <p>The nineteenth in the Morning, the Wind being at North-West, we discover'd Cape <hi>Gullo,</hi> between <hi>Modon</hi> and <hi>Coron,</hi> in the <hi>Morea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twentieth, with the same Wind that blew fresh, we found our selves by Morning within two Cannon-shot of Cape <hi>Matapan,</hi> which is the most Southern Cape of all <hi>Europe.</hi> About Noon the Wind coming full West, in three hours we pass'd by the Point of the Island <hi>Cerigo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-first in the Morning, we discover'd the Islands of <hi>Caravi</hi> and <hi>Falconera</hi> on the one side, and Cape <hi>Schilli</hi> on the other hand. Two hours after, having a fresh Gale at South-West, about Evening we were in view of the Island of St. <hi>George.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-second though the Wind slackn'd, yet we made some way; for in the Morning we found our selves between the Island of <hi>Zea</hi> and the <hi>Morea,</hi> near to another Cape <hi>delle Colonne:</hi> afterwards we discover'd the Island of <hi>Negropont,</hi> and doubl'd the Cape three hours after Noon, having left sight of the Island of <hi>Andros</hi> by ten in the Forenoon.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-third the Wind blowing fresh all the night, by morning we found our selves near the Island of <hi>Ipsera.</hi> At noon we made the Point of the Island of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106224:68"/>
                        <hi>Chio,</hi> near to the Land; and that night we came to an Anchor near the Castle, being becalm'd.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fourth the Wind rose at North-West, which blew us into the Port of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-fifth we went a-shoar, having had as quiet a passage as ever I had in my Life for twenty days together.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A Continuation of the Author's sixth Voyage, as he travel'd from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE staid at <hi>Smyrna</hi> from the twenty-fifth of <hi>April</hi> to the ninth of <hi>June;</hi> during which time there happ'nd so terrible an Earthquake, that I had like to have tumbl'd out of my Bed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caravan</hi> being ready to set out for <hi>Tauris,</hi> I took with me three <hi>Armenian</hi> Servants, besides those that I carry'd out of <hi>France</hi> to serve me upon the Road.</p>
                     <p>We set out of <hi>Smyrna</hi> upon Monday the ninth of <hi>June</hi> at three a Clock in the afternoon. The <hi>Caravan</hi> rendevouz'd at <hi>Pont-garbashi,</hi> three Leagues from the City, consisting of six hundred Camels, and almost the same number of Horse. We set out the next night, two hours after midnight. As for the Road I shall say nothing, only relate some Passages that fell out by the way.</p>
                     <p>Being come to <hi>Erivan,</hi> the fourteenth of <hi>September</hi> we encamp'd in a pleasant green place between the Castle and the old Town; for we would not lye in the Inn, because we heard that several sick people lodg'd there. We staid there two days; during which time I resolv'd to wait upon the <hi>Kan,</hi> I found him in a Room made in one of the Arches of the Bridge which is built over the River, which I have describ'd already, with several Captains and Officers about him: when he had ask'd me whence I came, and whither I was travelling, he caus'd a Glass of Liquor to be fill'd me. After that I presented him with a Prospective-Glass, six pair of ordinary Spectacles, twelve other pair of Spectacles that cast several Reflexions, two little Pistols, and a Steel to strike Fire, made like a Pistol. All which pleas'd him extremely well, especially the Spectacles, for he was sixty years of age. Thereupon he commanded a Lamb, Wine, Fruit, and Melons to be carry'd to my Tent, and that I should want nothing. After that we sate down to Dinner, but I observ'd the <hi>Kan</hi> himself drank no Wine, though he press'd me to it. The reason was, because he was an <hi>Agis,</hi> that is, one that had made his Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca;</hi> for then it is not lawful to drink Wine, or any other inebriating Drink. After Dinner, finding him in a pleasant humour, I resolv'd to complain to him of one of the Custom-Officers about an injury he had done me. For it is usual with the Customer in this place to op'n the Chests of all the Merchants, both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> to the end that if they have any thing of Rarity the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Erivan</hi> may see it: for many times, he buyes what pleases him best to send to the King. This Officer would not excuse me for his Custom, and therefore at my very first arrival he would have me to op'n my Chests; and because I did not do it according to his Orders, he ask'd me very rudely why I had not obey'd his Commands: I answer'd him as surlily, that I would op'n my Chest no where unless it were in the presence of the King, and that as for him, I knew him not: Upon that he threaten'd me, that if he did not find my Chests op'n the next day, he would op'n them by force; thereupon I said no more, but bid-him have a care I did not make him repent of what he had done already. This was the ground of the Quarrel, and I was about to have complain'd to the <hi>Kan;</hi> but his Nephew intreated me for the love I bare him, not to say any thing of it, and promis'd to send the Customer to me to beg my Pardon, which he did, and the Customer was forc'd to crave it heartily. To avoid the same inconvenience for the future, I desir'd the <hi>Kan</hi> to give me his Pasport, to the end I might pass Custom-free
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106224:68"/>
through the Territories of his Government, which he freely and courteously granted me: <hi>Come,</hi> said he, <hi>and dine with me to morrow, and you shall have it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twenty-sixth of <hi>September</hi> we departed from <hi>Erivan,</hi> and the ninth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> we came to <hi>Tauris,</hi> taking the ordinary Road.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Erivan</hi> two of my Servants, the one a Watch-maker, the other a Gold-smith, dy'd; I left them sick there, but caus'd them to be buried in the Church-yard belonging to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> One of them dy'd in fifteen days, of a Gangrene, which eat out his Mouth and Throat; being the Disease of the Country. Though had the <hi>Armenians</hi> known that one of them had been a Protestant, they would never have allow'd him to have been bury'd in their Church-yard.</p>
                     <p>Here observe the exact justice, wherewith the <hi>Persians</hi> preserve the Goods of Strangers. For the Civil Judge hearing of the death of the Watch-maker, caus'd his Chamber to be seal'd up, to the end the Goods might be preserv'd for the kindred of the deceas'd, if they came to demand them. I return'd to <hi>Tauris</hi> a twelve-month after, and found the Chamber close seal'd up.</p>
                     <p>We staid twelve days at <hi>Tauris:</hi> during which time I resolv'd to attend the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Shamaqui,</hi> a frontler Town of <hi>Persia</hi> toward the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; but I found him not there, in regard it was Harvest season, at what time he goes to gather the King's and his own Duties.</p>
                     <p>Two days journey on this side <hi>Shamaqui</hi> you pass the <hi>Aras,</hi> and for two days journey you travel through a Country all planted with white Mulberry-Trees; the Inhabitants being all Silk-Weavers. Before you come to the City, you must cross over several Hills: But I think I should rather have call'd it a great Town, where there was nothing remarkable but a fair Castle which the <hi>Kan</hi> built himself; I speak of the time past: For as I return'd from this present Voyage of which I now write, when I came to <hi>Tauris</hi> I understood, that there had happen'd such a terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in the Town as had laid all the Houses in a heap; none escaping that dismal subversion, but only one Watch-maker of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and one more who was a Camel-driver. I had several times design'd to return into <hi>France</hi> through <hi>Muscovy;</hi> but I durst never adventure, being certainly inform'd that the <hi>Muscovite</hi> never permitted any person to go out of <hi>Muscovy</hi> into <hi>Persia,</hi> nor to come out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi> So that it was by particular connivence that that favour was granted to the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>'s Ambassadors. This last time I was resolv'd to have try'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I could have open'd a Passage from <hi>Persia</hi> through <hi>Muscovy</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> but the Ruine of <hi>Shamaqui</hi> deterr'd me.</p>
                     <p>We departed from <hi>Tauris</hi> the twenty-second of <hi>November,</hi> from whence to <hi>Cashan</hi> we met with nothing considerable, but only one of the <hi>Muscovite</hi> Ambassadors upon his return into his own Country, with a small Retinue of sixty, his Companion dying at <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon Sunday the fourteenth of <hi>December</hi> taking Horse by three of the Clock in the morning, the Ice bearing very well, we came to <hi>Ispahan</hi> about noon: but in regard it was slippery before day, and very plashy after the Sun was up, the Journey was both tedious and troublesom.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Road from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Tauris,</hi> through <hi>Diarbequir</hi> and <hi>Van.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere are two Roads more remaining to be describ'd; one through the North part of <hi>Turkie,</hi> the other through the South. The first through <hi>Diarbequir</hi> and <hi>Van,</hi> and so to <hi>Tauris;</hi> the second through <hi>Anna,</hi> and the small Desert leading to <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will describe the first of these Roads, and make a skip at the first leap to <hi>Bir,</hi> whither I have already led you in the Road from <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bir</hi> or <hi>Beri,</hi> you travel all along the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> to <hi>Cachemé.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Cachemé</hi> you come to <hi>Milesara,</hi> where you pay the Customs of <hi>Oursa,</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106224:69"/>
when you do not pass through the City, which amounts to four <hi>Piasters</hi> for every Horse-load.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Milesara</hi> you come to the River <hi>Arzlan-chaye,</hi> or, the <hi>Lion River,</hi> by reason of the rapidity of the Stream which falls into <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Arzlan-chaye</hi> you go to <hi>Seuerak.</hi> This is a City, water'd by a River, that also falls into <hi>Euphrates.</hi> It is environ'd with a great Plain to the North, the West, and South. The way which the Horses, Mules, and Camels keep is cut through the Rock like a Channel, two Foot deep, where you must also pay half a <hi>Piaster</hi> for every Horse-load.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Seuerak</hi> you come to <hi>Bogazi,</hi> where there are two Wells, but not a House near; and where the <hi>Caravan</hi> usually lodges.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bogazi</hi> you come to <hi>Deguirman-Bogazi,</hi> and from <hi>Deguirman-Bogazi</hi> to <hi>Mirzatapa,</hi> where there is only an Inn.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Mirzatapa</hi> you come to <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Car-emu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diarbequir</hi> is a City situated upon a rising ground, on the right side of <hi>Tigris,</hi> which in that place forms a Half-moon; the descent from the Walls to the River being very steep. It is encompass'd with a double Wall; the outward Wall being strengthned with sixty-two Towers, which they report were built in Honour of the sixty two Disciples of JESUS CHRIST. The City has but three Gates, over one of which there is an Inscription in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that makes mention of one <hi>Constantine.</hi> There are in it two or three fair <hi>Piazza's,</hi> and a magnificent <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which was formerly a Christian Church. It is surrounded with very decent Charnel-houses, near to which the <hi>Moullah's, Dervi's,</hi> Book-sellers and Stationers do live, together with all those other people that concern the Law. About a League from the City there is a Channel cut out of <hi>Tigris,</hi> that brings the Water to the City: And in this Water are all the red Marroquins wash'd that are made at <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> surpassing in colour'all others in the East: which Manufacture employs a fourth part of the Inhabitants of the City. The Soil is very good, and yields according to expectation; there is excellent Bread and very good Wine, nor is there any better Provision to be had in any part of <hi>Persia:</hi> more especially, there is a sort of Pigeons which in goodness excel all the several kinds that we have in <hi>Europe.</hi> The City is very well peopl'd, and it is thought there are in it above twenty thousand Christians. The two thirds are <hi>Armenians,</hi> the rest <hi>Nestorians,</hi> with some few <hi>Jacobites.</hi> There are also some few <hi>Capuchins,</hi> that have no House of their own, but are forc'd to lodg<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in an Inn.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Diarbequir</hi> is one of the <hi>Viziers</hi> of the Empire. He has but an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Infantry, which is not much requisite in that Country; the <hi>Curds</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> which infest that Country being all Horse-men. But he is strong in Cavalry, being able to bring above twenty thousand Horse into the Field. A quarter of an hours riding on this side <hi>Diarbequir</hi> there is a great Town with a large Inn, where the <hi>Caravans</hi> that go and come from <hi>Persia</hi> rather choose to lye than at <hi>Diarbequir;</hi> in regard that in the City-Inns, they pay three or four <hi>Piasters</hi> for every Chamber, but in the Country-Inns there is nothing demanded.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> you cross the <hi>Tigris,</hi> which is always fordable unless when the Snow and Rains have swell'd it; for then you must go a quarter of a League higher, and cross it over a great Stone-Bridge. Half a League on the other side of <hi>Tigris</hi> stands a Village, with an Inn, which is the Rendevous of the whole <hi>Caravan,</hi> and where they that first come have time enough to provide themselves for a Journey of nine or ten days, as far as <hi>Betlis.</hi> For though you may find Towns and Inns thick enough upon the Road, yet there is no good Bread to be met with.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Caravan</hi> proceeds, the first days journey is fourteen hours on Horse-back, and you come to lye at <hi>Shaye-batman,</hi> where you must pay a <hi>Piaster</hi> for every Horse-load.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Chaye-batman</hi> you come to <hi>Chikaran.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Chikaran</hi> to <hi>Azou,</hi> which you leave half a League from the great Road, where the Toll-gatherers take their Toll, which is four <hi>Piasters</hi> upon every Horse-load.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Azou</hi> you come to <hi>Ziarat;</hi> from <hi>Ziarat</hi> to <hi>Zerque,</hi> where you pay a Duty of two <hi>Piasters</hi> for every Horse-load.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Zerche</hi> to <hi>Cochakan.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106224:69"/>
From <hi>Cochakan</hi> to <hi>Carakan,</hi> a bad Inn; where you enter among the Mountains, that being full of Torrents reach as far as <hi>Betlis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Carakan</hi> to <hi>Betlis,</hi> a City belonging to a <hi>Bey</hi> or Prince of the Country, the most potent and most considerable of all the rest; for he neither acknowledges the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> nor the <hi>Persian:</hi> whereas all the other <hi>Beys</hi> are Tributary either to the one or the other. And it is the Interest of those two Potentates to correspond with him; for it's an easie thing for him to stop up the passage from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> or from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Aleppo;</hi> the Streights of the Mountains being so narrow, that ten Men may defend them against a thousand. Coming near <hi>Betlis</hi> you must travel a whole day among high steep Mountains, that reach two Miles beyond, with Torrents on each side; the way being cut out of the Rock on each side, where there is but just room for a Camel to pass. The City stands between two high Mountains, equally distant one from the other, and about the height of <hi>Montmartre.</hi> It is built like a Sugar-loaf, the ascent being so steep on every side, that there is no getting to the top, but by wheeling and winding about the Mountain. The top of all is a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, where stands a Castle well built, at the Gate whereof is a Draw-Bridge. Then you pass through two great Courts, and then into a third, opposite to the <hi>Bey's</hi> Apartment. It is very troublesom to get up to the top of the Castle, and a Man must be very well Hors'd that does it. There is no other person but the <hi>Bey</hi> and his Esquire, who is permitted to ride up on Horse-back. There is one Inn within the City, and another as it were without, in which the Merchants rather choose to lye than in the other, by reason that it is ready to be overflown when the Torrents swell, that run through every Street. The <hi>Bey,</hi> beside the strength of his Passes, is able to bring above five and twenty thousand Horse into the Field; and a very considerable Body of Foot, compos'd of the Shepherds of the Country, who are to be ready at a Call. I went to wait upon the <hi>Bey</hi> himself, and made him a Present of two pieces of Satin, the one streakt with Silver, and the other with Gold: two white Bonnets, such as the <hi>Turks</hi> wear, very fine, and adorn'd with Silver at the top; together with a sute of Handkerchiffs, streak'd with Red and Silver. While I staid with the <hi>Bey,</hi> who sent for Coffee for me according to the custom, a Courier came to him from the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to desire him that he would deliver up into his hands a <hi>French</hi> Chirurgeon that was his Slave, having been tak'n in <hi>Candia;</hi> complaining withal, that he had run away from him with the value of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns. The <hi>Bey,</hi> who understood what belong'd to a Sanctuary, and was resolv'd to protect the <hi>French-man,</hi> school'd the Messenger so severely, that he threaten'd to put him to death if he did not get him gone presently; charging him to tell his Master withal, that he would complain to the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> of his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and that if he were strangl'd, he might thank himself. And indeed it behov'd the Great <hi>Turk</hi> to keep fair correspondence with him; in regard that if the <hi>Persians</hi> should at any time besiege <hi>Van,</hi> the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> must march through the <hi>Bey's</hi> Country to relieve it; who has Forces enow to oppose him if he should be his Enemy.</p>
                     <p>But to travel through the Country of the <hi>Curds</hi> is very pleasant: for if on the one side the ways are bad, and difficult to be travel'd, in other places you have a prospect of several sorts of Trees, as Oaks and Walnuts, and not a Tree which is not embrac'd with a wild Vine. Below the Mountains, in the Level, grows the best Wheat; and Barley in all the Country.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Betlis,</hi> where you pay five <hi>Piasters</hi> for every Horse-load, to <hi>Taduan,</hi> where you pay two.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Taduan</hi> is a great Town within a Cannon-shot of the Lake of <hi>Van,</hi> in such a part, where Nature has made a Hav'n, shelter'd from all the Winds; being clos'd on all sides with high Mountains, the entry into which though it seem narrow, is very free. It is able to contain twenty or thirty great Barks; and when it is fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that the Wind serves, the Merchants generally Ship off their Goods from thence to <hi>Van:</hi> from whence it is but four and twenty hours sail, and a very good passage; whereas by Land from <hi>Taduan</hi> to <hi>Van</hi> it is eight days journey on Horse-back. Returning back, you may also take Water at <hi>Van</hi> for <hi>Taduan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Taduan</hi> to <hi>Karmoushé.</hi>

                     <p>From <hi>Kellat</hi> to <hi>Algiaoux,</hi> a small City, where you pay one <hi>Piaster</hi> for every Load.</p>

                     <p>From <hi>Souserat</hi> to <hi>Devan,</hi> where two <hi>Piasters</hi> are gather'd for every Horse-load, or else you must pay at <hi>Van.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Devan</hi> to <hi>Van,</hi> where there is a Duty of two <hi>Tomans</hi> and four <hi>Abassis</hi> to be paid for every Horse-load. For though <hi>Van</hi> be in the Territories of the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> yet the <hi>Persian</hi> Money is better lik'd than his own Coyn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Van</hi> is a great City upon the side of a wide Lake of the same name. There is a good Fortress belongs to it, that is seated upon the top of a high Mountain which stands by it self. There is but one sort of Fish in the Lake, a little bigger than a Pilchard, of which they take great store in the Month of <hi>April.</hi> For about a League from the Lake there is a great River that is call'd <hi>Bendmahi,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> empties it self into the Lake. Now in <hi>March</hi> when the Snow melts and swells the River, vast numbers of these Fish come down the River into the Lake; which the Fisher-men observing, so stop up the Mouth of the River that the Fish cannot go back; for else they would not stay above forty days; at which time they catch 'em up in wide-mouth'd Baskets at the Mouth of the River, thinking to return; it being lawful for any man to fish. The people drive a great Trade in these Fish, transporting them into <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Armenia;</hi> for, the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> both, drinking Wine at the end of their Feasts, they then bring this Dish to the Table for a relishing-bit. The people of <hi>Van</hi> tell a Story, how that there was a certain rich Merchant who farm'd the whole Fishery, paying a good sum of Money for it to the <hi>Basha;</hi> who thereupon strictly forbad any to fish but the Merchant; whereas before it was free for any man. But when the Fishing-season came, and that the Merchant thought to have caught his Fish, he met with nothing but Serpents. So that after that time the Fishery was never more farm'd. And there seems to be something in it; for the <hi>Basha's,</hi> who are a sort of people that will lose nothing they can get, would be certain to farm the Fish again and again, were there not some strange reason to hinder it. There are two principal Islands in the Lake of <hi>Van;</hi> the one call'd <hi>Adaketons,</hi> where there stand two Covents of the <hi>Armenians, Sourphague</hi> and <hi>Sourp-kara:</hi> the other Island is call'd <hi>Limadasi,</hi> and the name of the Covent is <hi>Limquiliasi,</hi> all which <hi>Armenian</hi> Monks live very austerely.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Van</hi> to <hi>Darcheck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Darcheck</hi> to <hi>Nuchar;</hi> it stands in the Territories of a <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Curdistan,</hi> being a paltry Village consisting of two or three little Houses. These <hi>Bey's</hi> are a kind of particular Lords, upon the Frontiers of both the Empires of <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> who care for neither: for they lye so secure among the Mountains, that there is no assaulting them by force. The <hi>Curds</hi> in general are a brutish sort of people; who though they stile themselves <hi>Mahometans,</hi> have very few <hi>Moullah's</hi> to instruct or teach them. They have a particular veneration for black Grey-hounds; so that if any person should be seen to kill one of them, he would be knock'd o'the Head immediately. Neither does any one dare to cut an Onion with a Knife in their presence; but it must be squeez'd between two Stones by him that intends to make use of it; so ridiculously superstitious they are.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bey</hi> to whom <hi>Nuchar</hi> belongs has his Toll-gatherers in that place, who exact sixteen <hi>Abassi's</hi> for every Horse-load, besides a Present which the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> is oblig'd to present him, which comes sometimes to seven or eight <hi>Tomans,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more: for otherwise the <hi>Bey</hi> would be sure to watch the <hi>Caravan</hi> at some scurvy place, and plunder it to some purpose. As once it happen'd to a <hi>Caravan,</hi> with which my Nephew went along in the year 1672; though he had the good luck to lose nothing more than one Camel laden with <hi>English</hi> Cloth, and another with his Provision. The <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Van</hi> and the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Tauris</hi> took the Field with an intention to remedy these disorders: especially the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Van,</hi> who perceiving that the Merchants would forsake that Road by reason of the Injuries they dayly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106224:70"/>
receiv'd, was resolv'd to make the <hi>Basha</hi> restore some part of his Goods which he had taken from the Merchants; and for the future to leave two of his Subjects in <hi>Tauris,</hi> and two in <hi>Van,</hi> that should be responsible for what mischief should be done to the <hi>Caravan.</hi> For otherwise the Merchants like this way best, as being the nearest from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and where they pay less Duties.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Nuchar</hi> to <hi>Kuticlar,</hi> is a long Journey through the Mountains, by the side of several Torrents, which are to be cross'd in several places. This bad way brings Fifty i'the Hundred profit to the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Nuchar;</hi> for were the <hi>Caravan</hi> to travel through Plains, or a level Country, one Horse or Camel would carry as much as two or three, and the Merchant would pay Custom for no more. Here therefore the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> and the Merchants must understand one another, and agree as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly as they can togethor.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kuticlar</hi> to <hi>Kalvat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kalvat</hi> to <hi>Kogia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kogia</hi> to <hi>Darkavin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Darkavin</hi> to <hi>Soliman-Sera:</hi> all which four places are very convenient Inns.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Soliman-Sera</hi> to <hi>Kours:</hi> in that City resides a <hi>Bey,</hi> who is tributary to the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> He lives in an ancient Castle about half a League off, where the <hi>Caravan</hi> pays nine <hi>Abassi's</hi> for every Horse-load, besides a Present. But that Present consists only in Sugar-loaves, Boxes of Treacle, or Marmaled; for he stands so much upon his Honour, that he scorns to take Money. The Wine of <hi>Kours</hi> is sweet and tart.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kours</hi> to <hi>Devogli.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Devogli</hi> to <hi>Checheme.</hi> About half way between these two places you cross a Plain, which upon the South extends it self a League to the Mountains, but upon the North side enlarges it self out of sight. Upon the High-way, on the left hand stands a Rock three hundred Paces in compass, and about fourscore Foot high; round about it were to be seen several Dens, which most certainly had been the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of those that fed their Cattel thereabouts. Under the Rock, which is hollow, appears a Fountain of clear cold Water, wherein there was great store of Fish; thousands of which would come up to the top of the Water, when a man threw any Bread into it. The Fish had a great Head, and a large Mustache. I shot a Carbine into the River charg'd with Hail-shot, upon which they all disappear'd, but presently five or six return'd wounded to the top of the Water, which we easily took. The <hi>Armenians</hi> laught at me for shooting, believing it had been impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to catch them in that manner; but they admir'd when they beheld them again turning up their bellies at the top of the Water. The <hi>Turks</hi> and some of the <hi>Armenians</hi> would not eat of them, believing them to be defil'd: but the <hi>Armenians</hi> that had been in <hi>Europe</hi> laugh'd at their Superstition, and fell to, when they were drest.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Checheme</hi> to <hi>Davashiler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Davashiler</hi> to <hi>Marand;</hi> a City where you must pay sixteen <hi>Abassi's</hi> for a Camel's-load, and eight for a Horses.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Merand</hi> to <hi>Sefian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sefian</hi> to <hi>Tauris.</hi> These are the two biggest days journies throughout the Road.</p>
                     <p>Returning out of <hi>Persia</hi> this way, we could not get Bread for Money; so that we were forc'd to give the Women some Trifles which they lov'd better. Though the People are <hi>Mahometans,</hi> yet they will not spare to drink lustily.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Another Road from</hi> Aleppo <hi>to</hi> Tauris, <hi>through</hi> Geziré <hi>and other places.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>FRom <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Bir</hi> or <hi>Beri,</hi> where you must cross <hi>Euphrates,</hi> days 4</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bir</hi> to <hi>Ourfa,</hi> days 2</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ourfa</hi> to <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> days 6</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Diarbequir</hi> to <hi>Geziré,</hi> days 4</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geziré</hi> is a little City of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> built upon an Island in the River <hi>Tigris;</hi> which is there to be cross'd over a fair Bridge of Boats. Here the Merchants meet to buy Gall-nuts and Tobacco. The City is under the Jurisdiction of a <hi>Bey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having past the <hi>Tigris,</hi> all the Country between that and <hi>Tauris</hi> is almost equally divided between Hills and Plains; the Hills are cover'd with Oaks that bear Galls, and some Acoms withal. The Plains are planted with Tobacco, which is transported into <hi>Turkie,</hi> for which they have a very great Trade. One would think the Country were poor, seeing nothing but Galls and Tobacco; but there is no Country in the World where there is more Gold or Silver laid out; and where they are more nice in taking Money that is in the least defective either in weight or goodness of Metal. For Galls being a general Commodity for Dying, and no where to be found so good as there, bring a vast Trade to the Country; wherein there are no Villages, yet it is over-spread with Houses a Musquet-shot one from another; and every Inhabitant has his quarter of his Vineyard by himself, where they dry their Grapes: for they make no Wine.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Geziré</hi> to <hi>Amadié,</hi> days 2</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amadié</hi> is a good City, to which the Natives of a great part of <hi>Assyria</hi> bring their Tobacco, and Gall-nuts. It is seated upon a high Mountain, to the top whereof you cannot get in less than an hour. Toward the middle of the Rock three or four large Springs fall down from the Cliffs, where the Inhabitants are forc'd to water their Cattel and fill their <hi>Borachio's</hi> every morning, there being no Water in the City. It is of an indifferent bigness, and in the middle is a large <hi>Piazza,</hi> where all sorts of Merchants keep their Shops. It is under the Command of a <hi>Bey</hi> that is able to raise eight or ten thousand Horse, and more Foot than any other of the <hi>Beys,</hi> by reason his Country is so populous.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Amadié</hi> to <hi>Giousmark,</hi> days 4</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Giousmark</hi> to <hi>Alback,</hi> days 3</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Alback</hi> to <hi>Salmastre,</hi> days 3</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salmastre</hi> is a pleasant City upon the Frontiers of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> and the first on that side in the Territories of the <hi>Persian</hi> King. The <hi>Caravan</hi> never lyes there, because it would be above a League out of the way: but when the <hi>Caravan</hi> is lodg'd, two or three of the principal Merchants with the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> according to custom go to wait upon the <hi>Kan.</hi> The <hi>Kan</hi> is so glad that the <hi>Caravan</hi> takes that Road, that he presents the <hi>Caravan-Bashi</hi> and those that go with him, with the Garment of Honour, or the Calaat, the Bonnet, and Girdle; which is the greatest Honour that the King or his Governour can do to Strangers.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Salamastre</hi> to <hi>Tauris,</hi> days 4</p>
                     <p>In all thirty-two days journey this way from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Tauris.</hi> But though this be the shortest cut, and where they pay least Customs, yet the Merchants dare hardly venture for fear of being ill us'd by the <hi>Beys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teren,</hi> whose Capital City the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Cherijar,</hi> is a Province between <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandran</hi> and the ancient Region of the <hi>Persians</hi> known at this day by the name of <hi>Hierac,</hi> to the South-East of <hi>Ispahan.</hi> 'Tis one of the most temperate Countries, that has nothing in it of the contagious Air of <hi>Guilan,</hi> where the King goes for the purity of the Air, and for his sport of Hunting; besides, that it produceth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruits in many places. The Capital City whereof, which some call by the name of the <hi>Province,</hi> is of a moderate compass, but there is nothing worthy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in it: only a League from it are to be seen the Ruines of a great City, which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106224:71"/>
had been two Leagues in Circuit. There were abundance of Towers all of burnt Brick, and Pieces of the Wall standing. There were also several Letters in the Stones which were cemented into the Walls; but neither <hi>Turks, Persians,</hi> nor <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> could understand them. The City is round seated upon a high Hill, at the top whereof stood the Ruines of a Castle, which the Natives say was the Residence of the Kings of <hi>Persia.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Road from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Ispahan</hi> through the small Desert, and through <hi>Kengavar.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Will describe this Road as if I were to return from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Aleppo.</hi> This Road lies through <hi>Kengavar, Bagdat,</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> where you enter into the Desert, which I call <hi>The little Desert,</hi> because you get over it in far less time than the great Desert that extends Southwards to <hi>Arabia the Happy,</hi> and where you may often find Water, all the whole Journey being not far distant from the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> A man that is well mounted may ride this way from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Aleppo</hi> in three and thirty days, as I have done, and perhaps in less, if the <hi>Arabian,</hi> whom you take for your guide at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> knows the shortest cut through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>The Horse <hi>Caravans</hi> travelling from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Kengavar</hi> are fourteen or fifteen days upon the Road; but being well mounted ten or twelve in a Company, you may Ride it in five or six days. The Country through which you travel, is very fertile in Corn and Rice, it produces also excellent Fruits and good Wine, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about <hi>Kengavar,</hi> which is a large Town and well peopl'd.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kengavar</hi> to <hi>Bagdat</hi> I was ten days upon the Road. The Country is not so fertile but very stony in some parts. And it consists in Plains and small Hills, there being not a Mountain in all the Road.</p>
                     <p>Now for a man that travels quick, the Road lies thus:</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Consar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Consar</hi> to <hi>Comba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Comba</hi> to <hi>Oranguié.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Oranguié</hi> to <hi>Nahoüand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Nahoüand</hi> to <hi>Kengavar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fron <hi>Kengavar</hi> to <hi>Sahana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sahana</hi> to <hi>Polisha,</hi> or the Bridge-Royal, being a great Stone Bridge.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Polisha</hi> to <hi>Maidacht.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Maidacht</hi> to <hi>Erounabad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Erounabad</hi> to <hi>Conaguy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Conaguy</hi> to <hi>Caslisciren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Caslisciren</hi> to <hi>Iengui-Conaguy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Iengui-Conaguy</hi> to <hi>Casered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Casered</hi> to <hi>Charaban.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Charaban</hi> to <hi>Bourous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bourous</hi> to <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are some, who instead of passing through <hi>Kengavar,</hi> take <hi>Amadan,</hi> one of the most considerable Cities of <hi>Persia</hi> in their way, and so from thence to <hi>Toucheré;</hi> but the way is longer; and according to the Road which I have set down, you are to leave <hi>Amadan</hi> to the North upon the right hand.</p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Sahana</hi> and <hi>Polisha</hi> you leave the only high Mountain in all the Road to the North. It is as steep and as straight as a Wall, and as high as you can see; you may observe the Figures of men clad like Priests, with Surplices and Censors in their hands, and yet neither can the Natives tell you, nor any person imagin the meaning of those Sculptures. At the foot of the Rock runs a River, over which there is a Bridge of Stone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:106224:72"/>
About a days journey beyond the Mountain you meet with a little City, whose situation, the Streams that water it, the good Fruits that grow there, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the excellent Wine which it affords, render a most pleasant Mansion. The <hi>Persians</hi> believe that <hi>Alexander</hi> when he return'd from <hi>Babylon</hi> dy'd in this place, what-ever others have writt'n that he dy'd at <hi>Babylon.</hi> All the rest of the Country from this City to <hi>Bagdat</hi> is a Country of Dates, where the people live in little Hutts, made of the Branches of Palm-trees.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Anna</hi> you ride in four days, through a desert Country, though it lye between two Rivers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anna</hi> is a City of an indifferent bigness, that belongs to an <hi>Arabian Emir.</hi> For about half a League round about the Town, the Lands are very well manur'd, being full of Gardens and Country-houses. The City for its situation resembles <hi>Paris;</hi> for it is built upon both sides of the River <hi>Euphrates;</hi> and in the midst of the River is an Island, where stands a fair <hi>Mosquee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Anna</hi> to <hi>Mached-raba</hi> is five days riding, and from <hi>Mached-raba</hi> to <hi>Taïba,</hi> five days more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mached-raba</hi> is a kind of a Fortress upon the point of a Hill, at the Foot whereof springs a Fountain like a large Vase, which is very rare in the Deserts. The place is encompass'd with high Walls, defended by certain Towers, and in which are little Hutts where the Inhabitants keep their Cattel, of which there is great store, but more Mares and Horses than Cows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Taïba</hi> is also a fortifi'd place in a level Country, or a high Bank of Earth and Brick bak'd in the Sun. Near to the Gate a Fountain springs out of the Earth, and makes a kind of a Pond. This Road is most frequented by those that travel through the Desert from <hi>Aleppo</hi> or <hi>Damas</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> or from <hi>Damas</hi> to <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> by reason of this Fountain.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Taïba</hi> to <hi>Aleppo</hi> is but three days journey; but these three days are the most dangerous of all the Road for Robbers, in regard that all the Country is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited only by the <hi>Bedouïns,</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Shepherds, who make it their business only to plunder and steal.</p>
                     <p>Now to take the same Road from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> it lyes thus:</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Taïba,</hi> days 3</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Taïba</hi> to <hi>Mached-raba,</hi> days 5</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Mached-raba</hi> to <hi>Anna,</hi> days 5</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Anna</hi> to <hi>Bagdat,</hi> days 4</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Bourous,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bourous</hi> to <hi>Charaban,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Charaban</hi> to <hi>Casered,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Casered</hi> to <hi>Conaguy,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Conaguy</hi> to <hi>Cassiscerin,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Cassiscerin</hi> to another <hi>Conaguy,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Conaguy</hi> to <hi>Erounabad,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Erounabad</hi> to <hi>Maidacht,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Maidacht</hi> to <hi>Sahana,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sahana</hi> to <hi>Kengavar,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kengavar</hi> to <hi>Nahoüand,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Nahoüand</hi> to <hi>Oranguie,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Oranguie</hi> to <hi>Comba,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Comba</hi> to <hi>Consar,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Consar</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>So that whether you travel from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> or from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> you may easily ride it in thirty days.</p>
                     <p>From whence I make this Observation, That a man making it but two days more from <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> and finding a Ship ready there to set Sail for <hi>Marseilles,</hi> with a fair Wind he may travel from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> in two months.</p>
                     <p>Another time, having an occasion to go from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Kengavar,</hi> and so to <hi>Bagdat;</hi> and from thence, so through the Desert; at <hi>Bagdat</hi> I met with a <hi>Spaniard</hi> that was travelling the same way, with whom I luckily met to bear half the Charges of the Guide; which as soon as we had hir'd for sixty Crowns, we set forward from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106224:72"/>
                        <hi>Bagdat;</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and I, and our <hi>Arabian,</hi> who was afoot, walk'd about Pistol Shot before our Horses. From thence to <hi>Anna</hi> we met with nothing remarkable, but only that we saw a Lyon and a Lyoness in the Act of Generation: Whereupon our Guide believing we had been afraid, told us, that he had met them oft'n, but that he never found them do any harm.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> according to the humour of his Nation, was very reserv'd, and contenting himself with an Onion, or some such small matter at meals, never made much of his guide; whereas I was mightily in his favour, in regard there was never a day pass'd wherein he did not receive of me some good business or other. We were not above a Musquet Shot from <hi>Anna</hi> when we met with a comely old man, who came up to me, and taking my Horse by the Bridle; Friend, said he, come and wash thy feet and eat Bread at my House. Thou art a Stranger, and since I have met thee upon the Road, never refuse me the favour which I desire of thee. The Invitation of the old man was so like the custom of the people in ancient times, of which we read so many Examples in Scripture, that we could not choose but go along with him to his House, where he Feasted us in the best manner he could, giving us over and above Barly for our Horses; and for us he kill'd a Lamb and some Hens. He was an Inhabitant of <hi>Anna,</hi> and liv'd by the River, which we were oblig'd to cross to wait upon the Governour for our Passports, for which we paid two Piasters apiece. We staid at a House near the Gate of the City to buy Provisions for our selves and our Horses; where the woman of the House having a lovely sprightly Child of nine years of age, I was so taken with her humour, that I gave her two Handkerchiefs of Painted Calicut, which the Child shewing her Mother, all we could do could not make her take any Money for the Provisions we had agreed for.</p>
                     <p>Five hundred paces from the Gate of the City, we met a young man of a good Family, for he was attended by two Servants, and rode upon an Ass, the hinder part of which was Painted red. He accosted me in particular, and after some Compliments that pass'd, <hi>Is it possible,</hi> said he, <hi>that I should meet a Stranger, and have nothing to present him withall?</hi> He would fain have carry'd us to a House in the Country whether he was going; but seeing we were resolv'd to keep our way, he would needs give me his Pipe, notwithstanding all the excuses I could make, and though I told him that I never took any Tobacco; so that I was constrain'd to accept of it.</p>
                     <p>About three Leagues from <hi>Anna,</hi> we were going to eat among the Ruines of certain Houses, and had thought to have lain there 'till midnight, when we perciv'd two <hi>Arabians</hi> sent by the <hi>Emir,</hi> to tell us that he had some Letters which he would put into our own hands to the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to which purpose he had order to bring us back. There was no refusing, so that at our coming into the City the next day we saw the <hi>Emir</hi> going to the <hi>Mosquée,</hi> mounted upon a stately Horse, and attended by a great number of people afoot, with every one a great Poniard stuck in their Girdles. As soon as we saw him we alighted, and standing up by the Houses, we saluted him as he pass'd by. Seeing our Guide, and threatning to rip up his Belly; <hi>Ye Dog,</hi> said he, <hi>I will give ye your reward, and teach ye to carry Strangers away before I see them.</hi> Carry them, said he, to the Governours House 'till I return from the <hi>Mosquée.</hi> Returning from the <hi>Mosquée,</hi> and being seated in a spacious Hall, he sent for us and our Guide, whom he threatn'd again for carrying us out of the Town without giving him notice. But the Governour pleaded his excuse, and appeas'd the <hi>Emir.</hi> After that he sent for Coffee for us, and then caus'd us to open the Budget that we carry'd behind our Horses, to see whether there were any thing that pleas'd him or no. In my Budget were two pieces of Calicut exquisitely painted, for two Coverlets of a Bed; two pieces of Handkerchief of Calicut; two <hi>Persian</hi> Standishes beautify'd with <hi>Japon</hi> Varnish; two Damascene Blades, one inlaid with Gold, the other with Silver. All which he lik'd, and made me give him. In the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Budget he found nothing but a few old Clothes: But afterwards being known to have had some Diamonds about him, the <hi>French Consul</hi> at <hi>Aleppo</hi> sentenc'd him to pay me half the charges of what I gave the <hi>Emir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prince satisfi'd with what he had tak'n, gave order that we should be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with all necessary Provisions for our selves and our Horses: but being provided
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106224:73"/>
before, we only took three or four handfuls of excellent Dates, to shew that we did not slight his kindness.</p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Mached-raba</hi> is the Guide to take special care so to order his Stages, as to come every morning to the Wells by break of day, for fear of meeting the <hi>Arabs,</hi> that come to fetch Water there by that time the Sun is up, who are apt enough to be injurious to Travellers.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Mached-raba</hi> I saw one of the most beautiful Virgins that ever I beheld in my life. For I had given a <hi>Piaster</hi> to an <hi>Arab</hi> to get me some Bread, and going to see whether it were bak'd, I found the Virgin putting it into the Oven, who being alone, made me a sign to retire. There I also saw a Colt of that wonderful shape, that the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Damas</hi> had offer'd three thousand Crowns for it.</p>
                     <p>Coming to <hi>Taïba,</hi> we did not go into the Town, but lay without under the Walls. Only our <hi>Arab</hi> went in and brought us chopt Straw for our Camels. The Governour of the Town came along with him, and demauded twenty <hi>Piasters</hi> of every one, for certain Duties which he pretended payable to him. We knew there were but four due, and refus'd to pay any more; but the <hi>Arab</hi> having a mind to put a trick upon the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> gave me a wink, intimating to me that I should not trouble my self: Thereupon the Governour incens'd goes back to the Town, and by and by returns with an Iron Chain; and had certainly carry'd the <hi>Spaniard</hi> fetter'd to the Fort, had he not laid down the twenty <hi>Piasters.</hi> For my part, I was discharg'd for my four <hi>Piasters,</hi> according to custom.</p>
                     <p>Drawing near to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the first Houses that we came at bordering upon the Desert, were the Houses of the <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Bedoüins;</hi> the second of which being the Habitation of a Friend of our Guide's, I deliver'd my Horse to the Guide, to whom I had sold it before at his own earnest request; for I was resolv'd to go a-foot to <hi>Aleppo:</hi> and therefore that I might save the Custom of a parcel of Turquoises that I had about me, I put them in the Pouches which I carry'd behind my Horse, and threw the Pouches into a little Chest, as if they had been things of no consequence; and desir'd the Man of the House to keep them a day or two. The <hi>Arab</hi> told me, that were it all Gold it should be safe; and indeed when I sent for them within a day or two after, I found nothing missing.</p>
                     <p>When I came to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Consul ask'd me what news from <hi>Ispahan:</hi> I made answer, that he must of necessity know better than I, in regard the <hi>English</hi> President there had sent away an Express to him while I was there; and that he went away with two <hi>Capuchins</hi> and an <hi>Arabian</hi> Guide. Thereupon the Consul mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting some mischief was befal'n them, requested the <hi>Basha</hi> to lend him some of his Sokliers; who readily granted him eight Men, part <hi>Arabians,</hi> part <hi>Bedoüins.</hi> These the Consul order'd to disperse themselves upon several Roads in the Wilderness, to see if they could meet with any tidings upon the Way. In a short time two of them return'd with two little Pouches, in one of which was the Packet of Letters. They reported also, that in a by-place between <hi>Taïba</hi> and <hi>Mached-raba</hi> they saw the Bodies of four dead Men lying upon the Sand. One of them which was in black Clothes, being hack'd and mangled in a most miserable manner; but the Bodies of the other three were entire, though run through in several places. Some time after the persons themselves that did the fact told both at <hi>Diarbequir</hi> and <hi>Damas,</hi> how it came to pass. For certain Merchants of <hi>Damas</hi> going to <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> perceiv'd four Men early in the morning at certain Wells where they were to stop; whereupon they sent two of their Company before to know who they were. But the <hi>Austin-</hi>Frier having a little parcel of Diamonds about him, and believing them to be Thieves, inconsiderately let fly his Gun and kill'd one of them immediately upon the place: the Merchants seeing one of their companions dead, fell all at once upon the other three, cut the <hi>Austin-</hi>Frier to pieces, and slew the rest; and so without rifling them pursu'd their Journey.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Aleppo</hi> I went to <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> and there embarqu'd in a Vessel of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seilles,</hi> with a favourable Wind, 'till we came to make the Coast of <hi>Candy,</hi> where we were becalm'd for two days. One morning by break of day we discover'd a Pickaroon, whereupon seeing we could not avoid being fetch'd up by him, we made ready. He made two or three shot at us, which did us no other harm but only touch'd the Beak-head of the Ship. Our Gunner made a shot at him, which brought down his Top-gallant; a second went through and through the great Cabin,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106224:73"/>
and caus'd a great disorder in his Ship, as far as we could discern with our Prospective-Glasses. But when the Wind began to blow fresh, the Pirate, who had enough of us, and had discover'd another Vessel which perhaps he thought better prize, made all the Sail he could from us toward the other Vessel. Thereupon we pursu'd our Voyage with a fair Gale, and came to <hi>Malta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Malta</hi> we departed seven or eight in company, in two of the Pope's Gallies, staying three days at <hi>Syracuse,</hi> and one at <hi>Messina;</hi> where our Company increasing, we hir'd a Feluck for <hi>Naples.</hi> But as we were coasting by the Shoar to the Port of <hi>Naples,</hi> so terrible a Tempest surpriz'd us near to <hi>Paolo,</hi> that we were forc'd to put in there upon <hi>Palm-Sunday.</hi> The next day we went to see the Covent of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paolo;</hi> the way to it lying between a high Mountain on the right, and a Precipice on the left hand. This Mountain leans so, that it seems to be tumbling down; and there is a good height upon the Rock the seeming print of a Hand, which as the report goes, was the print of St. <hi>Francis's</hi> Hand, who sustain'd it a whole day, and kept it from falling. From <hi>Paolo</hi> we went to <hi>Naples,</hi> were we arriv'd upon <hi>Easter-eve;</hi> and as we enter'd into the City, the great Guns went off round the City, in honour of the Resurrection. At <hi>Rome</hi> we all separated, according as our Business led us.</p>

                     <p>THere are three Roads yet remaining, leading out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Persia</hi> or the <hi>Indies.</hi> That of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all along the Coasts of the Black Sea; that of <hi>Warsovia,</hi> crossing the same Sea at <hi>Trebisond;</hi> and that of <hi>Mosco,</hi> down the <hi>Volga,</hi> which has been amply describ'd by <hi>Olearius,</hi> Secretary to the Embassy of the Duke of <hi>Holstein.</hi> In this and the next Chapter I shall describe the Way from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all along the Black Sea, and that from <hi>Warsovia;</hi> not knowing any person that has hitherto mention'd any thing upon this subject. And first of all I will give a short Description of the principal Places that lye upon that Sea, as well upon the side of <hi>Europe</hi> as of <hi>Asia,</hi> with the just distances of one Place from another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The principal Cities upon the Black Sea, on the Coast of</hi> Europe.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Varna</hi> they count it two hundred Miles, four of which make an <hi>Alman</hi> League; miles 200</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Varna</hi> to <hi>Balshinké,</hi> miles 36</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Belshinké</hi> to <hi>Bengali,</hi> miles 70</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bengali</hi> to <hi>Constance,</hi> miles 60</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Constance</hi> to <hi>Queli,</hi> miles 25</p>
                     <p>Near to this City of <hi>Queli</hi> the great Arm of <hi>Danow</hi> throws it self into the Black Sea. Here is the grand Fishery for Sturgeon.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Queli</hi> to <hi>Aquerman,</hi> miles 50</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Aquerman</hi> belongs to a <hi>Kan</hi> of the lesser <hi>Tartary;</hi> but it is not the place of his residence, for he keeps his Court at <hi>Basha-Serrail,</hi> twenty-five miles up in the Land.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Aquerman</hi> to <hi>Kefet</hi> or <hi>Kaffa,</hi> miles 350</p>
                     <p>This is a great City, and a place of great Trade, wherein there are above a thousand Families of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and about five hundred <hi>Greeks.</hi> They have every one their Bishop, and several Churches. St. <hi>Peter's</hi> is the biggest, very large and very beautiful; but it falls to decay, because the Christians have not Wealth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106224:74"/>
enough to repair it. Every Christian aboue fifteen years of age, pays a <hi>Piaster</hi> and a half tribute to the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> who is Lord of the City; and he sends a <hi>Bashae</hi> that lives in the ancient City call'd <hi>Frink-Hessar.</hi> However the <hi>Kan</hi> of the Lesser <hi>Tartary</hi> extends his Jurisdiction as far as the Gates of <hi>Kaffa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kaffa</hi> to <hi>Assaque,</hi> miles 70</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Assaque</hi> is the last City in <hi>Europe,</hi> belonging also to the Grand <hi>Signor.</hi> By it runs a great River of the same name, the other side being in the Territories of the Duke of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> Down this River come the <hi>Cossacks</hi> that do so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the <hi>Turks.</hi> For sometimes they come with threescore or fourscore <hi>Gelia's</hi> which are a kind of <hi>Brigantines,</hi> the bigger sort of which carry a hundred and fifty men, the less a hundred. Sometimes they divide themselves into two parts, one of which makes Havock toward <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the other Ravages the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> as far as <hi>Trebizond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Coast of <hi>Europe</hi> bord'ring upon the Black Sea is 861 miles in length.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The chief Cities upon the Black Sea on the Coast of</hi> Asia, <hi>which is</hi> 1170 <hi>miles in length.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Neapoli,</hi> miles 250</p>
                     <p>In this City are made the greatest part of the Galleys and Vessels that belong to the Grand <hi>Signor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Neapoli</hi> to <hi>Sinabe,</hi> miles 250</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sinabe</hi> to <hi>Ouma,</hi> miles 240</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ouma</hi> to <hi>Kerason,</hi> miles 150</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Kerason</hi> to <hi>Trebisond,</hi> miles 80</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Trebisond</hi> to <hi>Rise,</hi> miles 100</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Rise</hi> to <hi>Guni,</hi> miles 100</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Guni</hi> belongs half to the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> and half to the King of <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> with whom he keeps a good Correspondence, because the greatest part of the Steel and Iron that is spent in <hi>Turkie</hi> comes out of <hi>Mengrelia</hi> through the Black Sea.</p>
                     <p>The only good Ports upon the Black Sea from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> are,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quitros, Sinabe,</hi> or <hi>Sinope, Onnye, Samsom, Trebisond, Gommé.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Haven of <hi>Quitros</hi> is very deep, and the Vessels lie shelter'd from the winds, but the entrance into it is very bad, which only the Pilots of the place, or they who have often accustom'd themselves to that Trade can only find out. It seems that anciently there had been most stately Buildings round about the Port; and several noble Pillars are to be seen all along the shore, not to speak of those which have been Transported to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Near the City toward the South stands a high Mountain, whence there flows good store of excellent Water, which at the bottom gathers into one Fountain.</p>
                     <p>To go from <hi>Constantinople</hi> for <hi>Persia</hi> by Sea, you must embark at <hi>Constantinople</hi> for <hi>Trebisond,</hi> and many times for <hi>Rise</hi> or <hi>Guni,</hi> which are more to the North. They that Land at <hi>Trebisond</hi> go directly to <hi>Erzerom,</hi> which is not above five days Journey off, and from <hi>Erzerom</hi> to <hi>Erivan</hi> or <hi>Tunis.</hi> But there are few that will venture upon this Sea where there is no good Anchorage; besides that it is subject to prodigious Tempests, from which there are very few good Ports to defend them; which is the reason it is call'd <hi>Cara-denguis,</hi> or the Black Sea: The Eastern people giving to all things, mischievous and dangerous, the Epithet of Black.</p>
                     <p>They that are Bound for <hi>Rise</hi> or <hi>Guni,</hi> go to <hi>Testis</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Giorgia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Erivan,</hi> for though the way be bad, yet it is far better and smoother than the Road to <hi>Tauris.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Road from <hi>Warsow</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> over the Black Sea, and from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Mosco;</hi> with the Names of the principal Cities and Islands of <hi>Turky</hi> according to the vulgar pronunciation, and as they are call'd in the Language of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>FRom <hi>Warsow</hi> upon the left hand of the <hi>Vistula,</hi> the ordinary residence of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> to <hi>Lublin,</hi> days 6</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Lublin</hi> to <hi>Iluove,</hi> days 5</p>
                     <p>There all the Bales are open'd, and the Customers take Five in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for their Merchandize.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Iluove</hi> to <hi>Jaslovieer,</hi> days 12</p>
                     <p>This is the last City of <hi>Poland</hi> toward <hi>Moldavia,</hi> where if you sell any quantity of Goods, you must pay Five <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Jaslovieer</hi> to <hi>Yashé,</hi> days 8</p>
                     <p>This is the Capital City of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and is the Residence of the <hi>Vaywood</hi> which the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> sends to govern in the Country. There they open all the Bales, and there is a Roll of what every Merchant ought to pay, which may amounts to Five <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Yashé</hi> to <hi>Ourshaye,</hi> days 3</p>
                     <p>This is the last City of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> where there is no Custom to be paid.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ourshaye</hi> to <hi>Akerman,</hi> days 4</p>
                     <p>Here they never open the Bales, but they take Four in the Hundred.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Akerman</hi> to <hi>Ozou,</hi> days 3</p>
                     <p>Here they never open the Bales, but the Custom amounts to Two <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ozou</hi> to <hi>Precop,</hi> days 5</p>
                     <p>Neither do they here open the Bales, but trust to the Merchant's word, and the Customs amount to Two and a half <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Precop</hi> to <hi>Kaffa,</hi> days 5</p>
                     <p>Nor are the Bales open'd here, but the Custom comes to Three <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus from <hi>Warsow</hi> to <hi>Kaffa</hi> the Journey takes up one and fifty days, in the Wagon, which is the manner of Carriage in those Countries. All the Customs amount to Eighteen and a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> to which you must add the Carriage, and Passage by Sea to <hi>Trebizond;</hi> where you pay three <hi>Piasters</hi> for every Mules-load, and four for every Camels-load.</p>
                     <p>Observe by the way, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> do not usually take shipping at <hi>Trebizónd,</hi> but go to another Port more to the West, upon the same Coast, where they never pay above a <hi>Piaster</hi> and a half for a Camels-load. This Port, call'd <hi>Onnie,</hi> is a very good Haven; and there is another a little farther off, call'd <hi>Samson,</hi> which is no bad one, but the Air is unwholsom and dang'rous.</p>
                     <p>There is also another Road from <hi>Warsow</hi> to <hi>Trebizond,</hi> shorter by three days journey.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Warsow</hi> to <hi>Yashé,</hi> according to the Road already set down, days 31</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Yashé</hi> to <hi>Galas,</hi> days 8</p>
                     <p>All Merchandize is Tax'd at this place, and the Duties are tak'n at <hi>Galas,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Note which the Merchant brings from <hi>Galas. Galas</hi> is a City of <hi>Moldavia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106224:75"/>
From <hi>Galas</hi> to <hi>Megin,</hi> days 1</p>
                     <p>The Bales are not open'd here, but the Merchant pays three and a half, or four <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Megin</hi> to <hi>Mangalia,</hi> days 8</p>
                     <p>This is one of the four Ports to the West upon the Black Sea, and the best of all.</p>
                     <p>The three others toward the South upon the Coast are <hi>Kavarna, Balgik,</hi> and <hi>Varna.</hi> At <hi>Mangalia</hi> they demand but half a <hi>Piaster</hi> for every Bale. Crossing from thence to <hi>Trebisond</hi> you have five days Journey to <hi>Erzerom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to the Road of <hi>Muscovy;</hi> which having been exactly describ'd by <hi>Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> going into <hi>Persia,</hi> I will describe it returning out of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having led the Reader to <hi>Shamaqui,</hi> I will return home from thence.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Shamaqui</hi> to <hi>Derbent,</hi> days 7</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Derbent,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Demir-Capi,</hi> is the last City within the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Persians;</hi> by which there runs a River which is call'd <hi>Shamourka.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Derbent</hi> to <hi>Tetarck,</hi> days 8</p>
                     <p>By this Town runs a River which is call'd <hi>Bocan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Tetark</hi> to <hi>Astracan</hi> they hire small Barks with a dozen Oars. All along the shoar the Osiers grow so very thick, that they afford shelter for the Barks in fowl weather. If the Wind serve they will put up a little Sail and be at <hi>Astracan</hi> in four or five hours; but if they only Row, they cannot be there in nine.</p>
                     <p>When you Embark upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, where you only creep along by the shore, you must provide your self with Water for the three first days, in regard the Water is bitter and ill tasted all along the Coast all that while; but for the rest of the Voyage it is very good. If you carry heavy Goods, you may hire large Boats to save charges.</p>
                     <p>When you come to <hi>Astracan</hi> you unlade your Goods; at what time the Officer comes, and sealing up every Bale, causes them to be sent to the Merchants lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Three days after the Customer comes to op'n the Bales, and takes five <hi>per Cent.</hi> If the Merchant hap'n to want money, and takes it up at <hi>Astracan</hi> to pay again at <hi>Moscow,</hi> he pays sometimes thirty <hi>per Cent,</hi> according to the rate of Gold <hi>Ducats.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Merchant have any Diamonds or any other Jewels, and let it be known, he pays five <hi>per Cent.</hi> But if a Merchant have any Jewels or any other rarities, and tells the Governour that he intends to carry them to the Grand Duke; the Governour sends a Convoy with him either by Land or Water, that costs him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and moreover sends a Courrier before to the Court to give notice of his coming. There is very good Wine at <hi>Astracan,</hi> but better at <hi>Shamaqui,</hi> where I advise the Traveller to provide himself.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Astracan</hi> to <hi>Moscow</hi> you take Shipping in great Barques that make use both of Oars and Sails rowing against the Tide, and weigh what ever you put aboard, to a very Coverlet. Generally you pay for every pound fourteen <hi>Caya,</hi> or three <hi>Abassi's</hi> and a half, and an <hi>Abassi</hi> makes eighteen <hi>Sous</hi> and three <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Muscovy</hi> they reck'n the way neither by leagues nor miles, but by <hi>Shage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> five of which make an <hi>Italian</hi> mile.</p>

                     <p>This is a great City with a stout Fortress.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Casan</hi> to <hi>Sabouk-sha, sha.</hi> 200</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sabouk-sha</hi> to <hi>Godamijan, sha.</hi> 120</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Godamijan</hi> to <hi>Niguina, sha.</hi> 280</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Niguina</hi> is a large and well Fortifi'd Castle.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Niguina</hi> to <hi>Mouron, sha.</hi> 300</p>

                     <p>So that from <hi>Astracan</hi> to <hi>Moscow</hi> they count it <hi>sha.</hi> which makes 590 <hi>Italian</hi> miles. 2950</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Sarataf</hi> you may go ashore, and so by Land to <hi>Moscow.</hi> When the Snow is gone you travel in Wagons, but when the Snow lies, in Sledges. If a man be alone, and that his Goods weigh not above two hundred pounds <hi>Paris</hi> weight, they put them into two Bales; and laying them upon the Horses back set the man in the middle, paying for Carriage as much as from <hi>Astracan</hi> to <hi>Moscow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sarataf</hi> by Land to <hi>Inserat,</hi> days 10</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Inserat</hi> to <hi>Tymnek,</hi> days 6</p>

                     <p>From <hi>Canquerma</hi> to <hi>Volodimer,</hi> days 6</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Volodimer</hi> is a City bigger than <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where stands a fair Church upon a Mountain in the City, having been formerly the residence of the Emperours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Volodimer</hi> to <hi>Moscow,</hi> days 5</p>
                     <p>In all, days 35</p>
                     <p>Observe by the way that they never go ashore at <hi>Serataf</hi> but in case of necessity, when the River begins to be Frozen. For from <hi>Serataf</hi> to <hi>Inserat</hi> is a Journey of ten days, in all which time there is nothing to be had, either for Horse or Man. The Custom is the same at <hi>Moscow</hi> as at <hi>Astracan,</hi> that is Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> All the <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Turks, Persians, Armenians,</hi> and others, lodge in a sort of Inns: but the <hi>Europeans</hi> lie in a place by themselves altogether.</p>

VIII.</hi> Remarks upon the Trade of the Island of <hi>Candy</hi> and the principal Isles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> as also upon some of the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> adjoyning; with a particular Relation of the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Galleys, belonging as well to the Isles as to the Continent.</head>

                        <head>Of the ISLAND of <hi>CANDY.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>OUT of the Island of <hi>Candy</hi> Strangers export great store of Wheat and Sallet-Oyl, all sorts of Pulse, Cheese, yellow Wax, Cottons, Silks, but more especially Malmsey, wherein consists its chiefest Trade. When Vintage draws near, the Country-people that are to gather the Grapes wrap their Feet in a piece of a Boar's Skin, which they tye together upon the upper part of the Foot with a piece of Pack-thred, to preserve their Feet from the violent heat of the Rocks upon which they are to tread. Those Skins are brought out of <hi>Russia</hi> by the <hi>Russes,</hi> that bring Botargo and Caviare to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they have a vast vent for it all over <hi>Turkie, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> where they that follow the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Church, eat little or nothing else all the <hi>Lent.</hi> By the way take notice, that the <hi>Turks</hi> make a certain Glew out of Sturgeon, which is the best in the World, so that whatever is fasten'd with it, will rather break in another place than where it is glew'd. They make it thus: When they have caught a Sturgeon, they pull out his Guts, and then there remains a Skin that covers the Flesh; this Skin they take off from the head to the belly. It is very clammy, and about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of two Sheets of Paper, which they roll as thick as a Man's Arm, and let it dry in the Sun. When they use it, they beat it with a Mallet, and when it is well beat'n they break it into pieces, and steep it in Water for half an hour in a little Pot.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Venetians</hi> were Masters of <hi>Candy,</hi> they that had committed any Crime which deserv'd Death, if they could get out of the Island before they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106224:76"/>
went directly to <hi>Constantinopole,</hi> to beg their pardon. For you must know, that no person but the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to pardon Crimes committed in <hi>Candy.</hi> For example, when Signor <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visano</hi> was Ambassador for the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a <hi>Candiot</hi> having a desire to lye with a Woman by force, she told him she would sooner eat her Child's Liver than yield to his Lust. Whereupon, the Villain enrag'd he could not compass his design, took his opportunity, kill'd the Child, cut out the Liver, and made the Mother eat it, and then slew the Mother also. Upon this he fled to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> to beg pardon of the Ambassador, and obtain'd it there: But the Ambassador at the same time wrote word to the Governour of <hi>Candy</hi> to put him to death at his return; having only granted him his Pardon, to preserve his Priviledge. And indeed, to speak truth, the <hi>Candiots</hi> are the most wretched people under Heaven.</p>

                        <head>Of the ISLAND of <hi>CHIO.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE City of <hi>Chio,</hi> which gives the Island its Name, contains about thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Inhabitants; where there are little less than fifteen thousand <hi>Greeks,</hi> eight thousand <hi>Latins,</hi> and six thousand <hi>Turks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Among the several <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, the last of which hath continu'd ever since the time that the <hi>Genoeses</hi> possess'd the Island, there are some indifferent handsom Structures. The five principal <hi>Latin</hi> Churches are the Cathedral, and the Churches belonging to the <hi>Escolantines,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and the <hi>Capuchins.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> have also their <hi>Mosquees,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> their <hi>Synagogue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Four Miles from the City, near to the Sea-side is to be seen a vast Stone, which was cut out of some Rock; it is almost all round, only the upper part, which is flat, and somewhat hollow; round about the upper part, and in the middle, are places like Seats, cut into the same Stone; of which there is one higher than the rest, like a School-master's Chair; and Tradition reports that this was <hi>Homer</hi>'s School, where he taught his Scholars.</p>
                        <p>In this Island there is such an infinite number of Partridges, that the like is not to be found in any part of the World. But that which is a greater Rarity is this, that the Natives breed them up, as we do our Poultry, but after a more pleasant manners, for they let them go in the fields all the day long, and at night every Country-man calls his own sevèrally home to Roost by a particular Note, whither they return like a Flock of so many Geese.</p>
                        <p>There are great quantities of Damasks and Fustians wrought in the Island of <hi>Chio,</hi> which are transported to Grand-<hi>Cairo,</hi> and to all the Cities upon the Coast of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, Natolia,</hi> and particularly to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Three Leagues from the Island of <hi>Chio,</hi> upon a Mountain to the South there grows a peculiar sort of Trees; the Leaves are somewhat like a Myrtle, their Branches so long that they creep upon the ground; but which is more wonderful, that when they are down, they rise again of themselves. From the beginning of <hi>May</hi> to the end of <hi>June,</hi> the Inhabitants take great care to keep the Earth under the Tree very clean; for during those two Months there issues out a certain Gum from the joynts of the Branches, which drops upon the ground; this is that which we call <hi>Mastick,</hi> and the <hi>Turks, Sakes,</hi> according to the Name which they give the Island. The Island produces great store of this <hi>Mastick,</hi> which is spent in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Women continually chew it, to cleanse and keep their Teeth white. When the <hi>Mastick</hi> Season draws near, the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> every year sends a certain number of <hi>Bestangi's</hi> to take care that it be not exported, but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd for the use of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> If it be a plentiful year for <hi>Mastick</hi> the <hi>Bestangi's</hi> that cull out the lesser sort to sell, put it into little Bags and seal it up; which Bags being so seal'd, are never question'd by the Custom-house Officers. The Island also yields very good Turpentine.</p>

                        <head>Of the ISLAND of <hi>NAXIS.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THere is not one Port belongs to this Island; the Vessels that are Bound thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Trade, being forc'd to stay in the Haven of the Isle of <hi>Paros,</hi> call'd <hi>Derion</hi> six miles from <hi>Naxis,</hi> which is one of the best Havens in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> able to contain a thousand Ships. There are the ruines of a Wall still to be seen that made a Mole, where four or five Galleys might ride. There are also the ruines of several Houses of the ancient Dukes, the Stables standing almost whole, all Arch'd, and built of Marble. These Dukes were also Lords of twelve other Islands. As for the Island it self, it is well stor'd with Villages, and has three good Cities, <hi>Barequa, Qüsa,</hi> and <hi>Falet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Near this Island within a stones throw, there is a curious piece of Antiquity still to be seen. It is a flat Rock, as big about in compass as the ancient Court of the <hi>Louvre.</hi> In the middle of this Rock it was that the Temple of <hi>Bacchus</hi> was built all of Marble, of which there is nothing but the Foundations that remain. The Gate is still standing made of three Stones, whereof two make the sides, and the third lies across. From the Isle to this Rock there is a fair Stone Bridge of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, upon each side whereof are to be seen the Pipes that convey'd the Wine into the Temple, that was drank at the Feast of <hi>Bacchus. Naxis</hi> also is the Island that produces the best <hi>Emeril.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the Inhabitants themselves, if the Husband or Wife happens to dye, the Survivor never stirs out of the House in six Months after, upon any business how urgent soever, no not to hear Mass. There are both <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Island, but the latter are the most numerous. There is a <hi>Latin</hi> Arch-bishop, and Canons belonging to the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church, with two Religious Houses, one of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and the other of <hi>Jesuites:</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> also have their Arch-bishop.</p>
                        <p>The Island of <hi>Naxis</hi> is sixscore miles in compass, being one of the fairest and pleasantest Islands in the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> The ancient Dukes made it their residence, whence they command the greatest part of the <hi>Cyclades.</hi> There is great plenty of White Salt made in <hi>Naxis,</hi> and it produces excellent Wine both White and Claret, which caus'd the Inhabitants to build a Temple to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who according to their ancient Tradition chose that Island for his Habitation. The Island produces excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fruits, feeds great store of Cattle, and abounds in several other things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for human support. There are also in it large Woods full of small Deer, and frequented by a great number of Eagles and Vultures.</p>
                        <p>Here follow the names of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> as the people of the Country pronounce them.</p>

                        <p>THE City of <hi>Athens</hi> is about four miles distant from the Sea, and contains two and twenty thousand Inhabitants, twenty five thousand <hi>Greeks,</hi> five or six thousand <hi>Latins,</hi> and a thousand <hi>Turks.</hi> Among all the Antiquities that yet remain, those in the Castle are the best preserv'd. The Castle stands upon a Hill, upon the North descent whereof some part of the City stands. It encloses a very fair and spacious Temple, built all of white Marble from the top to the bottom, supported by stately Pillars of black Marble and Porphiry. In the front are great Figures of Armed Knights ready to encounter one another. Round about the Temple, except upon the Roof, which is all of flat Marble Stones well order'd, are to be seen all the famous Acts of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in small carving, every Figure being about two foot and a half high. Round about the Temple runs a fair Gallery, where four persons may walk a-brest. It is supported by sixteen Pillars of white Marble upon each of the sides, and by six at each end, being also pav'd and cover'd with the same Stone. Close to the Temple stands a fair Palace of white Marble, which now falls to decay. Below the Castle, and at the point of the City toward the East, stand seventeen Pillars, the remainder of three hundred, where anciently, they say, stood the Palace of <hi>Theseus</hi> first King of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> These Pillars are of a prodigious bigness, every one eighteen foot about. They are proportionable in height, but not all of a piece, being thwarted most of them by Stones of white Marble, one end whereof rests upon one Pillar, and the other upon that which follows it; which was the support of the whole building. Upon the Gate, which is yet entire, are to be seen these words upon the front without.

The <hi>Athenian</hi> Merchants buy up Tissues, Velvets, Satins, and Cloth, with which they serve other Countries adjoyning. The Commodities which Foreigners export from thence, are, Silks, Wool, Sponges, Wax, Cordivan-Leather, and Cheese. Which is all that can be said in few words, of the Trade of all these Places.</p>

                        <head>A Particular Relation of the Gallies belonging to the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> as well at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as in the Isles and other Parts of the Empire.</head>
                        <p>FOrmerly there lay in the Road of <hi>Constantinople</hi> above a hundred and fifty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys: But the Grand <hi>Visier</hi> perceiving that so great a number did but cause confusion, and that the Captain-<hi>Basha</hi> could not conveniently take so great a burden as to look after such a number, he gave order that no more than twenty-four should lie in the Port of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> sending the rest to other Ports, as well of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, as the Islands.</p>
                        <p>At present the Number of the Grand <hi>Signor</hi>'s Gallies is fourscore, thus distributed under the Command of their several <hi>Beys</hi> or Captains.</p>
                        <p>At <hi>Constantinople,</hi> twenty-four under the Command of the Captain-<hi>Basha,</hi> or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the Sea; who when he goes out upon any Expedition, sends to the rest to meet him according to Orders. When he goes in person to Sea, he gives to every one of his Slaves, besides their ordinary Habit a kind of Cassock of Red Cloth, and a Bonnet of the same colour. But this is only in the Admiral's Gally, and at his own Cost. His Gally carries usually 366 Slaves, and to every Seat of the Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a <hi>Bonne Vole.</hi> These <hi>Bonne Voles</hi> are certain Volunteers that freely offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Service of the Admiral, and there is great care taken for their being well paid. Their Pay is 3500 <hi>Aspers</hi> for their Voyage, which generally continues seven or eight Months. They feed as the other Slaves; but if they Row negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or lazily, they are beaten worse than the Slaves; for the Volunteers have nothing to do except it be to Row: But the Slaves are put to several other Duties. Take notice also that the Volunteers that serve in the General's Gally, have 500 <hi>Aspers</hi> more than those in the other Gallies, that is to say, 4000 <hi>Aspers</hi> for their Voyage, which comes to 40 Crowns.</p>
                        <p>The Reer-Admiral carries Two hundred and fifty men, as well Slaves as Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. That Galley and the great <hi>Tefterdar</hi>'s or Treasurers, are the best provided of any in the whole Fleet: For the Reer-Admiral <hi>Basha</hi> has his choice to take four of the best men out of every Galley for his own, or else to receive 3500 Aspers for every man, which is paid by the Captain of the Galley; which makes him the richest of all the <hi>Beys.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The great <hi>Tefterdar</hi>'s Galley is one of the Twenty four Galleys of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and he sends a particular Treasurer, in the quality of a Lientenant, to command her. That Command is very much contested for, in regard that Galley is very well provided with all things; and for that all the Captains Court the <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> who, when the Galleys return to Port, rewards them according to their Merit.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Janizary-Aga</hi>'s Galley is of the same number; but he never goes to Sea, always sending one in his room.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that takes upon him the Title of <hi>Basha,</hi> has eight Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Stancho,</hi> an Island about an hundred Miles from <hi>Rhodes,</hi> Lieutenant to the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> has one Galley.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Sussam,</hi> a small Island near <hi>Scio,</hi> has one Galley, and his Lieutenant another. These Galleys are generally appointed to watch the <hi>Maltesi,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Scio</hi> formerly had but three; but since the War with <hi>Candy,</hi> he has had six.</p>
                        <p>The Lieutenant of the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Soio</hi> has two Gallies. There be also three other <hi>Beys</hi> in the Island of <hi>Scio,</hi> who have no dependance upon the <hi>Basha</hi> of <hi>Scio,</hi> but buy their Provisions where they can find it best cheap.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and his Lieutenant have two Gallies; but they can do nothing without the Orders of the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Scio.</hi>

                        <p>All these Gallies make up the number of Fourscore.</p>
                        <p>The light Gallies carry not above 196 men; the four men that are wanting of two hundred, being the <hi>Bey</hi>'s profit.</p>
                        <p>Every Captain is allow'd thirteen thousand <hi>Piasters</hi> for his Provision; and every <hi>Christmas</hi> he gives to every Slave a pair of Breeches, and a Cassock of course Cloth, with a scantie kind of a Cloak.</p>
                        <p>Every Slave has every day a pound and a half of good Bread, and nothing else. But upon <hi>Friday,</hi> which is the <hi>Mahumetans Snnday,</hi> they have hot Pease, or Beans, or Lentils boyl'd in Butter. They receive also sometimes the Alms of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> when they lie in any Port. But at <hi>Constantinople</hi> they fare somewhat better; for twice a week, as well the <hi>Turks,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and others, come to the <hi>Bains,</hi> and be stow their Charity of Rice and other good Victuals. The <hi>Bains</hi> is the name of the place where the Sea-men are kept when they are not at Sea.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes when they are to go to Sea, they will counterfeit themselves sick or lame; but they are so narrowly observ'd, that it serves them to no other purpose than to procure to themselves the more Blows.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> a Relation of the present State of <hi>Georgia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GEORGIA,</hi> which others call <hi>Gurgïe,</hi> or <hi>Gurgistan,</hi> extends Eastward to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; and upon the West is bounded by Mountains that part it from <hi>Mengrelia.</hi> Formerly it was a Kingdom, all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants whereof were Christians, of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; but of late the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have got footing among them. And the King of <hi>Persia</hi> having fill'd them full of Divisions, has made two Kingdoms of it, which he calls Provinces; over which he has plac'd two Governors. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Princes of the Countrey, who must turn <hi>Mahometans</hi> before they can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that Dignity. When they are advanc'd, they take upon them the title of Kings; and while they have any Issue, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> cannot dispossess their Children.</p>
                     <p>The most Potent of these two Kings, is he that resides at <hi>Testis,</hi> who in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country is call'd the King of <hi>Cartele.</hi> The present King is the last that has continu'd a Christian, with his four Sons; the Eldest of which, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> having entic'd to Court, partly by Promises, and partly by Presents, has won to <hi>Mahumetism.</hi> Immediately thereupon, he caus'd him to be declar'd King of the other Province.</p>
                     <p>These two Kings have each of them a Guard of <hi>Mahumetan-</hi>Horsemen under their own pay; and at present I believe there are in both Kingdoms near upon 12000 <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Families.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Testis</hi> coyns Mony in the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Name; and the Silver which he coyns, is in <hi>Spanish</hi> Reals, <hi>French</hi> Crowns, and such other Money, which the <hi>Armenians</hi> bring out of <hi>Europe</hi> for their Goods. As to the Justice of the Countrey, neither the King himself, nor the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have any thing to do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106224:79"/>
with it. A thief is acquitted, paying seven-fold what he has stole; two parts whereof go to the Party robb'd, one part to the Judges, and four parts to the King. If the Thief has not wherewithal to make restitution, he is sold: If the Product do not yet equal the Sum, if he have a Wife and Children, they first sell the Wife, and if that will not do, then they sell the Children: But if the Party robb'd be so merciful, as to forgive the Thief his share, then neither the King nor the Judges can demand any thing for their share. If a man commit a Murder, they condemn him to die, and deliver him up into the hands of the Kindred of the Party slain, to do Execution as they please themselves. However, it is in their power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, if he be able to give sixty Cows or more to the next a-kin to the Party kill'd. In matter of Debt, a Creditor has power to seize upon all the Estate of the Debtor; and if that will not satisfie, he may sell his Wife and Children.</p>
                     <p>The Christians of <hi>Georgia</hi> are very ignorant, especially in Matters of Religion. They learn that little they know, in the Monasteries, as also to write and read; and generally the Women and Maids are more knowing than the Men; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are more Religious Houses for Women than for Men, but also because the Boys are bred up to labour, or sent to the Wars. For if a Virgin grows up, and happens to be handsom, some one or other presently endeavors to steal her, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to sell her into <hi>Turky, Persia,</hi> or the Territories of the great <hi>Mogul.</hi> So that to prevent their being stoln, their Fathers and Mothers put them very young into Nunneries, where they apply themselves to study; wherein, if they attain to any proficiency, they usually stay as long as they live: After that, they profess, and when they come to a certain Age, they are permitted to Baptize, and to apply the holy Oyles, as well as any Bishop or Arch-Bishop can do.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Georgians</hi> are very great Drinkers; and Nature has fitted them a Countrey that produces good store of Wine. They love the strongest Drinks best; for which reason, at their Feasts both men and women drink more <hi>Aquavitae</hi> than Wine. The women never eat in publick with their Husbands; but when the man has invited his Friends, the next day the Woman invites her She-companions. And it is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that at the Womens Festivals there is more Wine and <hi>Aquavitae</hi> drank than at the mens. The Guest is no sooner enter'd into the Dining-room, but he is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 2 or 3 Dishes of Sweet-meats, and a Glass of half a pint of <hi>Aquavitae</hi> to excite his Appetite. They are great Feeders upon Onions and Herbs, which they eat raw out of the Garden. The <hi>Georgians</hi> are also great Travellers, and very much addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Trade; they are very dext'rous in shooting with Bow and Arrows, and are accounted the best Souldiers in all <hi>Asia.</hi> They compose a great part of the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Cavalry, who keeps them in his Court at peculiar pay, and relies very much upon their fidelity and courage. There are several also in the Service of the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> The Men are very well complexion'd. and very well shap'd; and for the Women, they are accounted the fairest and most beautiful of all <hi>Asia;</hi> and therefore out of this Countrey it is that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> chooses all his Wives, being not permitted to marry a Stranger. <hi>Teflis,</hi> where the Women have more liberty than in any part of <hi>Asia,</hi> is the Capital City of <hi>Georgia,</hi> well situated, large and well built, where there likewise is a great Trade in Silk.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> A RELATION of the present State of <hi>Mengrelia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MEngrelia</hi> extends from a Chain of Mountains, that separates it from <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> to the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> and is now divided into three Provinces (every one of which has their King. The first is call'd the Province of <hi>Imareté,</hi> or <hi>Bassa-Shiouk,</hi> the king whereof pretends to a superiority over both the other, which is the reason they are often at War, and that with so much cruelty, that when they have tak'n any Prisoners of either side, they fell them into <hi>Turkie.</hi> They are so accustom'd to sell one another in this Country, that if a man or his wife have any occasion for money, they will go and sell one of their Children, and many times they will exchange a Child for Ribands or other Toyes at the Mercers Shops.</p>
                     <p>The second Province is that of <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> and the King of this Province is call'd the King of <hi>Dadian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is the Province of <hi>Guriel,</hi> the King of which Province is call'd the King of <hi>Guriel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Mengrelia</hi> was formerly subject to the King of <hi>Bassa-Shiouk,</hi> who sent thither a Governour, which is call'd in their language <hi>Dadian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of those Governours being a person of wit and courage, gain'd so far upon the affection of the People, that they chose him for their King.</p>
                     <p>The chief of the Province of <hi>Guriel,</hi> seeing how the <hi>Dadian</hi> had obtain'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, following the Example of <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> shook off the Yoke of the King of <hi>Bassa-Shiouk,</hi> and chose another King among themselves, who keeps his Soveraignty to this day, by the support of the <hi>Grand Signor.</hi> For when the <hi>Dadian</hi> rebell'd he enter'd into an Alliance with the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> and oblig'd himself to furnish him every year with such a certain quantity of Iron, upon condition that if the King of <hi>Bassa-Shiouk</hi> should war upon him, he should furnish him with twenty thousand Horse. Of which the <hi>Turk</hi> was very glad, finding thereby the Country of <hi>Mengrelia</hi> divided, which being united, was able at any time to have disturb'd him with an Army of fifty thousand Men.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Bassa-Shiouk</hi> coynes money of the same bigness and weight with that of the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> But in regard it is not so fine metal as that of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> he would have much a doe to make it pass in the trade between his Subjects and the <hi>Persians,</hi> which is very great, had he not found an expedient by putting the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s name upon the Coyn as well as his own, which makes it pass without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. He would also put the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>'s Name upon his Coyn, but that the <hi>Turk</hi> coynes none but small money, or <hi>Aspers,</hi> excepting only some Ducatts which he coines at <hi>Cairo.</hi> The King of <hi>Bassa-Shiouk,</hi> as well as the King of <hi>Teflis</hi> coynes all sort of forreign money.</p>
                     <p>These three Kings of <hi>Bassa-Shiouk, Mengrelia</hi> and <hi>Guriel,</hi> are Christians also. And when they go to war, all the Ecclesiastical Persons attend them; Arch-bishops and Bishops, Priests and Monks: not so much to fight as to encourage the Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Being at <hi>Constantinople</hi> the first time I travell'd into <hi>Persia</hi> I saw there an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from the King of <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> whose behaviour gave all the <hi>Franks</hi> occasion of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Present which he made the <hi>Grand-Signor</hi> was in Iron and Steel, and a great number of Slaves. The first time of his Audience, he had a train of above 200 Persons. But every day he sold two or three to defray his expences; So that at his departure, he had none but his Secretary and two Vassals more left. He was a man of presence but no wit: and every time he went to visit the <hi>Grand-Visier,</hi> he presum'd to wear the white Bonnet which all the <hi>Franks</hi> wonder'd at; when they saw that the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> wink'd at it. For should any other Christian have done so, he had been most certainly put to death, or constrain'd to turn <hi>Mahumetan.</hi> By which it was apparent how much the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> valu'd the Friendship of the King of <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> and how careful he is of offending those that are sent from his Court. He knew those People suffer no affronts, but upon the least word presently draw; besides that there is nothing to be got by provoking them.</p>
                     <p>This Embassadour going once upon a visit into the Country, returning home was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106224:80"/>
surpriz'd with a Storm, whereupon he pull'd off his Boots and carri'd them under his Coat, choosing rather to go bare - foot to his lodging, then to spoil his Boots.</p>
                     <p>Another time, it being the custom of all Catholick Ambassadors to go to Mass to the Covent of Grey Friars in <hi>Pera,</hi> upon St. <hi>Francis's</hi> day, the <hi>Mengrelian</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador after Mass was done, coming out of the Church, and seeing several baubles which the Pedlers expose in the Cloyster upon that day, bought a Tin Ring, two or three small Looking-Glasses, and a Pipe, which he put in his mouth, and went piping all the way i'th Street, as Children do coming from Fairs.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the matter, you must take notice that there are not only Iron Mines, but also Mines of Gold and Silver in two places five or six days Journey from <hi>Teflis,</hi> the one call'd <hi>Soiianet,</hi> the other <hi>Obetet.</hi> But the mischief is, the people can hardly be got to work there, for fear the Earth should tumble down, and bury them in the Mine, as it has many times happen'd.</p>
                     <p>There is also a Mine of Gold near to a place which is call'd <hi>Hardanoushé,</hi> and a Mine of Silver at <hi>Gunishé-Koné,</hi> five days Journey from <hi>Erzerom,</hi> and as many from <hi>Trebisond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the people themselves both <hi>Georgians</hi> and <hi>Mengrelians,</hi> they never trouble themselves about the jgnorance and viciousnes of their Priests, or whether they be able to instruct them or no. The richest among them are they which are in most credit, and absolutely give Laws to the poor. There are also some heads of the Church, that assume such a jurisdiction over the people, as to sell them both to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and they choose out the handsom'st Children, both Boys and Girls, to get the more money, by which authority also the great men of the Country enjoy Marry'd Women and Maids at their pleasure. They will choose out their Children for the Bishops while they are yet in their Cradles; and if the Prince be dissatisfi'd at it, all the Clergy joyns with him that makes the choice, and then together by the Ears they go. In which Skirmishes they will carry away whole Villages, and sell all the poor people to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> And indeed the custom of selling men and women is so common in that Country, that a man may almost affirm it to be one of their chiefest Trades.</p>
                     <p>The Bishops dissolve Marriages when they please, and then Marry again after they have sold the first. If any of the Natives be not Marri'd to his fancy, he takes another for such a time as he thinks fit, for which he pays her all the while as the <hi>Turks</hi> do. Very few of these people know what Baptism means. Only two or three days after the woman is brought to bed, the Priest comes and brings a little Oyl, mumbles over a few Prayers, and then anoints the Mother and the Infant, which they believe to be the best Baptism in the World. In short they are a people of no Devotion at all, neither in their Ceremonies nor in their Prayers. But there are great store of Nunneries, where the young Maids apply themselves to their Studies, and after such an age, whether they stay in the Nunneries or betake themselves to the Service of any of the great Lords, they Confess, Baptize, Marry, and perform all other Ecclesiastical Functions, which I never knew practis'd in any other part of the World beside.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of</hi> Comania, Circassia, <hi>and of certain people which they call</hi> Kalmouchs.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>COmania</hi> is bounded toward the East by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; Westward by the Mountains that divide it from <hi>Circassia;</hi> Northward it lies upon <hi>Muscovia;</hi> and Southward it is bounded by <hi>Georgia.</hi> From the Mountains that bound upon the North-East to <hi>Tercki,</hi> which is the River that parts <hi>Moscovia</hi> from <hi>Comania,</hi> it is all a level Country excellent for Tillage, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in fair Meadows and Pasturage. However it is not over-peopl'd, which is the reason they never Sow twice together in one place. The Climate is much the same
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106224:80"/>
as between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lion,</hi> where it Rains very much; and yet the Country people have cut several Channels from the Rivers to water the Grounds after they have Sow'd them, which they learnt from the <hi>Persians.</hi> Those Rivers fall from the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Mountains, being not at all tak'n notice of in the Map. There is one among the rest a very large River, which can be forded at no time. They call it <hi>Coyasou,</hi> or <hi>The thick water,</hi> in regard it is continually muddy, the stream being so slow, that they can hardly discern which way it runs. It falls gently into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea to the South of the mouth of <hi>Volga.</hi> Not far from this River, in the months of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> all along the Shore of the same Sea, you may see vast shoals of fish about two foot long. Before, they have two legs, like a Dog's legs, behind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of legs they have only claws. Flesh they have none, but only fat with a bone in the middle. Now in regard they are but flow pac'd when they come upon Land, the Country people easily knock them on the head, and make Oyl of them; which is the greatest Trade they have.</p>
                     <p>The people of <hi>Comania,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Comouchs,</hi> dwell for the most part at foot of the Mountains, because of the Springs so plentiful in those places, that in some Villages you shall have above twenty or thirty. Three of these Spings meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, make a stream strong enough to drive a Mill. But this is not the sole reason, for there is Water enough in the plain. But in regard they are a people that only live upon the spoil and plunder of their Enemies, and of one another, as they are in continual fear of being set upon, they love to dwell near the refuge of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whither they fly with their Cattle upon any occasion of danger. For all the people round about, as <hi>Georgians, Mengrelians, Cirkassians, Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> live altogether by rapine, and continual In-roads into one anothers Countries.</p>
                     <p>There are another sort of people which are call'd <hi>Kalmouchs,</hi> that inhabit upon the Coast of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea between the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The men are strong, but the most deformed under Heaven. Their faces are so flat and broad, that there is the bredth of five fingers between each Eye. Their Eyes are very small, and that little Nose they have is so flat, that there is nothing to be seen but two little holes instead of Nostrils. Their Knees also and their Feet turn inward. When they go to the Wars, they carry their Wives and their Daughters, if they be twelve years of age, along with them, who fight as couragiously as the men themselves. Their Arms are Bows, Arrows, and Skains, with a great wooden Mace at the Pummel of their Saddles; their Horses being the best in all <hi>Asia.</hi> Their Captain is of some ancient Family, but they more particularly choose him for his valour. The Duke of <hi>Muscovia</hi> sends them presents every year, to preserve their friendship, which presents consist in Cloth. And he grants them free passage through his Territories, when ever they have a mind to invade the <hi>Mengrelians, Georgians,</hi> or <hi>Cirkassians,</hi> at which sport they are much more dexterous than the lesser <hi>Tartars.</hi> Sometimes they advance into <hi>Persia,</hi> as far as the Province of the <hi>Usbekes,</hi> which is a part of Great <hi>Tartary,</hi> ranging up as far as <hi>Caboul</hi> and <hi>Canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har.</hi> Their Religion is particular to themselves, but they are great Enemies to the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Comouchs</hi> or people of <hi>Comania,</hi> they are <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise ones too. They are under the protection of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who makes great account of them, in regard they defend the Passes into his Country on that side against the <hi>Kalmouchs.</hi> They are habited both men and women like the Lesser <hi>Tartars,</hi> fetching all the Silk and Calicut which they use out of <hi>Persia;</hi> for as for Cloth, they are contented with what they make in their own Country, which is very course.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Circassia</hi> is a pleasant good Country, and full of variety. There are Plains, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, Hills, and Mountains abounding in Springs, some of which are so large, that some of them will serve seven or eight of the neighbouring Villages. But on the other side, in all the Rivers that proceed from these Springs, there is not a fish to be seen. Flowers they have in abundance, especially fair Tulips. There is a sort of Strawberry also with a short stalk, of which five or six grow in a bunch; the least are as big as a small Nut, of a pale yellow Colour. The Soil is so fertile, that it brings forth without any great trouble a vast plenty of all sorts of Fruits. Nor do the people need any other Gardens than their Fields which are cover'd with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106224:81"/>
Cherry-trees, Apple-trees, Pear-trees, Walnut-trees, and all other useful Trees of the same nature: but their chiefest Wealth consists in Cattel, but especially in well-shap'd Horses, not much unlike the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gennets. They have also an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Goats and Sheep, whose Wool is as good as that of <hi>Spain;</hi> which the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> fetch away to make Felts. They neither sow Wheat nor Oats, but only Barley for their Horses, and Millet to make Bread; nor do they ever sow twice in the same place: not but that the Land is good enough to bear Wheat, but because they love Bread made of Millet better. They have very good Fowl, and Venison, and Wild-Fowl more than they know what to do withal; which they never hunt with Dogs, nor fly their Hawks at; for their Horses are so swist and so good, that they will tire the Beast, and force him to lye down and yield. Ev'ry Horse-man has a Rope with a sliding-knot ready at the Pummel of his Saddle, which they are so dextrous to throw about the neck of the Beast that begins to be weary, that 'tis twenty to one if they miss him. When they have kill'd a Dear, they cut off the legs, and breaking the Bones, eat the Marrow, which they say is the best thing in the World to strengthen the Body. When they go to steal Cattel, they carry along with them great Cows-horns stuft with boyl'd Tripes cut in small pieces; then watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their times when the Herdsmen are asleep, when the Dogs begin to bark, they throw to ev'ry one a Horn, with which the Dog presently runs away: and so while the Shepherds are asleep, and the Dog is busie to get the Meat out of the Horn, which is there ramm'd in on purpose, the Thieves drive away what they please.</p>
                     <p>The Drink of the <hi>Sherkes</hi> is Water and <hi>Bosa. Bosa</hi> is a Drink made of Millet, as intoxicating as Wine, which they want in the Country.</p>
                     <p>The Men and the Women, Boys and Girls go habited all alike, and their Habit is a colour'd Robe of Fustian, with a kind of large Petticoat underneath; with this they wear a little pink'd Wastcoat that reaches down to their Thighs; and over that a Cassock of course Cloth that reaches down to their Knees, girt about their Wasts with a Cord. The Sleeves of the Cassock are op'n below and above, and sometimes they pin them behind their Backs. They wear no Beards 'till they are sixty years of age. And as for their Hair, neither Men nor Women, Boys nor Girls, ever wear it longer than the tips of their Ears. The Men, both young and old, shave the middle of their Heads about the bredth of two Fingers from the Forehead down to the Nape of the Neck: and then instead of Hats or Head-clothes, both Men and Women wear only a little Bonnet of the same Cloth as the Cassock, made like a Night-cap. 'Tis true, when the Maids come to be marry'd there is some distinction upon their Heads; for then they fast'n to the hinder part of their Heads a round piece of Felt, which they cover with a white Veil very artificially pleated. Their Breeches are ty'd below their Knees, and reach to their Ancles; their Shooes, which are of Cordovan, both upper and under Leather, have but one seam upon the upper part of the Foot, being light, and cut like a pair of Pumps.</p>
                     <p>As for their Beds, they take several Sheep-skins and sow them together, and then stuffing them full of Millet-leaves, make a kind of Quilt. Now when they beat the Millet, the Leaf comes to be as small as the Chaff of Oats; so that when the person rises off from the Quilt, the Quilt rises and swells again of it self. Their Cushions are of the same Make, only sometimes they are stuft with Wool.</p>
                     <p>The People are neither Christians nor <hi>Mahometans,</hi> all their Religion consisting in some Ceremonies which they perform with the greatest Solemnities which they can imagin: for at that time old and young of all Ages and Sexes, and all the whole Town must be there at the place appointed, unless impotency or sickness excuses them. I call them Villages, for in all these Countries their is neither Fortress nor City: and as for their Villages, they are all built after the same Model, round, with a <hi>Piazza</hi> in the middle, according to the Figure.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Ceremonies and Customs of the People of <hi>Comania</hi> and <hi>Circassia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Principal of all the Feasts which the <hi>Comouchs</hi> and <hi>Sherkes</hi> or <hi>Cirkassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> make, is that which they make at the end of Autumn, after this manner. Three of the ancientest of the Village are appointed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it, and to discharge themselves of a Duty impos'd upon them in the company of all the people. These three old men take a Sheep or a Goat, and having mutter'd certain Prayers over the Beast, they cut the throat of it: after they have drest it very clean, they boil it whole, all but the Gathers, and them they roast. The Sheep being boil'd, they set it upon a Table, and carry it into a large Barn, where the People are appointed to meet: There the three old men stand upright before a Table, and all the People, Men, Women and Children behind them. When the Table upon which the Meat stands, is brought in, two of the three old men cut off the Legs and the roasted Gathers, and hold them up above their heads, and the third holds up a great Cup of <hi>Bosa</hi> in the same manner, to the end the people behind may see them. When the people see the Meat and <hi>Bosa</hi> so lifted up, they prostrate themselves upon the ground, and so continue till all the rest of the Meat be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lesser Table, and that the old men have said some few word. Then the two old men that held up the Meat, cut off two little pieces, and give each of them a piece to him that holds the Cup, which being done, they take each of them a piece for themselves. When they have all three eaten of the meat, the old man that holds the Cup, drinks first, then gives the two old men to drink, first to him upon the right hand, next to him upon the left, never letting go the Cup all the while. This first Ceremony being thus accomplish'd, the two old men turn toward the Assembly, and go and present both of the Meat and the Drink, first to their Chief or Lord, then to all the people, who equally eat their share, both men and women. That which remains of the four feet, is carry'd back to the Table, and the three old men eat it. This done, they go and place themselves at the Table, where the Mutton is set, where the oldest of the three taking the Head, eats a little Morsel; after him, the second, and next to him, the third does the same. Then the first old man commands the rest to be carry'd to the Lord, who receives it with a great deal of respect, and after he has giv'n it to his next a-kin, or the Friend whom he loves best, the Head is giv'n from one to another, till it be eat'n up. This being done, the three old men begin to eat of the Mutton a bit or two, and the Lord of the Village is call'd, who comes with his Bonnet in his hand, in a trembling posture; to whom, one of the old men presenting a Knife, he cuts off a piece of Mutton, and eats; and having drank a Cup of <hi>Bosa,</hi> he returns to his Seat. After him, all the people, according to their turns in quality, do as much; and then, for the Bones the Children go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears among themselves.</p>
                     <p>They have another Feast before they begin to Mow their Meadows; at which time all the people of the Village, that have wherewithal, take every one a Goat, (for in their Ceremonies they esteem Goats better than Sheep) and for the poor, they join eight or ten together for a Goat. Let them be Goats, Sheep or Lambs, when they are all brought together, they cut their Throats, and then flea off the skin, leaving the four feet and the Head in it. Then they stretch the Skin with sticks that cross from one foot to the other, aud set it up on a Pole fix'd in the Earth, the top whereof enters into the head of the Beast, as is to be seen in the Figure of the Village; and as many Beasts as there are kill'd, so many Poles are planted in the midst of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, with every one a particular Skin upon it; to which, every one that passes by, maks a profound obeysance.</p>
                     <p>Ev'ry one having boil'd his Goat, brings it into the void place in the middle of the Village, and sets it upon a great Table with the rest. There is the Lord of the Village with his Servants, and sometimes the Lord of some other Village is invited. Now all this Victuals being upon the Table, three of the oldest men of the Village
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106224:83"/>
sit down and eat a Bit or two: Then they call the Lord of the Town, and if there be any other Lord, they come both together, with some other of the Seniors of the Parish; who being set down, eat up one of the Beasts, which the old men had set apart for them; the rest is divided among the people, sitting upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>There are some Villages where you shall have fifty Goats and Sheep, or Lambs and Kids, kill'd together at one time. As for their <hi>Bosa,</hi> there are some that bring above 200 Pints; others more or less, according to their quality. All the day long they eat and drink, and sing and dance to their Flutes a dozen together, which are in some measure harmonious, as consisting of several parts, and decreasing propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably from the Treble to the Base. When the old men have solac'd themselves with eating and drinking, they go home, and leave the young people, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Boys and Girls to be merry by themselves: They stay as long as there is any Drink; and the next day they go early to Mowing.</p>
                     <p>They have other Ceremonies particular only to their Families. Once a year in every House they make a Cross after the Form of a Mallet, about five Foot high, the two Sticks that compose the Cross, being as big as a man's Arm. This the Master of the House sets in the Evening near the Door in his Chamber, and calling all his Family together, gives them every one a lighted Wax-Candle. Then first he fixes his own to the Cross, next his Wife sticks hers, and so all the Children and Servants: If the Children be so young, that they cannot do it themselves, the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do it for them. If one of the Candles burn out before it be put out, 'tisa Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostick that he or she that fix'd it there, shall not live out their year. If the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle falls, then he whose Candle it was, shall be robb'd, or be forc't to fly for his Life.</p>
                     <p>If it thunders, all the people run out of the Village, and the young people of both Sexes set themselves to singing and dancing in the presence of their Elders: And if any one be Thunder-struck, they bury that person honourably, believing him to be a Saint. Besides that, they send over all the Countrey for a white Goat, which they breed up and keep in the Village where it happen'd to thunder, having it in great veneration, till thundring in another place, the people send for it thither also. If the Thunder fall upon any of their Houses, though it kill neither Man, Woman, Child, nor Beast, all that Family shall be kept upon the publick stock all that year, without being ty'd to any Labour but of Singing and Dancing. These people, during that time, go from Village to Village Dancing and Singing at peoples Doors, but never going into their Houses; for which the Inhabitants are bound to bring them out something to eat.</p>
                     <p>There is a day in the Spring, when all that have been struck'n with Thunder, meet together in the Village where the white Goat is kept; who has always a Cheese hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his Neck as big as a <hi>Parma-</hi>Cheese. This Goat they take and carry to the Village of the chief Lord of the Countrey. They never go in, but the Lord with all the rest of the Village coming out, they all together prostrate themselves before the Goat. Having said some Prayers, they take away his Cheese, and immediately put another in its place. The Cheese which was taken away, is at the same time cut into little pieces, and distributed among the people. After that, they give the Strangers to eat, and bestow their Alms upon them; so that by this wandring from Village to Village, they get good store of Money.</p>
                     <p>They have among them but only one Book; and it is as big as one of our largest <hi>Folio</hi>'s, and it lies in the hands of an old man, who has only the priviledge to touch it. When that old man is dead, they choose another old man to keep the Book; whose Duty it is to go from Village to Village, where he hears of any sick people. He carries the Book with him, and after he has lighted up a Wax-Candle, and put the people out of the Room, he lays the Book upon the Stomach of the sick person, opens it, and reads in it, then blows over it sev'ral times, so that the Breath passes toward the mouth of the Party: Then he causes the party diseas'd to kiss the Book several times, and as often lays it upon his head, which is a Ceremony of half an hour. When the old man goes away, one gives him a Beef or a Heifer; another gives him a Goat; every one according to their Quality and Estate.</p>
                     <p>They have also Old Women that take upon them to cure the Sick. These Women feel the body of the sick party, all over, but more particularly they handle and grope that part where the distemper lies: during which time they let go several belches out
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106224:83"/>
of their mouthes, and the more sick the party is, the louder and thicker, they fetch their belches. The standers by hearing them belch in that manner and fetch such vilanous sighs from their stomacks, believe their friend to be dangerously ill, and that the louder the Women belch, the more ease and comfort they receive; but whether they do or no, the women are well payd for their pains. When any one feels a pain in the Head, they send for the Barber, who gives two cutts upon the Head across with the rasor, and then poures Oyl into the wound. For they believe the Head-ache proceeds only from a wind beeween the flesh and the bone, for which the Incision opens a paslage to let it out.</p>
                     <p>At their Funerals they that are the near Relations or Friends of the dead, some cut their faces, and other parts of their Bodies with sharp flints, others prostrate themselves upon the ground, and tear their hair; so that when they return from the Burial, they are all of a gore blood: However, notwithstanding all this affliction, they never pray for the Dead.</p>
                     <p>As to their Marriages: When a young man has seen a Virgin which he has a liking to, he sends one of his friends to agree with her Parents or her Tutor, what he will give for her. Commonly the guist consists in Horses, Cows or some other sort of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. When the agreement is made, the Parents and Kindred of the party thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, together with the Lord of the place, go to the House where the Virgin lives and bring her to the Bridegrooms House, where there is a Feast ready prepar'd; and after they have made merry, and sung, and danc'd for a while, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and Bride go and lye together, without any other Ceremony. If the Man and Maid are of two Parishes, the Lord of the Village where the Man lives, accompany him and his Kindred to the next Village altogether, to fetch the Bride from thence.</p>
                     <p>If a Man and the Wife have no Children, he is permitted to take several Wives one after another till he have Issue. If a marri'd Woman have a Gallant, and that the Husband should come and find his Wise a bed with him, he goes away again without saying a word, and never takes any further notice of it. The Woman also in the same case, does the like by the man. Nay, the more Gallants a Woman has, the more she is respected: And it is a common custom when they fall out, to taunt one another, that if they were not ugly, or ill natur'd, or diseas'd, they would have more Admirers than they have. The People are of an excellent Complexion, especially the Women, who are extreamly fair, and finely shap'd, and keep their beauty till five and forty or fifty years. They are very laborious, and work themselves in the Iron Mines, which they melt afterwards and forge into several Tooles and Implements. They make abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Embroidery of Gold and Silver for their Saddles, their Quivers, and their Pumps, as also upon the Calicut of which they make their Handkerchiefs.</p>
                     <p>If the man and the woman happen to quarrel often together, so that they cannot be reconcil'd: the Husband complaining first to the Lord of the Place, He sends for the Woman, and having giv'n order to sell her, gives the Man another. But if the Woman complain first, the Man is serv'd the same sawce. If a Man or Woman be a disturber of their Neighbours, if the Neighbours complain to the Lord, he presently causes the party to be apprehended and sold to the Merchants that buy Slaves, for they are resolv'd they will live in quiet.</p>
                     <p>They that take upon them the quality of Gentlemen, sit still, do nothing, and speak very little. In an evening they ride out, and meet some twenty or thirty together to go a stealing. Nor do they rob only their Enemies, but their Neighbours, from whom the chief prey which they take are Cattle and Slaves. All the Country-people are Slaves to the Lord of the Village where they live, whom he imploys to till his Land, and cut Wood for him upon occasion, of which they spend vast quantities. For not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very warm clad, they keep fire all night in the places where they sleep.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the lesser</hi> Tartars, <hi>call'd</hi> Nogaîes, <hi>bord'ring upon</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania.</head>
                     <p>THE lesser <hi>Tartars</hi> have a very ancient race of Horses, which they breed up even to Superstition; so that it would be among them an act of Sacriledge to sell them to strangers, as being not a little curious how they sell them to one another. These are the Horses which they ride, fifty or sixty in a Troop together when they go a thieving; and sometimes a hunder'd together, when they design any Incursion upon their Enemies. When the old Men come to be infirm and impotent, if they know any stout young Man that is a Souldier, they will lend him one of their Horses (if he have none of his own) to make an Incursion, upon condition to have half of the Booty. Many times they run up as far as <hi>Hungary,</hi> near to <hi>Comora</hi> and <hi>Javarin.</hi> These Horses, partly by nature, partly by early custom, will travel four or five days together with a handful of Grass giv'n them once in eight or ten hours, and a little Water every four and twenty hours. But they never go a robbing with them 'till they come to be seven or eight years old: besides that, they must undergo a very severe education ere they make use of them in those hardships. Their Bit is only a piece of Iron with a Buckle on each side, to which they fast'n the Bridle and Head-stall. For eight days together they put under the Saddle a bag of Gravel or Earth. The first day the Sack is a Horse-man's weight; and so they add to it every day, 'till it come to be double the weight at the end of the eight days. As they increase every day the weight upon the Horses back, they abate every day the Horse's Provender and Drink. During these eight days, they get up and walk the Horse two or three Leagues. The next eight days, they abate every day of the weight, 'till the Sack be quite empty. Proportionably also they abate him of his Meat and Drink as in the first eight days, and every day take up the Girt a hole shorter. The three or four last days they afford the Horse neither Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor Drink, according as they find him able to endure hunger and thirst, and the labour which he is to undergo. The last day, they work him 'till he be all over of a Sweat; then they unbridle and unsaddle him, and pour upon him the coldest Water they can meet with. That done, they lead him into a field, and tye him by the leg with a Cord, at such a length as they intend he shall feed; yet still from day to day allowing him more Rope, 'till at last they let him loose, and feed with the rest of the Horses. This terrible fasting and labour, during which time, that little which they do eat and drink, they eat and drink with the Bit in their mouth, brings them to be so lean and out of flesh, that their very bones are ready to start out of their skins: So that if any one should see them in that miserable condition, that does not know the nature of the Horses, would think they would never be fit for good service. The hoofs of these Horses are so hard that they never shooe them, and yet they will leave the prints of their feet in the Earth, or upon the Ice, as if they had been shod. These <hi>Tartars</hi> are so curious in having Horses that will endure labour, that so soon as they see any handsom Colt in their Breed, they presently take him up, to school him as I have related: but hardly ten in fifty endure the tutoring.</p>
                     <p>As for their Diet, 'tis a great advantage for these <hi>Tartars</hi> to ride a Mare, in regard they drink the Milk. They that ride Horses, carry along with them a little Bag full of pieces of Cheese dry'd in the Sun; they have also a small <hi>Boracho</hi> of Goat-skin, which they fill with Water where they meet with it, into which they put two or three bits of their hard Cheese, which softens with the motion of the Horse, the <hi>Boracho</hi> being ty'd under his Belly: and thus the Water becomes a kind of sowr Milk, which is their ordinary Drink.</p>
                     <p>As for their Instruments of Cookery, every Horse-man has a large wooden Ladle hanging at the Pommel of his Saddle, out of which the rider drinks himself, and gives his Horse likewise to drink. They that encounter them, can hope for no better Booty
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106224:84"/>
than their Horses; but they are very hard to be tak'n; for when one of these Horses perceives that his Rider is slain, he follows those that fly with all the swiftness ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. Beside that, those Horses being carri'd into other Countries, are presently spoil'd, and come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Their Cloathing is only a Sheep-skin, which in Winter they wear with the wool next their Bodies; in the Summer turning the other side. They that are the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Countrey, wear Wolves-skins, with a kind of Shirt, and Breeches of course Fustian of divers Colours, which the Taylor gets little credit by sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
                     <p>Their Women are very white and well proportion'd, but their Faces are broad, and their Eyes little, so that by thirty years of Age they become very deformed. There is not a man but has two or three Wives, which they never choose but out of their own Tribe. Every Tribe has a Chief; who is one of the Nobility of the Countrey, and carries for his Banner a Horse-tail fasten'd to a half-Pike, and dy'd into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour belonging to the Tribe. When they march, every one knows where to place himself, and how much ground they ought to take up for their Tribe and their Cattel; one Tribe never encroaching upon another.</p>
                     <p>The Women and Maids are generally clad in a large Shirt that reaches down to their feet. Upon their Heads they wear a large white Vail, their Foreheads being bound about with a large black Handkerchief ty'd in five or six Rolls. The Noble sort of Women and Maids wear over this Vail a Bonnet open behind, which comes down upon their Foreheads like a three-corner'd Cap: One of these Points stands up in the midst of the Forehead, lin'd with Velvet, Satin, or Cloth of Gold, and set with small pieces of Gold and Silver, and false Pearls, of which they also make themselves Bracelets: Their Breeches are of single-colour'd Cloth, and for Shoes and Stockings, they only wear a Cordovan Boot of what Colour they please, neatly sew'd.</p>
                     <p>When a young man intends to marry, it behoves him to give the Father and the Mother of the Maid a certain quantity of Horses, Bullocks or Cows, or other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which is done in the presence of the greatest part of the ancientest of the Tribe, and a <hi>Moullah</hi> beside. When the Agreement is made, the young man has the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to see his Mistress, but not till then: For before, he has only the information of her Mother, his Sisters, or such Women as were his own Friends. Besides the three Wives which the man is allow'd to take, he may keep several female Slaves; but the Children are still slaves, and can never inherit. These <hi>Tartars</hi> are of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot constitution, though not so hot as the women. Both the one and the other are very fair-haird; but the men have little or no Beards: So that if there be any one that has more Beard than ordinary, and can but write and read, they make him a <hi>Moullah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These people have no Houses, but live in Tents, or in Waggons which are drawn after them where-ever they go. The Tents are for the old people and little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with their Slaves that attend them. The young women ride in Waggons clos'd up with Boards, and to let in the Air, upon one side they open a Window that is made like a Lattice. In the Evening they are permitted to spend a little time in the Tents. When the Girls have attain'd to the age of ten or twelve Years, they never stir any more out of their Waggons till they are married, not so much as for the necessities of Nature; but in the middle of the Waggon there is a Plank to be taken up; and if it be in a place where they stay, a Slave presently comes and cleanses all underneath. The Maidens Waggon is easie to be known, as being painted with Flowers; and generally there is a Camel ty'd to the Tail of it, besmear'd with several colours, and several Nosegays or Posies of Flowers stuck about the Head of the Beast.</p>
                     <p>The young men have also every one their Chariot, wherein they only carry a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racho</hi> of Horse-skin, containing about 38 Quarts, which they usually fill with Mares-Milk, which is very sowr. They have also every one another Waggon next to that wherein they ride themselves; wherein they carry several <hi>Boracho</hi>'s full of Cows-Milk, which is very sowr. At Meals they drink this Milk: But before they powr it out, they stir it in the <hi>Boracho</hi> with a great Stick, that the Curd may mix with the thin Milk. But the Mares-Milk is only for the Master and Mistress, though before they drink of either, they mix it with water. When a Friend comes to see
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106224:85"/>
them, they fetch out their dri'd Cheese, which they call <hi>Kourout,</hi> and breaking it into little Bits, eat it with fresh Butter. At their Feasts they sometimes kill old Sheep, sometimes old Goats. But for their Horses they never kill them but at the Funerals of their Kindred, at the Birth of a Child, or at their Marriage-Feasts, or lastly, when their Friends return laden with Spoil from any incursion, and are stor'd with Slaves. They never drink any thing but Mares-Milk or Cows-Milk, and when they can get neither, they will endure thirst for three or four days together before they will drink Water, being always grip'd with a terrible Colick when they drink it. They never eat any Salt, being of an opinion that it is naught for the Eyes. They live long, and are very strong, and seldom sick; nor do they refuse any Diet but Swines-flesh.</p>
                     <p>Their Countrey is very level; only for some few Hills in some places. They have great store of Pasture-grounds, and every Tribe has their peculiar Wells to water their Cattel. In the Winter they lodge upon the banks of great Rivers, near to Woods and Marishes, suffering their Herds to feed at liberty. When the Snow is very deep, the Cattel scrape it away with their seet to come at the Grass, though they meet with very little else but Reeds and Bushes. In the mean while the men cut down the Woods, make great Fires, and employ themselves in Fishing. There are some parts of these Rivers where the least Fish they take is about four or five foot long; and some there are above ten or twelve foot in length. Some they dry in the wind, and preserve against Summer; some they smoke in holes which they make in the Earth: As for the smaller sort, they boil them, and eat them without Salt or any other seasoning. When they have eat'n their Fish, they scoop up a large wooden Ladle full of the Fish-water and gulp it down. As for Bread, there is no talk of it in their Countrey.</p>
                     <p>When they are not at Wars, or are but newly return'd from any Incursion, they spend their time in Hunting; but cannot endure any other Hounds except Greyhounds: So that he must be a very poor <hi>Tartar</hi> indeed that do's not keep a Greyhound. Take notice however by the by, that these petty <hi>Tartars,</hi> concerning whom I have last discours'd, are certain people adjoyning to <hi>Comania,</hi> which the <hi>Turks, Persians</hi> and <hi>Mengrelians</hi> call <hi>Nogaies;</hi> who may be well reckon'd among the number of the petty <hi>Tartars,</hi> in regard they are all under one Prince, whom the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> appoints King over all Petty <hi>Tartary,</hi> and who receives his investiture at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These <hi>Tartars</hi> are all <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> Nor have they any Physitian among them; making use only of certain Simples of which they have a traditional knowledge. When the sick person lies in any extremity, they send for a <hi>Moullah,</hi> who comes with the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which he opens and shuts three times, saying certain Prayers, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon the sick person's face. If by chance the sick person recover, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his recovery to the Sanctity of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and present the <hi>Moullah</hi> with a Sheep or a Goat: If he die, all his Kindred meet and carry him to the Grave with great Testimonies of Sadness, crying continually <hi>Alla, Alla.</hi> When he is interr'd, the <hi>Moullah</hi> mutters certain Prayers ov'r the Grave, and is paid for his pains according to the wealth of the Heirs. For the poor he generally spends three days and three nights in that exercise; for the rich he as usually spends a Month, never stirring all the while from the Grave; and sometimes sev'n or eight.</p>
                     <p>When any one of them is wounded, they use no other Salve but only boil'd Flesh, which they apply hot to the wound. If the wound be deep, they thrust in a piece of Fat as hot as the wound can endure it; and if the person be able to kill a Horse, the wound is cur'd so much the sooner; for the Flesh and Fat of a Horse are much more medicinable than the Flesh of any other Creature.</p>
                     <p>Were it not the Custom of the <hi>Tartars</hi> to buy their Wives when they marry, there would be fewer Whores. But in regard there are an abundance of poor young men that have not wherewithal to buy Wives, they never marry at all. This is that which makes so many Souldiers among them, and emboldens 'em to invade their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and to get something whereby they may be enabl'd to buy them a Wife. For the Virgins they are nev'r to be defil'd, being always shut up in their Waggons: But for the Women they are oft'n debauch'd, appointing their private Meetings, when they go to fetch water for their Cattel, when their Husbands are a-hunting, or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their Herds. Nor is it a hard thing to conceal it from their Husbands, in regard the <hi>Tartars</hi> are not in the least prone to Jealousie.</p>

                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106224:85"/>
By the way take notice, that the <hi>Nogaies,</hi> though they live almost after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and are under the same Prince, yet they perfectly hate them; reproaching them for effeminate, because they live in Houses and Villages, whereas the true Souldier should live in Tents as they do, to be ready upon all occasions.</p>
                     <p>They that run a-foot, as well in these Countries, as in <hi>Persia,</hi> when they are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, take Walnuts and bruise them, and then rub the Soles of their feet with them before the fire as hot as they can endure it, which presently makes them fresh again.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Extent of <hi>PERSIA,</hi> and its division into Provinces.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PERSIA,</hi> according to the present State of the Empire, to the North is bounded by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; Southward, by the Ocean; Eastward it joyns to the Territories of the Great <hi>Mogul;</hi> Westward, to the Dominions of the Grand <hi>Signor;</hi> the two Empires being parted by the Rivers <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that you may the better understand the full extent of the Dominions of the <hi>Persian</hi> King, you are to know, That this great Monarch, besides that Tract of Ground which is properly call'd <hi>Persia,</hi> possesses a vast part of the ancient <hi>Assyria</hi> and the great <hi>Armenia,</hi> the ancient Kingdoms of the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Lar,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Ormus,</hi> and all Eastward of <hi>Persia</hi> beyond <hi>Candahar,</hi> almost as far as the Kingdom of <hi>Scindi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But because those <hi>Europeans</hi> that have Travel'd before me, either were not so curious, or had not perhaps the opportunity to learn the true number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that compose the whole Continent of <hi>Persia,</hi> I have undertak'n, though the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves are ignorant enough, to give the best account I can, finding it necessary for the better satisfaction of the Reader, to take some notice of the Names of Places according to the ancient Geography.</p>
                     <p>The first is the Great <hi>Armenia,</hi> which our Maps without any ground or reason at all call <hi>Turcomannia;</hi> in regard they might have more properly call'd it <hi>Ermonick</hi> in general, since the Inhabitants are the greatest part <hi>Armenians.</hi> That part whereof which is situated between the two Rivers of <hi>Araxes</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> at this day call'd <hi>Aras</hi> and <hi>Kur,</hi> by the Natives is call'd <hi>Iran,</hi> or <hi>Cara-bag,</hi> being one of the most beautiful, and richest pieces of Land in all <hi>Persia;</hi> the principal Cities of which are <hi>Erivan, Nacksivan, Zulpha,</hi> and <hi>Van.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:106224:89"/>
The second is <hi>Diarbeck,</hi> formerly <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> between <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris;</hi> the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Bir, Car-Emir</hi> or <hi>Diarbequir, Ourfa, Moussul, Geziré, Merdin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The third is <hi>Curdistan,</hi> formerly <hi>Assyria,</hi> extending all along the East-side of the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> from the Lake <hi>Van</hi> to the Frontiers of <hi>Bagdat;</hi> the principal Cities are <hi>Niniveh, Sherisoul, Amadié, Sneirne, Betlis,</hi> and <hi>Salmastre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth is <hi>Hierak-Arabi,</hi> otherwise the Country of <hi>Babylon</hi> or <hi>Chaldea;</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Felougia</hi> upon <hi>Euphrates, Bagdat</hi> upon <hi>Tigris, Mershed-Ali, Gourno,</hi> and <hi>Balsara;</hi> and in the Country of <hi>Bourous, Sharaban, Eronnabat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is <hi>Hierak-Agemi,</hi> or the ancient <hi>Parthia;</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Hispahan, Toushercan, Hamadan, Cashan, Kan,</hi> and <hi>Casbin;</hi> and perhaps <hi>Yesd,</hi> if it be not rather in <hi>Kerman</hi> or <hi>Sigistan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixth contains <hi>Shirvan,</hi> all along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, where stand the Cities of <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Derbent</hi> in the <hi>Persian</hi> Tongue signifies ae Strait Gate, and <hi>Demir-Capi</hi> in the <hi>Turkish,</hi> ae Gate of Iron; near to which place were the ancient <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spian</hi> Gates, or <hi>Caspiae Pylae</hi> of the Ancients.</note> 
                        <hi>Derbent</hi> or <hi>Demir-Capi, Baku,</hi> and <hi>Shamaki;</hi> and the Province of <hi>Edzerbaijan;</hi> wherein stand the Cities of <hi>Tauris, Ardevil,</hi> and <hi>Sultany.</hi> Which two Provinces comprehend the ancient <hi>Media</hi> within a very little, extending to the very Shoar of the <hi>Caspan</hi> Sea.</p>
                     <p>The seventh contains <hi>Kylan</hi> and <hi>Mazandran,</hi> lying likewise upon the <hi>Caspan</hi> Sea, formerly <hi>Hyrcania;</hi> wherein are the Cities and Towns of <hi>Firuzcuh, Sukar-abad,</hi> and <hi>Mibnikiellé</hi> at the entry of the Mountains; <hi>Giru, Talara-pesct,</hi> and <hi>Saru,</hi> in the Plain; <hi>Ferh-abad, Ciarman,</hi> and <hi>Gscref,</hi> toward the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The eighth is <hi>Estarabad,</hi> formerly <hi>Margiana,</hi> which extends to the River <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>khané-kurkan,</hi> which the Ancients call'd <hi>Oxus;</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Estarabad, Amul, Damkam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ninth contains the Province of the <hi>Usbeck-Tartars,</hi> comprehending all the ancient <hi>Sogdiana</hi> and <hi>Bactriana;</hi> the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Balk, Samarcand,</hi> and <hi>Boccara,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The tenth is <hi>Corassan,</hi> formerly <hi>Aria,</hi> with some part of <hi>Bactriana;</hi> the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Eri, Meshed, Nisabur, Thun,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh <hi>Sablestan,</hi> formerly <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Beksabat, Asbé, Bust, Sarents;</hi> the Territory and City of <hi>Candahar</hi> being also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the extent of this Province, together with <hi>Duki</hi> and <hi>Alunkan,</hi> upon the Frontiers of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Dominions.</p>
                     <p>The twelfth is <hi>Sigistan,</hi> formerly <hi>Drangiana;</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Sistan, Shalack,</hi> and <hi>Kets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The thirteenth comprehends all the Territories of the ancient <hi>Arachosia,</hi> bord'ring upon the Kingdom of <hi>Scindi,</hi> not having any Cities that we know of.</p>
                     <p>The fourteenth is the Province of <hi>Makran,</hi> lying all along upon the Sea of <hi>Mogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> formerly <hi>Gedrosia;</hi> the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Makran, Firhk, Chalak,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Guadel</hi> toward <hi>Guzerat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifteenth <hi>Kerman,</hi> formerly <hi>Caramania,</hi> extending as far as the Gulf of <hi>Ormus;</hi> the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Kerman, Bermazir,</hi> the Port of <hi>Kuhestek,</hi> and the Cape of <hi>Jasques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixteenth is <hi>Farsistan,</hi> or that part of <hi>Persia</hi> so properly call'd; the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Schiras, Caseron, Benarou, Firus-abat, Darab-guier,</hi> &amp;c. To which you may add the little Province of <hi>Laraston,</hi> with the City of <hi>Lar,</hi> just against <hi>Ormus.</hi> But this Province formerly extended no farther than <hi>Benarou,</hi> two days journey from <hi>Lar,</hi> before <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> conquer'd the Kingdom of <hi>Lar,</hi> and then the Kingdom of <hi>Ormus.</hi> Now they are both united; though they have both several Governours, as they had distinct Princes before. The Ports in this Province upon the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf are <hi>Bander-Abassi</hi> and <hi>Bander-Congo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two other little Ports in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, about thirty hours sail from the Mouth of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but not capable of receiving any other than small Barks; which are very much to be admir'd; for in regard the Inhabitants are ignorant of the use of Iron, it is strange to see their Boats made so handsom and strong withal; the Planks being only ty'd together with a Cord, which is made of a kind of Hemp tak'n from the out-side of the Coco-nut.</p>
                     <p>The last is the Province of <hi>Cursistan,</hi> formerly <hi>Susiana,</hi> which <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> joyning together separate from <hi>Chaldea;</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Suster,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Susa,</hi> the Capital City of the Empire of King <hi>Ahasuerus, Ahawas, Scabar, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hormus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The temper of the Air in <hi>Persia</hi> varies according to the variety of situation. The Country of <hi>Edzerbaijan</hi> is very cold, but very healthy. The Air of <hi>Mazandran</hi> is very unwholsom; for being a low fenny Country, and full of Insects, when the Waters dry up in the Summer, the Insects also dye and infect the Air. Sometimes those bad Waters over-flow the Country; in so much that the Inhabitants receive a tincture in their Complexions from the colour of the Earth. The Province of <hi>Guilan</hi> is included in the Province of <hi>Mazandran;</hi> and the Air is so unwholsom, that the People cry of him that is sent to command there; <hi>Has he robb'd, stol'n, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, that the King sends him to</hi> Guilan?</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Ispahan,</hi> which is almost in the middle of <hi>Persia,</hi> there are six months of hot, and six months of cold weather. The Snow falls three or four times in a season, and sometimes so very thick, that there is hardly any travelling upon the Road. About a League from the City, toward the Mountain, there stands a Stone about two or three Foot high, which when the Snow hap'ns to cover, prognosticates a plentiful Year; and the first Country-man that carries the news thereof to the King, receives a hundred <hi>Tomans.</hi> As for Rain, there is very little falls there, unless it be in <hi>April,</hi> and then it sometimes rains very hard.</p>
                     <p>In the Southern Provinces, the heats are very excessive, and kill abundance of our <hi>Europeans,</hi> especially those that are giv'n to drink.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Persia</hi> is water'd with little Rivers; but there is not one navigable River through the whole extent of it, unless it be <hi>Aras,</hi> or the <hi>Araxes</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which carries some few flat-bottom'd Boats. The other Rivers, instead of growing bigger, the farther they keep their course from the Springs, grow shallower for want of Water, by reason of the infinite number of <hi>Kreises</hi> or Channels, which they cut out of the Rivers to water the Lands, which would not bring forth so much as only Grass without the help of those Cuts; unless it be in the Province of <hi>Mazandran,</hi> which from <hi>September</hi> to <hi>March</hi> seems a kind of Terrestrial Paradise, through the pleasing variety of Herbs and Fruits. However, <hi>Persia</hi> in general being thus water'd, is a most fruitful Country: though it be true, that many of their Springs and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are lost and brok'n. And <hi>Mirza-Ibrahim</hi> Governour of the Province of <hi>Edzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baijan</hi> told me one day, that in the very Territory of <hi>Tauris,</hi> there were above two hundred Springs utterly lost, either by accident or negligence.</p>
                     <p>As for their Gardens, they water them with Well-water, by the help of a Wheel and an Ox; but the running Water is much better, as not being so cold, and more fatning to the Earth. And therefore the Fruits that grow in the Mountains which are only water'd by the Rain or by the Dews, are much better tasted, and keep longer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Persia</hi> is a mountainous Country, but for the most part the Mountains are very dry and barren. As for Woods, there are none in all the Country. Travellers are also forc'd to go a great way out of their Road to find a Spring; and sometimes they shall ride ten or twelve Leagues, before they meet with any Water but what they carry in their Bottels. There are some Mountains out of which they dig Salt, as Stones out of a Quarrey. There are also Plains where the Sand is nothing but Salt, though it be not so savoury as our Northern Salt.</p>
                     <p>Of late several Copper-Mines have been found out, of which the Natives make all sorts of Kitchen-Housholdstuff. Their Lead comes from <hi>Kerman;</hi> their Iron and Steel from <hi>Corasan</hi> and <hi>Kasbin,</hi> though not so good as that of <hi>Spain.</hi> Their Steel is very fine, with a smooth grain, and grows very hard in the Water, but it is as brittle as Glass. Neither will this sort of Steel agree with the Fire: so that if the Fire have not more than a double heat when the Steel is forg'd, it will look just like a piece of burnt Charcoal. The Steel which we call <hi>Damas-Steel</hi> comes from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> call it <hi>Gauherdar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are also some Mines of Gold and Silver in <hi>Persia,</hi> wherein it appears that they have anciently wrought. <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> also try'd again, but found his expence to be more than his profit: whence it is become a Proverb in <hi>Persia, Nokre Kerven dehkrarge nohhassel;</hi> The Silver-Mine of <hi>Kerven,</hi> where they spend ten to get nine. which is the reason that all the Gold and Silver of <hi>Persia</hi> comes out of Forein Countries.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Flowers and Fruits of <hi>Persia,</hi> of Turquoises and Pearls.</head>
                     <p>THE Flowers of <hi>Persia</hi> are nothing comparable to our <hi>European</hi> Flowers, neither for variety nor beauty. For having pass'd the <hi>Tigris</hi> in the Road to <hi>Persia,</hi> you meet with nothing but Roses and Lillies, and some other Fruits peculiar to the Country.</p>
                     <p>As for Roses, they have great store, which they distil, as they do Orange-flowers, and transport the Waters into all the Eastern parts of <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I never left the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> but some of the Lords, especially four of the white Eunuchs, beg'd of me to bring them some Flowers out of <hi>France;</hi> for they have every one a Garden before their Chamber door: and happy is he that can present the King with a Posie of Flowers in a Crystal Flower-Pot.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Persia</hi> Apples, Pears, Oranges, Granates, Prunes, Cherries, Apricots, Quinces, Chesnuts, Medlers, and other sorts of Fruit, which is not generally so well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasted as ours.</p>
                     <p>Their Apricots indeed, especially the lesser sort, are better than ours. When you op'n this Apricot, the Stone cleaves in two, and then the Kernel, which is only a small Skin, as white as Snow, is more pleasing to the tast than if it had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
                     <p>As for their Melons, they are most excellent, and very plentiful, neither is it so dangerous to eat them to excess, as ours. There have been some that have eat'n six and thirty pound in a day, and have never been the worse. There is a prodigious quantity of them sold in <hi>Ispahan;</hi> where they are brought to Market, from midnight 'till four a Clock in the afternoon. Those Melons which are first in season, and are call'd <hi>Guermez,</hi> are insipid, and tast of nothing but Water. However the Physicians advise you to eat them, saying that they plump up the Flesh, and renew the habit of the Body. The next to the <hi>Guermez,</hi> are better than they, and they increase in goodness 'till they come to be quite out of season; the last of which they keep all the Winter long.</p>
                     <p>Though they have such vast plenty, yet they never leave but one Melon upon a stalk, and when it is as big as a Nut, the Gard'ner, or his Wife, or his Children, lye down upon the ground and lick off the Down, which they say keeps the Melon from being sweet, and rip'ning kindly.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have also a particular sort of Quince-Pepin, but not so good as ours, which they fry unpar'd, casting great store of Salt in the Pan to excite thirst, and then present them to their Friends at their Collations. They have also Almonds and Figs, but few Small-nuts or Wall-nuts.</p>
                     <p>Oyl they have none, but in the Provinces of <hi>Mazandran</hi> and <hi>Guilan,</hi> which furnish all the rest of <hi>Persia;</hi> but the Olives are rotten, black, gravelly, and not worth any thing, compar'd with <hi>Provence-</hi>Olives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Armenia, Mengrelia, Georgia,</hi> and <hi>Media</hi> abound in Vineyards. They bury their Vines all the Winter, and take them up again in the Spring by reason of the cold. In the hotter Countries they dress their Vines as we do, without any under-propping them. There are three sorts of Wines in <hi>Persia.</hi> That of <hi>Yesd</hi> is very delicate; that of <hi>Ispahan</hi> but ordinary: that of <hi>Yesd</hi> is transported to <hi>Lar,</hi> where there lives a great number of <hi>Jews,</hi> who care not to live but where they may have good Wine, and that at a cheap rate. It is also carry'd to <hi>Ormus,</hi> where it is sold half in half cheaper than the Wine of <hi>Schiras.</hi> As for the Wine of <hi>Schiras,</hi> it is made of one only Grape, sweet in tast, but which heats the Mouth extremely. This sort of Grape is call'd <hi>Kichmishé;</hi> it is a white Grape, without any stone, as vulgarly believ'd; but however it has a stone, though it be hardly to be perceiv'd; which nevertheless will appear in new Wine, when it frets like a little Ligament. They say that the Wine of <hi>Ispahan</hi> is cold upon the Stomach, but that it fumes into the Head. For its coldness upon the Stomach I can say little, but I know it will warm the Head, if a man takes too much of it. In <hi>Persia</hi> they never keep their Wine in Tuns, but in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106224:90"/>
great earthen Vessels bak'd in an Oven, either glaz'd, or else smear'd over with the fat of a Sheeps rump, stop'd up with wood'n Covers, cover'd over again with a great piece of red Calicut, that lyes over all the lids of the Pots.</p>
                     <p>The King and his Lords have other sorts of Cellars for magnificence, where they treat such as they invite. These are four square Rooms not above three or four steps deep, with a Well in the middle, the floor being spread with <hi>Turkie</hi> Carpets. Now at the four corners of the Well stand four great Bottles containing twenty Pints a piece, the one of White, the other of Claret. Between the great Bottles stands a row of lesser Bottles fill'd, a Bottle of White, and a Bottle of Red. In the Cellar-Wall are several niches one above another, and in every nich a Bottle, still vary'd <hi>Gules</hi> and <hi>Argent;</hi> a very pleasant sight to good Companions in a Room, which is as light as day.</p>
                     <p>As for Herbs and Roots they have very good in <hi>Persia,</hi> but above all, most excellent <hi>Roman</hi> Lettuce. But there is no sort of Pulse, nor can they find a way to make Pease grow among them. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> carry'd Asparagus, Artichoaks, and Succory, which were never seen there before, but now begin to thrive very well.</p>
                     <p>As for Turquoises and Pearls I shall speak thereof in my discourse of Jewels, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of my <hi>Indian</hi> Travels.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Beasts of Service; of the Fish and Fowl of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Beasts for service in <hi>Persia,</hi> are Horses, Mules, Asses, and Camels. The Horses of <hi>Persia</hi> are but of an ordinary stature, less than ours, very narrow before, but very swift and light. They carry their heads very ill in running, by reason of the custom to which the <hi>Persians</hi> use them. For they have got a trick of managing their Horses, yet never getting upon their backs; they teach them to Amble by tying their feet with two Cords of an equal length, to the middle whereof are fasten'd two other Cords that are fasten'd to the Saddle, which two Cords keep their feet so, that they cannot stir but at such a distance; and so they deal with their Mules upon which the old men generally covet to ride. The Horses of <hi>Persia</hi> are very docible, and easily brought up. They give them nothing else from one Evening to another but a Sack full of chopt Straw, with a measure of Barley which they mingle together with the Straw, to the end they may eat both together. When the Barley is newly ear'd, they give it them for fourteen or twenty days together to purge their bodies, as we for the same end put our Horses to Grass in the Spring. The <hi>Persian</hi> Horses hold out very well 'till eighteen or twenty years of age; but they never cut their Stone-Horses in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the Winter, they never take off their Shooes, but only Frost-nail them. Their Furniture is very light and handsomly made. And this is further observ'd, that whereas we keep Goats in our Stables and Inns, the <hi>Persians</hi> keep Hogs.</p>
                     <p>There are two sort of Asses in <hi>Persia.</hi> Those that are bred in the Country only serve to carry burthens; but there are a sort of <hi>Arabian</hi> Asses that are swift and very handsom, excelling in price the common sort of Horses. The Merchants of <hi>Ispahan</hi> keep these Asses in their Country Houses, taking it for a great piece of Grandeur to Ride every Morning to their Shops.</p>
                     <p>Some parts of <hi>Persia</hi> are perplex'd also with wild Beasts, as Lyons, Bears, and Leopards, but there are but very few; nor have we heard that ever they did any great mischief. Porcupines they have also; and I my self saw brought before the King two men, the one of which was Shot through the Thigh, and through the Leg with a Porcupine's Quill. The second was kill'd, the Porcupine having darted his Quill a little above his right Pap through his Brest. As for their Fish, there are an abundance of Carps, Trouts, and Pikes in the River <hi>Aras;</hi> but in all the other Rivers of <hi>Persia</hi> there is but one sort of Fish, which is a kind of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106224:91"/>
Barbel. In the subterranean Channel which they bring to water their fields there is another sort of Fish very plentiful of bones, and as little as can well be eaten.</p>
                     <p>Where the white Mulberies grow by the River side, so soon as they begin to bear fruit, 'tis very good pastime to see the Crabs, as big as the Palm of a man's hand, come out of the River after Sun-set, and climb the trees to eat the fruit, and then by break of day return into the River again. They are delicate food, far beyond Crey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, but a hot provocative Diet, as the Physicians well observe.</p>
                     <p>During the Frost they bring from the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea great store of Salmon or Salmon-Trouts, four or five Foot long. The Province of <hi>Media</hi> is well stor'd with Sturgeon from the mouth of the River <hi>Araxes.</hi> In the same Sea there is a certain Fish like a Carp, which they salt and dry like our Herrings. From the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf comes nothing but Salt-fish, which is transported over all the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Their Fowls are much the same that we have in <hi>Europe,</hi> only I do not remember that I ever saw any Quails in the Country. As for their Pigeons, they fly wild about the Country; but only some which they keep tame in the City, wherewithal to decoy the rest: which is a sport the <hi>Persians</hi> use in hot weather as well as in cold. Now in regard the Christians are not permitted to keep these Pigeons, some of the vulgar sort will turn <hi>Mahometans</hi> to have that liberty. There are above three thousand Pigeon-houses in <hi>Ispahan.</hi> For every man may build a Pigeon-house upon his own Farm, which yet is very rarely done; all the other Pigeon-houses belong to the King, who draws a greater Revenue from the Dung than from the Pigeons: which Dung, as they prepare it, serves to smoak their Melons.</p>
                     <p>Poultrey is very plentiful in <hi>Persia;</hi> and the <hi>Armenians</hi> brought out of <hi>Europe</hi> the way how to fat Capons; the first so fatted they presented to the King, who lik'd them so well, that he order'd that the richest of the <hi>Armenians</hi> should be commanded to provide him such a number every year. There are no Turkeys in all <hi>Asia;</hi> but the <hi>Armenians</hi> trafficking to <hi>Venice</hi> carry'd some from thence, which when the King had tasted, he lik'd so well, that he order'd the <hi>Armenians</hi> to breed him up such a number, and to stock the Kingdom with them. But the <hi>Armenians,</hi> seeing the King would impose a new Tribute of Turkeys as well as Capons, grew negligent, and suffer'd the Chickens to dye as soon as they were hatch'd. Thereupon the <hi>Persians</hi> suspecting the fraud, commanded the <hi>Armenians</hi> to keep the dead Turkeys, that they might be Judges how they came by their deaths: And it was my wonder to see so many young Turkeys hanging against the Walls of some Houses in <hi>Zulpha,</hi> that occasion'd this Story to be told me.</p>
                     <p>All sorts of Water-fowl are as plentiful in <hi>Persia,</hi> as with us.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Frontiers of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> at a certain season of the year are to be seen a great number of Birds, much like to our Owzils. Much about the same time the Corn begins to appear, but then is the ground cover'd with such infinite swarms of Locusts, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> are forc'd to betake themselves to their Processions, and to water the ground with a Water which they fetch a great way off, whereinto the Bodies of several martyr'd Christians were thrown. Three days these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions and waterings of the ground continue, and after that, whether it be that the fore-mention'd Birds do eat the Locusts, or only drive them away, in two or three days the Country is clear of them.</p>
                     <p>As for Birds of prey, the Country wants none, Falcons, Sparrow-haws, Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which the King of <hi>Persia</hi> is very well provided, having above eight hundred belonging to his Game. Some of these Birds are taught to fly at the wild Boar, or wild Ass, or wild Goat; others at Cranes, Herons, wild Geese, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge. The chiefest of which Birds are brought from the Southern Mountains, extending from <hi>Schiras</hi> to the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf.</p>
                     <p>The King takes great delight to hunt the Boar and Hart; and if it come to pass that the Game out-run the Dogs, then they let fly one of their Hawks, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently seizes the head, and while she is continually pecking and disturbing the Beast, the Dogs are presently at his heels. The Hawks are taught to stop like a Horse at full speed: else they would never quit their prey, which they presently do, as soon as ever the Falconer shews them their reward. Now their way of ord'ring or making the Hawk is this. They take the skin of a Hart, head, body, and legs, and stuff it with Straw, to the end it may be like the Beast which they intend to represent in the nature of a Quarry. When they have set it in the place
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106224:91"/>
where they usually train up the Hawk, they lay meat upon the head, or in the holes of the eyes, to the end the Bird may be sure to seize those parts at his down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Being accustom'd to feed in this manner for some days together, they fix the Beast upon a Plank with four Wheels, and cause it to be drawn with long Cords by certain men, that mend their pace ev'ry day, 'till at length it is drawn by a Horse at full speed, whereby the Bird is accustom'd by degrees not to forsake her prey. After the same manner they counterfeit all other sorts of Quarrys to enter their Hawks, as well wild Boars, wild Asses, as Hares and Foxes. Some there are that will order a Crow with the same industry as you would make a Hawk. They have have also a certain Beast which they call <hi>Once,</hi> which has a spotted skin like a Tiger, but which is nevertheless very gentle and tame; this a Horse-man will carry behind him, and when he sees a wild Goat, he sets down the <hi>Once,</hi> which is so nimble, that in three leaps he will be upon the back of the wild Goat; though the wild Goat be a very swift Creature. The <hi>Once</hi> immediately strangles him with his sharp teeth. But if by accident the wild Goat get from him, the <hi>Once</hi> will stand still in the same place abash'd and troubl'd, so that an Infant may take him and kill him, without the least resistance made in his own defence.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> take great delight in Hunting, and in that sport it is that they love to shew themselves magnificent: Insomuch that <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> desirous to treat all the Ambassadors then at his Court, which at that time were the <hi>Tartarian, Muscovite,</hi> and <hi>Indian,</hi> carry'd them along with him into the field, and having tak'n a great number of Harts, Fallow-dear, Hinds, and wild Boars, he caus'd them all to be made ready to be eat'n the same day: And while he was feasting, an Architect had order to raise a Pyramid of the heads of those Beasts in the middle of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> of which there are some remains to this day. When the Architect had rais'd it to a considerable height, he came very pleasantly to the King, and told him he wanted nothing but one head of some great Beast to finish the Work. The King, whether in his Wine, or to shew the Ambassadors how absolute he was over his Subjects, turning briskly toward the Architect; <hi>Thou say'st well,</hi> said he, <hi>nor do I know where to meet with a Head more proper than thy own.</hi> Thereupon the miserable Architect was forc'd to submit his own Head, the King's Command being presently put in execution.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the manner of Building in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN regard there is little Wood or Stone in <hi>Persia,</hi> all the Cities, except some Houses, are generally built of Earth; but of an earthen, or rather a kind of Potter's Clay, so well wrought, that you may cut it like Turf, being wrought to a just consistency. The Walls are made with lays of Earth, according to the proportion intended, and between every lay of Earth, three Foot high, two or three rows of Bricks bak'd in the Sun. These Bricks are made in a square Mold three singers thick, and seven or eight inches broad: and for fear they should cleave with drying in the Sun, they lay over them pounded Straw to keep them from chopping in the heat. They never lay the second Lay 'till the first be dry, nor is the second Lay to be so broad as the lowermost. Those Buildings which are made of Brick bak'd in the Sun are very handsom; and after the Wall is rais'd, the Mason plaisters it over with a Morter made of Potter's Clay mingled with Straw; so that the defects of the Building being cover'd, the Wall appears very firm and close. Then the Work-man plaisters the Morter over again with a Lime mixt with <hi>Muscovy-</hi>Green, which he pounds with a certain Gum, to render the Lime more glutinous: and then rubbing the Wall over with a course Brush, it becomes as it were damask'd and silver'd, and looks like Marble. The poor are contented with only bare Walls, or some course daubing that costs little. The middle of the House consists of a large <hi>Portico,</hi> twenty or thirty Foot square; and in the middle of the <hi>Portico</hi> a Fountain full of Water. It is all open upon one side; and from the <hi>Portico</hi> to the Pond or
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106224:92"/>
Fountain all cover'd with Carpets. At every corner of the <hi>Portico</hi> is a Room to sit and take the fresh Air; and behind another large Room, the floor whereof is spread with Carpets, Mattresses, and Cushions, according to the quality of the Master of the House. Upon the two sides of the <hi>Portico</hi> are two other Chambers, and doors to go from one Chamber to another: and thus are the Houses of the great Lords built, but only they are more spacious. For their Houses consist of four great Parlours, that look toward the our corners of the World, and every Parlour has two Chambers upon each side, which make eight Chambers, that surround a great Hall in the middle. The King's Palace is also built after the same fashion: and generally the <hi>Persian</hi> Houses are very low, it being a rare thing to see one three Stories high. Yet all their Chambers and Rooms are arch'd, wherein the <hi>Persian</hi> exceeds us. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all that trouble and time that we spend, they will presently raise an Arch so broad and high as easily demonstrates the skill of the Work-man. The tops of their Houses are flat and terrass'd; being plaster'd with Earth mixt with Straw chopt very small, and well temper'd; which they bind together with a layer of Lime beat'n for seven days together, which makes it as hard as Marble, and if they want Lime, they pave the Terrass with square Tiles bak'd in an Oven, so that the Rain can do no harm. But they are very careful to shovel off the Snow, for fear it crack the Terrass with lying. Without the Houses show nothing, but within they are curiously painted with Birds and Flowers, wherein the <hi>Persians</hi> are no bad Artists. They take great delight to have several little Chambers, with several Doors, and Lattice-windows, the quarrels whereof are of Glass of various colours. This sort of glazing serves generally, and indeed more properly, for the Apartments where the Women may come. For they might have Crystal-windows if they pleas'd, but they glaze the void spaces in this manner, that their Women may not be seen; after they have fram'd the op'n place that gives light, like a Flower-Pot with several Flowers in it, which the Glass of several colours imitates to the life; whereby it is impossible that the Windows should be peer'd through; besides, that it is pleasant to the Eye. The Doors of their Houses are of <hi>Tchinar-</hi>Wood, which is very noble, and their Wainscoting is as neat. The <hi>Persians</hi> that love ostentation, always display their rich Carpets, Mattresses, Cushions, Coverlets, and all the most costly Furniture they have, in the fore part of their dwellings: For the <hi>Haram,</hi> or the Women's Quarter is but meanly adorn'd, in regard they are never visited by any men but their Husbands. In some of their Rooms they have very narrow Chimnies; for the <hi>Persians</hi> set all their Wood upright which they burn, because of the Smoak; besides, they make but small Fires, in regard they have so great a scarcity of Wood. When they would go to sleep, they lye down upon a Plank cover'd with a Carpet, and wrap themselves in a quilted Blanket. In the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they sleep in the open Air, upon their Terrasses; and in regard the Women lye there too, there is an order obtain'd, that the <hi>Moullahs</hi> that sing upon the <hi>Mosquèes</hi> shall not presume to go up in the morning, because it might be their hap to see the Women as they lay; it being one of the highest pieces of infamy imaginable for a Woman to be discover'd with her Face op'n.</p>
                     <p>There are some Houses that belong to great Lords, that have a square place before their Doors, where they that come to visit them may put their Horses, to the end the Street should not be pester'd. If you look upon the Front of their Houses, there is little ornament to be seen, unless it be upon some which have been lately built.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> A Description of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> the chief City of the Kingdom and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the King of <hi>Persia.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>ISpahan, Sphahan,</hi> or <hi>Sphaon,</hi> as the <hi>Persians</hi> pronounce it, which some Travellers have too unwarily affirm'd to be a fine City, lyes in the Province of <hi>Hierac,</hi> which composes some part of the ancient Kingdom of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> It is the Capital City of all <hi>Persia,</hi> and a very large place, where the King usually keeps his Court. The Records of the <hi>Persians</hi> declare that formerly it was two contiguous Towns, one
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106224:92"/>
part whereof belong'd to <hi>Haider,</hi> and the other to <hi>Neamed-Olahi,</hi> two parts of <hi>Ispahan</hi> still retaining those two names, which has occasion'd great quarrels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates among the people, while they have both been eager to prefer their own quarter. Nor indeed could <hi>Ispahan</hi> be accompted other than a Village, before <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> had conquer'd the Kingdoms of <hi>Lar</hi> and <hi>Ormus.</hi> But then observing so fair a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he might as well be near the Provinces which he had newly conquer'd, as for the design which he had to extend his Dominions to the East and West, as he had enlarg'd them to the South, he quitted <hi>Casbin</hi> and <hi>Sultany</hi> to reside at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> as in the center of his Empire.</p>
                     <p>This City is seated in a vast plain, which extends it self three ways fifteen or twenty Leagues. Upon the South about two Leagues from <hi>Ispahan</hi> rises a very high Mountain, on the top whereof toward the West are to be seen the remains of a very strong Fortress, where <hi>Darius</hi> kept himself, when <hi>Alexander</hi> gave Battle to him in that Plain. In the side of the Rock is a <hi>Grotto,</hi> either natural or artificial, or both, out of which issues a natural Spring of excellent Water, where a <hi>Dervis</hi> usually inhabits.</p>
                     <p>The Circuit of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> taking the Suburbs all in, is not much less than that of <hi>Paris;</hi> but the number of Inhabitants is ten times greater at <hi>Paris</hi> than at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Nor is it a wonder that a City should be so large and yet so ill peopl'd, where every Family has its particular House, and every House its particular Garden. What ever way you come to it you may discover first the Towers of the <hi>Mosquees,</hi> and then the Trees that environ the Houses, so that <hi>Ispahan</hi> seems rather a Forrest than a City. The Plain being fertile is well inhabited, but there are no Villages in it, only three or four Houses in a place together.</p>
                     <p>The Walls of <hi>Ispahan</hi> are of Earth, to which do belong some pittiful Towers without Battlements or Platforms, Bastions or Redoubts, or any other Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Moats also are as bad, neither broad nor deep, but always dry. In some places also the people have beaten down great gaps in the Wall, to get the nearest way into the City; yet they reckon ten Gates, which are but of Earth however, and of no defence; the chief of which are <hi>Der-Vasalsehab,</hi> not far from the King's Palace, <hi>Der-Tokshi, Der-Mark, Der-Vasal-Lembon, Der-Nasan-Abad, Der-Sha,</hi> and <hi>Der-Dekt.</hi> The Gates are made of Planks rudely joyn'd together, and cover'd with plates of Iron four fingers broad, and as thick as a Crown, fasten'd with flat-headed Nails. The Keys are never carry'd to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but left with a silly Porter that op'ns and shuts the Gates as he pleases himself; for indeed there is no necessity of shutting the Gates when there are so many other ways into the City.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Ispahan</hi> is ill laid out; for the Streets are narrow and unequal, and for the most part dark, because of the Arches that go from one House to another, so that a man is forc'd sometimes to feel his way for two hundred paces. Moreover the Streets are many times annoy'd with Loads of Ordure and the Carcasses of dead Beasts, which cause a most filthy stench, and would be very infectious certainly, but for the wholesomness of the Air. In the most part of the Streets are Wells, which are stop'd up in Summer, and open'd in the Winter to carry away the Rain and the Snow into the Arch'd Channels which run under Ground through the middle of the Street. There are also before every Door certain Troughs to receive the filth and ordure of every Family, which the Country-men come and carry away to Dung their Grounds. Every morning the Country-man comes with his Ass to lade Dung; and it is observable that he is more diligent to carry away the Dung of the <hi>Armenians, Franks,</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> that drink Wine, than of the <hi>Persians</hi> that drink none. And this is the profit of the Servants of the House that sell an Asses Load of Dung for five, and sometimes for ten or twelve <hi>Kasbeshé.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Streets of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> as of all the rest of the Cities of <hi>Persia</hi> are not pav'd, which makes them very incommodious both Summer and Winter. For in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the dust puts out your Eyes, unless it be in the Streets where the great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants live, and about the <hi>Meydan,</hi> where there are people hir'd to water the Streets Morning, Noon, and Night. Those people go about the Streets also with a <hi>Boracho</hi> full of Water, and a Glass, with Ice in a Bag, to give them drink that desire it: Nor do they take any money, being paid out of the Legacies left by persons deceased for that purpose. In the Winter this dust turns to mire half
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106224:93"/>
the leg deep; though it be very true that there are very few people to be seen then in the Street; for in regard of the vaulted Channels that run through every Street, should the soak'd Earth chance to fail under the Horse, it might endanger a Limb. Besides, the <hi>Persians</hi> are so superstitious, that they will hardly receive a man within their doors with a spot of Dirt upon his Cloathes, for fear of being defil'd by him.</p>
                     <p>You shall also meet with little Holes against the Walls of the Houses in the op'n Street, where the <hi>Persians</hi> are not asham'd to squat and Piss in the face of all the World. If there be any running Water in the Street, they take a little in their Hands and wash their Member with it; or if there be no Water, they rub it against a Stone or the Wall, which they take for a great piece of gentility and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</p>
                     <p>That which farther contributes to the nastiness of the Streets of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> is, that the Butchers throw the Blood and Excrements of the Beasts which they kill into the Streets. If a Horse or a Mule, a Camel or an Ass dye, they presently throw him into the Street. True it is, that there are people who come presently to buy it of the Owner; who make <hi>Harissé,</hi> which they sell to the poor Work-men. This <hi>Harissé</hi> is thus prepar'd; they boyl the flesh of the dead Beast with Corn, and after it is well boyl'd they mash it together, 'till it becomes like a Pottage. They also make <hi>Harissé</hi> of good Mutton; both which sorts they sell in the Market-place, or great <hi>Meydan</hi> of the City.</p>
                     <p>Though the City of <hi>Ispahan</hi> be dirty, yet there is a way for persons of ability to avoid it; for they never stir but on Horse-back, with two or three Lackeys, call'd <hi>Chatres,</hi> that run before to make room. For the Men are all upon the false Gallop in the Streets, without any fear of hurting the Children: by reason that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not suffer'd to play in the Streets like ours, but as soon as ever they come from School, they sit down by their Parents, to be instructed by them in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Valets</hi> or Foot-men make a Trade of Running; of which the King and the Lords have several in their service; it being a piece of grandeur to keep a great many. They serve from Father to Son, undergoing an Apprentiship in Running. From six to seven years of age, they only set themselves to walk slowly. The next year they run a League at a time upon a handsom trot, the next year after they run two or three Leagues, and so proportionably for the rest. At eighteen years of age they are allow'd a Scrip of Flowr, with a flat piece of Copper to bake their Bread upon, and a Bottle of Water; all which they carry about them when they run. For these people when they are sent Post never take the <hi>Caravan-</hi>Road, but the shortest cuts through the Deserts, and must therefore accustom themselves to carry their Provision. The King and the Lords have no <hi>Chatres,</hi> but what are Masters; which degree they are not to arrive at without some Ceremony and performing a Race, like our <hi>Jemmy</hi> and the Butcher of <hi>Croyden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If he be a Lord that owns the <hi>Chater</hi> who desires to be a Master, he sends for all his Friends, sets up a Scaffold in the <hi>Meydan,</hi> provides a Collation, and sends for the Curtisans to divert the Company. Now there is not one of these Guests that does not bring something to give this <hi>Chater</hi> after the Race is run, either a Bonnet or a Girdle, or some other thing, part of which the <hi>Chater</hi> gives to his fellows. Then the <hi>Chater</hi> appears with his Legs greas'd, his Thighs bare, only a slight short pair of loose Breeches, and a Girdle with three little Bells hanging upon his Belly. Thus accouter'd he starts from <hi>Ali-Capi,</hi> and between Sun-rising and Sun-setting he runs backward and forward to a Stone a League and a half from the City toward the Mountains; running in that time six and thirty of our common Leagues, or a hundred and eight Miles. While he runs, there is <hi>Kourouk</hi> in the <hi>Meydan,</hi> and upon all the Road where he runs, and three or four Horse-men that continually ride to and fro, to see that there be no deceit in the <hi>Chater</hi>'s Race; who when he approaches near the City, ride before to give notice of his coming. Every time he starts and returns, the Drums and Trumpets sound; at the end of the Race there stand several persons with Arrows in their Hands, and ev'ry time he comes to the Stone they give him an Arrow, which he carries back every course to <hi>Ali-Capri.</hi> Every time he returns, the Curtisans rub him and make much of him. All the time he runs, he eats nothing, but drinks Sherbet now and then. If he acquit himself
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106224:93"/>
well, which appears by the number of Arrows brought back, he is admitted a Master by the approbation of the King's Foot-men, who are superior to all the rest. The <hi>Kans</hi> or Governours of Provinces run their own <hi>Chaters</hi> with the same Ceremonies, and in the same manner.</p>
                     <p>The Fortress of <hi>Ispahan</hi> is nothing at all considerable. It joyns to the Wall upon the South side of the City, and is twice as long as broad, but without any defence in the world, unless it be of some pitiful Towers made of Earth. Here it is that the King keeps all the Rarities which he has purchas'd, or that has been presented to him. For as to his main Treasure, I believe it consists chiefly in Gold-Plate. Within the Fortress there is a large Field, sow'd every year with Rice and Corn; hard by which stands the House of the <hi>Capuchin-</hi>Friars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ispahan</hi> in general, unless it be the <hi>Meydan</hi> and some few arch'd Streets where the Merchants live, is more like a great Village than a City; the Houses standing at a distance one from the other, with every one a Garden, but ill look'd after, not having any thing in it perchance but only one pitiful Tree: true it is that they begin to build better of late days, but it is without the City. As for the Women, 'tis not a pin matter whether they live out of the City or within, in regard they never stir out of doors, and as seldom go a-foot.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Meydan</hi> or great <hi>Piazza</hi> of <hi>Ispahan</hi> was the contrivance of the great <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> who had never done it, if a great Prince of the ancient Race of the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> had not refus'd him the old <hi>Meydan,</hi> with several Priviledges, and the House that stood by it. Thereupon he design'd this new <hi>Piazza,</hi> to draw off the Merchants, and to spoil the old Market-place, by their departure from that quarter of the City which is less inhabited at this day. It is not far from this old <hi>Meydan,</hi> that the <hi>Austin-Friars</hi> on the one side, and the <hi>Carmelites</hi> on the other have their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. There are also two sides of that <hi>Meydan</hi> entire, under the <hi>Portico's,</hi> where sit only such people as sell Herbs, Fruit, and Victuals; the other two sides are almost faln to decay; but when it was all standing, it was as handsom as the new one: and it is to be wonder'd, that the Prince, who built it, did not choose the place where <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> has built his, as being near the Water, and consequently far more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Meydan</hi> then is a place about seven hundred Paces long, and between two and three hundred broad. It has Buildings upon all the four sides; it lyes in length directly North and South; the Fronts are every one Portico'd, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rass'd at the top; and on the City-side are little Chambers nine or ten Foot high, which fall very much to decay, being only built of Brick bak'd in the Sun. They are inhabited, the greatest part of them, by the most infamous Curtisans of the City. At some Paces distance from the <hi>Portico's,</hi> is a Channel which is pav'd with stone, and runs round about the <hi>Piazza; Sha-Abas</hi> caus'd several Trees to be planted by the side of it, but both the Channel and the Trees being altogether neglected, are faln to decay; besides, that the smell of the Water in the Summer time is very noysom.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of the <hi>Piazza</hi> stands a kind of a May-Pole, or Mast of a Ship, where the people exercise shooting at Birds. When the King comes to shoot, they set a Cup of Gold upon the top of the Mast, which he is to strike down with an Arrow. To which purpose he must ride full speed, nor is he permitted to shoot 'till after he has past the May-Pole, turning himself upon the crupper of his Horse: a remain of the ancient custom of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> that kill'd their Enemies flying.</p>
                     <p>The Cup belongs to him that strikes it down; and I have seen <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> Grandfather of the present King, in five Courses strike down three Cups.</p>
                     <p>From this Mast or May-Pole down to the great <hi>Mosquee,</hi> they sell nothing but Wood and Charcoal: from the same Pole to the Sun-Dial upon the North-side, are none but such as sell old Iron-Tools, old Harness for Horses, old Coverlets, and other old Brokery-ware, as in our <hi>Long-Lane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Pole to another <hi>Mosquee,</hi> to the South, just against the Sun-Dial, is the place for all the Poulterers. The rest of the <hi>Piazza</hi> toward the Palace, is always kept clean, without any Shops, because the King comes often abroad in the Evening to see Lions, Bears, Bulls, Rams, Cocks, and all other sort of Creatures fight which are brought thither.</p>
                     <p>The people of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> as in many other Cities, are divided into two parts, the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106224:94"/>
one call'd <hi>Hedari,</hi> the other <hi>Nametlai;</hi> and upon all the Combats of Beasts before-mention'd, there are always very considerable Wagers laid between these two Tribes. The King, who is a neuter, gives to the Master of the Beast that gets the upper hand sometimes five, sometimes ten, sometimes twenty <hi>Tomans,</hi> according to the value of the Wager laid; and he that wins the Wager, presents the Master of the the Beast likewise. They have also a Sport at breaking of Eggs, by knocking the ends one against another, some of which Eggs come to three or four Crowns. The Hens that lay them are bred in a Country which they call <hi>Sausevare,</hi> about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> toward the Province of <hi>Karason;</hi> the Cocks of which Country are bigger and stronger than other Cocks, and cost some of them a hundred Crowns. There are a sort of Tumblers also, that after Dinner set up their Stages in the <hi>Meydan,</hi> and toward the Evening, they that play the <hi>Maid-Marians</hi> come and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass a square place with a course piece of Calicut; and then through another very fine Cloth, the Wenches shew a thousand tumbling Tricks and antick Postures. When they have done, they come and ask the Spectators for Money, who give them every one what they think fit. Every Friday, which is as it were Market-day, the Country-folks bring to Town what they have made in the Villages, as Doors and Windows fitted to be hung up, Window-frames, Locks, and other things of that nature. Upon that day also they sell Mules, Horses, Camels, and Asses, which brings a great confluence of people from all parts.</p>
                     <p>Upon the West side, where stands the Gate of the Palace, and <hi>Ali</hi>'s Gate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Canal and the <hi>Portico's</hi> are rang'd some seventy Pieces of Cannon upon, their Carriages. These Guns, together with the Sun-Dial, were brought from <hi>Ormus</hi> by the Great <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> of which the <hi>English</hi> ought to have had their share; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their assistance he never could have tak'n the Town.</p>
                     <p>From the corner of that Front, which touches upon the Eastern Front of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> in the middle, are all Sadlers Shops; and from that <hi>Mosquee</hi> to another corner that touches upon the Western Front, live the Book-sellers, Book-binders, and Trunk-makers. In the middle of the Southern Front stands a Portal, with a Tower upon each side, which leads to a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> the Gate whereof is cover'd all over with Plates of Silver, and is certainly the neatest Portal and fairest Entrance into any <hi>Mosquee</hi> of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the other end of the same Front, where it joyns to that upon the West, there is a great Portal that leads to a false Gate of the King's Palace; near to which, as soon as you are enter'd, you meet with the Apartment of the Great Treasurer, who is a white Eunuch, and having the Keys of the Chamber where the Money lyes, takes care to pay what-ever the King orders him. Through that false Gate all the King's Provisions are carry'd into the Palace. This way also enter they that are entertain'd for the Manufactury of the King's Tissues, Silks, Sattins, Coverlets, and the like. In the same Enclosure also the <hi>Franks,</hi> who are under the King's Wages, and live at <hi>Zulpha,</hi> come every day to work; as also all the most particular and eminent Artists that the King hires.</p>
                     <p>The Western Front, which makes one of the two lengths of the <hi>Meydan,</hi> is thus appointed; from the Southern angle that touches the Trunk-maker's quarter, live all your Pedlers that sell all the small Commodities of <hi>Norimberg</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the King's Palace, I cannot make any handsom description of it, in regard there is nothing of Beauty either in the Building or in the Gardens. I think I have been as far in the House as a man could go, every time I was sent for by His Majesty; but excepting only four Rooms which they call <hi>Divans,</hi> I saw nothing but pitiful low Galleries, and so narrow that hardly two men could pass a-brest in 'em. In one of those Galleries I had audience of the King, in the Garment of Honour which he had bestow'd upon me. But in regard I have spok'n of two of them in another place, and that the other two are much alike both Building and Furniture, I shall say no more of them here.</p>
                     <p>From the King's Palace Gate to <hi>Haly</hi>'s Gate live the Goldsmiths, Lapidaries, and Gravers of Stones for Seals: <hi>Haly</hi>'s Gate is a plain Gate, naked of Work; of which I have already spok'n.</p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Haly</hi>'s Gate, and the other angle of the same Western Front, stands a great Gate which leads into a <hi>Bazar,</hi> where all the <hi>Armenians</hi> that live at <hi>Zulfa</hi> keep their Shops, and sell all sorts of Cloth that comes out of <hi>Europe,</hi> and other the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106224:94"/>
choicest Wares of <hi>Persia.</hi> At the end of that <hi>Bazar</hi> stands a fair Inn two Stories high, which the Mother of <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the second caus'd to be built. In the middle stands a great Fountain with four great Gates, which lead into four other Inns. Here by the way let me give a Traveller and a Trader in <hi>Persia</hi> this advice; that if his Goods be not very heavy, he never hire a low Chamber, as being three times dearer than those above: For the Chambers which the Sun lies upon most in the Summer, are the Chambers which cost least. Not but all the Chambers in the Inn are Tax'd at the same rate by the King; but the Host for his profit will find some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or other to raise his price, pretending those Chambers be hir'd already which you desire, especially if they be corner Chambers, which are the largest and most commodious. And indeed without this collusion Chambers would be very cheap. The best convenience of those Inns is, that a man is more secure in one of them then in a private House: For there if it happ'n that a piece of Goods be stol'n; or that your Chapman prove insolvent for Goods bought, the Inn-keeper is to make all good; being by the Law to receive so many blows a day 'till he pays the sum demanded. The Merchant also gives two in the hundred for every thing that he sells, and when the Market is done they presently go to the Host, who sets down in his Book the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Goods, and the names both of buyer and seller. If he knows not the buyer, he is bound to go and enquire after him, and if he be not solvent, the Merchant takes his Goods again. Sometimes the Merchant to save the two in the hundred, combines with the Purchaser to carry away some of his Goods without the knowledge of the Host, which is done by greasing his Deputies fist, who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently shut his Eyes. But then if the Purchaser proves insolvent, the Merchant dares not complain, because his Goods are not Register'd in the King's Book, whom he has defrauded of his Custom.</p>
                     <p>No less secure are the <hi>Bazars</hi> or Market-places, where the Merchants shut up their Shops very slightly, the <hi>Bazars</hi> being strongly guarded both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all night long. As for the petty Stalls in the <hi>Meydan,</hi> every one puts up his Ware in a Box Padlock'd up, and then lay them down at one end of the place one by another. As for the course sort of Ware, as Tents, Cords, Ropes, and such other things they only heap them under a large Coverlet fasten'd at the four corners by four sticks, for the <hi>Meydan</hi> also is as strongly guarded as the <hi>Bazar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Haly</hi>'s Gate and that which leads to the <hi>Bazar</hi> where the <hi>Armenians</hi> keep their Shops, live all those that deal in <hi>Russia</hi> Leather, making <hi>Borachio's</hi> to tye under the Horses Bellies, little Buckets, and Furniture for Horse-men, as also Bowyers, Fletchers, and Forbishers. From the last Gate to the end of the Gallery, live all the Druggists and Apotheearies.</p>
                     <p>At the Angle upon the two fronts upon the East and North, there is a Gate that leads to the Great <hi>Bazar;</hi> next to that live only your Sails-men that sell whole Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits for men, as Shirts, Sheets, Hose, and the like. There be also those that sell Leather Shooes for men and women; which Shooes are always worn by persons of quality.</p>
                     <p>Out of this <hi>Bazar</hi> you go into another full of men that work in Copper, such as make Pots, Plates, and other Utensils for the Kitchin. Here also live those that make Files, and the blades of Sythes. The rest of the <hi>Bazar</hi> is possess'd by Dyers of Calicut; and at the end of the <hi>Bazar</hi> is a fair Inn, where all the Merchants live that sell Musk, <hi>Russia</hi> Leather, and Furrs.</p>
                     <p>I have in another place observ'd that the King has a great Revenue out of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> and Inns which he has caus'd to be built, which is particularly laid out in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for his Table. For the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> forbidding Princes to impose Taxes or Customs upon the people, they do not believe that the money which arises from thence is fit to be employ'd or laid out for the necessaries of life, believing that their food so purchas'd would do them no good. By virtue of this prohibition of <hi>Mahomet</hi> it is, that the Merchants take all the liberty they can to deceive the King of his Customs, believing that they cannot offend the Prince, while they transgress not the Law. Besides, that if they should pay all the King's Duties, the price of Goods would rise so high, so as to spoil the whole Course of Trade and Commerce. Neither would the Revenue of the <hi>Caravansera's, Bazars,</hi> and Gardens suffice for the Kings Kitchin, were not the several <hi>Kans</hi> or Governours of Provinces oblig'd to supply that expence every Week in their turns, whereby those expences cost the King little or nothing.</p>

Upon the North-Front of the <hi>Meydan,</hi> are made under the <hi>Portico's</hi> separations for Chambers, that look upon the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where people go to smoak Tobacco and drink Coffee. The Seats of those Rooms are plac'd as in so many Amphitheaters, and in the midst of every one stands a large Vessel full of running Water, wherewith their Pipes be cleans'd when they are over-fowl. All the <hi>Persians</hi> that haveany spare time, fail not every day to resort to those places between seven and eight in the Morning, where the Owner of the Room presently brings them every one their Pipe and their Dish of Coffee. But the Great <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> who was a man of a great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, finding those places were only so many Meeting-houses, where men assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd to talk and prattle of State-affairs, a thing which no way pleas'd him; to break the neck of those petty Cabals, he order'd that a <hi>Moullah</hi> should be sure to be betimes at every place before the rest of the people came thither, and that he should entertain those Tobacco-whiffers, and Coffee-quaffers, sometimes with a Point of the Law, sometimes with History, sometimes with Poetry. This custom is still observ'd: so that after this entertainment has lasted two or three hours, the <hi>Moullah</hi> rising up, crys to every one in the Coffee-Room, <hi>Come my Masters, in good time, let's all now retire every man to his business.</hi> Straight every one retires upon the <hi>Moullah</hi>'s words, who is liberally entertain'd all the while by the Society.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of the North-Front stands a great Portal, with a large Dial over it, which <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> brought from <hi>Ormus</hi> when he took it from the <hi>Portugals.</hi> But the Dial is of no use, nor is ever like to be. Round the Tower of that Portal runs an op'n Gallery, with a kind of a Cieling over head supported with Pillars; from whence every Evening about Sun-set, and at Midnight, a noise of Drums and Trumpets is to be heard through the whole City. Though the truth is, the Musick would never charm a curious Ear. Out of some parts of the Gallery are contriv'd little Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, where the chiefest of the Court lye. In all the Cities where the <hi>Kans</hi> reside is the custom of making this ratling noise of Drums and Trumpets observ'd, and not elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>On each side of the Portal, under the Horologe, are five or six Banks of Jewellers, who there put to sale certain parcels of Pearls, Emralds, Granats, and Turquoises, which are not of any great value: every parcel being set by it self in a Dish, and the whole Stall cover'd with a silk Net, to preserve the Stones from being stoln.</p>
                     <p>Just against the same Portal, going toward the South-Front, you meet with two little Goals five or six Foot high, and sev'n or eight distant one from the other. Here the men play at Pall-mall on horse-back, the Horse-man being to strike the Ball run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at full speed, between the two Goals.</p>
                     <p>Through that Portal you enter into an Enclosure much like the place where the Fair of St. <hi>Germans</hi> is kept, and there it is that the Merchants of Gold and Silver-Tissues and other rich Stuffs, with all your finest sorts of Calicuts and Linnens, keep their Shops.</p>
                     <p>The Court side of the <hi>Meydan,</hi> which is upon the East, and which answers to the grand Front where the King's House stands, is thus appointed. In the middle stands a <hi>Duomo</hi> cover'd with a kind of bak'd Earth, and as well the <hi>Duomo</hi> as the Portal, which is very high, are all varnish'd over. You ascend nine or ten steps, the Port of <hi>Haly</hi> facing it on the other side of the <hi>Piazza.</hi> From the end of the <hi>Portico's</hi> that touch the North side of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> live the Shop-keepers that sell sowing-Silk, and small Manufactures of Silk, as Ribands, Laces, Garters, and other things of the same nature. From the <hi>Mosquee</hi> to the other end, are all Turners, that make Cradles for Children, and Spinning-Wheels. There are also some Cotton-beaters, that make quilted Coverlets. Without the <hi>Portico's</hi> are none but Smiths, that make Scyths, Hammers, Pincers, Nails, and such like things; with some few Cutlers.</p>
                     <p>This is all that can be said of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and that great <hi>Piazza,</hi> which some perhaps have set out in better colours. But I have represented all things as they are, as being one that have seen them oftner, and beheld them a longer time than ever any <hi>Frank</hi> that Travel'd into <hi>Asia.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of</hi> Zulpha, <hi>a little City, separated from</hi> Ispahan <hi>by the River</hi> Senderou.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ZUlpha,</hi> which others call <hi>Julpha</hi> and <hi>Giolpha,</hi> is distant from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South half an hours walk, the River <hi>Scnderou</hi> running almost at an equal distance between the two Cities. The way that leads from one City to another is a Walk some fifteen hundred Paces long, and seventy broad, almost equally divided by the River. It begins from a Pavilion or Tabernacle forty Foot square, which joyns to the hinder part of the King's House, with a double Story, to which several Windows give light, clos'd with wooden Lattices very artificially wrought. None but the King and his Houshold pass that way into the Walk. For they that go from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Zulpha,</hi> find the way into the Walk through a Gate which is close adjoyning to the Tabernacle. This Walk is call'd the Street of <hi>Tcharbag,</hi> or the Street of <hi>Four Gardens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Channel runs all along the Walk from the Tabernacle, where a little Rivulet falls into it, and fills it as far as the great Bridge. The two sides of the Channel which are pav'd with Stone, and are two or three Foot broad, make one way, which Passengers may, and many times do take; for the usual way both for Horse and Foot, lyes upon each side of the Walk, behind the Trees, which are planted in a streight line to the very Walls of the King's Gardens, which close the Alley on each side. It is a kind of a Causey of Free-stone, somewhat rais'd, and four or five Foot broad. There is but one row of Trees on each side, straight and high, call'd <hi>Tchinards,</hi> with one tuft at the top. The space between the Channel and the Trees is not pav'd, but lyes common, and is sometimes sow'd. About two hundred Paces from the Tabernacle or Banqueting-house, the River falls into a great Pool, about thirty or thirty-five Foot in diameter; and in that place, as also in others somewhat beyond it, where there are also other Pools, the Walk is cross'd by a Causey pav'd and rais'd, ten or twelve Foot broad, as the rest are. Upon the left hand of the first Pool stands another Tabernacle or Banqueting-house, much alike in structure and bigness to the former; in which place, in a low arch'd Room with a Fountain of Water in the middle, you may go and drink Coffee. From that House to the Bridge the Walk descends, and the Water makes some falls.</p>
                     <p>All the Gardens on each side of the Walk, both on this side and beyond the Bridge, belong to the King. But you must not imagin that these Gardens, or that of <hi>Hezardgerib,</hi> which is the fairest of all <hi>Persia,</hi> are so curiously set out, nor so well kept as ours in <hi>Europe.</hi> For they have no such lovely Borders, nor such close Walks of Honeysuckles and Jasmin as are to be seen in the Gardens of <hi>Europe.</hi> They suffer the Grass to grow in many places; contented only with a good many great Fruit-trees, tufted a-top, and planted in a line, which is all the grace of the Gardens of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In each side of the Walls between which the Walk runs, at a true distance of space, are gates neatly contriv'd, and over each a little Room. Almost in the middle of the Walk between the great Banqueting-house and the Bridge, upon the left hand, stands a House of the <hi>Dervi's,</hi> to whom the King has giv'n one of his Gardens to build upon. There they keep the Rellcks of <hi>Haly,</hi> or some other Prophet; for you shall see them standing under a certain Arch, before which the <hi>Persians</hi> make a most profound Reverence. These <hi>Dervi's</hi> come every Afternoon about three or four a Clock into the <hi>Bazars</hi> of <hi>Ispahan;</hi> every two, an old one and a young one, choosing his quarter. They go from Shop to Shop, instructing the People upon some Point or other of the Law: the young <hi>Dervi's</hi> answering the old ones at certain times. Their Habit is only two Sheep-skins or Goat-skins, the one hanging before, the other behind, with a great leathern Girdle, four or five fingers broad, garnish'd with several great Plates of Latten. They throw another Sheep-skin cross their Shoulders, which they tye before, under their Chins. Upon their Heads they only wear a little Lamb-skin in form of a Bonnet, letting the feet hang down to their Necks,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106224:96"/>
over their Cheeks. They carry a great Club in their hands, as the Painters represent <hi>John the Baptist</hi> in the Wilderness. Between their girdles and their wasts they stuff a company of pittiful Flowers, or else a sort of Herbs, which after Exhortation, both the young and the old <hi>Dervi's</hi> bestow upon the Merchants and Tradesmen, from whom at the same time they receive Alms. Toward the Evening they go home again; and I forgot to tell you, that before the door of the House stands always a large Vessel of Water with several little Cups, and Ice in the Summer, where all passengers may drink upon free-cost.</p>
                     <p>The River of <hi>Senderou,</hi> which as well as the rest of the Rivers of <hi>Persia,</hi> except the <hi>Aras,</hi> is not able to carry a Boat, is a very great relief to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Behind the Mountains of the South beyond <hi>Zulfa</hi> is another River, call'd <hi>Abkuren,</hi> which about five or six Leagues above <hi>Ispahan</hi> runs within a League and a half of <hi>Senderou. Sha-Abas</hi> the first attempted to have joyn'd the two Rivers together, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he went about to have remov'd certain Rocks that stood in his way, but not being able to compass his design, his Successors laid aside all the thoughts of attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting any more. Could it have been done, the Champaign of <hi>Ispahan</hi> would have been one of most fertile and delicious places in the World; whereas now the River is of no use, running through Desert Countries and Plains of Salt. As for the River of <hi>Senderou,</hi> in Winter it over-flows, but in Summer it has very little Water, being oftner foarded than cross'd over upon Bridges. About four Leagues above <hi>Ispahan</hi> they are constrain'd to force it into their Lands to water their Fields and Grounds, which else would produce nothing at all. Wells they have a great many in several places; but besides, that they are not able to furnish that great quantity of Water which is necessary; the River Water is much better to fatten the Land. Now you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that their Channels never return to the River, being wasted upon the Ground; so that the River of <hi>Ispahan</hi> being very much wasted before it comes to the City, by reason that it is still lessen'd by so many Channels, about ten or twelve Leagues from thence, it ends as it were quite spent in a few Mershes. This scarcity of Water, which is so general over all <hi>Persia,</hi> is the reason that they are extraordinary Husbands of it, and buy it very dear. Therefore is the superintendant of the Water, which brings the King in a very considerable Revenue, one of the most contended for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the whole Court. For every Garden is Tax'd more or less according to its bigness, for the Water it requires once a Week; which Water is let go into the quarters which have need of it, every Garden having a particular Channel whence they have their Water by turns. But you must have a care of attempting to bring this Water in before your turn, for should it come to be known, an easie Fine would not excuse the matter. I knew two <hi>Franks,</hi> who because they presum'd to take in Water in the night time before it was their turn, had like to have lost all their Land by Confiscation, had it not been for the particular favour of the King to the <hi>Franks;</hi> and yet all that favour did not excuse them from being soundly amerc'd.</p>
                     <p>There are four Bridges a quarter of a Leagues distance one from another that cross the River of <hi>Senderou</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> That which crosses the walk bears the name of <hi>Alywerdi-Kan,</hi> who caus'd it to be built, being also call'd the Bridge of <hi>Zulfa.</hi> It is built of good Brick joyn'd together with Free-stone, and very level, not being higher in the middle than at either end. It is not above three hundred and fifty paces long, and twenty broad, being supported by several small Arches of Stone which are very low. Of each side there is a Gallery eight or nine foot broad which runs from one end to the other, several Arches twenty-five or thirty foot high supporting the Platform, where when the heat is not extream, they that please may walk for the sake of the fresh Air. But the most usual passage is under the Galleries, where there are several out-lets upon the River to let in the fresh Air. For the Galleries are very high from the level of the Bridge, to which you ascend by easie steps, the middle of the Bridge not being above twenty-five foot broad, serving for Waggons and Pack-horses. There is also another way all along by the Water side, where there are several Stones laid to step upon, to keep you from being watchet. It crosses through all the Arches of the Bridge, through little doors made in every Arch from one end to the other, descending from the Bridge by a little pair of stairs, tak'n out of the thickness of the Arches supporters. There is another Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case to ascend up to the Galleries of about two fathoms broad, with stays or Rails on both sides. This Bridge is truly a very neat piece of Architecture, if I may not say the neatest in all <hi>Persia.</hi>

There are also three other Bridges upon the River, one above the Bridge of <hi>Zulfa,</hi> and two below. The first but meanly built, but very commodious for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> when they travel Westward, who would else be forc'd to go a great way about, through the whole City of <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of the other two Bridges below the Bridge of <hi>Zulfa,</hi> was built by <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the second, Father of the present King. It is almost equal to it in Structure; but it has one particular beauty, which is a hexagonal place in the middle of the Bridge, which causes the Water to fall in that part with a pleasing noise. For that being the deepest part of the River, <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> resolv'd to build a Bridge there; partly for the <hi>Gaurs</hi> sake, to the end, they might not come through the walk of <hi>Tcharbag,</hi> and that going from <hi>Ispahan</hi> they might have a shorter cut home. The Habitation of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> is only a large Village, the first Houses whereof are but a little way from the River; though the walk that goes from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to the <hi>King's Bridge</hi> is both longer and broader than that of <hi>Tcharbag,</hi> planted on both sides with a row of Trees, but no Channel in the middle.</p>
                     <p>Before each of the Avenues to the Bridge stands a House that belongs to the King for his divertisoment. That upon the left side of the River toward <hi>Ispahan,</hi> was by the great <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> giv'n to the <hi>Capuchins.</hi> For as soon as they came to <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> upon their Examination, the King was extreamly tak'n with their behaviour. He ask'd them how they liv'd, and whether they took any money? To which the <hi>Capuchins</hi> making answer, that they never handled any money but contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Alms; the King believing his Subjects, would give them very little, bestow'd that House and Garden upon them. But they stay'd not long there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was too big for them to repair, and too far from the City, so that the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> in the Winter could not get to their Chappel. Now they have built them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a very handsom House not far from the King's Palace, at the Cost of Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> one of their own order.</p>
                     <p>There is another old Bridge a quarter of a League below the <hi>Gaurs</hi> Bridge, which is upon the Road from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Schiras.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to return to the long-walk of <hi>Tcharbag,</hi> which continues above eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces beyond the Bridge of <hi>Zulfa</hi> to the Garden of <hi>Hezardgerib.</hi> The Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that passes that other part of the walk, comes from the same River which they have cut three or four Leagues above <hi>Ispahan.</hi> When you have walk'd about four hundred paces, you meet with a fall of Waters that tumbles into a Pool, from whence there are twelve steps to ascend to the end of the Alley. The walk is fronted by the great House which stands before the Garden of <hi>Hezardgerib,</hi> or <hi>the thousand Acres.</hi> The House consists but only of one great Hall over the Gate, and four small Chambers at the four corners of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hezardgerib</hi> is the fairest Garden in <hi>Asia,</hi> though it would be accounted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Europe.</hi> However as it lies upon the descent of a Hill, it consists of sixteen <hi>Terasses,</hi> sustain'd by a Wall sixteen or seventeen foot high. There is but little Water in any of the Wells; but that which has most is in the fourth <hi>Terrass.</hi> That is a great Octagonal Pool about a hundred and twenty foot in Diameter, round about which are several Pipes that throw up the Water about three foot high, and there are three steps down to the Water. A Channel pav'd with Stone runs through the principal Alley, which goes no farther than the building. This Channel is as wide as that of the Channel of <hi>Tcharbag,</hi> whence it is supply'd as being right oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to it. In the tenth <hi>Terrass</hi> you meet with another Fountain of the same bigness and form with that in the fourth; and in the last which terminates the Grand Alley and the length of the Garden, there is another Channel which crosses all the Alleys, which, like the great one compose the length of the Alley. Besides this, there are op'n Rooms to take the fresh Air, some falls and murmurs of Water, but for borders and close Alleys, and Arbours, you must expect no such thing, either in <hi>Hezardgerib,</hi> nor in any other part of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having walk'd in the great walk of <hi>Tcharbag,</hi> you meet upon the right hand with a Street between two Walls of the Gardens that belong to the King, which Street leads you to <hi>Zulfa,</hi> not above two or three Musquet Shots distance off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zulfa</hi> a Colony of <hi>Armenians</hi> which <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> brought from <hi>Zulfa</hi> a City of <hi>Armenia,</hi> is so much encreas'd for some years since, that it may now pass for a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106224:98"/>
large City, being almost a League and a half long, and near upon half as much broad. There are two principal Streets which contain near upon the whole length, one whereof has on each side a row of <hi>Tchinars,</hi> the roots whereof are refresh'd by a small Channel of Water, which by a particular order the <hi>Armenians</hi> bring to the City, to water their Gardens. The most part of the other Streets have also a row of Trees, and a Channel. And for their Houses, they are generally better built, and more chearful than those of <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How they came to be fetled here, I have already describ'd: And now the number <note place="margin">See the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Zul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.</hi>
                        </note> of Inhabitants is strangely increas'd by the accession of several other Christians of divers Sects, as <hi>Jacobites, Cophtes,</hi> and <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who formerly liv'd in the Suburbs of <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Neither was <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> so cruel in transplanting the <hi>Armenians</hi> away out of their own Country; for they were all at that season poor labouring men, who knew not at all what belong'd to Trade. Since that time they are grown very rich: so that the <hi>Armenians</hi> have no cause to be covetous of the Habitations of their Ancestors. And now I will tell you how they came to be such great Proficients in Trade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> who was a man of a great Genius, and a person of great undertaking, considering that <hi>Persia</hi> was a barren Country, where there was little Trade, and by consequence little Money, resolv'd to send his Subjects into <hi>Europe</hi> with raw Silks, so to understand whence the best profit would arise, to bring Money into his Country. To which purpose, he resolv'd to make himself Master of all the Silk in his own Country, by purchasing it himself at a reasonable rate, tax'd by himself, and to reap the gains by his Factors: and withal, thought it necessary to seek an Alliance with the great Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> to engage them on his side against the <hi>Turk.</hi> He first sent to the King of <hi>France, Henry</hi> the Fourth. But he dying before the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador arriv'd, answer was made the Ambassador, That if the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had any thing to say to the King of <hi>France, Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, he must send a new Ambassador, which was never done.</p>
                     <p>Three or four years after he sent an Ambassador to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with a <hi>Persian</hi> Merchant of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> putting into their hands a considerable quantity of Bales of Silk. He also sent along with them a <hi>Portuguez Austin-Friar,</hi> to be their Guide and Interpreter. The <hi>Persian</hi> Merchant would have sold the Silks, as was the King's order, and have bought a Present more becoming. But the Ambassador over-rul'd by the Friar, resolv'd to present the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with the Bales of Silk. The Merchant not able to oppose the Ambassador, returns home forthwith to give an account to the King, who approv'd his management. The Ambassador proceeds, and coming to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, presents his Bales of Silk to the King, who ask'd the Ambassador whether his Master took him for a Woman, that he had sent him so many Bales of Silk to spin; and immediately sent away the Present to his Queen, presenting the Ambassador but very meanly: who thereupon seeing the Errour he had committed, made hast home; but upon his return, the <hi>Persian</hi> King having notice of the ill success of his Negotiation, caus'd his Belly to be ript op'n in the publick Market-place.</p>
                     <p>About fifteen years after, he trusted a considerable quantity of Silk with a Merchant's Son of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Venice:</hi> who when he came there, took a stately Lodging, and spent his Money at a strange rate, especially among the Courtisans; to maintain which expence, he continually sold great quantities of Silk. The <hi>Venetians</hi> seeing a private man live so splendidly among them, and not believing so great a quantity of Goods could belong to one single Merchant, but rather imagining him to be a Factor for some Company who suffer'd for his folly, wrote to all the Ports of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and having intelligence who he was, the Senate thought fit to seize his Person and his Goods, before he had consum'd all; at the same time giving a civil account to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> what they had done. To which the <hi>Persian</hi> King return'd a most obliging Answer of Thanks, sending withal an intelligent <hi>Persian</hi> Merchant to take an account of what was left, to whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> were very punctual. As for the Prodigal <hi>Persian,</hi> who thought it not his wisest way to return into <hi>Persia,</hi> what became of him is not material to this Story.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> by these Experiments observing the little inclination of his Subjects to Trade, who were naturally addicted to Pride and Expence, which is no part of a Merchant's business, cast his Eyes upon the <hi>Armenians,</hi> men able to endure the

labour of long Journeys, sober persons, and great Husbands, and such who being Christians, might more freely Trade among the Christians; and made choice of them, as being most proper and fit for Trade. Whereupon, picking out the most Judicious among them, he deliver'd to every one so many Bales of Silk, according to their Capacity; for which they were to pay at their return, a reasonable Rate tax'd by the King, who allow'd them what more they got for their Expences and Gains. Those people in a short time became so expert, that there is not any sort of Trade which they will not now undertake; for now they run as far as <hi>Tunquin, Java,</hi> and the <hi>Philippines,</hi> and indeed over all the East, except <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan.</hi> But if they do not thrive, they never return; as being a place where they must either give an exact Account, or else suffer the quick and severe Justice of Drubbing, which never fails those Factors that are ill Husbands for their Masters.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the <hi>Armenians</hi> are so much the more fit for Trading, because they are a people very sparing, and very sober; though whether it be their virtue of their avarice, I know not. For when they are going a long Journey, they only make provision of Bisket, smoak'd <hi>Bufalo</hi>'s flesh, Onions, bak'd Butter, Flowr, Wine, and dry'd Fruits. They never buy fresh Victuals, but when they meet with Lambs or Kids very cheap in the Mountainous Countries; nor is there one of them that does not carry his Angle to fish withal, when they come to any Ponds or Rivers. All these Provisions cost them little the Carriage. And when they come to any Town where they are to stay, they club five or six together, and lye in an empty Chamber which they furnish themselves; every one carrying his Mattress, his Coverlet, and his Kitchin-Instruments, which is a great piece of Thrift. When they travel into Christendom, they carry along with them Saffron, Pepper, Nutinegs, and other Spices; which they exchange in the Country-Towns for Bread, Wine, Butter, Cheese, Milk-Meats, and other Provisions which they buy of the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. When they return out of Christendom, they bring along with them all sorts of Mercery-ware, and Pedlery-ware of <hi>Noremberg</hi> and <hi>Venice;</hi> as little Looking-glasses, trifles of Tin enamel'd, false Pearls, and other things of that nature; which pays for the Victuals they call for among the Country-people.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of their Trade, there return'd very few <hi>Caravans</hi> into <hi>Persia</hi> without two hundred thousand Crowns in Silver, beside <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Clothes, fine Tissues, Looking-glasses, <hi>Venice-</hi>Pearls, Cochenel, and Watches; which they thought most proper for the Sale of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At length those <hi>Armenians</hi> became so exquisite in Trade, that several of them have left Estates of two, some twenty thousand <hi>Tomans.</hi> But the richest among them was <hi>Cotgia,</hi> or Monsieur <hi>Petrus,</hi> who left forty thousand <hi>Tomans</hi> in coyn'd Money, besides his Horses, Furniture, and Lands in the Country, his Jewels and Plate; all which are never reckon'd a Merchant's Estate, but only the ready Cash with which he trades. <hi>Cotgia Petrus</hi> was very much esteem'd for his Charity, and the great Church which he built, which is a kind of Covent, with a Bishop and Monks. Nor is the fair Market-place, all environ'd with Shops, a little beholding to his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Zulpha</hi> have this advantage over all the Christians of the East, that they enjoy Lands and Priviledges, the King not permitting the least injustice to be done them, nor that any <hi>Mahometan</hi> should live at <hi>Zulpha.</hi> They have also the priviledge to be as well clad as the <hi>Persians,</hi> and to make use as they do of Bridles of Gold and Silver. Their Wives also are very richly habited, in strip'd Sattins purfl'd with Gold, and other rich <hi>Europaean</hi> Silks.</p>
                     <p>The King names whom he pleases among the <hi>Armenians</hi> to be their Chief; whom they call <hi>Kelonter,</hi> who judges all their differences, and taxes them to make up the Sum which they are to pay to the King every year.</p>
                     <p>The Language of the <hi>Armenians</hi> is either vulgar or learned: the learned is only us'd by the Ecclesiasticks, in reference to their Religion. They write like us, from the left to the right, having found out peculiar Characters about four years since. They have three Languages very natural to them, which however are very differente the <hi>Armenian,</hi> which is their ancient Country-speech, which they have preserv'd from Father to Son; the <hi>Persian,</hi> which is the Language of the Country where they live; and the <hi>Turkish,</hi> of which they make very much use in course of Trade. As for their Women, they speak nothing but the <hi>Armenian,</hi> as having no converse with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106224:100"/>
strangers, and never stirring out of their houses. There are some <hi>Armenians</hi> speak <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as having learnt it in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Zulpha</hi> fifteen or sixteen Churches and Chappels of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> among which you are to count two Nunneries for Women. There are in <hi>Ispahan Austin-</hi>Friars, <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and in <hi>Zulpha Jesuits.</hi> The <hi>Jesuits</hi> that came last have but a little House, but to make them amends they have a large Garden. Though the number of the Religious Teachers is far greater then the number of Hearers: for in all <hi>Ispahan</hi> and <hi>Zulpha,</hi> take the <hi>Franks</hi> that come out of <hi>Europe,</hi> or born in <hi>Persia,</hi> as well Men as Women, there are not six hundred persons that profess the Catholick Religion. As for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> they are so obstinately fix'd to their own Religion, that they will hear of no other; and nothing but Money has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caus'd them to seign the embracing of another. Friar <hi>Ambrose</hi> a <hi>Capuchin</hi> staid a while at <hi>Zulpha,</hi> to whom several of the principal <hi>Armenians</hi> came to School to learn <hi>French,</hi> in hopes of establishing a Trade with <hi>France.</hi> But the <hi>Armenian</hi> Archbishop and Bishops fearing lest the Children should be infected with some other Religion, excommunicated all Fathers that sent their Children to School. And finding that they little regarded the Excommunication, they shut up the Church doors, and stir'd up the People against the Religious <hi>Franks;</hi> so that Father <hi>Ambrose</hi> was forc'd to leave <hi>Persia,</hi> and retire to <hi>Surat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover there are in <hi>Ispahan</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters. Nor are the <hi>Jews</hi> so miserable and beggarly, as they seem to be: they intrude, according to custom, into all Business; so that if any has a mind to buy or sell any rich Jewel, he need do no more but speak to them. In the Reign of <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> persecuted them so grievously, that either by force or by cunning he caus'd them to turn <hi>Mahometans;</hi> but the King understanding that only power and fear had constrain'd them to turn, suffer'd them to resume their own Religion, and to live in quiet.</p>
                     <p>There are about ten or twelve thousand <hi>Banians</hi> in <hi>Ispahan,</hi> who are known by their yellow Complexions, or rather by a yellow Mark made with Saffron upon the top of their Foreheads. Their Turbants are less than usual, and their Shooes are almost like ours, embroider'd with Flowers a-top. They are all Bankers, and very knowing in Money. The greatest part of the Money of the principal Money'd men of <hi>Ispahan</hi> is in their hands for improvement sake. So that if you want a considerable Sum, you may have it the next day upon good Security, and paying severe a Interest, which those <hi>Banians</hi> will squeez up sometimes to 18 <hi>per Cent.</hi> But if it be not very privately exacted and paid, the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which forbids the taking of Interest, lays hold upon the whole Sum, and confiscates it every Penny.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Religion of the <hi>Persians;</hi> of the great Feast of <hi>Hocen</hi> and <hi>Hussein,</hi> and the <hi>Camel-Feast.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE difference among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> doth not consist in the different Explanations which they put upon the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but in the several Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which they hold concerning the first Successors of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> from which have aris'n two particular Sects entirely opposite; the Sect of the <hi>Sunnis,</hi> and the Sect of the <hi>Schiais.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first, who are of the <hi>Turkish</hi> belief, maintain that <hi>Abou-baker</hi> succeeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as his Vicar or Vicegerent; to him <hi>Omar;</hi> to <hi>Omar Osman;</hi> to <hi>Osman Mortuz-Ali,</hi> Nephew and Son-in-law to <hi>Mahomet</hi> by Marriage of his Daughter. That <hi>Osman</hi> was Secretary to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a porson of Courage, as well as the other three: and that they were all valiant Souldiers, and great Captains, who extended their Conquests more by force of Arms than by Reason. And thence it comes that the <hi>Sunnis</hi> will not allow of Disputes, but propagate and maintain their Religion altogether by force.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Schiais,</hi> who are of the <hi>Persian</hi> belief, detest <hi>Abou-baker, Omar,</hi> and <hi>Osman,</hi> as Usurpers to the Succession of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which only belong'd to <hi>Haly,</hi> his Nephew
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106224:100"/>
and Son in Law. They hold that this succession consists in elev'n High Priests descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants from <hi>Haly,</hi> who makes the twelfth in this order. 1. <hi>Haly,</hi> Son of <hi>Aboutaleb.</hi> 2. <hi>Hocen,</hi> eldest Son of <hi>Hali.</hi> 3. <hi>Hussein,</hi> his second Son, who suffer'd death in defence of his Father's Succession. The place where the <hi>Sunnis</hi> gave him battel and slew him, is call'd <hi>Kerbela</hi> near to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is a holy place in high venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Persians.</hi> 4. <hi>Iman-zin-el-Abedin.</hi> 5. <hi>Mahomet-el-Baker.</hi> 6. <hi>Iafer-el-Scadek,</hi> who introduc'd the Law into <hi>Persia,</hi> that if any <hi>Christian, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Idolater</hi> turn'd <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> he should be declar'd general Heir to his Family to the exclusion of Brothers and Sisters, and that he might allow what he pleas'd to his Father and Mother. Whence arose two mischiefs, that some <hi>Armenians, Christians,</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> turn'd <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> to get the Estate of the Family, and others turn'd <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to keep their possessions. 7. <hi>Moussa-Katzem.</hi> 8. <hi>Hali-el-Rezza,</hi> whose Tomb at <hi>Meshed</hi> is as highly venerated among the <hi>Persians,</hi> as <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s among the <hi>Turks.</hi> 9. <hi>Mahammet-el-Ioüad.</hi> 10. <hi>Hali-el-Hadi.</hi> 11. <hi>Hocen-el-Askeri.</hi> 12. <hi>Mouhemmet-el-Mouhadi Shaheb-za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> hold the same belief as to the last <hi>Iman,</hi> as we do of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> which is the reason that several people leave them in their Wills Houses ready furnish'd, Stables full of stately Horses, and other necessaries for them to make use of when they return to Earth again. They attribute to this <hi>Iman</hi> the Sirname of <hi>Zaheb-zaman,</hi> or <hi>Lord of Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These two Sects of <hi>Sunnis</hi> and <hi>Schias</hi> over-run the three principal Kingdoms of <hi>India, viz.</hi> the Great <hi>Mogul's,</hi> the King of <hi>Golconda's,</hi> and the King of <hi>Visapour's.</hi> The first and last being <hi>Sunnis,</hi> that is to say, both the Kings and Lords of the Court; for their Subjects are most of them Idolaters. Some <hi>Schiais</hi> there are in the Courts of both Kings, in regard the Officers of the Army are for the most part <hi>Persians,</hi> though in outward shew they may follow the Religion of the Prince. But the King of <hi>Golconda Koutoub-Sha</hi> is a zealous <hi>Schiais.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to the Grand Festival of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which is the famous Feast of <hi>Hocen</hi> and <hi>Hussein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eight days before the Festival begins, some of the more zealous sort black all their Bodies and their Faces, and go naked in the Streets with only a covering about their secret parts. They carry two Flints, one in each hand, which they knock one against another, wrything their Bodies, and making a thousand antick Faces; and all the while crying out, <hi>Hussein, Hocen; Hocen, Hussein;</hi> which they act and speak with so much Labour, 'till they foam again at the mouth. In the Evening, the devout people admit them into their Houses, and feed them very well. During those days, as soon as the Sun is set, you shall see at the corners where several Streets meet, Pulpits set up for certain Preachers, who prepare the people that flock to hear them to the devotion of the Feast. Now in regard all Ages and Sexes go, there is no time in all the year so favourable for the Women to meet their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1667. the third of <hi>July,</hi> I saw the Festival by the favour of the <hi>Nagar,</hi> who appointed me a place just against the <hi>Déla</hi> where the King sate. This <hi>Déla</hi> is a Room built with a jetting upon that side of the <hi>Meidan</hi> next the Palace Gate, one story high. Several Pillars sustain the flat bottom or floor of the <hi>Déla,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with a <hi>Grotesco</hi> work of Gold and Azure, in the mid'st whereof there was a Fountain that was fill'd with Water by the contrivance of a Pipe. The Stage or <hi>Déla</hi> was op'n upon three sides, the longest side jetting out upon the <hi>Piazza.</hi> Upon the Wall of the opposite side, which was close, were to be seen several <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> both men and women pictur'd with Bottles and Glasses in their hands, as if they were drinking to one another. <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the second caus'd this Painting to be drawn by a <hi>Hollander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About sev'n a Clock in the Morning <hi>Sha-Sephi</hi> the second, who since has chang'd his name to <hi>Sha-Soliman</hi> the second, came and seated himself upon his Throne set up in the mid'st of the <hi>Déla,</hi> all his Nobility standing about him. So soon as he was sate down, the Great <hi>Provost</hi> appear'd at the end of the <hi>Piazza</hi> mounted upon a fair Horse, attended by certain young Lords, who caus'd the people, consisting of the Companies of the two quarters of the City, which are twelve in all, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the places which were design'd them. For formerly the Companies would strive for the way; and therefore the King to prevent disorder, order'd there should be a <hi>Provost,</hi> or Master of the Ceremonies to place them without disturbance.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106224:101"/>
As he was about his duty, a Horse-man entred the <hi>Piazza,</hi> arm'd with a Bow, a Quiver, and a Scimitar, follow'd by seven Men that carry'd every one a Pike upright in their hands, with every one a Man's Head at the top. Those were the Heads of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Usbeck-Tartars,</hi> the neighbouring and mortal Enemies of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which those men had cut off from the shoulders of their conquer'd Foes. The King caus'd five <hi>Tomans</hi> a piece to be giv'n to them that carry'd the Heads, and ten <hi>Tomans</hi> to their Leader. After them enter'd three hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> which were fled from the Borders of <hi>Turkie,</hi> from whence the Country-people were tak'n by force, and sent to the Warrs of <hi>Candy.</hi> They complain'd, that whereas they were wont to be sent to their Winter-Quarters about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> kept them to the same hard service in Winter as in Summer. All these were order'd to advance into the middle of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where they made their obeysance to him three times, and then humbly besought him that they might dwell in his Kingdom, with their Wives, their Children, and their Cattel. The King order'd Money to be distributed among them, and that they should have Lands assign'd them to manure. Then the <hi>Provost</hi> caus'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to advance, every Company having the Thill of a Wagon carry'd before him; upon every of which Thills was a Bier three or four Foot high, the Wood of the Thill being painted with a <hi>Grotesco</hi> of Gold and Silver, and the Bier cover'd with Sattin. When the first Company had order to march, three Horses were led before, richly harness'd; when they were come about a hundred Paces forward into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> in view of the King, they that led the Horses caus'd them to gallop, and then all the Company fell a running and dancing about with the Bier. Besides that, every one flung up his short Cassock, his Girdle, and Bonnet, put their fingers in their mouths, to whistle as loud as they could. While the naked people, with their Flint-stones in their hands, ran knocking their Stones together, crying out, <hi>Hussein Hocen, Hocen Hussein,</hi> 'till they foam at the mouth again; not omitting to wryth their Bodies, and to make all the scurvy Faces as before describ'd. The three Companies succeeding one another in the same Formalities, by and by came two Companies more with a little Bier upon their Thills, and in each Bier a little Child that lay as if dead. They that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd these two Biers wept and sigh'd most sadly. These two Infants represented the Children of <hi>Hussein,</hi> who when the Prophet was slain, were tak'n by <hi>Yerid, Caliph</hi> of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and put to death.</p>
                     <p>Upon this occasion you shall see a great number of Curtisans that come to the Ceremony fall a weeping, who thereby believe their Sins are forgiv'n</p>
                     <p>When all the people were come into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> notwithstanding all the care and good order that was tak'n, there were several that went to Sharps, accounting it a great honour to fight smartly in the King's presence; and farther believing, that if any one be kill'd upon that occasion, he shall be Sainted; as indeed every one gives some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward his Interrment. The Grand <hi>Provost</hi> seeing the Quarrel grow hot, and fearing more mischief, sent for five Elephants, which ceas'd the Combat, by drawing the Eyes of the Spectators upon them. The Elephants march'd one before another, according to their Pay that was allow'd them, and their skill in War. Not that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> makes any use of them in the Field, but only for State, keeps such as the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes present him withal. Those five Elephants were cover'd with Houses of Cloth of Gold, with a Fringe of the same round about. And upon the first, which was the highest and the biggest, sate two Men, the one upon the neck, who guides the Elephant; the other upon the crupper, carrying the King's Arm's in a Standard fix'd to a Half-Pike. Upon the other four sate only one Man a-piece, who were the Governours. When they came before the place where the King sate, they were all rank'd five a-brest, at what time the biggest, which was in the middle, stretch'd out his two fore-legs forward, and his two hinder-legs backward, 'till his belly almost touch'd the ground; after which manner the Elephant makes his obeysance. The other four did the same. Then laying their Trunks upon the ground, and raising them again over their heads three times more, they were made to stand with their heads where their tayls stood; and their Houses were turn'd up; to the end the King might see in what condition they were, and whether well look'd after or no: which being done, they were led away again.</p>
                     <p>Upon one side of the Room where the King stood, a little Scaffold was set up, cover'd with Tap'stry, some five Foot lower than the Kings. In the middle of the Scaffold stood a great Elbow-Chair cover'd with black Velvet, where sate a <hi>Moullah</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:106224:101"/>
with six other <hi>Moullah's</hi> round about him. The <hi>Moullah</hi> made a Discourse upon the Death of <hi>Hussein</hi> and <hi>Hocen</hi> of about half an hour long, which being ended, the King caus'd a <hi>Calaat</hi> or Habit of Honour to be giv'n him, as also to the others, though not so rich. When they had all put on the Habit, the same <hi>Moullah</hi> return'd to his Chair, and made a Prayer for the health of the King, and the prosperity of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>All these Ceremonies lasted from seven in the Morning 'till Noon, at what time the King retir'd into his <hi>Haram.</hi> As for the People, they carry their Biers up and down the City, and where-ever two Companies meet, whether it be for the upper hand, or to get formost, they presently fall together by the Ears, and knock one another down: for they are not permitted to carry any other Arms than good big Clubs, almost as big as Levers.</p>
                     <p>Some time after the Feast of <hi>Hussein</hi> and <hi>Hocen,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> celebrate another Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, which they call the <hi>Feast of the Camel,</hi> in remembrance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sacrifice. They have a great reverence for this Festival, saying that it was a Camel and not a Ram which God sent to reprieve <hi>Ishmael</hi> (affirming that <hi>Ishmael</hi> was to have been sacrific'd, and not <hi>Isaac.)</hi> They choose out for this Ceremony one of the fairest Camels they can meet withal, and adorn and dress him up with several Plates of counterfeit Gold and Silver, and then leäd him without the City to a place which is before a <hi>Mosquee</hi> on the other side of the River of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> upon <hi>Zulpha</hi> side; the <hi>Deroga</hi> or <hi>Provost</hi> accompanying the people. The King was formerly wont to be at this Feast, accompany'd with his Nobility, and I have seen him there; but of late years he never goes, the <hi>Deroga</hi> supplying his place.</p>
                     <p>When the King went thither, several <hi>Moullahs</hi> pray'd for half an hour, after which the King took a kind of a Jav'lin and darted it against the Camel: but now in the absence of the King, the <hi>Deroga</hi> gives the first stroak. At the same time they fling the Camel to the ground, with Ropes ty'd to his legs, and cutting off his head and neck together, they divide the rest of the Body into eleven parts more, to the end all the twelve Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies may have every one their share. Every Company carries their share to the Master of the Companies House, who is generally the ancientest among them. Which part is kept and salted up 'till the next Feast, and the piece the year before, so 'till then preserv'd, is then boyl'd with Rice, and is the foundation of the Feast for the chief of the Company, who take it for an honour to eat of it: For the rest, they boyl Rice with Mutton and Hens, and besides that, distribute large Alms to the Poor.</p>

                     <p>THere are no men in the world so scrupulous of discovering the Mysteries of their Religion, as the <hi>Gaurs;</hi> so that I was forc'd to frequent their company very much in most of my Travels, to pick out what I have here to deliver.</p>

                        <p>AFter the <hi>Persians</hi> began to persecute the <hi>Gaurs,</hi> great numbers of them retir'd to <hi>Surat,</hi> and others into the Province of <hi>Guzerat.</hi> Now the King of <hi>Persia</hi> lets them live in quiet; and there are now above 10000 in <hi>Kerman,</hi> where I staid three Months in the year 1654. All that live in <hi>India</hi> are Tradesmen, and for the most part Turners in Ivory; those in <hi>Kerman</hi> deal in Wool. Four days journey from whence stands their principal Temple, where their Chief Priest resides; whither they are once in their lives oblig'd to go in Pilgrimage. There are some of these <hi>Gaurs</hi> live near <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                        <head>Of their Original, and their Prophets.</head>
                        <p>THey say that the Father of their Prophet was a <hi>Frank</hi> by Nation, whose Name was <hi>Azer,</hi> and a Carver by Trade. That he left his own Country to live in theirs, which at that time was the City of <hi>Babylon;</hi> where he took a Wife who call'd her self <hi>Doghdon.</hi> That one night his Wife dreamt that God had sent an Angel from Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise to visit her, who brought her very rich Cloathes, which she put on. That a Celestial Light presently over-spread her Face, and render'd her as beautiful as the Sun; and that when she wak'd she found her self with Child, which Child prov'd to be the Prophet <hi>Ebrahim-zer-Ateucht.</hi> That the Astrologers of that time, by their skill in the Stars knew of the Birth of that Infant sent by God, who was to govern Men, and reign in their Hearts. That those Astrologers went and declar'd the same thing to the King, telling him that there was a Child suddenly to be born, that would one day deprive him of his Crown. Whereupon the said King, call'd <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brout,</hi> and a great Tyrant, caus'd all the Women with Child to be put to death, through the whole extent of his Dominions.</p>
                        <p>But by a Miracle the big Belly of the Mother of their Prophet not appearing, she remain'd undiscover'd, and brought forth a Son. Her Husband, who knew nothing of this Mystery, fearing he should lose his head if he did not discover the business to the King, before he found it out another way, went and confess'd that he had a Child born, but that he knew nothing of her being with Child.</p>
                        <p>Now you must know, that contrary to the custom of other Children, that cry so soon as they come out of the Mothers womb, this Child laugh'd so soon as he was born. For being to triumph over the Hearts of the people, he was to shew signs of joy; so that the people began already to rejoyce in their future felicities. This being signifi'd to the King, he call'd his Astrologers together, to tell him the meaning of so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a thing, and what would become of the Infant. But the Astrologers not being able to satisfie him, he sent for the Infant, and would have slain him with a Sword with his own hand; but God dry'd up his Arm immediately, so that he could not. However, not terrifi'd with so great a punishment, transported with Choler, he caus'd a great Fire to be kindled, and commanded the Infant to be thrown into it. But by the power of God, the Fire which he had prepar'd to consume the Infant turn'd into a Bed of Roses, where the Child most sweetly repos'd.</p>
                        <p>They who from that hour began to honour the little Prophet, took away some of that Fire, which has been preserv'd to this time. They keep it, say they, in honour of so great a Miracle; and they have it in great veneration, because it discover'd the merit of their Prophet.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless the King stop'd not there, but still obstinate in his impiety, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these Miracles, he prepar'd new torments for the little Infant; but God chastis'd his incredulity and that of his people very severely, by sending such an infinite number of Flies, and that of such a pestiferous nature, that who-ever were stung with them dy'd without remedy, unless they immediately came and worship'd the Prophet, and kiss'd his Feet, in testimony of their repentance. As for the King, who still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in his impenitency, an exemplary fate befel him. For one of those Flies stinging him in one of his Ears, he dy'd a most tormenting death.</p>
                        <p>His Successor was <hi>Sha-Glochtes.</hi> He also at the beginning of his Reign began to persecute the little Infant, who now began to increase in years and virtue. The King imprison'd him: but he was astonish'd when he heard that one of his Horses, which he always confided in when he went to Battel, as being assur'd of Victory when he rode him, had lost his four legs. Thereupon, wiser than his Predecessor, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging from whence so dire a Correction proceeded, he sent for the Prophet out of Prison, ask'd pardon for his incredulity, and pray'd him by his intercession to restore his Horse his legs again. The Prophet willing to do him that favour, pray'd to God four times, and every time he pray'd one leg return'd to the Horse again. The King beholding such a Miracle, was half converted; but being desirous to be farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, he desir'd the Prophet to throw himself into a Bath of melted Silver, which he would provide for him; promising, if he came out safe, that he and all his People would receive him as one sent from God, and be obedient to his Precepts in all things. The Prophet resolutely undertook his offer, and the Bath being ready, cast himself
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106224:102"/>
fearlesly into it; and as he went in, so he came out without the least harm. Then the King and all the people that were present ador'd him for a real Prophet, and gave him the name of <hi>Zer-Ateucht,</hi> or <hi>Wash'd in Silver.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Prophet perceiving that all the people had him in so much veneration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself, and would not be seen any more. Nor do they justly know what-became of him; which makes the greatest part of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> believe, that he was tak'n up into Paradise both Soul and Body together. Others say, that having found an Iron Coffin upon the Road near <hi>Bagdat,</hi> he put himself into it, and was carry'd into Heav'n by the Angels. They allow their Prophet three Children, who are not yet come into the world, though their names be already giv'n them. They say that this Prophet <hi>Ebrahim</hi> walking one time upon the River without a Boat, three drops of his nature fell from him upon the water, which are still preserv'd there. That their God will send a Virgin, very much belov'd by him, upon the same River, who by the reception of the first drop shall become big of the first Child, whom they call beforehand <hi>Ouchider.</hi> He shall come into the world with authority, and shall cause his Fathers Law to be receiv'd, and confirm it, not only by his eloquent Preaching, but by many miracles. The second, whose name is <hi>Ouchiderma,</hi> shall be conceiv'd after the same fashion; he shall assist his Brother, and by causing the Sun to stand still ten years, shall convince all the world of the Truth of his Doctrine. The third shall be conceiv'd by the same Mother, and shall be call'd <hi>Senoïet-hotius:</hi> He shall come with more authority than his two Brothers, and shall perfectly reduce all people to the Religion of their Prophet. After which shall be the universal Resurrection, at what time all the Souls, either in Paradise or Hell, shall return to take possession of their Bodies. Then say they, shall all the Mountains, and all the Minerals in the world be melted, and shall fill up the great Chaos of Hell, whereby the Mansion of the Devils shall be utterly destroy'd? After this the world shall be levell'd, and be made fit to inhabit, and men shall have every one their apartment answerable to the degree and quantity of the good which they did in their life time: but that their chief delight shall be to behold and praise God and <hi>Ebrahim</hi> their Prophet. They add that before the Resurrection, those that are in Paradise do not behold the face of God, no not the Angels themselves, except only one, who is always attendant on him to receive and execute his commands. They also say that God will have pity upon the Damn'd, and that they shall go into Paradise, as having suffer'd enough already for their sins. By which it appears, that the Paradise of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> is less remote from sense than that of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; and that they have a confus'd knowledge of the mysteries of Christian Religion.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>EBrahim-zer-Ateucht</hi> being taken up into Paradise, they receiv'd by his means seven Books of Laws, which God of his goodness sent them to instruct them in the way of their Salvation. They also receiv'd seven others, containing an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of all the Dreams that could be Dream'd. Lastly seven others, wherein were written all the secrets of Physick, and all the possible means for the long preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of health. They say that fourteen of these Books, which contain'd the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Dreams and secrets of Physick are lost; for that <hi>Allexander</hi> the Great carry'd them away, as esteeming them a vast treasure; and for the Books of their Religion, because they were written in a language that none but the Angels understood, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> for madness caus'd them to be burnt: for which rashness of his, God punish'd him, and afflicted him with that terrible sickness whereof he Dy'd. Some Doctors and Priests that had did themselves in the Mountains to save their lives from his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, after <hi>Alexander</hi> was Dead, met again together, and compos'd one Book by the strength of their memories. I saw that Book which is a good large one, and written in a different Character, either from the <hi>Arabian, Persian,</hi> or <hi>Indian.</hi> Their Priests themselves that read in that Book hardly understand what they read, but they have other Books that explain what is contain'd therein. When they read in that Book, as also when they pray, they tye a Handkerchief about their mouths, as if they were afraid their words should mix with the Air and receive any impurity.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Gaurs</hi> never use Circumcision; but at the Birth of their Children practise something like our Baptism. For some days after the Child is born, they wash it with Water wherein certain Flowers are first boyl'd; and during that dipping, the Priest, who is present, makes certain Prayers. If the Child dye without that Washing, they do not believe but that it goes to Paradise; but they hold that the Parents shall give an account for their neglect of the Infant, because that Washing increases his favour and his merit in the sight of God.</p>

                        <head>Of their Marriages.</head>
                        <p>THe Religion of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> permits them to have five Wives, if they can maintain them; nor is it laudable to repudiate any one but in case of an evident Adultery, or that she turn <hi>Mahometan;</hi> besides, it behoves her Husband to stay a whole year, to see whether she will repent or no. If she come and acknowledge her fault to the Priest, he enjoyns her Penance for three years; after which he remarries them, and they become man and wife again.</p>
                        <p>As to the Ceremony of Marriage, the Priest, when the Couple come to him, asks the Man and the Woman in the presence of Witnesses whether they both consent; then taking a little Water he says a few Prayers over it, and then washing both their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads he pronounces certain words, and there's all. But they are not to marry within the third degree; nor do they know what it means to desire a Dispensation.</p>
                        <p>But you must observe by the way, that though they are allow'd five Wives, there is but one which can be truly said to be marry'd, with whom they are oblig'd to lye at least two nights in a week, Fryday and Saturday, and she always goes before the rest. But if she have no Children in seven years, the man is allow'd to marry another, but not to repudiate the other, whom he is bound still to maintain according to his quality.</p>
                        <p>So soon as Women or Maids perceive the custom of Nature upon them, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently leave their Houses, and stay alone in the Fields in little Hutts made of Hurdles or Watlings, with a Cloth at the entring in, which serves for a Door. While they are in that condition, they have Meat and Drink brought them every day; and when they are free, they send according to their quality, a Rid, or a Hen, or a Pigeon for an Offering; after which they go to the Bath, and then invite some few of their Kindred to some small Collation.</p>

                        <head>Of their Fasts, Feasts, and principal Ceremonies.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Gaurs</hi> drink Wine both men and women, and eat Swines-flesh, provided it be of their own breeding and feeding. They are very careful lest their Hogs eat any ordure; for should they perceive that they had devour'd any thing of nastiness, they are strictly forbid'n to eat them. They never pare their Nails; so that if by way of disgrace, or by any misfortune they are constrain'd to cut their Nails or their Hair, they carry that which they cut off to some place appointed without the City for that purpose. Five days in a year they abstain from Meat, Fish, Butter, and Eggs; and three other days they fast altogether 'till Evening. They have also thirty Holy-days in honour of thirty of their Saints, which they keep very strictly, no man daring to work. But the day of the Birth of their Prophet is celebrated with an extraordinary Pomp; besides, that then they bestow large Alms.</p>
                        <p>There is one day in the year when all the Women of every City and Village meet together to kill all the Frogs they can find in the fields; and this is done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Prophet, who was one day very much annoy'd by them.</p>
                        <p>Their Priests have several Books full of small Pictures in Water-Colours, ill done, representing how the several Sins of Men shall be punish'd in Hell, especially Sodomy, which they abominate.</p>

They neither burn nor bury their dead, but carry the Corps without the City, into a wall'd place, where are abundance of Stakes seven or eight Foot high, fix'd in the ground, and tye the dead Corps to one of the Stakes, with his Face toward the East. They that accompany the Corps fall to their Prayers at a distance, 'till the Crows come; for those Cemitaries draw the Crows to them. If the Crow chances to fasten upon the right Eye of the deceas'd, then they believe the person to be happy, and for joy they give large Alms, and make a Feast in the field. But if the Crow fixes upon the left Eye, then they take it for an ill <hi>Omen,</hi> return home sad, without speaking to one another; give no Alms, nor eat nor drink.</p>

                        <head>Of their Adoration of Fire.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Gaurs</hi> would not be thought to give Honour to Fire under the title of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For they do not account themselves Idolaters, saying that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but only one God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, whom they only adore. As for the Fire, they preserve it and reverence it, in remembrance of the great Miracle, by which their Prophet was deliver'd from the Flames. One day being at <hi>Kerman,</hi> I desir'd to see that Fire, but they answer'd me, they could not permit me. For say they, one day the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Kerman</hi> being desirous to see the Fire, not daring to do otherwise, they shew'd it him. He it seems expected to see some extraordinary Brightness; but when he saw no more then what he might have seen in a Kitchin or a Chamber-fire, fell a swearing and spitting upon't as if he had been mad. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Sacred Fire being thus profan'd, flew away in the form of a white Pigeon. The Priests considering then their misfortune, which had happen'd through their own indiscretion, fell to their Prayers with the People, and gave Alms; upon which, at the same time, and in the same form the Sacred Fire return'd to its place: which makes them so shy to shew it again. When they put any persons to their Oaths, they Swear them before this Fire; for they think no person so impious, as to swear false before that Sacred Fire, which they take for the Witness of their Oath. Their Priests put them in dread of very great punishments, and threat'n them that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fire will forsake them, if they prove so wicked as to swear falsely before it.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Of their Manners and Customs.</head>
                        <p>THe Language of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> is different from the <hi>Persians,</hi> as is their Character and manner of Writing. They love to feast, and to eat and drink well, being very profuse of their Wine and Strong-water. They never eat Hares, because they have their monthly Purgations, like Women: for the same reason they never eat Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, believing that they partake of the nature of Women and Hares.</p>
                        <p>If, when they comb their Hair or their Beards, any one hair happ'ns to fall upon their cloaths, those cloaths must be wash'd in the stale of a Cow or an Ox to purifie them again. If by chance they happ'n to touch any ordure or nastiness, when they come home they must wash themselves in the same Urin. If one of their Priests meet a dead Corps in the High-way, and chances to see it, he is oblig'd to wash himself in Cows-Piss, which they hold to be a good Purification: an Opinion held in some parts of <hi>India</hi> also. I ask'd one of their Priests how they came to understand the virtue of this Urin; who answer'd me, that a certain person who was contemporary with the first Man, having his Arm bruis'd and very black, by reason of some accident that befel him through the malice of the Devil, fell asleep in the fields, and as he lay, an Ox staling, a drop of the Urin flew upon his Arm, and presently heal'd that part which it wet, and restor'd it to its former whiteness: which the man perceiving when he wak'd, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently follow'd the Ox, and staid by him 'till he stal'd again, and then receiving the Piss upon the whole wound, was perfectly cur'd. They also preserve it, and compound it with a Water, which they cause them to drink who have committed any Sin, after they have been at Confession for it. They call that Water the <hi>Cazi</hi>'s Water; which Urin ought to be preserv'd forty days, with an infusion of Willow-Bark, and certain Herbs. When any person is confess'd of his Sin, if it be a crying Sin, the party is bound to stay ten days in the <hi>Cazi</hi>'s House, and not to eat or drink but what the Priest gives them. And in order to Absolution, the Priest strips him naked, and tyes a little Dog to his right great Toe, which he leads with him about the <hi>Cazi</hi>'s
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106224:104"/>
House wherever he goes, sometimes a whole day, sometimes longer, according to the hainousness of the crime. In that posture he desires the <hi>Cazi</hi> to purifie him, telling him that for his part he believes himself to be purify'd. The Priest makes answer that it is the Dog that must purifie him, and not he. After that he powrs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded water seven times upon his head, then gives him a draught to drink, and so he is absolv'd. This penitence costs the criminal Sawce, who is afterwards bound to feast all his friends at the <hi>Cazi</hi>'s House. Being surpriz'd at this superstition, I ask'd whether the women were shrifted thus by the <hi>Cazi;</hi> but I found that the <hi>Cazi</hi>'s Wives confess and absolve the women and maids.</p>
                        <p>One more strange custom they have, that when a man is upon the point of death, they take a little Dog and set it upon the expiring parties brest. When he is just breathing his last, they put the mouth of the Dog to the mouth of the person dying, and cause him to bark twice in that posture, that the Soul of the deceas'd may enter into the Dog, who they say will deliver it into the hands of the Angel appointed to receive it. Moreover when any Dog happ'ns to dye, they carry him out of the City, and pray to God for the Carrion, as if the Beast receiv'd any kindness after death by their Prayers.</p>

                        <p>THere are some Beasts which the <hi>Gaurs</hi> do mightily respect, and to which they give a great deal of Honour. There are others which they as much abhor, and which they endeavour'd to destroy as much as in them lies, believing that they were not created by God, but that they came out of the body of the Devil, whose ill nature they retain.</p>
                        <p>The Beasts which they principally admire are the Cow, the Oxe, and the Dog. They are expresly forbid to eat of the flesh of a Cow or an Oxe, or to kill them. The reason why they so esteem these Creatures is, because the Oxe labours for man, and Ploughs the Ground that produces his food. As for the Cow they more dearly affect her for the Milk she gives, but especially for the purifying qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of her Urine.</p>
                        <p>The Creatures which they abhor are Adders, Serpents, Lizards, Toads, Frogs, Creyfish, Rats, Mice, but above all the rest Cats; which they say are the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Devil, who gave them so much strength that a man can hardly kill them; so that they rather suffer the inconveniency of Rats and Mice, than ever to keep a Cat in their Houses.</p>
                        <p>As for the other Animals before-mention'd, if any of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> fall sick, they hire poor people to go and find those Creatures out and kill them; which they reck'n in the number of those good works that comfort the Souls of the deceas'd. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they hate them so, is, because they believe the Devils make use of them to torment the Damn'd; and therefore they do a work of charity that destroy them, whereby they mitigate the pains and torments of Souls in Hell.</p>
                        <p>The last King of these <hi>Gaurs</hi> was <hi>Sha-Iesherd,</hi> who was driv'n out of his Country by <hi>Omar</hi> the second, successor to <hi>Mahomet.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>How the</hi> Armenians <hi>Consecrate and Administer the Sacrament.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>SInce the <hi>Armenians</hi> Traded into <hi>Europe</hi> and began to be Travellers, their Churches are better set out then they were heretofore. They spare no cost to adorn the Choir and the Altar; you tread upon rich Carpets, and for the structure and embellishments of it, they employ the best Workmen and the choicest Materials they can meet with. From the body of the Church to the Choir there is usually an ascent of five or six Steps. Nor is there above one Altar in any Church, upon which they set the Consecrated Bread, before they set the Chalice where the Wine is. When the Mass for the Ceremony is said by an Arch-bishop, at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Gospel they light an abundance of Wax Tapers, which Tapers are like Torches. After the Gospel is read, several of the <hi>Noviciates</hi> take sticks in their Hands about five foot long, at the end whereof are Latten Plates with little Bells hanging about them, which when they are shak'd, imitate the sound of Cymbals. Other <hi>Noviciates</hi> there are which hold a Copper Plate in their Hands hung about with Bells, which they strike one against another: and at the same time the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> sing together indifferent Harmoniously. All this while the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop has two Bishops of each side of him, who are in the room of a Dean and a Sub-dean; and when it is time, he goes and unlocks a Window in the Wall on the Gospel side, and takes out the Chalice where the Wine is. Then with all his Musick he takes a turn about the Altar, upon which he at length sets down the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, saying certain Prayers. After that, with the Chalice in his hand, and the Bread upon the Chalice, he turns toward the people, who presently prostrate themselves upon the Ground, beat their Brests, and kiss the Earth, while the Arch-bishop pronounces these words; <hi>This is the Lord who gave his Body and Blood for you.</hi> Then he turns toward the Altar, and eats the Bread dip'd in the Wine; for they never drink the Wine, but only dip the Bread in it. That done, the Arch-bishop turns once more toward the people with the Bread and Chalice in his hand, and they that will receive, come one after another to the bottom of the Choir, whither it is not lawful for any Lay-person whatsoever to ascend; to whom the Arch-bishop gives the Bread dip'd in Wine that is in the Chalice, which Bread is without leven, flat, and round, about as thick as a Crown, and as big as the Host of the Mass, being Consecrated the day before by the Priest, whose Office it is. They never put Water in their Communion-Wine; affirming that Water is for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and that Christ when he instituted the Holy Supper drank it pure, without any mixture of Water.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Armenians</hi> come to the Communion, the Arch-bishop or the Priest says these words: <hi>I confess and believe that this is the Rody and Blood of the Son of God, who takes away the sins of the World, who is not only ours, but the Salvation of all Mankind.</hi> The Priest repeats these words three times to the people, to instruct them and to teach them to what end they receive the Sacrament. Every time the Priest says the words, the people say after him word for word; and when the Priest serves the people, he breaks the Host into little bits which he dips in the Wine, and gives to every one of the Communicants. That which I most wonder at is, that they give the Communion to Children of two or three months old, which their Mothers bring in their arms; though many times, the Children put it out of their mouths again. They never administer the Sacrament all the time of their Lent, for then they never say Mass but upon <hi>Sunday</hi> noon, which they call Low-Mass, at which time they never see the Priest, who has a Curtain drawn before the Altar, and only reads the Gospel and Creed aloud. Sometimes upon <hi>Thursday</hi> in the Passion week
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106224:105"/>
they say Low-Mass about noon, and then they Confess and administer the Sacrament: But generally they stay 'till Saturday, and then the Communicants, after they have receiv'd, are permitted to eat Fish, Eggs, Butter, Oyl, or any thing else except Flesh. Upon <hi>Easter-day,</hi> by break of day, the Priest says Low-Mass, Confesses, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, after which it is lawful to eat Flesh. But the Beasts must be kill'd upon <hi>Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and not so much as upon <hi>Easter-eve.</hi> They have four other Feasts in the year, wherein they observe the same Ceremony, eating neither Flesh, Fish, Eggs, Butter, nor Oyl for eight days: which four Feasts are <hi>Christmas,</hi> the <hi>Ascention,</hi> the <hi>Annunciation,</hi> and St. <hi>George</hi>'s. Before this last Feast they stretch their devotion to the utmost, for some will fast three days, some five, one after another.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the ordination of their Priesthood; and their Austerities.</head>
                     <p>WHen a Father designs his Son to the Priesthood, he carries him to the Priest, who puts the Cope, op'n on both sides, about his Shoulders; after which the Father and Mother take him home again. This Ceremony is repeated seven times in several years, according to the years of the young Child, 'till he come to be of age to say Mass. If he be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for a Monk, but for the Priesthood, after the fourth time of putting on the <hi>Chasuble</hi> or op'n Cope, they marry him: for their Priests marry once, but if that Wife dye, if they intend to marry again, they must give over saying Mass. The six first Ceremonies being over, when the Youth comes to the age of 18 years, at what time they are capable of saying Mass, as well those who are design'd for Monks, as those who are marry'd Priests, they proceed to the seventh and last Ceremony, which must be perform'd by an Archbishop or a Bishop; who invests the young Priest with all the Habits which the Priests wear that say Mass. That being done, he goes into the Church, out of which he is not to depart for a whole year; during all which time he is altogether employ'd in the service of the Church. The Priest who is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, must be five days after he has said Mass before he returns home to eat or drink, or lye with his Wife. And as well the Monks as Priests, when they intend to say Mass again, must remain five days in the Church, without either going to bed or touching any thing with their hands, unless it be the Spoon where-with they eat their meat: not daring all the while to spit or blow their noses. The next five days after they have said Mass, though such days upon which they might otherwise eat Flesh and Fish, they are oblig'd to seed upon nothing else but Eggs without Butter, and Rice boyl'd with Water and Salt. The morning before they celebrate Mass, if the Priest have by chance swallow'd a drop of Water, he must not say Mass.</p>
                     <p>Their Austerities are such, that many of their Bishops never eat Flesh or Fish above four times a year; but more then that, when they come to be Archbishops, they only live upon Pulse. They have six months and three days in a year wherein they keep <hi>Lent,</hi> or particular Fasts, which you please to call them; and during all that time, as well the Ecclesiastical persons as the Laity, feed only upon Bread, and some few Herbs which grow in their Gardens. There was an <hi>Armenian</hi> of <hi>Zulpha</hi> whose super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition was so great, that he made his Horse to fast with him, allowing him but very little either to eat or drink for a whole week together. As for the poor labouring people, they only feed upon Pulse, boyl'd in Water and Salt: for during their chief <hi>Lent,</hi> they are permitted no more then others, to eat either Butter or Oyl; nay though they lay a dying, it is not lawful for them to eat Flesh upon those days wherein that diet is forbidd'n. They may only eat Wall-nuts or Small-nuts, Almonds or Pista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or some such other Fruit that affords no Oyl; and they have this farther liberty, to pound them, and put them among their Pulse or their Herbs, and boyl them with Rice.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of their Baptism.</head>
                     <p>'TIS the custom of the <hi>Armenians</hi> to Baptize their Infants upon Sunday; or if they Baptize any upon the week-days, it is only in case of necessity, when they think they will not live. The Midwise carries the Infant to Church, and holds it in her arms, 'till either the Archbishop, the Bishop, or the Priest has said some part of the Form of Baptism. Then he that baptizes takes the Infant which is naked, and plunges it in the Water, and then taking it out again, puts it into the hands of the God-father, and goes on with the Prayers. While he reads them, with the Cotton which he has in his hand he twists a string about half an Ell long. He makes another also of red Silk, which is flat; then twisting those two strings together, he puts them about the Child's neck. They say, that these two strings, one of white Cotton, and the other of red Silk, signifies the Blood and Water which flow'd from the Body of CHRIST, when he was wounded with the Lance upon the Cross. Having ty'd the cord about the neck of the Child, he takes the holy Oyl and anoints the Child in several parts of the body, making the sign of the Cross in every place where he drops the Oyl; every time pronouncing these words, <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</hi> He first anoints the Forehead, then the Chin, then the Stomach, the Arm-holes, the Hands and Feet.</p>
                     <p>As to the making this Oyl, you must know, that every seven years, upon the Eve of our <hi>Lady</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> against which day they observe a small <hi>Lent</hi> of eight days, the Patriarch makes this holy Oyl; there being no person but he who has power to make it. He uses all sorts of fragrant Flowers, and Aromatical Drugs; but the principal Flower is that which the <hi>Armenians</hi> call in their Language <hi>Balassan-Jagué,</hi> we in ours, the <hi>Flower of Paradise.</hi> When the Oyl is made, the Patriarch sends two Bottles to all the Covents of <hi>Asia, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> without which they cannot baptize.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremony of Baptism being over, the God-father goes out of the Church with the Infant in his arms, and a Taper of white Wax in each hand. According to the quality of the person, when the Child is carry'd out of the Church, the Trumpets, Drums, Hautboys, and other Instruments of the Country make a hideous noise, and go before the Infant to the Parents House, where being arriv'd, the God-father delivers the Child to the Mother. She prostrates her self at the same time before the God-father, kissing his feet; and while she continues in that posture, the God-father kisses her head. Neither the Father nor God-father names the Child, but he that baptizes gives him the Name of the Saint whose Festival falls upon the Sunday on which the Child is baptiz'd. If there be no Saint's day that Sunday in the Almanack, they take the next Name whose Festival succeeds the Sunday of Baptism; so that they have no affected Names among them. Upon the return of the God-father with the Child home, there is a Feast prepar'd for all the Kindred and Friends, and him that baptiz'd the Infant, with whom all the Priests and Monks of the Covent, at least of the Parish, go along. The poor people were wont to be so prodigal at these Feasts, as also upon their Marriages and Burials, that the next day they had not wherewithal to to buy Victuals, much less to pay what they have borrow'd for so needless an expence. But now the poor <hi>Armenians</hi> are grown so cunning to avoid the Bastinado's which are giv'n to Debtors upon the soles of the Feet, when they cannot pay, according to the custom of <hi>Persia;</hi> that they carry the Child to Church upon the week-days, without any Ceremony, with tears in their eyes, pretending it to be sickly and like to dye, and so make no Feasts at all.</p>
                     <p>If the Women lye in fifteen or twenty days, or two months before <hi>Christmas,</hi> they defer the baptizing the Infant 'till the Festival, provided the Infant be healthy. Then in all the Cities and Villages where the <hi>Armenians</hi> live, if there be any River or Pond, they make ready two or three flat-bottom'd Boats, spread with Carpets to walk upon; in one of which upon <hi>Christmas-day</hi> they set up a kind of an Altar. In the morning by Sun-rising all the <hi>Armenian</hi> Clergy, as well of that place as of the parts adjoyning, get into the Boats in their Habits, with the Cross and Banner. Then
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106224:106"/>
they dip the Cross in the Water three times, and every time they drop the Holy Oyl upon it. After that they use the ordinary form of Baptism, which being done, the Arch-bishop or the Minister plunges the Infant in the River or Pond three times, saying the usual words, <hi>I Baptise, &amp;c.</hi> and the same anointings as before: though it seems a wonder to me that the extremity of the weather does not kill the Child. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> is many times present at this ceremony when it is perform'd at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> riding on Horse-back to the side of the River with all his Nobility. The Ceremony being over he goes to <hi>Zulpha</hi> to the <hi>Kelonter</hi>'s House, where there is an entertainment prepar'd for him. Neither is there any place in the World where a King may be entertain'd with less charge than in <hi>Persia.</hi> For if any private person invite the King, and that His Majesty pleases to do him that Honour, 'tis but for the inviter to go to the chief of the Officers, and to carry him twenty <hi>Tomans,</hi> or three hundred Crowns, and to tell him withall, that the King has promis'd to accept of a small Collation with his Slave. For then the Governour is oblig'd to send to the House of him that treats the King all things necessary for the entertainment. Else it were impossible to be done, in regard the King eats in nothing but in Gold Plate. At the end of the Feast the King is always presented with some <hi>European</hi> Rarity, not less worth than four or five thousand Crowns. Or if the person have no Rarity to present, it suffices to offer in a Bason the value in <hi>Venetian Ducats</hi> of Gold, with all the submission imaginable. Besides all this, some Presents must be giv'n to some of the Lords and principal Eunuchs of his train; and others sent to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if living, and to the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> his Wives and Sisters. Thus though the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment may be made with little trouble, yet otherwise it proves somewhat expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; though the <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Zulpha</hi> are well enough able to bear the charge. I was twice at this Ceremony upon <hi>Christmas</hi> day in <hi>Ispahan.</hi> The first time I saw <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> and the second time <hi>Sha-Abas</hi> the second, who drank both so hard, that in their Drink they committed those crimes that very much stain'd their memories: For <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> returning home stab'd his Wife, the Mother of <hi>Sha-Abas. Sha-Abas</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time returning home in drink, would needs drink on, and force three wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to drink with him; who finding he would not give over, stole out of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The King perceiving them gone without taking leave, in a mad humour sent his Eunuchs for them, and caus'd them to be thrown into the Fire, where the poor wom<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>THE <hi>Armenians</hi> Marry their Children before either party have seen each other, nay before the Fathers or Brothers know any thing of it- And they whom they intend to Marry must agree to what their Fathers or Parents command them. When the Mothers have agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they tell their Husbands, who approve what they have done. Upon this Approbation, the Mother of the Boy, with two old Women and a Priest come to the House where the Mother of the Daughter lives, and present her a Ring from him whom they intend to betroth. The Boy appears afterwards, and the Priest reads something out of the Gospel as a blessing upon both parties; after which they give him a sum of Money according to the quality of the Father of the Girl. That done, they present the company with drink, and this is call'd a betrothing or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancing. Sometimes they agree a Marriage when the Children are not above two or three years old; sometimes two women that are friends being both with Child at one time together, will make a match between the two Children before they are born, if the one be a Boy and the other a Girl. So soon as they are born the Contract is made; and when once the Boy has giv'n the Ring, thought it be twenty years after before they are Marry'd, he is bound every year upon <hi>Easter-</hi>day to send his Mistris a new Habit with all the trimming belonging to it according to her quality. Three
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106224:106"/>
days before the Celebration of Marriage, the Father and Mother of the Boy prepare a Feast, which is carry'd to the house of the Father and Mother of the Girl, where the kindred of both parties meet. The Men are in one place by themselves, and the Women in another; for they never eat together at publick Feasts. The Evening before the Nuptials the Bridegroom sends a Habit to the Bride; and some time after he comes to receive what the Mother of the Bride has provided for him, on her part. If the Bride has no Mother, some ancient Woman next a-kin dresses the Bride. At length the Bride gets upon one Horse, and the Bridegroom upon another, each Horse being sumptuously harness'd, with Bridles and Saddles of Gold and Silver, if the persons be rich: those that are poor, and have not Horses of their own, repair to the Great men, who willingly lend theirs upon such an occasion. As they set out from the Virgins habitation, the Bridegroom goes before with a Veil of Carnation-Tiffany upon his Head, or else of Gold and Silver Net-work, the Meshes whereof are very close, that reaches below the Stomach. He holds in his Hand one end of a Girdle some three or four Ells long, and the Bride that rides behind holds the other. She is also cover'd with a large white Veil from head to foot, that spreads also a good way over the Horse. Under which Veil, that rather seems a large white Sheet, the Bride is hid in such a manner, that there is nothing to be seen of her but her Eyes. Two Men walk on either side of each Horse; and if they be Children of three or four years old (for so young they marry) there are three or four Men to hold them in the Saddle, according to the quality of their Parents. A great Train of young Men, the kindred and acquaintance of both parties, follow after, some a-horseback, some a-foot, with Tapers in their hands, as if they were going in Procession: and besides all these, the Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Country, all attending to the Church-door. When they are alighted, every one makes way for the Bridegroom and Bride, who advance up to the foot of the Altar, still holding the Girdle in their hands. Then the Bridegroom and the Bride meet, and lean forehead to forehead. Then comes the Priest, and turning his back to the Altar, lays his Bible upon their Heads, instead of a Desk, a weight suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently heavy, as being a thick ponderous Folio. There he lets it lye while he reads the Form of Matrimony, which Office is most usually perform'd by a Bishop or an Archbishop. The Form is very much like ours. The Bishop demands the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, <hi>Wilt thou have such a one to thy Wife?</hi> then to the Bride he says, <hi>Wilt thou have such a one for thy Husband?</hi> to which they both answer with a nod of the Head. The Matrimonial Benediction being giv'n, they hear Mass; which being ended, they return both together to the Daughters habitation, in the same order as they set out. These Nuptials last three days: where the Women drink more than the Men. The Man goes to Bed first, the Woman pulling off the man's Breeches, though she does not lay aside her Veil 'till the Candle be put out. Let it be what time in the year it will, the Woman rises before day. So that there be some <hi>Armenians</hi> that in ten years after they are marry'd never saw their Wives faces, nor ever heard them speak. For though her Husband may speak to her, and all the rest of her kindred, yet she never answers but with a Nod. The Women never eat with their Husbands; but if the Men feast their Frinds to day, the Women feast theirs the next day.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SO soon as any person dyes, one appointed for the Services of the Dead runs immediately to the Church to fetch a Pot of Holy-water, which he presently pours into a great Vessel full of Water, into which they put the dead Corps. This man is call'd <hi>Mordichou,</hi> or the person that washes the Dead; which <hi>Mordichou's</hi> are so much detested among the people, that it is an ignominy to eat or drink with those sort of people. Whatever the party deceas'd has about him at the time of his death belongs to them, though it be any excellent Jewel; for it is the custom of the East to lye in their Breeches, Shirt, and Wastcoat, in regard they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106224:107"/>
never make use of Bed-cloaths. So soon as the Corps is wash'd, they dress it with a clean white Shirt, a pair of Breeches, a Wastcoat, and a Bonnet, all new, never having been worn before. Then they put the Body in a linnen Sack, and sow up the mouth of it. That being done, the Priests come and take up the Body to carry it to Church, which is attended by all the kindred and friends of the deceas'd, with every one a Taper in his hand. Being come to Church, they set down the Corps before the Altar, where the Priest says certain Prayers; and then setting up lighted Tapers round about the Corps, they leave it so all night. The next day in the morning a Bishop or an ordinary Priest says Mass, at the end whereof they carry the Body before the door of the Bishop's house, attended as before; at what time the Bishop comes forth and says a Prayer for the Soul of the deceas'd. Then eight or ten of the poorer sort that are next at hand, carry the Body to the Church-yard. All the way they sing certain Dirges, which the Priests continue, while the Body is let down into the Grave. Then the Bishop takes three handfuls of Earth, and throws them one after another into the Grave, pronouncing these words; <hi>From Earth thou cam'st, to Earth thou shalt return, and stay there 'till our Lord comes.</hi> These words being said, they fill up the Grave. Those of the kindred and friends that will go back find a Collation ready; and if any other persons will go along, they are not refus'd. For seven days also they allow Dinners and Suppers to certain Priests and poor people, if they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of ability: believing no Soul departed can be sav'd, unless the survivors are at that expence. Whence it comes to pass, that so many of the poor people are so miserable, and Slaves to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> by borrowing Money to desray those expences, which they are not able to pay again.</p>
                     <p>When an Archbishop or a Bishop dyes, they add this farther Ceremony, that an Archbishop or a Bishop writes a little Note, and cutting op'n the Sack puts the Note into the Hand of the deceas'd, wherein are these words; <hi>Remember thy self, that from Earth thou cam'st, and to Earth thou shalt return.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Slave dye before enfranchiz'd, when the Body is brought into the Church, the Master writes a Note, wherein are these words; <hi>Let him not grieve, I make him free, and give him his liberty.</hi> For they believe that he would be reproach'd in the other World for being a Slave, for which his Soul might suffer tribulation. If the Master be dead, the Mistress does the same. If an <hi>Armenian</hi> makes away himself, they never carry the Body out of the door of the house, but make a hole in the wall, where they can most conveniently, and carry him to his Grave without any Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>The night preceding the Feast of the <hi>Holy Cross,</hi> Men, Women, and Children go to the Church-yard, whither they carry good store of Food, not forgetting their Wine. Immediately they fall a weeping over the Graves of the dead, and after they have spent some time in that doleful Exercise, they all fall to eating and drinking; thus passing the whole night by turns, in blub'ring, eating, and bubbing.</p>
                     <p>As for the poor people, they would think themselves undone, and the most unfortunate in the world, should they want Provision and Wine to go to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, the night before the Feast of St. <hi>George,</hi> where they go to frolick it, rather then to pray for the Dead.</p>
                     <p>There may be some few <hi>Armenians</hi> that embrace <hi>Mahometanism</hi> for worldly Interest, but they are generally the most obstinate persons in the world, and most firm to their superstitious Principles.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Examples of the Constancy of the</hi> Armenians, <hi>in maintaining their Religion against the Persecutions of the</hi> Mahometans.</head>
                     <p>IT is the custom of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> that when any one of them apostatizes, and desires to return again to the Church, he cannot have Absolution but at the same City or Village where he first abjur'd his Religion.</p>
                     <p>Now it happen'd that a young <hi>Armenian</hi> being sent to <hi>Smyrna</hi> with a very considerable quantity of Goods, and falling to debauchery, turn'd <hi>Mahometan,</hi> to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106224:107"/>
the end he might defraud his Father and his Brethren of their Estate, according to <hi>Haly</hi>'s Law, already mention'd. But after he had spent good part of the Goods in Debauchery, he return'd to the <hi>Three Churches,</hi> where the Grand Patriarch liv'd, to be absolv'd from his Fault; but the Patriarch telling him he must go to the Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> he went accordingly; and in some few days after he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the Penance enjoyn'd him, he went to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and with a great Resolution, <hi>Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>you know that some years since I turn'd</hi> Mahometan; <hi>now I come to declare before ye that I have repented, and do repent of the foul Crime I committed, when I deny'd the Saviour of the World, and embrac'd your wicked Law.</hi> The <hi>Cadi,</hi> who thought it had been at first only some evaporation of Extravagance, endeavour'd to reclaim him by fair words and promises; but when he heard him persist in his resolution, when he heard him curse and blaspheme <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he caus'd him to be carry'd to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where he was cut to pieces immediately. For no persons go with more courage and joy to suffer for their Faith, then the <hi>Armenians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1651 there happen'd to be a Wedding between a young <hi>Turk</hi> and a Virgin of the same Nation. To this Wedding was invited an <hi>Armenian</hi> Lady, who was a great friend of the Bridegroom's Mother. The <hi>Armenian</hi> had an only Son of about twelve years of age, that earnestly desir'd to go along with her; at first she refus'd him, knowing that after the age of five or six years, no Youth is permitted to be in company with the <hi>Turkish</hi> Women or Maids. But the Boy still pressing his Mother, and being seconded by an Aunt, who to please her Nephew, told her she might let him go in Girls Apparel; at last the indulgent Mother, over-rul'd by the importunity of the Child, took him along with her in a female dress. Three days the solemnity of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Weddings last: but the very first day, an old <hi>Gipsy-Turk</hi> casting her Eye upon the young <hi>Armenian,</hi> and finding him too sparkish and too nimble for a Girl, suspected his Sex; and calling his Mother aside, told her, that by all the gestures and actions of the Child, she could be no Girl, but a Boy in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise. The Mother not only deny'd the matter, but also seem'd highly offended at the old Womans suspition; who as much incens'd to have her judgment que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, decoy'd the Child among the Eunuchs of the Family, and caus'd him to be search'd; and finding her self in the right, spred it presently about the house. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the people cry'd that the Chambers were defil'd, that the <hi>Armenian</hi> Lady had done it in derision of their Law; and seizing Mother, Aunt, and Youth, carry'd them all before the <hi>Basha,</hi> demanding Justice. The <hi>Basha</hi> dismiss'd the Mother and the Aunt, but kept the Youth six or sev'n days, hoping the rage of the people would be over. But in vain he strove to plead for the Child, though the Father offer'd them half the weight of him in Gold, for the <hi>Basha</hi> was forc'd to deliver him up into the hands of the marry'd Womans kindred; who carry'd the Child to the Market-place of the City, where they stript him stark naked; and first they flea'd him from his Neck behind down to the Wast, and so left him with a Guard upon him all night. The <hi>Cadi</hi> and <hi>Moullah's</hi> exhorted the Child to turn <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and they would preserve him from further mischief. His Mother beg'd him to have pity upon her and himself, and to turn <hi>Mahometan</hi> to save his life. But neither tears, nor all the tender words that grief and affection could inspire, could shake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of the Infant, who with a resolute utterance answer'd, that he had hitherto suffer'd, and still would suffer patiently; and that nothing griev'd him, but that his Mother should exhort him to deny his Saviour. Next day the pitiless <hi>Turks</hi> came and flea'd all his Breast and his Stomach, and so left him all night under a Guard, intending to have flea'd him part by part every day. But the <hi>Basha</hi> abhorring their Cruelty, came the next day with his Guards, and caus'd his Head to be cut off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Van</hi> is a City peopl'd as well with <hi>Armenians</hi> as <hi>Turks;</hi> so that it is a usual thing for the <hi>Armenian</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Boys to play together. One day it unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately fell out, that the Boys playing one among another, and flinging Stones at each other, an <hi>Armenian</hi> Boy hit a young <hi>Turk</hi> full upon the Temples, and strook him dead. Presently the other <hi>Turkish</hi> Boys and the Rabble seiz'd him, and carry'd him to the <hi>Basha;</hi> the Father and Mother of the Child slain follow'd with hideous out-crys, bawling for justice, or that the Boy should turn <hi>Mahometan</hi> to expiate his fault. The <hi>Armenian</hi> Parents offer'd a large sum of Money to redeem their Child; but the adverse party obstinate against all accommodation, the <hi>Basha</hi> was constrain'd to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106224:108"/>
deliver the Child, giving sentence that the young <hi>Armenian</hi> should endure the same death the <hi>Turk</hi> had suffer'd, and no other. Immediately the <hi>Turks</hi> hurry'd the poor Child to the place where he had unfortunately slain his play-fellow; and after the Parents of the young <hi>Turk</hi> had had the two first hits, he was presently brain'd by a show'r of Stones from the Rabble. Yet as near death as he knew himself to be, without any disturbance at all, he exhorted his weeping play-fellows to stand firm to the Faith of Jesus Christ, for which he was going to dye.</p>
                     <p>Another time an <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant coming from the <hi>Indies</hi> to Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> went to the Coffee-house according to custom, being a rendesvous of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in the Town. There falling into discourse, by reason of the heat of the weather, he took off his Bonnet made after the <hi>Armenian</hi> fashion of divers Colours, and laid it behind him, keeping his black Cap only upon his head. When the <hi>Moullah</hi> came about to hasten the people to go away according to the custom, which I have already declar'd, the <hi>Armenian</hi> hastily rising up, a <hi>Turk,</hi> concealing the Merchant's Bonnet, clap'd his own Bonnet upon his head. Upon that all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Merchants that were there came and congratulated the <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant, telling him, how glad they were to see that he had embrac'd the good Law. At which words the <hi>Armenian</hi> surpriz'd, takes off the Turbant, throws it to the Ground before all the Company, and stamp'd it under foot. This action of contempt so enrag'd the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they carry'd him before the <hi>Basha,</hi> before whom it was in vain to justifie himself, or to affirm that the Turbant was malitiously put upon his head; for the <hi>Turks</hi> swore the contrary, and that he took it of his own accord, and therefore he must either turn <hi>Turk</hi> or dye for it. Upon his refusal they put him in Prison, and in a few days the sentence was brought him from the <hi>Mufti</hi> and <hi>Cadi,</hi> that he must either turn or be burnt alive. The severity of the sentence overpower'd him at first to embrace the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law. But four or five years after returning from the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Cairo,</hi> he came where the <hi>Basha</hi> was sitting in Council with the Grandees of the Country, and getting as near the <hi>Mufti</hi> as he could, and throwing his Turbant in his face; <hi>There Dog,</hi> said he, <hi>Thou wert the cause that I have worn it so long, of which I have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and do repent from the bottom of my heart; for I know that neither thou nor thy Law are worth a Straw.</hi> At the same time the croud laid hold of him, and drag'd him to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where he dy'd in the midst of the flames with an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</p>
                     <p>A rich Merchant of <hi>Zulpha,</hi> call'd <hi>Cotgia Soultenon,</hi> was so well belov'd by <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> that he often went to Dine at his house, But one day it fell out that the King having eat and drank to excess, upon his return home fell crop-sick, upon which the report ran that the <hi>Armenian</hi> had poyson'd him. Which report coming to his ears, fearing least the King should dye, and himself be put to cruel Torments, he took a dose of Poyson and dy'd. Which when the King, who was well again the next day, understood, he was very much troubl'd for his death.</p>
                     <p>The same <hi>Cotgia Soultenon</hi> had a <hi>Cafer</hi> sent him from <hi>Melinda</hi> for a Slave; who being young and very apprehensive soon learnt the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Languages, and was instructed in the Christian Religion, and Christen'd by the name of <hi>Huzod</hi> or <hi>Joseph.</hi> After his Master's death he turn'd <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and so continu'd twenty years. At the end whereof returning to <hi>Zulpha,</hi> he beg'd pardon of the Church; and all the rest of his days so crucify'd himself with Fasting, that every one pitty'd him; and when the <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishops told him he had done well, he made no other answer, but that he was not worthy to live upon the Earth who had deny'd his Saviour, only he hop'd that he would have mercy upon him; and so continu'd his austere penance 'till he dy'd.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Author's reception at the Court of <hi>Persia</hi> in his sixth and last Voyage, and what he did there during his stay at <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IArriv'd at <hi>Ispahan</hi> the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1664. So soon as the <hi>Nazar</hi> was inform'd of my arrival, he sent the <hi>Kelonter</hi> or chief of the <hi>Armenians</hi> with seven or eight more to congratulate my arrival, and to assure me of all the kind Offices he could do me. The next day he sent the same <hi>Armenians</hi> with four Horses; and to tell me that the King had a desire to see what I had brought; for which purpose the <hi>Kelonter</hi> had order to furnish me with men. Thereupon I took Horse, accompany'd by all the <hi>Franks</hi> that were at <hi>Zulpha.</hi> When I came to Court, I was brought into the place where all the great Ambassadors had audience, where I found attending the <hi>Nazar,</hi> and Father <hi>Raphael</hi> superior of the order of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> ready to deliver me my Box of Jewels which I had left with him in the Covent for more security. After I had expos'd my Goods upon a fair Table cover'd with a Carpet of Gold and Silver, and that the <hi>Nazar</hi> had dispos'd every thing in order with his own hand, the King enter'd, attended only by three Eunuchs for his Guard, and two old men, whose office it was to pull off his Shooes when he goes into any Room spread with Gold and Silk Carpets, and to put them on again when he goes forth. The King had nothing on but a single pair of Drawers of Taffata, chequer'd red and white, which came half way the Leg, his feet being bare; a short Cassock that came but half way his body, with a large Cloak of Cloth of Gold with hanging-sleeves down to the Ground, furr'd with Sable Martin. The first thing I shew'd was a large Candlestick of Chrystal of the Rock, the richest piece of that nature that ever was seen. The next was a suit of Tapestry hangings held up by several men, as I had appointed. The <hi>Nazar</hi> then caus'd me to advance and do my obeysance to the King, who presently knowing my Face again; <hi>Oh,</hi> said he to the <hi>Nazar, This is the</hi> Fringui Aga <hi>who sold me so many Rarities about six years ago, when</hi> Mahomet Beg <hi>was Athemadoulet.</hi> After that the <hi>Nazar</hi> shew'd him all my Rarities as they lay in order. Among the rest I besought His Majesty by Frier <hi>Raphaël,</hi> to accept of a great Steel Mirror, which when he look'd in, he wonder'd to see his Face so big. But when Frier <hi>Raphael</hi> had told him the nature of it, he caus'd it to be held to one of his Eunuchs, which had a monstrous Hawk Nose, the sight whereof held him in laughter and divertisement for above a quarter of an hour. After that the King retir'd, leaving me alone with the <hi>Nazar</hi> and Friar <hi>Raphel.</hi> As for my Jewels I put them up my self, and had a place assign'd me to Lock them up and keep the Key, but for my large pieces of Goldsmiths work, the <hi>Nazar</hi> committed them to the trust of one of the principal Officers of the House.</p>
                     <p>The next day early in the morning the <hi>Nazar</hi> sent for me and Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> and made his Secretary write down the price of every thing, according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He had also his own Artists to prize them; but that I did not value, in regard I knew the price much better then they. After he had shew'd the Jewels, price and all to the King, we were several times before we could agree; but at length he told me, that the King would give me Twenty-five in the Hundred profit for all the Stones; leaving me the Pearls, which he thought I might put off at a better price in the <hi>Indies;</hi> which was an offer I could not refuse, and therefore I sign'd the Agreement according to the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s desire: Which when his Majesty had seen, he bid the <hi>Nazar</hi> tell me I should be his Jeweller in Ordinary, and that for my sake all the <hi>Franks</hi> should be the better us'd within his Territories, and that I should have any favour of him that I desir'd. I besought his Majesty to give me his Patent with his Seal affix'd, whereby I might be priviledg'd to Trade in his Dominions, without paying Custom for such and such Merchandize, and in in such manner as I should think fitting. I also besought him graciously to grant his Protection to a Nephew of mine, whom I had left at <hi>Tauris</hi> to learn the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that he might be serviceable to his Majesty when I was dead and gone.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106224:109"/>
Thereupon he caus'd my Nephew to be enrol'd presently as one of his Domestick Servants, and order'd the <hi>Nazar</hi> to take particular care of him.</p>
                     <p>The next day after my agreement with the <hi>Nazar,</hi> the King gave audience in the great Hall of the Palace to the Ambassador of the <hi>Vsbeck-Tartars.</hi> All the Lords and Officers of the Crown stood in the Court where the Ambassador was to pass: there were also nine stately Horses, whose Furniture was very rich, and all different. Two Harnesses were cover'd with Diamonds, two with Rubies, two with Emralds, two with Turquoises, and one embroider'd with fair Pearls. Had he been an Ambassador from a Monarch for whom the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had had a greater esteem than he had for the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> there had been thirty Horses: for according to the value which the King puts upon the Prince that sends to him, he either augments or abates of the number of his Horses of State. Every Horse is ty'd by the Reins to a Nail of Gold fasten'd in the Ground, with a Hammer of Gold lying by. There was another Nail of Gold behind, with a Cord ty'd to it, that held their hinder legs. They set also before every Horse a Caldron of Gold, out of which they draw up Water into a great Manger; though all this be only for State, for they never water their Horses in that place.</p>
                     <p>Out of the first Court the Ambassador enter'd into a large Gallery, between a long File of Musqueteers on each side. Thence he enter'd into a Garden through an Alley about eight Fathom broad, all pav'd with great Marble Stones, in the middle of which runs a Channel of Water four Foot wide, with several Water-works that spurted out of the Channel at equal distances. On each side of the Walk to the Hall where the King sat, there is a Pond almost as long as the Walk, and in the middle of the Pond another sort of Water-works. Several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army were rang'd all along the Alley; and at the end of one of the Ponds were four Lions ty'd; and at the end of the other, three Tigers couchant upon Carpets of Silk, having Men to guard them with Half-pikes in their hands. The Hall took up more ground in length then in bredth, being op'n every way; the Cieling was sustain'd by sixteen wooden Pillars, of eight pannels every one, and of a prodigious thickness and height. As well the Cieling as the Pillars were all painted with Foliage-work in Gold and Azure, with certain other Colours mix'd therewith. In the middle of the Hall was a Vase of excellent Marble, with a Fountain throwing out Water after several manners. The Floor was spread with Gold and Silk Carpets, made on purpose for the place: and near to the Vase was a low Scaffold one Foot high, twelve Foot long, and eight wide, cover'd with a magnificent Carpet. Upon this Scaffold sate the King upon a four-square Cushion of Cloth of Gold, with another Cushion behind him cover'd with the same, set up against a great Tap'stry-Hanging, wrought with <hi>Persian</hi> Characters, containing the Mysteries of the Law. On each side of the King stood several Eunuchs with Musquets in their hands. The King commanded the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> and four others to sit down by him, and the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> made me a sign to sit down; but the King knowing how little the <hi>Franks</hi> care for sitting cross-leg'd, order'd me to be told that I might stand upright, if I thought good. The King was clad in a Silk streak'd with Gold: His Cloak was a Gold-ground with Flowers of Silk and Silver, Furr'd with a Martin Sable, the blackest and most glist'ring that ever was seen. His Girdle was very rich, and upon his Bonnet he wore a plume of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Feathers fasten'd with a transparent Jewel; in the middle of the Jewel was a Pear-fashion'd Pearl, set with great Topaze's and Rubies.</p>
                     <p>About half an hour after the King was sat, the <hi>Nazar</hi> and the Master of the Ceremonies brought the Ambassador, who neither himself nor any of his Train were very well clad, and caus'd him to stay at the foot of the steps into the Hall from the Garden. When the Ambassador had ascended the steps, he prostrated himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, then advancing nine or ten paces he did the same again; after which the Master of the Ceremonies caus'd him to sit down, leaving between him and the King space enough for eight men. After that I observ'd that the <hi>Nazar</hi> went often between the King and the Ambassador, and between the Ambassador and the King; but I could not tell what they said. So that I being by that time quite tyr'd, made my obeysance to the King, and went home to my Lodging.</p>
                     <p>The next day the <hi>Nazar</hi> signify'd to me that it was the King's pleasure to favour me with a compleat <hi>Calaat,</hi> or Habit of Honour, and to pay me my money.</p>

The next day in the Morning being sent for to the Court, I found the <hi>Nazar,</hi> the Grand Treasurer, and several other great Officers expecting me in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, where the Money lay ready in seal'd Bags.

                     <p>THE day following one of the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s principal Officers brought me the compleat <hi>Calaat,</hi> consisting of Vest, Tunick or Super-Vest, Girdle, and Bonnet. He also deliver'd me three Patents, seal'd by his Majesty and the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> which exempted me from paying any Customs within his Kingdom. Another to the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Schiras,</hi> with a little Seal or Signet, commanding him to let me have three Loads of good Wine when I travel'd that way. A third with his Signet, in favour of my Nephew at <hi>Tauris;</hi> wherein the King declar'd that he own'd him as his Domestick Servant, and that he was under his Protection.</p>

And whereas We have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to perfect some Business for Us, which so soon as he has finish'd, he is to bring to the holy and pure view. Therefore through, whatsoever Road or Coast of Our Thrice-spacious Kingdom the above-nam'd shall have a desire or occasion to pass, Let not the Receivers of the Palace, out of any seeming expectancy from the above-nam'd, give him any trouble or molestation. But let them know, that it is necessary for them to give him all honour, and to make much of him, that he may go where he pleases. And whereas the Seal of High Nature, the Light of the Universe of</hi> Kragon, <hi>of thrice-noble extraction, the Master of the Age, has illuminated and adorn'd this Writing, Let them rest there, and give Credence to it. By the thrice-high Command,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>But to return to the <hi>Calaat.</hi> You must take notice, that the <hi>Persians</hi> call a <hi>Calaat,</hi> any Present which one person makes to another inferior to him in dignity; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Vest alone, sometimes a Tunick with the Girdle only, sometimes a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, or a Horse, with Bridle and Saddle; to those in the Army the King sends a Sword or a Dagger, and all these go by the name of <hi>Calaat's.</hi> Secondly, you must take notice, that when the King sends a <hi>Calaat</hi> to a Governour of a Province, he names himself the person, that is to carry it. For both in <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> the Receiver of the King's Present is oblig'd to pay the Messenger, in so much that sometimes they hardly scape for a thousand <hi>Tomans.</hi> But when the <hi>Calaat</hi> is sent to any private person, the <hi>Nazar</hi> chooses out of his Domestick Servants one to carry it. I gave twenty-five <hi>Tomans</hi> into Father <hi>Raphael</hi>'s hand, who order'd his business with so good a grace, and so advantageously for my Purse, that he complemented away the Messenger very well satisfi'd with half.</p>
                     <p>The next day the <hi>Nazar</hi> sent to me to put on my <hi>Calaat,</hi> and to come and do my obeysance to the King, who was that day to go abroad. Thereupon I summon'd together all the <hi>Franks,</hi> and order'd the Trumpets and Drums to be made ready as I rode from the Palace home. For then the people come out to see who the King has honour'd that day, who is always known by his Habit, which is still the newest and gayest of all the rest.</p>
                     <p>It happen'd, that the King being indispos'd did not go away that day; however I apply'd my self to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> and told him how much I was oblig'd to the King for the honour he had done me, and that I was resolv'd to shew my self before the greatest Monarchs in <hi>Europe</hi> in the Habit he had bestow'd upon me; that they might behold the beauty and richness of my <hi>Calaat.</hi> The <hi>Nazar</hi> fail'd not to repeat my Compliment to his Majesty; who thereupon order'd me the <hi>Persian</hi> Cloak, with hanging-sleeves, and fac'd with sable Martins.</p>
                     <p>Two or three days after the <hi>Nazar</hi> sent for me again to Court, whither I went, accompany'd by the <hi>Zulphian Franks,</hi> as before. I was no sooner come to the Palace, but the <hi>Nazar</hi> met me in the great Hall, attended by two Officers, who carry'd the Cloak which the King had appointed for me, and presently taking the Cloak out of their hands, he put it about my shoulders, saying these words, <hi>It is the King's pleasure to honour thee entirely.</hi> It was a most magnificent piece of Silk, and very richly furr'd, having been valu'd at eight hundred Crowns. In this I was particularly beholding to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> who might have sent me my Cloak home to my Lodging as well as the <hi>Calaat;</hi> but he was pleas'd to put it upon my back in the Palace with his own hands, to spare me the charges of a new Present. After this the <hi>Nazar</hi> took me by the hand, and led me to the Hall, where the King was sitting upon a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106224:111"/>
large Cushion, having no more than twelve Eunuchs for his Guard; some with Bows and Arrows, and some with Musquets. By that time I had advanc'd two or three paces in the Hall, the <hi>Nazar</hi> order'd me to fall upon my knees, and touch the Ground with my forehead; then taking me by the hand, he led me within two or three paces of the place where the King was sitting, where I was order'd to make the same obeisance as before; after that he caus'd me to retire seven or eight paces, and there to stand. And then it was that His Majesty was pleas'd to tell me, that he had contriv'd the Models of several pieces, which he would have made in <hi>France;</hi> and ask'd me whether I would carry them along with me, or whether I would presently send them into <hi>France</hi> to be made up while I dispatch'd my business in the <hi>Indies?</hi> I told His Maiesty, that so soon as he would be pleas'd to deliver them to me, I would send them for <hi>France.</hi> After this and some other discourse I made my obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, and retir'd toward the door of the Hall. Having thus done my duty to the King, I went and kiss'd the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s hand; and then taking Horse at the Palace-Gate, with the rest of the <hi>Franks</hi> that accompany'd me, we rode home with the Trumpets and Drums of the Country before us. When we came to <hi>Zulpha</hi> with our Torches before us, for it was three hours after Sun-set, the Men and old Women came out of their Houses to see us pass along, and several presented us with Fruits, Sweet-meats, and Wine, obliging us to drink almost at every House 'till we got home.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> How the King was pleas'd to divertise himself in the Author's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</head>
                     <p>ABout two days after betimes in the Morning I was sent for to the Court in that hast, that I had scarce time to make me ready. When I came to Court, I found the <hi>Nazar,</hi> Father <hi>Raphel,</hi> and two <hi>Hollanders,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Nazar</hi> had began to cast a particular eye of favour all together. After we had stay'd a while, the <hi>Nazar</hi> brought us to the Room where the Ring was, sitting upon a low Pallet, with two Mattresses cover'd with a rich Carpet. He lean'd his back against a large Cushion four foot long, having before him eight or ten Plates of Fruits and Sweet-meats. Before him also stood two Bottles, with long round necks of Venice Chrystal stop'd with Pitch, full of <hi>Schiras</hi> Wine, with a Cup of pure Gold; upon one side a kind of a very small Fat and with a handle, within three or four Fingers full of the same Wine, with a Gold Ladle that held a good <hi>Chopine</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Bottles were for the King's drinking; that in the Fat for those that the King did the Honour to drink with him. After we came in and had made our several obeysances; said the King to Father <hi>Raphael, Raphael, bia, bia,</hi> that is, <hi>come hither, come hither,</hi> who thereupon rising, and falling upon his knees when he came near the King; <hi>Raphael,</hi> continu'd the King, <hi>if thou wilt drink Wine, stay here, if not, be gone.</hi> The Fryar unaccustom'd to drink Wine, reply'd that since His Majesty did him so great an Honour, he was willing to drink a little. <hi>'Tis very well,</hi> answer'd the King smiling, <hi>go then and take thy seat.</hi> Thereupon the King commanded one of the <hi>Dutch-men</hi> to fill some Wine, which he did, but with a trembling hand Heav'n knows, as never having been at such a Festival before. And I observ'd that having laid his Hat upon the Carpet; the King commanded him to put it on, it being a very ignominious thing in <hi>Persia</hi> to be bare-headed. Thus the great Ladle went about very smartly, considering it was but early in the Forenoon: But at length the King bethinking himself that the <hi>Franks</hi> were not used to drink without eating, gave such order, that immediately they spread before us a <hi>Sofra</hi> of Cloth of Gold instead of a Table-Cloth; and over that a Leather Covering of the same length and bredth, and over that a sort of Bread as long as the <hi>Sofra;</hi> for had the <hi>Sofra</hi> been ten Ells long, the Bread must have been as long. This Bread is no thicker then a piece of Paper, and folds like a Napkin. It is made with a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106224:112"/>
Rolling-pin, and bak'd upon Plates of Tinn'd Copper. This Bread is never eat'n, but only serves for a Table-Cloth to preserve what falls from the Dishes, and what every man leaves particularly upon his own Plate, which is all wrap'd up in the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and giv'n to the poor. Next to that they set upon one end of the <hi>Sofra</hi> a sort of most excellent Bread two foot long, and one broad, then which never was better eat'n in the World. By and by follow'd Boyl'd and Roast flesh and fish, with two Chests of Limons of <hi>Mazandran,</hi> and Granates from <hi>Schiras.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After we had made a large Breakfast, the King was pleas'd to put me upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of my Travels into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ask'd me what Princes I had had access to, and how many I knew by their faces? Then causing a Satchel to be brought him, he open'd it himself, and shew'd me several portraitures in Miniature. Presently I knew <hi>Sha-Gehan, Aurenge-Zebe,</hi> and three of his Sons; the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour; Sha-Est-Kan,</hi> and two <hi>Raja's.</hi> Among the rest he shew'd me a <hi>Persian</hi> Lady's Picture and gave it me; to the end, said he, that your <hi>French</hi> Ladies may see how our <hi>Persian</hi> Ladiés are clad. After that he shew'd me the Pictures of two <hi>Venetian</hi> Curtisans, the one a Widow, and the other a Virgin, with a Parrot upon her hand clad after the <hi>French</hi> mode. Upon which the King putting the question to me which I lik'd best? I reply'd that she pleas'd me best who had the Parrot upon her fist. And why not the other said the King? Because, answer'd I, she looks like one that had renounc'd the world. Thereupon the King falling into a laughter, and turning toward Father <hi>Raphael; Patri, Patri,</hi> said he, <hi>is it possible that such a Lady as this should have renounc'd the World?</hi> This led us into a discourse of beauty, wherein when the King demanded my opinion, I told him that Womens beauty depended very much upon the Custom of the Country; for that in <hi>Japan</hi> Women with broad faces were most in request; in <hi>China</hi> small feet were admir'd; in the Isles of <hi>Borneo</hi> and <hi>Achen,</hi> Women the blacker their Teeth were, the more they were belov'd; that in the Island of <hi>Macasser,</hi> to make their Women lovely, they pull out four of their Teeth when they are young, to put in four of Gold in their room; as I have seen a Captain of <hi>Java,</hi> who pull'd out four of his fore Teeth, and set four Diamonds in their place. In short, I told His Majesty that in his own Dominions full Eye-brows which meet together were highly esteem'd; whereas the Women of <hi>France</hi> pull them up by the Roots. But which, said the King, dost thou like best, the black or the fair? Sir, continu'd I, were I to buy Women as I purchase Diamonds, Pearls, and Bread, I would always choose the whitest. With that the King fell a laughing, and orderd me a brimmer in his own Cup, which was a great Honour indeed. From hence we fell into a more serious discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the present State of <hi>Europe,</hi> speaking very low, and the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany retiring all the while out of hearing. Only I observ'd that there was one Lord middle ag'd, and clad after the <hi>Georgian</hi> mode, who stood within five or six paces behind the King, and that many times as the King drank, he only wet his Lips, and gave the rest to that Lord to drink, which when he had done, he retir'd again to his place. Upon inquiry I found he was the Kings Uncle by the Mother's side.</p>
                     <p>While we were talking of serious things the Curtisans were bid to retire out of the Hall, which they did, into a Gallery that look'd upon a Garden, where they sate, where immediately a <hi>Sofra</hi> was laid before them cover'd with Fruits and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, and one of their Society continually powr'd out the Wine which they drank round without intermission: One would have thought they should have been fuddl'd; yet when they came in again, no man could perceive they had been drinking. After they had Danc'd a while, they were order'd to retire again, and the King sent for his Musick, which was both Vocal and Instrumental; his Instrumental Musick consisted of a kind of a Lute, a Guittar, a Spinet, and two or three Base Flutes. He had also in the Gallery where the Curtisans were, a large Ebony Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net eight foot high, adorn'd with several Silver figures, which prov'd to be an Organ that went alone. It was part of the present which the <hi>Muscovite</hi> Ambassadors made the King, which he order'd to be set a going, that we might hear it as we sate. No sooner had the Organ stop'd, but the Curtesans were call'd in again, and the King caus'd the Gold Ladle to go round, commanding that no man should leave a drop. When every man had done, the King was pleas'd to ask me which of the Curtisan's I thought to be handsomest? Thereupon I rose up, and taking a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106224:112"/>
Wax-Candle in my hand, I went and view'd them all. The King laugh'd, and being very glad to see my face among theirs, <hi>Bring hither,</hi> said he, <hi>her to whom thou hast most a fancy.</hi> In obedience to which, I pick'd out the eldest, as I thought, and led her to his Majesty, who caus'd us to sit down by him. Then the King pointing to another, <hi>And why,</hi> said he, <hi>did you not chose yonder Girl, which is younger and handsomer;</hi> commanding them both to kiss me one after another, that I might understand the difference between the Caresses of one and the other. But I reply'd, that were I to choose again, I would make the same choice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving prudence to accompany age. However I besought his Majesty to consider, that it was not for me to look upon elder or younger, and that though he had giv'n me the liberty to send the elder home to my Lodging, yet it was not in my pow'r to accept of his favour, in regard I had a Wife, to whom I never had been unfaithful.</p>
                     <p>We had thus droll'd together 'till eleven a Clock at night, when the King started another Question, Whether any one present knew how to Sing? It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that there was one Monsieur <hi>Daulier</hi> there, that Play'd upon the Virginals, and pretended to Sing, who immediately began a Court-Air. But his Voice being a high-pitch'd Voice, and for that the <hi>Persians</hi> are altogether for Bases, the King did not like him. When I perceiv'd that, being in a merry vein, though I knew not a Note, yet having a good deep voice, and clear, I sung an old Air that came into my head, which begins,</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Fill all the Bowls then, fill'em high,</l>
                        <l>Fill all the Glasses there, for why</l>
                        <l>Should every Creature drink but I?</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>The King was so pleas'd, that he cry'd out, <hi>Baricala, Baricala,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Oh the works of God!</hi> an expression of admiration usual among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time it was very late, and the King growing sleepy, gave us leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; which we did very willingly, having had hard labour for seventeen hours together.</p>
                     <p>The next night the King fell a drinking again, and there was in his presence an <hi>Agi</hi> or Pilgrim newly return'd from <hi>Mecca,</hi> and consequently oblig'd never to drink Wine after that. While this <hi>Agi</hi> staid, there was one of the <hi>Persian</hi> Lords got so impertinently suddl'd, that he twice struck the <hi>Agi</hi>'s Turbant from his head, refus'd to drink when the King commanded him, play'd the fool with the Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans when they were dancing, and committed so many other acts of folly, that the King incens'd at such a continuation of Buffonry, in a great fury, <hi>This Rascal,</hi> said he, <hi>has lost all his respect, and thinks he is no more my Slave; drag him out by the feet, and throw him to the Dogs to eat.</hi> Immediately four or five of the King's Officers came and drag'd him out of the Hall by the feet, and every body wonder'd he was not thrown to the Dogs, according to the King's Command; but 'tis thought that some of the King's Women beg'd for him, so that his punishment was chang'd.</p>
                     <p>There was one of the Curtisans that gave one of her Companions a box on the ear, not in the King's presence, but in the Gallery where they were drinking together. However she did not strike so softly, but that the King heard the noise of the blow. Whereupon he commanded her that had giv'n the blow to be had before the <hi>Deroga</hi> or Judge of the Town, whom he order'd to expunge her out of the number of Curtisans, and to put another in her place; that she should have a hundred <hi>Tomans</hi> giv'n her, and that the <hi>Deroga</hi> should cause her to be marry'd.</p>
                     <p>The next day I waited on the King, and receiv'd those Models which he had bespoke me to send into <hi>France.</hi> They were the Patterns of certain Drinking-Cups and Trenchers, with the Model of a Dagger drawn with his own hand: for he had learnt to draw of a couple of <hi>Dutch-men</hi> that were in his Service. The
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106224:113"/>
Dagger was to be Goldsmith work enamel'd. When I had receiv'd his Instructions, I took my leave of his Majesty: and then going to wait upon the <hi>Nazar</hi> at his Country-house, I took leave of him also, who assur'd me of his affection upon all occasions, and did me several kindnesses at my departure.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Genealogy of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> of the last Race.</head>
                     <p>AFter that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had extended his Conquests into <hi>Asia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Army of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whom he took Prisoner, together with his Wife, he return'd into <hi>Persia,</hi> where at that time liv'd a <hi>Cheik,</hi> whose name was <hi>Aidar,</hi> a person in high reputation for his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He was a person of great wit, and the first in the dignities of the Law, which gain'd him great authority and belief among the people. He gave great honour to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and shew'd Eminent kindnesses to all the Officers of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; in recompence whereof, <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who was a generous Prince, and full of gratitude, made a Present to the <hi>Cheik</hi> of a great number of Captives, which he brought along with him out of <hi>Turky.</hi> The <hi>Cheik</hi> planted one part of these Slaves about <hi>Ardevile,</hi> and seated the other near his own residence. Now in regard he assum'd to himself to be descended in a direct line from <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> he cover'd his head after another manner then all the rest of the <hi>Persians,</hi> wearing a kind of flat Bonnet, growing broader and broader to the top, and so pleighted, as to make twelve Pleights of a Ruff, in honour of the twelve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. In the middle, a kind of a Pyramid about a fingers length seem'd to rise out of the Bonnet, but was indeed sow'd to it. Such a Bonnet as this the <hi>Cheik</hi> appointed all the Slaves to wear that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had giv'n him, and this is that which at this day distinguishes their Successors from the other <hi>Persians.</hi> And it is the custom, where <hi>Kans</hi> or Governours of Provinces reside, that all the <hi>Sophies</hi> both in the City and the neighbouring parts, meet in the <hi>Piazza</hi> every Friday in the afternoon, where they pray to God for the health of the King and the <hi>Kan,</hi> and for the prosperity of the Kingdom; after which the <hi>Kan</hi> sends
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:106224:114"/>
them Victuals to eat, not without some other effects of his Liberality.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cheiks</hi> Sons considering of what a number of Slaves they were Masters, and that the greatest part of the people, prepossess'd in favour of their Father, out of the opinion they had of his Sanctity, took their part; the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully to engage them, shew'd themselves liberal to all, and when they found themselves strong enough, revolted against <hi>Alamout</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign. After many Skirmishes, at length they gave him Battel near to <hi>Tauris,</hi> wherein <hi>Azimout</hi> was defeated, and slain by the hand of <hi>Ismael Sophi,</hi> the <hi>Cheiks</hi> third Son, who is properly to be accounted the first King of that Race: I mean of the Race of them that did not embrace the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but according to the Interpretation of <hi>Haly, Mahomets</hi> Son-in-Law.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Ismael Sophi</hi> succeeded <hi>Sha-Tammas</hi> his Son, and to <hi>Sha-Tammas Sha-Ismael</hi> the second, who reign'd but a short while; for his cruelties constrain'd the Nobility of the Country to set up in his room <hi>Mahomet-Coda bendé</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though little skill'd in the affairs of Government or War. Many thought he was blind, but he was only dim-sighted, through the application of a hot Iron to his eyes, by the Command of his unnatural Brother in the beginning of his reign. He was the Father of <hi>Sha Abbas,</hi> that succeeded him, who setl'd the affairs of <hi>Persia</hi> in a very good condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> the first, by his Valour and good Conduct gain'd the name of Great. When he came to his Throne, upon the North and West side he found nothing in his power but the City of <hi>Casbin;</hi> but afterwards, as he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage of great wit as well as courage, partly by policy, and partly by force, he recover'd several Provinces to the West, and conquer'd the Kingdoms of <hi>Lar, Ormus,</hi> and <hi>Candahar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of many Sons that <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> had, not one surviv'd but only <hi>Sophi-Mirza,</hi> a Prince of great wit, and dextrous at his Arms. All the people lov'd him, which made his Father jealous of him, that he waited for his death to ascend the Throne. And that which augmented his jealousie was, for that one day being a hunting, <hi>Sophi-Mirza</hi> drew the first arrow at a Boar; it being a capital crime in <hi>Persia</hi> to shoot before the King. However <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> for the time conceal'd his displeasure, unwilling to fly out in fury against the Prince, in regard he had no more Sons. But <hi>Sophi-Mirza</hi> having had a Son by a Slave, which pleas'd him, <hi>Sha Abbas's</hi> joy encreasing as the Child grew, his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie also daily encreas'd against the Father of the young Prince; so that being no longer able to dissemble his fear, he caus'd his eyes to be put out. Nay his jealousie went a great way farther; for he now fear'd the blind Prince, and having therefore resolv'd his death, he commanded a Lord of the Court to bring him his head. The Lord in an astonishment refus'd to obey the King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him rather to take away his life, than to constrain him to embrue his hands in the blood of his Prince. The King offended at him for his refusal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd him his Court; and the next day gave the same command to another Lord, who without any scruple put it in execution, and brought him the head of his Son in a Bason of Gold. That object of pity brought him to himself; so that not being able to look upon so sad a spectacle without tears in his eyes, upbraiding the villany of the Lord, he expell'd him from his sight, forbad him his presence for ever, and sequesterd all his estate, only allowing him a Mamoudi, or nine <hi>French</hi> Sous a day. The other Lord, who had so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously refus'd to aid him in so bloody an act, the King recall'd from Exile, and bestow'd upon him one of the best Governments of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Ever since that time all the Male Children of the Blood Royal are shut up in the Womens <hi>Haram,</hi> where they are bred up in ignorance, having only two or three Eunuchs to teach them to write and read, and to keep them company in their recreations, whether it be in shooting with a Bow, or riding about the Gardens upon an Ass; for they never allow'em a Horse: besides that all that time they are never permitted to see the people. In this manner it was that <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> bred up his little Grandson, many days causing him to take Opium to render him more stupid. So that when he came to the Throne, after his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers death, the Physiicians thought it convenient that he should drink Wine, to restore his natural heat, and renew his vigor. <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> reign'd forty years,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106224:114"/>
and dy'd at the end of the year 1628. Before he dy'd, he gave command, that he should be bury'd in some place unknown to all the world; and that they should set his Grandchild upon his Throne, and give him the name of <hi>Sha-Sefi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So soon as <hi>Sha Abbas</hi>'s eyes were clos'd, the General of the Horse, and the chief Captain of the Harquebusses, with whom the Commands were left, rode in all haste to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and coming to the Palace, desir'd to speak with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Child. The Mother was in a sad affright, believing that they came to put the young Prince to death. But when they had dissipated her fears, and that she understood that they came to set him upon the Throne by the command of his Grandfather, she embrac'd the young Prince, and return'd him into the hands of the Eunuchs. When he was come out of the <hi>Haram,</hi> the two Lords, attended by several others, saluted him King, and acknowledg'd him for their Soveraign. At the same time they took off his Clothes and tore them, which in <hi>Persia</hi> is a mark of mourning; and according to custom, put him on another plain Garment, which he wore till midnight. Then they disrob'd him again, and put him on his Royal Robes, and set him upon the Throne, where all the Lords came and did him homage, and the next day he was acknowledg'd by all the Acclamations of the people. For when the Royal Habit is put upon the new King, the Drums, Trumpets, Timbrels, Hautboys, and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, make a din in a peculiar place of the <hi>Meydan</hi> appointed for that purpose. Which is the Signal to give notice to the people to meet the next morning, to acknowledg the new King. <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> for many years was a Novice in the art of Government. But time opening his eyes, the first remarkable thing which he did, being at <hi>Casbin,</hi> was to cut off the head of <hi>Ali-Kouli-Kan,</hi> that great Captain who had conquer'd the Kingdoms of <hi>Lar</hi> and <hi>Ormus</hi> for <hi>Sha Abbas;</hi> and the heads of three of his Sons. After that, returning to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> he cut off the heads of seven of the principal Lords of his Court; and by little and little took the Government into his own hands. Of those Lords whom <hi>Jani-Kan</hi> was the chief.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis thought that <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> had left a private order with <hi>Mirza Také,</hi> and the Dowager <hi>Sultaness,</hi> to rid themselves of those Lords so soon as <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> should be setl'd in his Throne, and that they had plac'd Governors in all places where in the King might confide. These Lords having smoak'd the private order of <hi>Sha-Abbas,</hi> and believing that the time of execution drew near, prevented the <hi>Athemadoulet Mirza Také;</hi> for meeting one morning before the Palace-door, they kill'd the Porter, and entring his Bed-Chamber, stab'd him before he could rise. After this execution, they went to the King, whom <hi>Jani-Kan</hi> boldly told, that they had slain <hi>Mirza Také.</hi> The King at that time dissembling his anger at so bold an enterprize, and an attempt upon the Royal Authority, answer'd him, that he had done very well, and that he had prevented those orders which he intended to have giv'n him. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> his Mother then govern'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, together with the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> from whom she receiv'd four hundred Ducats in Gold every day for her little pleasures; and held a private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with him in her <hi>Haram,</hi> where he had free admission, as being cut close. In this Council it was, that these two persons overthrew in the night whatever the Lords concluded in the day; chang'd the Kings mind, and over-rul'd his thoughts as they pleas'd themselves, by vertue of that power which they had over him. Eight or nine days after, as these Lords were sitting in Council with the King, an Eunuch enter'd, which was the signal for the King to get out of the way; and as soon as the King was gone, the Chamber was fill'd with Eunuchs, that rushing in immediately fell upon <hi>Jani-Kan</hi> and his Accomplices, and cut off their heads. Their heads and bodies were immediately expos'd to the view of the people in the <hi>Meydan;</hi> and for that it is not the custom in <hi>Persia</hi> to take any cognizance of what the King does, the most part of the people, spurning the heads with their feet, cry'd one to another, <hi>See the heads of those Dogs that have disobey'd the will of the King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I told ye, that <hi>Mirza Také</hi> was clean cut; which occasions a particular story: He was Governour of <hi>Guilan</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Sha Abbas,</hi> and having abus'd one of his Pages, the young Ladd stole secretly to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106224:115"/>
to the King; who having heard it, immediately sent him to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Guilan,</hi> in the place of <hi>Mirza Také,</hi> and order'd him to send him his head by one of the Officers, which he dispatch'd along with him. The King also, in regard the Page was very young, appointed him a person able to advise him in his affairs. In the mean while <hi>Mirza Také</hi> missing his Page, and making no question but he was gone to make his complaint to the King, which would of necessity prove his ruin, if not prevented; he resolv'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the storm by punishing himself, and caus'd that part to be cut clean off that committed the crime. At the same time, and in that bad condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he then was, he caus'd himself to be put into a Litter, and taking his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon along with him, he gets to <hi>Ispahan</hi> by another way which was not usually travel'd, for fear of meeting the Page, and causing himself to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd into the Palace in that pitiful and languishing estate, desir'd to speak with the King, who was surpriz'd at his arrival. But the <hi>Kan</hi> having presented him in a Plate of Gold with the undoubted marks of his repentance, besought his Majesties pardon. Whereupon the King considering the rigor and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary punishment which he had inflicted upon himself, sent him back to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and recall'd the Page, whom he otherways gratifi'd. And this was the man whom <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> upon his Death-bed order'd that <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> should make <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> as being the fittest for the employment of any person in his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> not content to have rid himself of the Lords that had presum'd to invade his Authority, was resolv'd to have the head of <hi>Ali-merdan-Kan,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Candahar;</hi> of whom he was jealous, by reason of his vast riches, his Plate being all Gold, and his House as magnificently furnish'd as the Kings. But the King could not bring about his design; for the <hi>Kan</hi> being press't to come to Court, and believing it was only to take away his head, to free himself from the danger, deliver'd <hi>Candahar</hi> to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> by whom he was kindly entertain'd, and highly caress'd. Neither was <hi>Ali-merdan-Kan</hi>'s wealth of his own getting, but left him by inheritance, as being descended from the ancient Kings of <hi>Candahar,</hi> who were originally <hi>Tartars.</hi> Now whatever favours or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> bestow'd upon <hi>Ali-merdan-Kan,</hi> the same did the <hi>Persian</hi> King bestow upon his two Sons; whereas all the world believ'd, that after such a piece of Treason committed by their Father, the King would have ript up their bellies. This piece of policy of <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> was very advantageous to <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second, when he besieg'd <hi>Candahar</hi> with fifty thousand men. For the greatest part of the <hi>Moguls</hi> Army being compos'd of <hi>Persians,</hi> they remembring how kindly <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> had us'd the two Sons of <hi>Ali-merdan-Kan,</hi> made little resistance against the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who enter'd <hi>Candahar</hi> in a small time. The Great <hi>Mogul</hi> troubl'd at the loss, ask'd <hi>Ali-merdan-Kan,</hi> by what means he might retake <hi>Candahar;</hi> who presently made answer, that it would be very easie, if he could find such another Traytor as he had been.</p>
                     <p>But to return to <hi>Sha-Sefi;</hi> his Reign was very violent, of which I will give you this Example:</p>
                     <p>One day the King returning from the <hi>Kelonters</hi> House in <hi>Zulpha,</hi> having drank to excess, commanded that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> should come to him; who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that he was in drink, made no great haste, so that the King in the mean time fell asleep. But waking again soon after, and not seeing the Queen, he call'd for her a second time; of which when she had notice, she came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. When she came into the Chamber, she perceiv'd the King asleep, and in expectation of his waking, hid her self in a Nich behind the Hangings; where generally the Mattresses and Coverlets are laid by. The King waking, and not yet perceiving the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> in a great chafe demanded why she was not yet come. The Queen-Mother, who was a <hi>Georgian</hi> Slave, and mortally hated the young <hi>Sultaness,</hi> who was the Daughter of the King of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and therefore disdain'd by her, took an occasion to put her out of the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and having first spok'n ill of her, made a sign to the King to let him understand that the young Queen was hid in such a Nich. Upon that the King rising in a great fury, stab'd the poor Princess with his Dagger four or five times in the belly, and hardly knowing what he had done, went to bed again. The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106224:115"/>
next day, forgetful of the fact, he call'd for the Queen; but when they told him what had happen'd, he began to be deeply sensible of his error, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd excessively; and at the same time sent an express order through his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, that no man should drink Wine, and that the Governours should break all the Wine-Vessels wherever they found any, and spill the Wine. But this order did not last above a year.</p>
                     <p>During the Reign of <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Erivan</hi> sent him a Colt, which I saw, which was begot by a Mule. Not long after the King dy'd of a Surfet, with excess of drink ing, after he had reign'd fourteen years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> the second was set upon the Throne at <hi>Casbin,</hi> with the usual Ceremonies, at the end of the year 1642, and made his entry into <hi>Ispahan</hi> in the beginning of the year following. Upon the day of the Solemnity all the Citizens were order'd to be in Arms, and to march out of the City, where they were fil'd off upon each side of the Road. In the same manner were all the standing Infantry and Cavalry rang'd for five Leagues together. All the Road for two Leagues together without the City was cover'd with Tissues of Gold and Silver, with Carpets of Silk, and other rich Stuffs; all which costs the King nothing. For the <hi>Sha-Bander,</hi> who is like our Mayor, takes care to tax every one what he is to furnish toward that Solemnity. The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> went also forth to meet the King; among whom I was one. When we came near the King, <hi>Jani-Kan,</hi> General of the Cavalry, gave the King notice who we were. Whereupon we all alighted, and the King holding his Leg stretcht out of his Stirrup, we all kiss'd his Boot. When he came where the way began to be spread with rich Carpets, he found the Grand <hi>Mufti</hi> and the Grand <hi>Cadi,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a great number of <hi>Moullahs,</hi> who made a Prayer after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Prayers being ended, the King rode on, the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> being on the left hand, which is the most honourable, and the General of the Cavalry on the right, yet not even with him, but so as that their Horses heads reach'd to the Crupper of his. There was no person but the King that rode over the Tissue, that Honour belonging to him alone; nor is the way spread above the breadth of the Stuff; and as soon as the King is pass'd over it, the people fall to scram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and carry away every one what they can get for themselves.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of a League from <hi>Ispahan</hi> is a Garden, with a Great Room over the Gate, where the King made a halt, thinking to have made his Entry into the City. But an Astrologer came to him, and told him, that the hour was past, and that he must tarry three days before the hour would prove pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious again. So that he was constrain'd to betake himself to the Garden of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardgerib</hi> till the time came; whither the Nobility also were all forc'd to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning, and to stay till the evening. The day that the King made his Entry, the way from the Garden to the City was also spread with Carpets. For three days together the Fire-works play'd in the <hi>Meydan;</hi> and round the <hi>Piazza</hi> from top to bottom were lights hung out; and in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inns, the richest Merchants had adorn'd the Doors and Windows of their Chambers, according to the Mode of the Country; and I believe it cost the Chief of the <hi>Holland</hi> Company, above nine hundred Tomans.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1643, came the Prince of the <hi>Usbecks</hi> in person to desire aid of <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> against his Children, who had caus'd his own Subjects to rebel and make war against him. His eldest Son first took Arms, and getting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a Battel, the other Brother treacherously took part with him; which nothing dismay'd the Father, to whom the chief of the Nobility still adher'd. Toward the end of the year 1642, the Prince lost another Battel and his left eye, which was shot thorough with an Arrow; which constrain'd him, so soon as he was cur'd of his wound, to come and crave succour from the King of <hi>Persia;</hi> which he easily obtain'd. <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> designing to receive him honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably sent above ten thousand Horse as far as <hi>Cashan,</hi> which is four days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and five or six thousand Foot two days journey from thence to meet him. Every day he was attended by different Officers. Every day they set him up a new Tent, and spread new Carpets; and every day chang'd the twelve Horses that were led before him, whose furniture was all over cover'd with Jewels. For a League and a half from the City the way was spread with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106224:116"/>
all sorts of Silk Stuffs to the very Palace; and the King of <hi>Persia</hi> went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to meet him, as far as where the Stuffs were begun to be laid. Though <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> was very young, yet he was resolv'd to shew, that he look'd upon himself as a potent King in the peaceable possession of his own Dominions, and that he went to meet a dethron'd Prince, that came to desire his Aid. For so soon as he perceiv'd the King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> he made a shew of spurring on his Horse; and being come up to his Horses head, he put his foot out of the Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, as if he intended to have alighted, but did not. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, as old as he was, presently leap't to the ground from his Saddle to salute the <hi>Persian</hi> King, who return'd him some slight Compliments about his having alighted; at which time the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> and other Lords remounting him, the two Kings rode together upon the Silks, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> giving the left hand to the <hi>Tartar.</hi> The King of <hi>Persia</hi> very generously lent him a considerable assistance of 15000 Horse, and 8000 Foot, and sixty thousand Tomans in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The <hi>Tartar</hi> in Exchange gave him one of his Provinces bordering upon <hi>Persia,</hi> which yeilded him a very good Revenue, in regard the Inhabitants were all Shepherds, or <hi>Turcomans,</hi> that breed an infinite number of Cattel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wealth of that Province consists.</p>
                     <p>While he reign'd, he had a present made him from the Governour of <hi>Schiras,</hi> of a wild Ass, whose Skin was as red as Scarlet, having a Horn growing out of his forehead about a foot long.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> reign'd about twenty-four years, and dy'd at <hi>Tehzon,</hi> of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in his throat, which came by excessive drinking. His body by his own order was buri'd at <hi>Kour.</hi> So soon as he was dead, the Lords that were about him, sent advice of his death to the Prince that now reigns, by the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigi-Basha,</hi> who is General of the Musqueteers, and <hi>Mirza Bayad</hi> the Cheif of the Astrologers. So soon as they came to the door of the <hi>Haram,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to speak with the Mother and the Son; who believ'd them come upon some dismal design. But they presently confirm'd them to the contrary. For as soon as the Prince came forth of the <hi>Haram,</hi> they fell at his feet, and saluted him King, declaring the death of his Father. Whereupon the Prince imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tore his Garment according to the custom. And indeed they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther custom, that as soon as the new Prince comes after much entreaty out of the <hi>Haram,</hi> he throws himself to the ground, at the door of the <hi>Haram,</hi> and then rising and sitting upon his heels, one of the Lords that are sent, girds the Scimiter about his waste, saying these words, <hi>May it please your Majesty to remember your Slave, that had the Honour to grid you with this Scimiter.</hi> Which done, he goes and sets the Trumpets a sounding, and the Drums beating, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the people in the morning come running to the Gate of the Palace, crying out, <hi>Patsha Salamalek, I salute thee Emperor.</hi> Which is all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony us'd when any King of <hi>Persia</hi> ascends the Throne. For I never saw any Crown set upon the head either of <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> or <hi>Sha Sefi.</hi> Only in <hi>Persia</hi> they gird on the Scimiter, as in <hi>Turky</hi> they put on the Bonnet of the <hi>Sophi's,</hi> which is very richly set with Jewels, but has not the least resemblance of a Crown. The same Ceremony of girding on the Scimiter, is us'd to the <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Visapour</hi> and <hi>Golconda;</hi> and they also put the Bonnet upon their heads, which is set with the richest Jewels in the possession of those great Monarchs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> the second, some time after his coming to the Throne, fell dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously sick, not having ever enjoy'd a perfect health before. Now it is the custom in those Countries, that upon such an occasion all the Lords of the Court, and Governors of Provinces, give a sum of money, according to their willingness and liberality. This sum is usually in Gold, which they put into a Bason very richly set with pretious Stones, and bear it three times over the Kings head, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing these words, <hi>Patsha Bashena Olson, This money is sacrific'd for the health of the Kings head.</hi> If the King recover all that money is giv'n to the poor, to which the King and his <hi>Haram</hi> add very liberally. But if the King dies, the money is put into the Treasury, and the poor have nothing. The twentieth of <hi>August</hi> 1667, was the critical day of his distemper, and every one thought he would have dy'd. Upon which all the Grandees of the Court seeing him in that condition, went to the <hi>Mosquee</hi> call'd <hi>Babaron,</hi> which is without the City, to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106224:116"/>
pray for his health, and altogether gave near a thousand Tomans to the poor. The next day they commanded the Christian <hi>Armenians</hi> to pray for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the King. Whereupon as well the Ecclesiasticks as the Laity went to their prayers upon the side of the River which is between <hi>Ispahan</hi> and <hi>Zulpha.</hi> They also sent their <hi>Kelonter,</hi> with fifty Tomans in Gold, to bear over the Kings head; though the <hi>Armenians</hi> pronounce not the same words as the <hi>Persians,</hi> saying only, <hi>Berai te Sadduk, destin'd for Alms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the danger being over in a few days, they made it their business to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him to a perfect habit of health; but in regard the King continu'd in a languishing condition, and for that the Physicians could not discover the cause of the distemper, the King began to beleive that it proceeded from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Physicians; for which reason some of them had receiv'd none of the best entertainment already. At length it came into the thoughts of some others of the Physicians, who were afraid for themselves, that in regard <hi>Persia</hi> was thus doubly afllicted, with Famine and the Sickness of the King, both at one time, it must of necessity be the Astrologers fault, that miss'd the favourable hour when the King should have ascended the Throne. Thus being troubl'd at their disgrace, pretending to have no less skill in future knowledg than the Astrologers, who had not chos'n a true time for the King to ascend the Throne, they concluded that for the perfect recovery of his health, and the restoring of plenty to the Nation, it was necessary to renew the Ceremony at a lucky hour, and to change his name. This proposition pleas'd the King and his Council. The Physitians and Astrologers joining together, observ'd the first unlucky day, which would certainly be follow'd by another that would prove fortunate. Now there being among the <hi>Gaures,</hi> some that pretend themselves descended from the <hi>Rustans,</hi> who were ancient Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Parthia,</hi> that very morning one of those <hi>Gaures</hi> setting himself upon the Throne, with his back against a wooden Figure which represented him to the life, all the Grandees of the Court came and did him homage as their King, as he had order'd them to do. This action lasted till the favourable hour was come, which happen'd a little before Sun-set. Then it was that an Officer of the Court came behind and cut off the head of the wooden Figure, while the <hi>Gaure</hi> immediately took his heels and fled. Presently upon that the King appear'd in the Hall, upon whose head when they had put the Bonnet of <hi>Sophi,</hi> and re-girt him with the Scimitar, he ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Throne, and took the name of <hi>Soliman.</hi> He was forc'd to act this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to satisfie the Law, which contriv'd that he should change his Name, and take a new possession of his Throne, by ejecting a Usurper that had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully claim'd it. For which reason the <hi>Gaure</hi> was set up as Pretender, as laying claim to the ancient Lineage of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, and being of a different Religion. From that time the King recovering, and the Famine decreasing, the Physicians were in great repute, and the Astrologers were cast out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, except two or three of the most skilful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha-Soliman</hi> before his coming to the Crown, had convers'd with none but Women and black Eunuchs; from whom he could not learn the art of Ruling. At present he only divertizes himself with his Wives in going a hunting, very rarely troubling himself with business, but relying wholly upon his Ministers of State. He will not be seen for ten or twelve days together; all which time there are no Petitions to be preferr'd, nor Complaints to be made.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of certain particular Actions which denote the Vertues and Vices of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> from <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> the first to <hi>Sha-Soliman</hi> the present King. And first of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the Great.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SHa-Abbas,</hi> who was a passionate Lover of Honour, sought all ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to furnish his Empire with the supports of wealth and good Government. He would not suffer any <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Banian</hi> to live as a Trader in his Dominions; they having crept in since under the Reigns of <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> the first, and <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second, who came very young to the Throne. Neither had <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> any reason to permit them to trade in his Kingdom; for they are worse Usurers than the <hi>Jews,</hi> and seldom it happens, but that they have all the Money in the Nation, which they take up at nine or ten in the hundred, and let out again upon pawns at two and a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> a month. From such devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Pests and Vipers as these, <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> thought it but reasonable to preserve his people; so that before these Vermin crept into <hi>Persia,</hi> the Money was all in the hands of the <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Zulpha.</hi> And indeed those <hi>Banians</hi> have been the ruin of many poor people, of which I will only bring one example among many.</p>
                     <p>I was at <hi>Ispahan</hi> in the year 1662, when one of those <hi>Banians</hi> lent six or seven Tomans <hi>per Cent.</hi> a month to a poor <hi>Persian,</hi> who had utter'd several pieces of Linnen upon the place. Those <hi>Banians</hi> will have their interest paid every month; but the <hi>Persian</hi> had slipt three or four, having no Money to pay, in regard his Debtor could not pay him. Thereupon the <hi>Banian</hi> dunn'd him perpetually, and threaten'd to have him drub'd till he pay'd it, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> custom. The Mother of the <hi>Persian</hi> troubl'd to see her Son haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that manner, one morning as he was going to the <hi>Meydan,</hi> bid him, if he met the <hi>Banian,</hi> that he should be sure to bring him home, and she would pay him his interest, and some of the principal, with some Money that she had sav'd of her own. Toward evening the <hi>Banian</hi> met his Debtor, whom he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily follow'd home upon promise of payment. The Mother desir'd him to set upon the <hi>Coursi,</hi> which is the place where they make their fires, it being cold snowy weather, and set fruits before him to eat. While he thus eat and warm'd himself, night came on apace, and the woman putting him in hopes of payment, spun out the time so long, that the <hi>Banian</hi> not being unaccustom'd to cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and late hours, was easily perswaded to stay all night at the <hi>Persians</hi> House. When 'twas time to go to bed, the <hi>Banian</hi> threw himself upon one Quilt, and the <hi>Persian</hi> upon another. About two hours after midnight, the Mother comes sostly into the Chamber, with a sharp Razor in her hand, intending to have cut off the <hi>Banians</hi> head; but unfortunately mistaking, kill'd her own Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the <hi>Banian.</hi> The <hi>Banian</hi> having had such an escape, stole cunningly out of the House, and declaring the murther to the <hi>Divan-bequé,</hi> or the Chief Justice, He caus'd the woman to be apprehended, and brought before him; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the fact, he commanded her to be ty'd to the tail of a young Mule, and to be dragg'd about the City till the Mule had kick'd her to death.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1667, eight or ten days before I departed from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> there was a <hi>Banian</hi> found buri'd in a Street near the <hi>Capuchins</hi> house; they had cut off his arms and legs, and so put him into the hole; but buri'd him so shallow that the Dogs scrap'd away the Earth, and discover'd him; but who committed the fact, was not then known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> was not only willing that all the trade should be in the hands of his Subjects, to make profit thereby, and to draw the Money into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but he would not suffer it to be transported when it was brought in. He saw that the Pilgrimages of his Subjects to <hi>Mecca,</hi> their Expences and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents carry'd out abundance of his Ducats of Gold; therefore more politick than religious, he strove to hinder those Pilgrimages as much as in him lay; and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106224:117"/>
going himself in person to <hi>Meshed</hi> in Pilgrimage to the Tomb of <hi>Iman-rez</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken of, over which one of the Legs of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Camel hangs as a a great Relict; and upon his return relating and giving out strange Miracles of <hi>Iman-rez,</hi> on purpose to divert his Subjects from going to <hi>Mecca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the rest of the cunning knacks that <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> made use of, to know how squares went in his Kingdom, without trusting too much to his Ministers, he oft'n disguis'd himself, and went about the City like an ordinary inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, under pretence of buying and selling, making it his business to discover whether Merchants us'd false weights or measures or no. To this intent one evening going out of his Palacein the habit of a Countryman, he went to a Bakers to buy a <hi>Man</hi> of Bread, and thence to a Cook to buy a <hi>Man</hi> of Rost-meat, (a <hi>Man</hi> is six Pound, sixteen Ounces to the Pound). The King having bought his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains return'd to Court, where he caus'd the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> to weigh both the Bread and the Meat exactly. He found the Bread to want fifty-seven Drams, and the Meat forty-three. The King seeing that, fell into a great chase against three or four of them that were about him, whose business it was to look after thos things; but especially against the Governour of the City, whose Belly he had caus'd to have been ript up, but for the intercession of certain Lords. Besides the reproaches that he threw upon them for being so negligent in their Employments; and for their little affection to the publick good, he laid before them the injustice of false weights; and how sadly the cheat fell upon poor men, who having great Families, and thinking to give them eight hundred Drams of Bread, by that fraud depriv'd them of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty three. Then turning to the Lords that were present, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, what sort of justice ought to be done those people? When none of them daring to open their mouths, while he was in that passion, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a great Oven to be made in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> together with a Spit long enough to roast a man; and that the Oven should be heated all night, and that they should make another fire to be kindl'd hard by the Oven. The next morning the King caus'd the Baker and the Cook to be apprehended, and to be led quite thorough the City, with two men going before them, who cry'd to the people, We are going to put the Baker into a red hot Oven made in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where he is to be bak'd alive, for having utter'd Bread by false weights; and the Cook is to be roasted alive, for having sold meat by false weights. Thus those two men serv'd for an example not only to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> but to all the Kingdom, where every one dreaded the severe justice of <hi>Sha-Abbas.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of what fell out most memorable in the Reign of <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> the first; and particularly of the death of <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</hi> and his three Sons.</head>
                     <p>I <hi>Man-Kouli-Kan</hi> was the last <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Schiras,</hi> whose Government extended over the Province of <hi>Lar,</hi> to the Golf of <hi>Persia,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Sha-Abbas;</hi> these <hi>Kans</hi> being the most potent in all <hi>Persia. Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> was he who in the Reign of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> conquer'd the greatest part of the Kingdom of <hi>Lar,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Ormus,</hi> with all the Coast of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Golf, from <hi>Cape Jasques</hi> to <hi>Balsara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> was prodigiously rich, belov'd and respected by all the world; besides he was wonderfully magnificent, his expences almost equalling the Kings; which occasion'd <hi>Sha-Abbas,</hi> who discours'd with him one day parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon that Subject, to tell him, that he desir'd him to spend every day one <hi>Mamoudy</hi> less than he, that there might be some difference between the expences of a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Kan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The noble qualities of this <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> had gain'd the affections of the people; for he was magnificent and liberal; highly recompenc'd brave Soldiers and Students; he lov'd Strangers, and had a particular care to cherish Arts and Sciences. To which purpose he built a fair Colledg at <hi>Schiras,</hi> for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Youth; and several Inns, as well in the City as upon the Road, for the benefit of Travellers. He caus'd Mountains to be cut thorough to shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the way; and join'd others by Bridges, of such an adventurous Structure, that it is hard to conjecture how such prodigious Arches could be made over such vast Precipices and Torrents.</p>
                     <p>Now in regard <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> was strick'n in years, he seldom went to Court, chusing rather to continue in his Government, where he was belov'd and respected by all men. But the King being young, and the Government of the Kingdom in the hands of the Queen-Mother and the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> who were extreamly jealous of the <hi>Kan,</hi> those two persons link'd together in interest for the maintenance of the Kings Authority and their own, fretted to see the <hi>Kan's</hi> Court almost as splendid as the Kings; and that nothing of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of <hi>Schiras, Lar, Ormus,</hi> or any part of the <hi>Persian</hi> Golf came to the Kings Coffers, as being solely at the disposal of the <hi>Kan;</hi> but that on the contrary, the King was oblig'd to send him Money to pay the Army. But that which troubled the Queen-Mother most of all, was the pretention of the <hi>Kan</hi>'s eldest Son to the Crown, whowas also a person of a daring and ambitious courage. For the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> esteem it a great Honour to bestow upon any <hi>Kan</hi> or great Lord, one of their Wives out of their Royal <hi>Haram;</hi> and <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> had given to <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> one of his own proper Wives, whom he lov'd extreamly. 'Tis thought that when she left the <hi>Haram</hi> she was three months gone with Child by <hi>Sha-Abbas,</hi> for somewhat above six months after she was bedded by the <hi>Kan,</hi> she lay-in of a Son, of which the King was the reputed Father, and who being born before <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> pretended a right before him to the Throne. By vertue of this claim, contrary to the will of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> in favour of <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> this ambitious Lord, who only pass'd for the <hi>Kan</hi>'s eldest Son, vehemently sollicited his Father to seize upon <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self King, or at least to op'n a way for him to the Throne. Now it happen'd, that one day being a hunting with the young King near <hi>Schiras,</hi> the impatient young Lord coming to his Father; Sir, said he, see now the opportunity that offers you the Throne; for I will go presently and bring you <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi>'s head. But the <hi>Kan</hi> holding his Son by the Arm, told him, that he would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the death of his King; protesting to him, rather to dye a thousand deaths; adding withall, that it was the Kings will to appoint <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, as being the Son of his Son, and consequently his lawful Heir; that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106224:118"/>
the young Prince was recommended to his care, and in regard he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd and sworn, he was so far from falsifying his trust, that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his possession to the last gasp.</p>
                     <p>This generous resolution of the <hi>Kan</hi> broke the young Lords design upon the Kings person. However the <hi>Sultaness</hi> being not ignorant of the train that was laid for the young King, and against the repose of the Kingdom, thought it her wisest way to prevent the blow, and to rid her self of such persons as had conspir'd the death of the King. The <hi>Kan</hi>'s two other Sons took part with him they call'd their elder Brother. And as for the <hi>Kan</hi> himself, though he were upright in his Loyalty, yet his power, his wealth, his reputation among the Souldiery, and the affection that the people bare him, concurr'd together not only to render him suspected, but guilty. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> and the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> took counsel together, which way to divert the storm that threaten'd the Kings head, to whom they represented, that he was not safe in his own person so long as <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> and his three eldest Sons liv'd. The King easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd them, and resolv'd to be rid both of Father and Sons together; but the difficulty was to get 'em to Court, wherein opportunity it self assisted them. For at that time <hi>Amurath</hi> the Great <hi>Turk</hi> at the head of a vast Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was already advanc'd within the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi> had tak'n <hi>Erivan,</hi> and had ruin'd <hi>Tauris.</hi> Upon the first news of this march the King sends for all the <hi>Kans</hi> and Governours to attend his person, with all the Forces under their command. Among the rest, the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Schiras</hi> receiv'd the same orders; who thereupon assembl'd all his Troops, both Horse and Foot, who were not only the most numerous, but the best disciplin'd and stoutest Souldiers of all <hi>Persia.</hi> As he was upon his march to <hi>Casbin</hi> with his three Sons, the eldest having well consider'd of affairs; Sir, said he, <hi>We are making hast to the King, to the end our heads may the sooner fall at our feet. Perhaps my Son,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Kan, thou maist speak the truth; but to this day I never was a Rebel against the King, I have done whatever he commanded, and whatever may happ'n I will obey him till death.</hi> The <hi>Kan</hi> arriving at <hi>Casbin,</hi> was by the King welcom'd with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of joy. Some days after, he took a general Muster, and then made a great Feast which lasted three days, to which all the great Lords and <hi>Kans</hi> that were at <hi>Casbin</hi> were call'd. The three Sons of <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> were of the number; but the Father excus'd himself, as well by reason of his age, as also representing to his Majesty, that it better befitted him to employ his time in taking care of his affaires, and in praying for his Majesty; however if it were his Majesties express command, he would not fail to obey; to which the King return'd for answer, that the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Schiras</hi> was at his liberty to do as he thought fit. The third day of the Feast the King rose from his Seat, and going out of the Hall, without speaking a word to any person, went into a Room hard by. Half an hour after, three sturdy resolute Fellows with some other Ragamuffin attendants, entring the Hall with their Scimeters drawn, seiz'd upon the <hi>Kans</hi> three Sons, and cut off their heads. They were put into a Gold Bason, and presented to the King; who commanded the Fellows to carry them to their Father, and as soon as he had seen them, to take off his head to make the fourth. The Assassinates found him at his prayers; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted to see the heads of his three Sons, he desir'd leave only to conclude, which having done, with a countenance undisturb'd, and without any other words or expressions in his mouth than what is usually said among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, Let the Kings will be done,</hi> he submitted to a death which he might have easily avoided. The four heads were brought back to the King, to be sent into the <hi>Haram</hi> to his Mother. So soon as he had taken off the heads of the Father and the three Sons, the King dispatch'd away certain <hi>Chappars</hi> or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, with order to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Kan,</hi> to put to death all the rest of the Children. The command was obey'd, and they were all put to death, but only two that were at Nurse, whom their Nurses so well conceal'd, that never any tidings could be heard either of the Nurses or of the Children.</p>
                     <p>After the death of <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</hi> the Province of <hi>Schiras,</hi> with its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances, has been govern'd by a <hi>Vizir,</hi> who agrees with the King what Rent to pay him yearly. In the years 1665 and 1666, the <hi>Vizir</hi> gave him fifty
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106224:119"/>
thousand Tomans a year. But in the year 1667, the King abated him eight thousand Tomans, in regard he had taken from him a small part of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pleasure a Favourite.</p>
                     <p>Besides what the Governour of <hi>Schiras</hi> pays to the King in ready Money, he is oblig'd every year to send him a present of all the rarities that grow on are bred in the Province. These Presents consist in Horses, of which there is the best breed of any Province of <hi>Persia.</hi> In Granates, Oranges, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, sweet Oils and Waters of several sorts, especially Oil of Roses, with which the women rub their bodies and heads; and the water of a certain Flower that grows upon a tree not much unlike our Willows, which water is call'd <hi>Arak-Bilmitshe,</hi> which is a great refreshment to those that use it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other Oils and Essences which the Governour is oblig'd to present. Yet were he only oblig'd to present the King, the expence might be born well enough; but for fear of being displac'd by any other Favourite, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to make Friends of all the other great Lords and Favourites at Court; which there is no way to do, but by continual presents. Whereas the ancient <hi>Kans,</hi> who were a kind of petty Soveraigns in their Governments, were only wont to send a few Baskets of new Fruits in their season for the service of the Kings Table. To defray this expence, the Governours are forc'd to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over the people; who when they come, as many times they do, two or three Villages together, to complain to the King, are forc'd after long wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to return with empty Purses home again, by reason that they who should give them admission, are the only persons that debar them from it; and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to submit to the Extortions of the <hi>Vizir;</hi> which is a piece of policy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd likewise by all the other <hi>Kans</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Persian</hi> Provinces. As for <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> himself, he was very severe, and one whose punishments oft'n amounted to acts of cruelty. One day being a hunting, a poor Countryman appear'd from behind a Rock, with a paper in his hand, being deputed by the Village to make some complaint to the King. But while the poor man cry'd for justice, the King without making any answer, shot two arrows into his body and slew him. That which mov'd <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> to this act of cruelty, was because he had some of his Wives with him in company. For then there is no mercy to those poor people that happ'n to be in the way where the King chances to pass by; no not for them that are in the Country round about, where the Eunuchs have order to kill all men they meet. When the King gives notice of his intention to carry his Wives into the Country, this is call'd <hi>Courouk;</hi> and there is nothing more troublesome nor more inconvenient in the world to the poor people that live in the Villages through which these women are to pass; for upon notice giv'n them, they must leave their Houses for a League or two of either side. When there is a <hi>Courouk</hi> at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> let the weather be never so bad, the people must leave their Houses, and if they have no Friends in some distant quarter to retire to, they have no way but to repair to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Such is the excess of the jealousie of the Kings of <hi>Persia;</hi> which indeed derives it self to all his Subjects, who will not permit their women to be seen by any but their own Husbands.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> both men and women are so addicted to take Tobacco, that to take their Tobacco from them, is to take away their lives. So that if the King should prohibit Tobacco for any time, he would lose a good part of his revenue. However <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> in a humor having once forbidd'n Tobacco to be taken in any part of his Dominion, his Spies (that are in every City) found in the <hi>Indian</hi> Inn two rich Merchants of that Nation smoaking their noses. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they were seiz'd, bound, and carry'd to the King, who commanded forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that Justice should be done upon them in the <hi>Meidan,</hi> which was that they should pour melted lead down their throates till they were dead.</p>
                     <p>The people thought the King had only intended to have scar'd them, and would have repriev'd them upon the place. Insomuch that four <hi>Banians</hi> went to the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> and offer'd to pay two thousand Tomans into the Kings Treasury, so that he would be pleas'd to spare the two Merchants lives. The chief Minister made the proposal, but the King falling into a passion, and asking the <hi>Atbemadoulet, whether those Indian Dogs thought that a King of</hi> Persia <hi>would
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106224:119"/>
sell justice,</hi> sent a second order for the execution of the Merchants without delay.</p>
                     <p>The same <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> having giv'n command that the Eyes of a young Lord of the Court should be put out, one of the principal Officers of the House being present, and seeing the Executioner prick the eyes of the unfortunate young man with the point of a small knife, shut his own eyes and turn'd away his head, as abhorring such a spectacle. The King perceiving it, and vex'd to see those signs of pity, and a dislike of an act that he approv'd; <hi>What,</hi> said he in a fury, <hi>art thou afraid to punish the wicked?</hi> And at the same time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his eyes to be pull'd out of his head.</p>
                     <p>It is a custom, that if any man points at the King as he passes along in the Street, or upon the Road, he must lose his hand. One day <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> being in the Country, two Merchants of <hi>Constantinople</hi> were upon the Road, where the King and his Train were to pass. They stopp'd to see the King, and when he came near, one of the Merchants pray'd his Friend that oft'n had seen him, to shew him which was he. The other knowing that only the King wears the Heron tops in his Bonnet, innocently lifted up his hand to distinguish him, by pointing, from the rest of the Lords that follow'd him. For which act two Horsement came presently to him, and cut off his hand with a Scimiter.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The tragical and memorable Story of <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi> Native of <hi>Zurich,</hi> in the Reigu of <hi>Sha-Sefi,</hi> who had retain'd him in his Service.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>RAlph Sadler,</hi> born in <hi>Zurich,</hi> was a Watchmaker by Profession, who put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the service of the Emperors Resident at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, with whom he went to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This man I desir'd to take along with me into <hi>Persia;</hi> and coming to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> he set himself to work, and made a small Watch about the bigness of half a Crown; which being a neat piece of work, the <hi>English</hi> would needs buy, to present it to <hi>Iman-Couli-Kan</hi> paying the price demanded, which was two hundred Crowns. <hi>Iman-Couli-Kan</hi> presented it to the King; who was mightily pleas'd with it, in regard it was the least striking Watch that ever had been seen by the King, who therefore carry'd it hanging about his Neck under his Clothes, in a Gold Chain. One day the King happening to wind up his Watch, and turning the Key the wrong way, broke the Fusil, for which he was so much troubl'd, that he sent for the Watch-maker from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Casbin;</hi> whither when <hi>Ralph</hi> came, he presently made the Watch as good as ever. The King thus satisfy'd in his work and in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, order'd him a Pension of thirty Tomans, and Diet for him and a man, and provision for two Horses; commanding him withall to make some new pieces of work. Now a skilful workman in the service of the <hi>Persian</hi> King, has this advantage, that if he pleases the King, besides his Wages that are duly paid, the King out of his liberality bestows on him a present, which usually amounts to a third part or half his Wages; or else his Wages are rais'd, which is more advantageous than a present.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ralph</hi> was oblig'd every morning to wait upon the King at his rising, to wind up his Watch; and was so much in the Kings favour, that every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he came out of the Kings Chamber, he had a Glass of Wine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him, as a mark of esteem. And indeed the King had such an affection for him, that to retain him in his service he often sollicited him to turn <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Embassador of <hi>Holstein</hi> coming to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and seeing <hi>Ralph</hi> so much in favour with the King, endeavour'd to gain his Friendship.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Ralph</hi> oft'n keeping company with the Embassadors, and having one time tarry'd till late at night upon the debauch with them, returning home to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106224:120"/>
his Lodging, where he kept a young <hi>Nestorian</hi> girl, in the Court of the House met a young <hi>Persian,</hi> Brother to one of the Kings Porters. The <hi>Persian</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself guilty, and surpriz'd to see <hi>Ralph</hi> so soon return'd, skip't over the Wall into the Garden and fled. The next day <hi>Ralph</hi> (who knew who he was) told his Brother of it, and desir'd him to speak to the young <hi>Persian</hi> not to come any more to his House; for if he did, he must expect what follow'd.</p>
                     <p>Some days after, the Embassadors treated all the <hi>Franks;</hi> when <hi>Ralph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be warm, call'd the young <hi>Persian</hi> to mind, and slipping home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking his leave, open'd the door softly, and found the young <hi>Persian</hi> again with his Mistris. Thereupon <hi>Ralph</hi> calling his Slaves to help him, bound his arms, and ty'd him to a Tree in the Court; and so leaving him there, went to bed. By and by one of <hi>Ralph</hi>'s Servants, who knew the <hi>Persian,</hi> fell a jeering him; which so incens'd the <hi>Persian,</hi> that he having his feet at liberty, and the fellow within his reach, gave him sach a kick upon the bottom of his belly, that he first swooned away, and then dy'd. The other Slaves seeing him fall, waken'd <hi>Ralph</hi> with their cries, who thereupon snatching up a Pistol that was charg'd with a brace of Bullets, shot the <hi>Persian</hi> into the head. The <hi>Persian</hi> being thus slain, <hi>Ralph</hi> went in the morning to wind up the Kings Watch; and being ask'd by the King, as he was wont to do, what news in <hi>Ispahan,</hi> told him plainly what he had done, and the reason why. The King upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port told him, he had done well according to the strictness of the Country.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> at that time was <hi>Mirza-Také,</hi> who hated <hi>Ralph.</hi> For the <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants having presented the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> with several Watches at a time, it happen'd that once he sent to <hi>Ralph</hi> above thirty Watches toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be mended. For which the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> to gratifie him, and knowing that he kept four or five Servants, and seven or eight Horses, sent him fifteen or twenty Camels load of Straw and Barley for his Horses. But <hi>Ralph</hi> slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a present as that, <hi>Go</hi> (said he to the <hi>Athemadoulets</hi> Servant) <hi>tell thy Master, that I am neither a Horse nor an Ass, and therefore let him eat his Present himself.</hi> Which message so provok'd the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> that he study'd nothing but revenge.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> whose business it is to attend the King when he rises, and to report to him the news of the Town, told him, among the rest, what <hi>Ralph</hi> had done. The King reply'd, that <hi>Ralph</hi> had consess'd it to him already: and that he had pardon'd him, in regard he had reason to do as he did. But the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> made answer, that <hi>Ralph</hi> had minc'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and represented the story to the King far otherwise than it was, making the worst of it he could upon <hi>Ralph</hi>'s side; and the more to incite the King, he put him in mind of the fair occasion he had to force him to turn <hi>Mussulman,</hi> there being no way to expiate his crime, but by turning <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or suffering the Law. The King thus over-rul'd, sent for <hi>Ralph,</hi> told him, he was now better inform'd of the crime he had committed, and that he must either turn <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> or dye. Thereupon the King sent him to Prison. Eight days after, the King (who had a great love for him, and therefore troubl'd that he must be constrain'd to put him to death, unless he would turn <hi>Mahumetan,)</hi> sent for him again, and offer'd him two thousand Tomans, after a powerful perswasion by words, but all signify'd nothing. Upon that he sent him back again to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But yet remembring that he had once approv'd the fact, he sent for <hi>Ralph</hi> a second time, and offer'd him ten thousand Tomans, and a Wise out of his <hi>Haram,</hi> with all her Jewels; all which <hi>Ralph</hi> refus'd, with the same resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as before. The King incens'd at the fierceness of his resolution, deliver'd him to the Brother of the party slain, to execute the Law upon him. The <hi>Holstein</hi> Embassadors were resolv'd to have beg'd his life; but the <hi>Athema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doulet,</hi> smelling their design, would not permit them Audience. However, the King commanded all the <hi>Franks,</hi> and all the <hi>Armenian</hi> Clergy to be present at the Execution, to save all his blood, and put him in a Coffin; he commanded also, that he should be buried at <hi>Zulpha</hi> in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church-yard, and have a Tomb made over him.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon <hi>Ralph</hi> was lead to the <hi>Meidan,</hi> with that triangular Instrument of Wood which the <hi>Persians</hi> call a <hi>Palenk,</hi> about his neck. This <hi>Palenk</hi> was the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106224:120"/>
cause that the Brother of the deceas'd, who was to be the Executioner, not only miss'd his first blow, but wounded himself in the Leg, while his Skain being born off by one of the sides of the triangular Instrument, by the force of the blow lighted upon himself. Whereupon the people making a great shout hinder'd farther execution for that time. The King being advertis'd thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to Prison, and after a few days sent for him a third time into his presence; but though the King offer'd him a thousand Tomans, and that the Lords urg'd him to turn, though it were but for a while, and in outward appearance; yet neither threats nor promises could move the <hi>Zurickian,</hi> who was thereupon executed at the end of <hi>October,</hi> 1637.</p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Franks</hi> willingly contributed to raise him a Tomb; which was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a small <hi>Duomo,</hi> supported with four Pillars, ten or twelve foot high. The <hi>Armenians</hi> have made him a Saint; so that when they are sick of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they come and make their devotions at this Tomb; and every time they come, they carry away a piece of a Stone; so that the Tomb wants repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every year.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> to the end the King might be the less sensible of the want of him, had told the King, that his Majesty would find no great miss of him, in regard he had a Servant who was almost as good as himself. But some few days after, the Kings Watch that he always carry'd about him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of order, and <hi>Ralphs</hi> Apprentice not being able to remedy the fault; the King for madness that he had been the Watchmakers death, threw the Watch at the <hi>Athemadoulets</hi> head. <hi>There,</hi> cry'd he, <hi>Dog as thou art, by thy advice I put</hi> Ralph <hi>to death, the most skilful man of his Profession that ever will come into my Kingdom. Thou deservest for thy counsel, to have thy belly ript up. But I swear by my Throne, that from this time forward I will never put a a Christian to death for his Religion. And I question whether any of you would have had the same courage to have dy'd for the Law of</hi> Haly. And indeed they have been very cautious ever since; nor has any of the <hi>Franks</hi> been put to death, though they have flown out before the King in words and actions rash enough.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of some particulars under the Reign of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SHa-Abbas</hi> the second, Son of <hi>Sha Sefi,</hi> was no less cruel then his Father; and would be no less punctually obey'd.</p>
                     <p>He had two Sisters, which he marri'd to two of the richest Lords of his Kingdom, though of a very mean extraction. Some time after, the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that they were both with-Child, order'd Physick to be given them to destroy the fruit of their Wombs. About three months after, he was told that they were big again; then he suffer'd 'em to be brought to bed; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they should not give the Children any nourishment, but let'em starve to death.</p>
                     <p>The same <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> caus'd the tongue of one that fill'd him Tobacco to be cut out for a word spok'n idly. For the King calling for Tobacco, one of the Pages ran hastily for it to him that had it in charge, and bid him dispatch; who answer'd him briskly, <hi>Gehennemé sabreijlé,</hi> that is, <hi>to Hell, have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> The King being inform'd of it, commanded his tongue to be cut out. The poor man desir'd him that was the Executioner, to cut it as deep as he could in his throat, and to leave it very short; by which means he spoke some words muffling.</p>
                     <p>The people cry'd out against the <hi>Nazar,</hi> who being a person of low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and advanc'd to that high dignity in a short time, grew so proud that he contemn'd all the Lords of the Court. There was no dealing with him
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106224:121"/>
about any business, unless he were first presented; and he paid no body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making some advantage of it. Every body had reason to complain; yet no person knew how to come at the King to make their complaints. At length they bethought themselves of making their application to two black Eunuchs, who had the Kings ear in the night. One was call'd <hi>Aga-Saron,</hi> who was the <hi>Meter</hi> or Master of the Wardrobe; and the other <hi>Aga-Kafour,</hi> or high Treasurer. These two Eunuchs seeing the King in a good humour one night, let fall certain words concerning the <hi>Nazar,</hi> and his management of affairs, and thence slid into a discourse of His injustice, that caus'd the people to cryout against him, and speak evil of his Government. Now it happen'd one morning that the King intending to go a hunting, the Grand Master, who had always a large train at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, coming to the Kings Tent, the <hi>Meter</hi> deny'd him entrance. About the same time the King came forth, and seeing the <hi>Nazar,</hi> commanded his Officers to take off the Bonnet from the head of that Dog that took Gifts from his people; and that he should sit three days bareheaded in the heat of the Sun, and as many nights in the Air. Afterwards he caus'd him to be chain'd about the neck and arms, and condemn'd him to perpetual imprisonment, with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moudy a day for his maintenance; but he dy'd for grief within eight days after he was put in prison.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jafer-Kan,</hi> being a generous Lord, and one that kept a magnificent train, was Governour of <hi>Asterabat.</hi> At first he was very mild, but at last he began to exact such sums from the people, that his oppressions were very heavy; nor were these violences of his conceal'd from the Kings ear; who being one day drinking with some of his Lords, and seeing the Master of his Musick in the Room, who was a merry droll, and had always some pleasant news or other to tell the King; his Majesty was pleas'd to ask him, what the people said of <hi>Jafer-Kan;</hi> adding withall, that he had made him Governour of several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and had never heard any complaint of him before, but that now he was accus'd of strangely tyrannizing over the people. The Musick Master being a meer flatterer, and knowing that <hi>Jafer-Kan</hi> was extreamly belov'd by the King, confidently averr'd, that the Governour was falsly accus'd, and that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways known him apter to give than to receive. There was at the same time in the Room, an <hi>Agis</hi> call'd <hi>Manouchar-Kan,</hi> lately return'd from a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca;</hi> him the King also ask'd, what was his opinion of <hi>Jafer-Kan,</hi> and his Government, being a person that had been long acquainted with him; to whom the <hi>Agis,</hi> thinking to please the King, return'd the same answer, that the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Master had giv'n. Whereupon the King, who had been well inform'd of the <hi>Kans</hi> behaviour, turning toward the Lords that were present, <hi>What think you, said he, of these two Flatterers, that absolutely know the contrary to what they speak?</hi> And at the same time commanded two of the Musick Masters teeth to be pull'd out of his mouth, and to be driv'n into the head of the <hi>Agis;</hi> which had like to have cost him his life, being a very old man. As for <hi>Jafer-Kan,</hi> he was disgrac'd for a time, but being a person endow'd with noble qualities, valiant, generous, and pleasing in conversation, he was recall'd to Court, and knew so well how to make his tale good, that his Majesty gave him the Government of <hi>Shemeloubostan,</hi> of which <hi>Semeran</hi> is the Capital City. <hi>Shemelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bostan</hi> signifies a Country manur'd to bear fruit. Nor is there any Province in <hi>Persia</hi> that so abounds in Pastures and Castles, that daily fall to ruine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jafer-Kan</hi> being restor'd to favour, the King sent for several Lords of the Court to come and drink with them. He also commanded five <hi>French</hi> Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which he had in his service to wait upon him, a Goldsmith nam'd <hi>Sain,</hi> two Watchmakers <hi>Lagis</hi> and <hi>Varin,</hi> and two Musket-makers <hi>Marais</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi> After they had heated themselves a little with Wine, the King drew a Ruby out from off his finger, which I sold for him a hundred Tomans, and a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Jewel worth thirteen or fourteen hundred Tomans, which he gave to <hi>Jafer-Kan,</hi> with whom he was whispering at the same time. Now though the <hi>Nazar</hi> were at a distance, yet without doubt somewhat of the discourse was heard; insomuch that the Wine emboldning him, he told the King aloud, that if he would let him have but four thousand Horse, he would cut all that Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pieces. The King bid him hold his tongue and go to sleep; testifying
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106224:121"/>
his displeasure at his discourse. For the <hi>Nazar</hi> conjectur'd that the King was talking to <hi>Jafer-Kan</hi> about the incursions which the <hi>Usbeck Tartars</hi> often made from <hi>Meshed</hi> side. As for the <hi>Franks</hi> three of the five were gone home to sleep, <hi>Sain, Lagis,</hi> and <hi>Bernard: Maras</hi> and <hi>Varin</hi> stay'd behind in the Room. But <hi>Marais</hi> being of a humor that when he was drunk he could not hold his tongue, and having heard what the <hi>Nazar</hi> said, he likewise took upon him to tell the King, that if the King wanted a General, there was none fitter to make a General than <hi>Jafer-Kan,</hi> and presently began a long repetition of his praises. The King commanded him to hold his tongue, which he did for awhile, but then falling again into his former impertinencies, the King commanded him to be dragg'd out of the Room by the feet, and that they should rip up his belly. Thereupon <hi>Marais</hi> was seiz'd upon by the <hi>Meter,</hi> who having a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the <hi>Franks,</hi> and knowing that the King had a singular love for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais,</hi> delay'd the execution of the Kings command, pulling his Cloathes off very slowly; and finding that the King did not rise to go into his <hi>Haram,</hi> which is the sign of no pardon to be given, he caus'd him to be dragg'd as near the person of the King as he could, thereby to try whether the King would have compassion on him or no; while certain Lords took the boldness to implore the Kings mercy in his behalf. At last when the King saw him dragg'd along, he commanded the Officers to let him go, and withall order'd him to put on his Cloathes again, and resume his place.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s eldest Son comes very raw to the Throne; and his first divertisement is to make short journeys into the Provinces, thereby by little and little to gain the knowledge of such things as concern him. Above all things he never fails to visit the principal Church of the <hi>Armenians</hi> at <hi>Zulpha.</hi> That which makes him so curious, is his desire to see the <hi>Armenian</hi> women, who are very handsom; being also further incited thereto by the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> who are glad of any recreation. And then he has a <hi>Courouk</hi> through all <hi>Zulpha,</hi> at what time all the men must retire to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> or to their Friends at a distance. <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second went several times in that manner to <hi>Zulpha;</hi> and one day among the rest, upon the report of the beauty of the Wife of the Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonter <hi>Gorgia Sasras,</hi> Son of Kelonter <hi>Gorgia Nazar,</hi> the King having seen her, lik'd her very well, and desir'd her to go along with the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> who carry'd her into the <hi>Haram,</hi> where she continu'd fifteen days, and then return'd home with a fair Neck-Lace of Pearls, which the King gave her when she went away.</p>
                     <p>To say the truth of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second, he was a man too much given to drink, and too much govern'd by his passion; otherwise he was a lover of justice, and very magnificent and generous to Strangers.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the misfortune of Mahomet <hi>Beg</hi> in the raigne of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second,</head>
                     <p>MAhomet <hi>Beg</hi> was born at <hi>Tauris,</hi> the Son of a Taylor, who bred him a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. He had a quick apprehension, and was naturally enclin'd to vertue; and being desirous to advance himself in the world, he had the good luck to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the employment of <hi>Major-Bashi,</hi> or chief of the Essayers and Refiners of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, who has a power to visit all places where money is coyn'd. After that, he became acquainted with the <hi>Aila Verdi Beg,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Godsgift,</hi> the Kings chief Huntsman, by the title of <hi>Mert-Shekar-Bashi,</hi> who gladly presented him to the King, to whom the King was very thankful, so soon as he had found the noble Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the person he had presented. Thereupon so soon as <hi>Mahomet Ali-Beg,</hi> grand Master of the Kings House dy'd, the King bestow'd that Employment upon <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Beg,</hi> who not only gain'd the favour of his Majesty, but the good will of all the Lords of the Court. He had a great respect for them all, without medling with any of their employments, and supprest his revengeful spirit, not finding it seasonable as yet to disclose his passions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kalise Sultan</hi> at that time <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> hapning to dye, the King conferr'd that place upon <hi>Mahomet Beg,</hi> who at first behav'd himself in that employment to the satisfaction of all men. He apply'd himself particularly to the searching out of Mines; for there had a report ran among the people for many years, that if certain mountaines nine or ten miles from <hi>Ispahan</hi> toward the West were well digg'd into, their might be found store of Gold, Silver and Copper. To which purpose he made use of a <hi>Norman,</hi> whose name was <hi>La Chapelle de Han,</hi> who vanted at that time to have great skill in Chymistry, Mines and Minerals, for which reason he was recommended by the Governor of <hi>Ispahan</hi> to the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> then at <hi>Casbin</hi> with the King, who presently sent him back again to the Governour to furnish him with all things necessary for his Expences, and for the work which he undertook in the Mountains. Thither went <hi>La Chapelle,</hi> and after fifteen days toyl return'd to <hi>Ispahan</hi> with two or three hunder'd weight of earth, and set up fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces to draw out the metal. The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> was so wise as to give order to the Governour of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and three or four more persons of Quality to overview the Norman, to see that he play'd no foul play. But though there was not so much as a half peny worth of silver in all the earth from the bottom to the top, though the <hi>Persians</hi> watch'd him so narrowly as they did, he made a shift to shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle in an <hi>Abassi</hi> among the earth, as it was in the furnace without being perceiv'd. Nevertheless the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> to whom it was carry'd, presently found out the cheat, though he took no notice of it, hoping to make better use of the Norman in other things; only he forbad him to dig any more in that place, in regard the expence would exceed the profit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Chapelle,</hi> who was very skilful at putting off his merchandize, and one who knew to make the best use of the least smackering that he might perhaps have in Mechanicks, and the power of Motion, had the cunning to amuse the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> for ten years together, being a passionate Lover of new Inventions; and the better to insinuate himself into the Kings favour assum'd to himself the Invention of several Rarities which he shew'd the King, who thereupon allow'd him a very handsome pension. Thus encourag'd, he undertook to cast Canons, bring the water to the top of the Kings house, and several other things, yet when all his designs fail'd for want of Art, and that he found he could do no more good in <hi>Persia,</hi> resolving for <hi>India,</hi> he dy'd at <hi>Ormus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> missing of Gold and Silver Mines, apply'd himself to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Copper Mines, wherein he was more fortunate; for in those Mines he also found veins of Azure, of which there is a great quantity consum'd in painting the <hi>Grotesco Flourishes</hi> upon the Ceilings and Arches of their Houses. He also found out a Mine of Lead near <hi>Yerde:</hi> and being still upon new discoveries, he found out
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106224:122"/>
a Mine of Talk, Stone, Allum, and Coles, but of neither so good as in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. He was so obstinate in the searth of Metals, that if any person had an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speak with him, let him be never so busie upon never so important affairs, it was enough to bring him some stones of a supposed Mine, or something rare ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Colour, Figure or Weight. He also gave full power to them that brought him any tidings of a Mine to go to the place, and to press the Countrymen from their labour to dig in the Mountains and break up rocks: and if they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he cast the fault upon the ignorance of the Labourers.</p>
                     <p>He also apply'd himself to the study of Mechanic Motions. He would have found an Invention, whereby the half Vail that hangs in the Kings <hi>Megeler,</hi> or Council Chamber, and is drawn to and fro by certain Officers in the Summer, to gather the cool Air, should have bin made by Engine-work. Then he took a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for water Engines, the most necessary thing in the world for <hi>Persia</hi> to relieve the drowth of the Country, but wanting necessaries, as Beams, Rafters, Wheel-work, Cordage and Iron, he could not begin those Engines, the figures whereof <hi>La Chapelle</hi> had left him in a Book.</p>
                     <p>But as Mahomet <hi>Beg</hi> was studious in these things, so was he Ambitious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful to that height that he could not observe a moderation in his resentment against those that had given him any distaste. In his height of Passion he caus'd several <hi>Kans</hi> to be depriv'd of their Provinces, and by confiscating their Estates reduc'd them to utmost necessity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Erivan</hi> had a Son who was a lovely and a well proportion'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and always attended at the Kings Elbow. One day that the King was drinking with some Lords, he commanded the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Erivans</hi> Son to carry a Gold Cup full of Wine to the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> who perceiving that he had enough already, made a sign with his eye to the young Lord to return it back. The young Lord passing by the King told him ingeniously that the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> had no desire to drink, whereupon the King commanded him to go and powre the Wine into his bosome. As the one vvas oblig'd to obey, the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> vvas forc'd to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to permit the young man to open his bosome and povvre dovvn the Wine; for not daring to shevv his Anger, he vvas forc'd to dissemble the best he could for that time. But having resolv'd to revenge the affront upon the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Erivan</hi> Father of the young Lord, vvho had only done vvhat the King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he resolv'd to lay hold upon the opportunity that presented it self, knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there vvere several complains come against him from the <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Erivan.</hi> Thereupon the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> sends for the <hi>Kelonter,</hi> encourages him in his suit, and gives him instructions hovv to proceed. To this end Mahomet <hi>Beg</hi> appoints him to meet him such an hour at the Kings Stables, whither the King presently coming, the <hi>Kelonter</hi> threw himself at the Kings feet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him for Justice against the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Erivans</hi> oppressions: while Mahomet <hi>Beg</hi> fail'd not to heap up aggravations against the Governour, and the King, though he had heard but one side, as easily condemn'd him upon the Accusation of the <hi>Kelonter</hi> and his Prime Minister. Thereupon an Officer of the Kings, call'd <hi>Negef-Couli-Beg,</hi> a man of a quick and active spirit was commanded to go in all haste, and seize upon the Person of the <hi>Kan.</hi> Who being come to <hi>Erivan</hi> found him upon his seat of Justice, confiscating and condemning to fine and Corporal punishment a near Kinsman of the <hi>Kelonters.</hi> The Messenger boldly enter'd into the <hi>Megeler</hi> or Council Chamber, goes directly to the <hi>Kan,</hi> told him he was the Kings prisner, and gave him a blow with his fist upon the neck, about which he was to wear the Triangle of great thick pieces of wood already describ'd, into which the neck is enclos'd, while the Arms and Hands of the Prisner are put through another piece of wood that crosses the Triangle, which is a great pain to the Prisner. Thus was the <hi>Kan</hi> carry'd night and day to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> but when he came there the King shew'd him more mercy, and allowed him his house for a prison, yet not suffering him to go to the Bath, nor to shave his hair, nor to stir out of the Apartment where his women were. These are penalties impos'd upon those that fall into disgrace at Court, whom the King shuts up in their houses, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no severer punishment. For the <hi>Kan</hi> being belov'd by the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to his favour, and to his former charge of superintendant of the Kings <hi>Mosquee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106224:123"/>
Neither did this sright'n others from bearing up against the Power of Mahomet <hi>Beg,</hi> though every one had not the same success. For ill it far'd with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Schiras,</hi> who was call'd <hi>Mirza Haddi.</hi> He was a person of great wealth and knowledge, and one day in Council took upon him to tell <hi>Mahomed Beg,</hi> that he was not of his opinion, and withall to lay before him his defects, and ill conduct. But the Primce Minister so deeply lay'd to heart the boldness of <hi>Mirza Haddi,</hi> that he resolv'd to revenge himself by all means imaginable. He suborn'd false witnesses, and other persons to make complaints before him of the Governour of <hi>Schlras.</hi> There was a necessity for the party accus'd to appear before <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> as his Judge, but the Governor trusting to his Innocence, nere minded the rage of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, not believing he could receive any injury from him. In the mean time <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> inform'd the King what he pleas'd himself, and overpow'ring him by his authority, confiscated all <hi>Mirza Haddi's</hi> Estate, and sent him to prison to the House of the <hi>Nazar,</hi> who was call'd <hi>Ismael Beg.</hi> When he came there they hung him upon Tenter-hooks by the feet against the wall, and drub'd him so long, that he was forc'd to be carri'd into another Room upon a Slaves back. His Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and an Eunuch, that had bin his Treasurer, were serv'd in the same sawce, and all three put into a high Chamber that serv'd instead of a prison. His Vizier or Lieutenant was releas'd in a short while, but <hi>Mirza Haddi</hi> and his Eunuch were still kept close.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the manner of his revenging himself upon <hi>Mir-Kassem-Beg,</hi> the <hi>Deroga,</hi> or Provost of <hi>Ispahan</hi> less remarkable. While <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> was only <hi>Majer-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shi,</hi> there was some gold Plate stoll'n out of the Kings Kitchin. Thereupon the <hi>Deroga</hi> sent his Officers to seize upon all the Goldsmiths in <hi>Ispahan,</hi> that knew nothing of the matter, as being utterly innocent of the Robbery. In the mean time he put them all in prison, and lockt them close up, intimating to them that he was resolv'd not to release them without a good sum of money. The poor Goldsmiths thus ill us'd, apply'd themselves to the <hi>Majer Bashi,</hi> who sent his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to entreat the <hi>Deroga</hi> to consider that the Gold-smiths were innocent of the Robbery, and that being in some manner under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Mayer-Bashi,</hi> as being Artificers in Gold and Silver, he ought not to refuse to discharge them at his request. But the <hi>Deroga</hi> not seeing the money come, bid the Officers of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet <hi>Beg</hi> tell their Master that he knew what belong'd to his Employment, and further, said he, <hi>Let the Taylors Son meddle with his own business; tell him withall,</hi> added he, <hi>that if he pleases I will shew him his Sister's drawers.</hi> For a little before the <hi>Deroga</hi> had by his Spies surpriz'd her toying in a Garden with two young Lords, from whom he squeez'd a considerable sum of money. <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> not powerful enough then to prosecute his revenge, let it sleep, but when he came to the height of preserment, he remember'd the <hi>Deroga,</hi> and bethought himself which way to ruin him. Nor was it long ere an opportunity offer'd it self. For there being a report that the Enemy appear'd about <hi>Candahar,</hi> a Frontier Town of <hi>Persia</hi> upon the <hi>Mogulls</hi> Territories, the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> adviz'd the King to raise a good number of Souldiers about <hi>Ispahan,</hi> as being lusty nimble fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and us'd to labour, and to send them to <hi>Candaliar,</hi> to be ready against all accidents. The King having an entire confidence in the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> order'd him to lose no time, but to commit the management of the Levies to such persons as had perfect knowledge of the plain Country. Then <hi>Mahomet Beg,</hi> studying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, told the King that there was no person fitter for the employment than the <hi>Deroga. Mir Kassembeg,</hi> who according to his cruel and covetous humor, soon abus'd his Commission, the thing which he, who had procur'd it, chiefly desir'd. For whereas the King intended that none should be enroll'd but those that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the <hi>Deroga</hi> forc'd every body, especially the Sons of the richest Farmers, who rather than part with their Sons gave the <hi>Deroga</hi> his own demands to spare them. When <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> had got matter enough against the <hi>Deroga,</hi> he underhand stirr'd up the Country people to make their complaint, giving them to understand that it was contrary to the Kings intention to have them tormented in that manner, that his Commission was only to list those that would go of their own accord. The Villages, easily encourag'd, sent their Deputies to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> whom he kindly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd and presented the same hour to the King. His Majesty having heard them, and <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> having seconded their complaint, the King order'd that they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106224:123"/>
should make an exact list of what the Commissioners of the <hi>Deroga</hi> had robb'd them of. <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> lost no time, but by vertue of his Authority and the Kings command, sent his Officers into all the Villages to take the Oath of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Countryman to the end they should declare the truth, under the penalty of a Fine and Corporal punishment, of what had been exacted from them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Shayet.</hi> This Oath was to be put in Paper, sign'd by every one that made it, in these words, <hi>Let my head be confiscated to the King, and my goods to his</hi> Divan, <hi>if I obey not punctually the Order of his Majesty.</hi> The accompt being made of all the money for which they had compounded with the <hi>Deroga,</hi> it was presented by <hi>Mahomet Beg,</hi> who aggravated the Tyranny of the <hi>Deroga,</hi> and represented to his Majesty that for thirty years he had thus devour'd the Territories of <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Thereupon by the command of the King, who was then at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> the <hi>Deroga</hi> was to be carry'd into the <hi>Meydan,</hi> and being ty'd up by the heels to receive a certain number of Bastinado's upon the feet for so many Fridays one after another; and moreover the nerves of his heels were to be cut, and his ankles to be boar'd tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. The Kings command being thus seal'd, Mahomet <hi>Beg</hi> committed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof to his trusty Instrument <hi>Negef-Couli-Beg,</hi> who coming to <hi>Ispahan</hi> assembl'd the chief of the City, together with the <hi>Vizir</hi> or Governour, and the <hi>Deroga</hi> or Provost, who thought of nothing; being met, before they broak open the Kings Seal they made a publick Prayer for the prosperity of the King; which being ended, the <hi>Vizir</hi> open'd the Letter and read it with a loud voice. When the <hi>Vizir</hi> came to read the Sentence against the <hi>Deroga,</hi> he was seiz'd with astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at what time <hi>Negef-Couli-Beg</hi> coming to the <hi>Deroga,</hi> and striking him upon the Neck with his fist, threw him down under his Horses feet, and caus'd him to be bound according to custom. Immediately he was hurri'd to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where he receiv'd so many Bastinado's upon the soles of his feet that his nayls fell off. The next Friday they brought him to the same place, where they repeated the same Execution, and boar'd his ankles. The <hi>Deroga</hi> being very ancient, his pains put him into such a condition as mov'd <hi>Negef-Couli-Beg</hi> himself to compassion, who wrote presently to Court, that the continuance of so much torment, would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be the death of the old man. Upon that the King order'd that there should no more be done to him; only that he should be shut up in the inner part of his House with his Wives, depriving him of his employment, but leaving him his Estate.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Mahomet Beg,</hi> not having yet compleated the revenge he sought, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd after he had thus tormented him, to deprive him also of his Estate. To which purpose he advanc'd to the Office of <hi>Deroga,</hi> a <hi>Georgian</hi> Renegado who was call'd <hi>Padada-Beg,</hi> whom he taught all the tricks imaginable to pick the peoples pockets. The design of <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> in this, was to let the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that if the new <hi>Deroga</hi> could heap up such a sum of money in five or six months, what a prodigious sum must <hi>Mir-Kassembeg</hi> have heap'd up in so many years. In short, the new <hi>Deroga</hi> instructed and encourag'd by <hi>Mahomet Beg,</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd unjustly such a vast number of fines, committed so many extortions and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines upon the people, that at the end of six months the people began to tumulc at the Palace gate. The <hi>Divan Bequi,</hi> who is the first Minister of Justice, took the peoples part; whereupon <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> perceiving he had been too hasty in his design to be reveng'd upon the <hi>Divan Bequi,</hi> who had cross'd his designs, one morning caus'd several files of Musqueteers to be drawn up at the Kings <hi>Haram.</hi> The King surpriz'd at the sight, <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> told him that his Majesty was not safe so long as the <hi>Divan Bequi</hi> stirr'd up the people to Rebellion: which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd the King, that he caus'd the Groom Porter to go immediately and pull out the <hi>Divan Bequi's</hi> eyes, which was immediately done; nor did the old man say any more, but with his face all besmear'd with his own goar, desir'd the servant upon whose arms he lean'd, to turn him toward <hi>Mecca</hi> that he might pray for the prosperity of the King. All his goods were confiscated and brought into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury; but <hi>Mir Kassem-beg</hi> still enjoy'd his, though he was forc'd to spend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his days in his own house.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> preserv'd himself still in the Kings favour, and had remov'd all those persons from the Court that had no kindness for him, and was indifferently safe, till <hi>Mir-Tchekar-Bashi</hi> another favourite, whom the King highly lov'd, began
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106224:124"/>
to make head against him. These two haughty spirits would not give an inch one to another: and both equally strove to possess the Kings favour, to have the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of Affairs. <hi>Mir-Tchekar-Bashi,</hi> who had brought <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, being the elder pretended a respect due to his years, and <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more due from him by reason of his place. During this contest ran a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a rebellion upon <hi>Georgia</hi> side. Whereupon the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> perswaded the King to send <hi>Mir-Tchekar-Bashi,</hi> lately made <hi>Koular Agasi</hi> or General of the Slaves toward <hi>Georgia,</hi> that so he might remove his Rival from Court. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite sets forward with a flying Camp, but not finding any Enemy that oppos'd him, wrote back to the King that he saw no appearance of an Enemy, and that therefore it was a needless thing to tire the Souldiers in a Country where there was no face of War, and begg'd his Majesties leave to return. The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> on the other side labour'd to hinder his return by preaching to the King the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the stay of those forces in those parts.</p>
                     <p>In this interim the <hi>Usbek Tartars</hi> had made inroads upon the Frontiers of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassan,</hi> and had slain several of <hi>Manoutcheks</hi> people, who was governor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> who was his Kinsman, gave the King to understand that the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Corassan</hi> had behav'd himself valiantly, but conceal'd the defeat of the <hi>Kan.</hi> On the other side the <hi>Koular Agasi</hi> sent Letter upon Letter to the King, but perceiving that none of them came to the Kings hands, he sent to <hi>Ispahan</hi> one of his discreetest and most trusty servants, who coming to Court intermix'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self among the rest of the Lackeys. The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> spying an unknown face, and being always mistrustful, demanded who he was? To whom the Messenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd that he was a poor Souldier upon the frontiers of the Kingdom, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not get his pay there was come to Court to see if he could there get any recompence for his service: upon which reply the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> took no farther notice of him. Presently after, the young man meeting the <hi>Meter</hi> told him he had Letters of importance to deliver into the Kings own hand, of which the <hi>Meter</hi> giving notice to the King, the messenger was immediately call'd in. The King having read the Letters which discover'd to him what the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> had conceal'd from him touching the no necessity of keeping forces upon the Frontiers of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and the loss which the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Korassan</hi> had receiv'd, transported with choler against his prime Minister, sent for him, and after he had most bloodily revil'd and reproach'd him, he was within a little of killing him with his own hands. But the <hi>Nazar</hi> and some other Lords there present took the boldness to represent to the King the long services which <hi>Mahomet Beg</hi> had done the Kingdom, and that since his Majesty had rais'd him from the dust to the highest honours of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it would not be for his honour to destroy at one blow a person that he had lov'd, and might still be useful to him. This discourse somewhat appeas'd the King, so that he only gave him in custody to the <hi>Nazar.</hi> Three days after the King exil'd him to <hi>Kom,</hi> with all his Family, not permitting him to shave himself, go to the Bath, or to come abroad. This Exilement lasted for several years. But my Letters from <hi>Persia</hi> in the year 1674. enform'd me that <hi>Sha Solyman,</hi> the present King, has restor'd him to his Primier Dignity, and that he still governs as <hi>Athema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doulet,</hi> the King finding no man more capable than himself.</p>

                     <p>BEtween <hi>Cape Jasque,</hi> and <hi>Cape Guadel</hi> which are the two most Southern points of <hi>Persia,</hi> there lies a mountainous and mershie Country, which extends it self from the Ocean toward the Province of <hi>Kerman,</hi> and in several places is inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible. It is possess'd by three petty Princes, the one a Mahumetan, the other two toward the East both Idolaters. The first is the most potent of the three, and nearest to the Province of <hi>Ormus.</hi> He also assumes the title of Prince of <hi>Jasque,</hi> as his Ancestors did before him. Now after <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the first had conquer'd <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> he went about to have made himself master of all the coast that extends it self beyond <hi>Cape Jasque;</hi> but meeting with resistance, he only obtain'd that the Prince of the Country should acknowledge the King of <hi>Persia</hi> for his Lord, and that as his Vassal he should pay him an annual tribute. And indeed during the raign of <hi>Sha-Abbas,</hi> who knew how to make himself fear'd, the Prince of <hi>Jasque</hi> pay'd his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute very orderly. But <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> succeeding his Grandfather very young, this tributary Prince shook off his yoak, and refus'd to pay. Which not being regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the raign of <hi>Sha Sefi,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Jasque</hi> thought to do the same in the raign of <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> the second. But at length after he had refus'd to pay for some years, the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Ormus</hi> pretending the Country to be under his Jurisdiction, and that the Kings honour was concern'd in the Princes refusal, incited <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> to send forces against him to reduce him to obedience. The King granted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to him that had undertaken the business: who presently gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Army of 20000 men, the most part Horse, thought to have surpriz'd his Enemy. To which purpose that he might take the nearest way, he march'd direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward <hi>Cape Jasque.</hi> But as it was the shortest cut, it was the most dangerous; insomuch that the <hi>Kan,</hi> who hunted all the way he march'd, according to the custom of <hi>Persia,</hi> had the misfortune to fall into a bogg, where he was stifl'd, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with 20 or 30 horsemen more. The death of the <hi>Kan</hi> being divulg'd, the Army retreated back again: but as soon as the King receiv'd the news, he sent the Brother of the deceas'd <hi>Kan</hi> to succeed him. In the mean while the Rebel Prince believing within himself, that he was not to be thus at quiet, and expecting to be attack'd by the new <hi>Kan,</hi> stood upon his guard. And indeed the new <hi>Kan</hi> march'd with all the speed he could, and enter'd the territories of the rebellious Prince, but being beat'n was forc'd to make more haste back again to <hi>Ormus,</hi> with the loss of an abundance of men.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Jasque</hi> puft up with this success, did not believe that the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would be so hasty to come again: and thereupon he resolv'd upon a Voyage for <hi>Mecca</hi> to give the Prophet thanks for his Victory. To which end he embarqu'd at the nearest place he could to <hi>Cape Jasque,</hi> thence to make fail toward <hi>Arabia.</hi> But the Governor of <hi>Kan</hi> understanding his design by his spies, way-laid him by Sea, took him and brought him to <hi>Ormus.</hi> At that time the heats being exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, the Governour was retir'd, according to custome, to the Mountains some ten or twelve Leagues from the City, whither the Prince was carry'd and brought to the <hi>Kans</hi> tent. But while the <hi>Kan</hi> was expecting the return of the Messenger which he had sent to the King for orders what to do with the Prisner, the Princes wife hearing of her husbands misfortune, and being a woman of a manlike cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, taking along with her about five or six hundred horse, with little noise and by long marches she at length fell unawares upon the <hi>Kan</hi> about midnight, kill'd him with her own hand, cut in pieces the greatest part of his men, whom she found asleep, carry'd away ten or twelve of his wives, and set her husband at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in spite of the <hi>Persians,</hi> who had not time to rally themselves.</p>
                     <p>The news of this defeat coming to Court, the King being highly incens'd, sent away the third Brother to be governour of <hi>Ormus,</hi> with special command to the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106224:125"/>
Governours of <hi>Schiras, Lar</hi> and <hi>Kerman</hi> forthwith to raise 30000 horse to revenge affront and reduce the Rebel. The <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Ormus</hi> march'd at the head of that Army, and gave Battel, but the Prince being succour'd by the other two Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Princes his neighbours, the <hi>Persians</hi> were again beaten. Only the Prince of <hi>Jasque</hi> lost his Lieutenant General, a valiant Captain, and a very good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
                     <p>The King understanding that the Lieutenant General was the <hi>Kans</hi> Prisner, gave him leave to do with him what he would, in revenge of his Brothers death: who thereupon devis'd the most cruel torments that ever were heard of. For he first caus'd the body of the Lieutenant General to be larded with lighted Candles, and then setting him upon a Camel order'd him to be led softly about the streets eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in the very heat of noon. A torment almost insufferable, which the hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic Indian nevertheless endur'd with an invincible courage. After the <hi>Kan</hi> had tormented him in this manner three days together, the chief of the <hi>Holland</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and other strange Merchants abhorring so much cruelty, begg'd of the <hi>Kan</hi> to surcease his rigour, who readily granted them their request.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Observations upon the raigne of <hi>Sha Soliman</hi> the present King.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ALi-Couli-Kan</hi> had bin three or four times exil'd from the Court, for speaking with two much liberty. For he was bold and could not keep his tongue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his teeth. For which reason he was call'd the Kings Lyon, who was wont to chain him up when he had no occasion for him, and to let him loose when he had any business for him to do. The last time he was exil'd, he was kept five or six years in a Fortress out of which he had never stirr'd: but one day, having a smooth tongue, he overperswaded the Commander to give him leave to go a hunting with him. When he return'd, with the help of some of his servants, he fell upon the Commander, and gave him so many Bastinadoe's upon the feet, that he had like to have kill'd him: telling him withall, that it was to teach him his duty not to let a man go that the King had committed to his charge. <hi>Sha Sephi,</hi> though very young, hearing of this, and desirous to see <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan,</hi> notwithstanding all the endeavours of the Grandees to hinder his return, commanded him to be set at liberty, and that he should have a better allowance to live upon. Two or three days after, the King sitting in Council, the whole Assembly was amaz'd to see <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> enter, who approaching his Majesty with a profound reverence, told him that the Lyon being now let loose was humbly come to kiss his hands. Thereupon the King fell a laughing, and casting a favourable glance upon him, told him he had done well. Nor was it long ere the King finding him no less pleasant in conversation, then a valiant and expert Captain, made him Generalissimo of his Armies, as he had bin in the raigne of <hi>Sha Abbas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Court saw <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> so well receiv'd, every one then labour'd to testifie their joy for his return. They sent him Horses, Mules, Camels, rich Carpets, and every thing fit to furnish a Lords house. But all this while he wanted money, which because he could not meet with among the <hi>Persians,</hi> he was forc'd to have recourse to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> of whom he desir'd to borrow five or six hunder'd Tomans. As for the <hi>Kalenter</hi> he would have had the sum lent, but the rest would not. Thereupon the King taking a walk to <hi>Zulpha, Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> put it into his head to go and see the great Cathedral belonging to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> where several Bishops with several Monks reside. The King entring into the Church, where the Bishop stood ready at the head of the Clergy to receive him, and seeing all things new and strange, as coming but lately out of the womens <hi>Haram,</hi> ask'd his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite what sort of people those were clad in such an extraordinary manner. <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> told him they were Devils, <hi>Devils!</hi> said the King, <hi>What!</hi> added he, <hi>dost bring me into a house of Devils?</hi> The King thus incens'd against the <hi>Armenians,</hi>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:106224:125"/>
resolv'd to force 'em to turn <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> But <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan,</hi> being a <hi>Georgian,</hi> repenting that he had rais'd the Kings indignation to so high a pitch, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it would be any advantage to him for the <hi>Armenians</hi> to turn <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> contented himself only with frighting them, which was enough to bring the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> upon their knees, and to make them come and beg the Intercession of his authority. Which favour, as he order'd it, cost the <hi>Armenians</hi> ten thousand To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to the King, and four or five thousand Tomans to his Favourite.</p>
                     <p>The 23. of <hi>September</hi> 1677. the King made a Cavalcade, then which there could be nothing imagin'd more magnificent. All the richest Furniture was brought out of the Exchequer into the <hi>Meydan.</hi> The golden buckets to water the Horses. The golden Fat out of which they take the water, together with the buckles, harness and nails of gold, to which the Horses are ty'd. After the King had play'd at Mall, as I have already describ'd, and had also shot at the Goblet upon the top of the Mast in the middle of the <hi>Meydan,</hi> he went and fate in the <hi>Divan,</hi> which is over the Gate call'd <hi>Ali Capi,</hi> where he had the pastime to see Lyons, Bulls, Bears, Tygres and Rams fight. But that which was most admirable, was to see a man stand upright upon the Saddle while the horse ran full speed, which he did three times the whole length of the <hi>Meydan.</hi> The first time, 'tis true, he fell, but the two last times he stood firm.</p>
                     <p>On day the same <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> presented two handsom Youths to the King, which had both delicate voices. The King hearing them sing, was very much troubl'd that he could not make use of them in his <hi>Haram,</hi> which <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> observing, sent for a <hi>French</hi> Chirurgeon, and promis'd him a great reward if he could cut the youths and save their lives. The Chirurgeon for lucre of a large recompence, cut them both and cur'd 'em very well. Which done, <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan,</hi> presented the two youths to the King, who was surpriz'd to see them, but was well pleas'd that he had got two such new attendants in his <hi>Haram.</hi> But see the reward of such a wicked action. <hi>Ali-Couli-Kan</hi> dy'd soon after. The Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urgeon never was pay'd: and being advis'd to present a Petition to the King by the Meter, the Meter ask'd him whither he would turn <hi>Mahometan:</hi> which when the Chirurgeon deny'd to do, the Meter bid him be gone like a Rascal, telling him withall that he did not think the Religion of the Christians had permitted such acts of villany. The two youths were born at <hi>Cashan,</hi> and had both Fathers and Mothers, and were promis'd in Marriage. When their Parents heard of it, they came to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> to weep over their Children. Which the King observing, to appease their sorrow, gave them a Pension during life.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Government of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Government of <hi>Persia</hi> is purely Despotick or Tyrannical. For the King has the sole powre of life and death over all his Subjects, independent from his Council, and without any Trials or Law-proceedings. He can put to what death he pleases the chief Lords of the Kingdom, no man daring to dispute the reason: nor is there any Soveraign in the world more absolute then the King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King deceasing and leaving Male Issue behind him, the Eldest ascends the Throne, while his Brothers are kept in the <hi>Haram,</hi> and their eyes are put out: and if there be the least suspicion of any contrivance against the King, they are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with put to death without any farther examination. And not only they, but the Children also of the Kings Brothers and Sisters. I remember when I first travell'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Persia,</hi> they were not so rigorous, but were contented to move a red hot iron to and fro before their eyes. But <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> perceiving his command had bin neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently executed, and that the poor unhappy Princes had some sight left them,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106224:126"/>
he order'd their eyes to be digg'd out of their heads. <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi>'s cruelty went yet farther, for he spar'd not his Eldest Son <hi>Sha Abbas,</hi> the lawful Heir to his Throne, ordering one of his Eunuchs to move an Iron before his eyes, no man being able to tell the reason. But the Eunuch compassionating the young Prince, did indeed move an Iron, but not a red hot Iron before his Eyes, and teaching him to counterfeit himself blind, preserv'd his sight till his Father lay upon his death-bed: at which time his Father was very penitent, for having put out the eyes of his Eldest Son, to whom the Throne of right belong'd. The Eunuch seeing the King so sadly afflicted and ready to give up the ghost, assur'd him that he would restore the Prince to his sight, and to comfort him at his death, brought the Prince with perfect eyes to the bed side. The sight of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd the Kings life till next day; and gave him time to command all the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Court to obey <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> his Eldest Son, as his lawful Successor and their King.</p>
                     <p>But to return to these blind Princes; There were several at <hi>Ispahan</hi> when I was there: and I knew one particularly, who is still alive, and is a person of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent natural parts. As blind as he is, he is a great lover of Curiosities, and has built him a House in <hi>Ispahan,</hi> which is worthy a mans sight. He is overjoy'd when any person brings him any rarities out of <hi>Europe,</hi> feeling them in his hands, and causing his Eunuchs, which are very apprehensive, to tell him the meaning of every thing. He is a great admirer of Clock-work and Watches, and can tell by his finger when a Watch is right in the Case. To know what a Clock it is, he has little points set up in the Dial-plate, and a half hand, to the end he may not be deceiv'd which part of the hand points to the hour. By means of certain figures which he makes of soft wax, and sets in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon a Table, he will cast up an accompt very exactly. Several other good qualities I admir'd in him; and it griev'd me to see a man reduc'd to that miserable Condition, only because he was of the blood Royal of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the Employments of the Kingdom generally fall from Father to Son, yet the King if he pleases may bequeath the Governments of Provinces or any other dignities to any of his <hi>Goulams</hi> which are his Slaves, if he find them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and thinks they may be fit for his service. The Father to leave the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to his Family, labours by degrees to introduce his Son, and to obtain the Survivorship for him. But if the Father dye, and leaves the Survivorship to an Infant, there is generally a person of Age and Experience sent along with him. Some there are also that obtain employments by presenting the Favourites at Court.</p>
                     <p>The State of <hi>Persia</hi> is distinguish'd like most of the <hi>European</hi> States, into three Bodies. The first is that of the Sword, which answers to the Nobility, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Kings houshold, the <hi>Kans,</hi> and all the Souldiery. The second is that of the Quill, comprehending all those that belong to the Law and the Courts of Justice. The third is compos'd of Merchants, Handicrafts-men and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the first of the three Orders or States of <hi>Persia,</hi> which comprehends the Kings Houshold, the <hi>Kans</hi> or Governours of Provinces, and the Souldiery.</head>
                     <p>THE Primier Minister of the Kingdom is call'd <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> or the support of Riches. His office is the same with the Grand <hi>Vizir's</hi> in <hi>Turkie,</hi> and may be compar'd to the ancient <hi>Mayors</hi> of the <hi>Palace</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> In regard all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom pass through his hands, he ought to be rather a Gowoman then a Souldier: and herein he only differs from the Grand <hi>Vizier,</hi> who is always to be at the head of the Army, and for every slight fault or distaste is subject to be strangl'd by the Grand <hi>Signior.</hi> Whereas in <hi>Persia</hi> where the Government is milder, the Prime Ministrers generally dye in their beds, or if they are Depos'd, they are only exil'd to some frontier City, where they live as private men.</p>
                     <p>When the King is young, the Prime Minister has a hard game to play, for then the Favourite Eunuchs and the Sultanesles disannul and cancel in the night what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever orders he makes in the day time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Nazar</hi> or <hi>Seer</hi> has the charge of all the Kings goods, of his breeds of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of his moveables, of his Cloaths and Plate: much like the grand Master of the Kings House in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mehter,</hi> who is always a white Eunuch, is the first Gentleman of the Kings Chamber, and follows the King with a kind of bag hanging by his side full of handkerchiefs. And as he is always at the Kings elbow, if he have the Kings ear, it is easie for him to befriend or do unkindnesses, as his inclination leads him. During the minority of the King, some of these <hi>Mehters</hi> have been known to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mir-Akhor-Bashi,</hi> or Grand Esquire, has the Charge of the Kings Stables, which as well as the Gate of <hi>Ali-Capri,</hi> are a place of Refuge, and whoever saves himself therein, let it be for Murther or Debt is safe. All the Horses in the Kings Stable are mark'd with a hot iron upon the left hip, and those that belong to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons upon the right. Those that the King gives to them that serve in his Armies, have the Kings mark, and are not to be sold, but they may be chaffer'd away. If any of those Horses happens to dye in a Horse-mans hands, he must flea off the Kings mark, and carry it to the under Officers of the General of the Cavalry, to have another, otherwise he would be forc'd to buy another at his own expences. Those people by laying the skin in the water, know, though by what art I cannot tell, whither the Horse dy'd of age or sickness, or whither he were malitiously kill'd. For in times of Peace there are some Horsemen that will kill their Horses, to save the Charges of keeping any more than themselves: then at the next Muster they bring the skin of their Horse, with the mark on, to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and get another, unless they be found out. Nor are their Horses only mark'd, but their Scimitars, Musquets, Bows and Quivers, all which they must shew to the Commissioners every Muster.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the second being at <hi>Casbin</hi> in the year 1654, took a general view of his Cavalry, which lasted for ten or twelve days. For the King sitting in the Portal of one of his Gardens, with his Officers standing about him, every day caus'd so many troopers to ride by him: which were all stout active men and well mounted. Every Souldier gallop'd singly by him; and coming just under the King, he shot an Arrow against a Butt of Turf that was thrown up upon his left hand, and when the Muster was over, the King advanc'd the Pay of every Horse-man, who according to the sentence of the Judges had shot nearest the mark.</p>
                     <p>I was then at <hi>Casbin,</hi> and I remember one Souldier, who quite contrary to what the other Horse-men did, walk'd his Horse along by the King, and never shot, but only lay'd his hand upon his brest, and then upon his forehead, which is the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106224:127"/>
Ceremony of Salutation us'd by the King. He was a very homely fellow, with a flat tawny countenance: so that his behaviour and his presence offending the King, in a chafe he commanded that black rascal to be cashier'd out of his service. Immediately they took away his Horse and his Arms, and were going about to have drubb'd him, but that the General of the Cavalry made them a sign to let him alone. Immediately the General gave the King to understand that he was one of the best Souldiers in the Army: as he had signally made it appear at the Sieges of <hi>Erivan</hi> and <hi>Candahar.</hi> Upon that the King caus'd his Horse and Arms to be restor'd him again, and commanded him to ride by him as the rest of the Souldiers had done. When he came against the Butt, instead of obeying the Kings command, he turn'd his Horse to the right and left, without saying a word. The General fearing he would offend the King again, bid him shoot. <hi>What shall I shoot at?</hi> Sir said he. <hi>Against the place where all the rest have shot,</hi> answer'd the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Then the Souldier shaking his head and smiling, <hi>'Tis not my way,</hi> said he, <hi>to spend my Arrows against a wall; for I know how to make use of 'em better against the body or head of the Enemies of my King. I would then shoot thrice before another could shoot once.</hi> At the same time he draws out two Arrows out of his Quiver, one of which he held in his mouth, and put the other to his bow: and then set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spurs to his Horse he out-rid the Butt for the nonce, to shoot backward, which he did, and hit the very middle of the white, then turning his horses head and passing the Butt as before, he shot the second Arrow into the same hole, whence they had pull'd the first Arrow. Then the General approaching near the King, told him that by what he had heard and seen, he might well believe that Horseman to be as brave a Souldier as any in the Army: which his Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, and from three Tomans advanc'd his pay to 15 Tomans.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mir-Shikar-Bashi,</hi> or the Grand Master of the Hunt, who is also employ'd as Grand Falconer. He has under him a thousand Officers, and a great number of Birds of prey, and manag'd Hawks.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seguan Bashi</hi> receives the orders of the Grand Master of the Hunt. He has charge of the Doggs, Lyons, Leopards, and other Beasts for Chace.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kindar Bashi,</hi> who has charge of the Kings Saddles.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Zinkan-Courlshisi</hi> is the chief of the Querries, that hold the Kings stirrup, when he gets a Horseback.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kelege-Courlshisi</hi> carrys the Kings sword.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Oriaje-Courlshisi</hi> carrys his Bow and Arrows.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vakanviez</hi> is as it were the chief Secretary of State: an employment never conferr'd but upon a Favourite. He also reads all Petitions and Papers that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to the King.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kasnadar-Bashi</hi> is he that keeps all the Money which is in the Kings Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, whom we call the High Treasurer.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ishik-Agasi-Bashi</hi> is the Grand Master of the Houshold, who has several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers under him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mehmender Bashi</hi> is the Master of the Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hakim-Bashi</hi> is the Kings chief Physitian, by whose allowance all the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Kingdom are licens'd.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Munedgin Bashi</hi> is the chief of the Astrologers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Divan-Bequi</hi> is the chief Justiciar, as well in Civil as in Criminal causes, and he keeps his Court either in <hi>Ali Capi,</hi> or in the Kings House, where his Majesty sometimes presides himself when he pleases. Before him as being an Officer of great Authority all the Criminals in the Kingdom make their appeal, and he makes out process against the <hi>Kans,</hi> and other Grandees of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Deroga</hi> is much like the Lieutenant Criminal in <hi>France,</hi> from whom it is lawful to appeal before the <hi>Divan Bequi.</hi> He has an eye upon Robberies, Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Murthers, and he has power to suppress Houses of Debauchery. If he catch any debauch'd persons, he has power to give them the Bastinado, or to fine them: and most commonly he spares corporal chastisement to punish their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sofragi-Bashi</hi> is he that spreads the <hi>Sofra</hi> before the King.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chirakgi-Bashi</hi> is he that has charge of the Wine: chiefly the <hi>Schiras</hi> wine, which is particularly kept for the King, who seldom drinks any other. Nor can
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106224:127"/>
any particular person in <hi>Schiras</hi> make Wine till the Court be first serv'd, and that with the leave of the <hi>Chirategi-Bashi;</hi> there being none but the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> that make it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mesheal-Bashi</hi> is the chief of the Torch-bearers; who furnishes the Court with Candles, which are all of Wax. To this <hi>Mesheal-Bashi</hi> belong all the fines of those that play at Cards or Dice, the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> forbidding all Games of hazard. This Officer has several inferior Officers under him, who go from place to place to spy where they can find any persons at play: and he has power to break open any house, unless the Master be of great Quality.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kahuergi-Bashi</hi> is he that has eare of the <hi>Kahué,</hi> the Rose-water, and other distillations which the <hi>Persians</hi> drink; as <hi>Bilmishe,</hi> made of the buds of brown Sallows.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kara-Setashe</hi> is the King's Chirurgeon, or Barber, who lets him Blood, and shaves his Head, and cannot part with his place to another.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capigi-Bashi</hi> is the great Porter, who has under him several other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Melikultugagear</hi> is he that has charge of the Stuffs for the King's Houshold, and puts them out to the Taylors. He takes an account of the shreds and old ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which serve to make Clothes for the Souldiers, deducting for them out of their pay.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gelander-Bashi</hi> is the chief of the Foot-men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mir-ahe,</hi> or the Prince of the Seals, is the Superintendent of the Seals; and for profit, is one of the best employments in the Kingdom. He has the sale of the Canal-water to the Countrey-men; for which he makes the Farmers pay a severe rate.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Karkrone</hi> is the House for the Royal Manufactures, where the Gold and Silver-Carpets are made, as also those of Silks and Worsted, together with Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues, Velvets, and Taffeta's. There are other Workmen that make Coats of Mail, Bows, Arrows, Scimitars, and other Arms. In other Apartments are Limners that paint in Water-colours; Lapidaries, and Goldsmiths, that only make Silver-Rings. For in regard the <hi>Persians</hi> cannot say their Prayers when they have any Gold about 'em, they never wear Jewel or Ring of Gold, because it would be troublesome to pull 'em off, and lay 'em up so many times a-day. And therefore the King of <hi>Persia</hi> causes all his Jewels to be set in Silver, as we set all our Stones in Gold. As for working Goldsmiths, they have none in <hi>Persia;</hi> all their Gold and Silver-Plate being wrought by the Copper-smiths in round figure, for they have not the art to frame an Oval.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Nakkashe-Bashi</hi> is the Serjeant-Painter, who only works in miniature; they cover their Pictures with a Varnish made of Mastich steep'd in a certain Oil that distills from a Rock that points upon the <hi>Caspian-</hi>Sea not far from <hi>Shamatri.</hi> It distills out of the Rock at first like water: but afterwards it thickens till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as thick as Sallet-Oil, preserving still its whiteness. There are also three other Rocks not far from the former, from whence this Oil distills; but it is thicker, and of darker colour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Negeach-Bashi</hi> is the chief of the Joyners.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Embardar-Bashi</hi> has the charge of the King's Granaries, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, having several Officers under him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Odondar-Bashi</hi> is the Master of the Woodyard.</p>
                     <p>The most part of these Officers have their diet in the King's House, or else an allowance of Diet from thence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tushemal-Bashi</hi> is the Clerk of the Kitchen. He orders what shall be serv'd up to the King, and when the Table is clear'd, he sticks his Knife in the best dish, and orders it to be carri'd home to his own House.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Officers of War, the principal are; First, the <hi>Sepeh-Salar, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralissimo</hi> of the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Armies, who is never constituted but in time of War; which being ended, his employment ceases. His place in Council is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately next to the <hi>Athemadoulet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in regard the Militia is divided into three sorts, there are also three Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. The three Bodies of the Militia are the <hi>Corschis,</hi> the <hi>Goulams,</hi> and the <hi>Tusenlegis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:106224:128"/>
The <hi>Corschis</hi> are descended from a forreign race, which have still a great repute for their Valour. These people live in Tents, like the <hi>Turcomans;</hi> and they send their Youth betimes to the King. They furnish their Youth also with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and maintain them till they come to be taken notice of by the King. They are all Horse-men, well paid, and well look'd to, and are many times advanc'd to the Supreme Dignities of the Kingdom. They are generally call'd <hi>Kesel-Bashi,</hi> or <hi>Red-heads,</hi> because that formerly they wore red Bonnets. It is said that the King has about 22000 of these <hi>Corchis</hi> in pay, all good Souldiers, that do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Battel. <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the first did what he could to abolish this Militia, and to set up the <hi>Goulams</hi> in their stead. His hatred against them was only because he thought them too powerful; for he was wont to say to his Favourites, that nothing but the Puissance of the <hi>Corchis,</hi> could oppose the Royal Power. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he took away some of their Priviledges, and gave them to the <hi>Doulams;</hi> but he could not bring about his design any farther.</p>
                     <p>The General of the <hi>Corchis</hi> is call'd <hi>Corschi-Bashi,</hi> and ought to be one of their Body; nor can the King impose another upon them. The <hi>Mim-Bashi</hi> commands a thousand Men, the <hi>Yux-Bashi</hi> commands a hundred, and the <hi>Om-Bashi</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ten. The <hi>Corschi-Bashi</hi> has 150 <hi>Tomans</hi> a year; the <hi>Mim-Bashi</hi> sixty-two; the <hi>Yuz-Bashi</hi> thirty, and the <hi>Om-Bashi</hi> fifteen. The pay of every Horse-man is from nine to fifteen <hi>Tomans</hi> a year. Besides, every year the King makes a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Muster, and then he gives to the <hi>Corschis</hi> a third part more than their usual pay; however, to some more, to others less, either according to favour or merit. When the King has resolv'd to put a great Man to death, he commits the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his command to a <hi>Corschi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gouler-Agasi</hi> is General of the <hi>Goulams,</hi> or Slaves. For indeed they are either Slaves, or the Sons of Slaves of all sorts of Nations, who do the King ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Service They are for the most part runnegade <hi>Georgians;</hi> and there are about 18000 of these <hi>Goulams,</hi> being all Horse-men; whose pay is from five to eight <hi>Tomans</hi> a year. The <hi>Corschis</hi> are very good Husbands; but the <hi>Goulams,</hi> as soon as they have receiv'd their pay, fall a drinking and swaggering; whereas the other, if he has a <hi>Piaster</hi> to spare, will buy a Sheep with it: For in regard they live in Tents, their Riches consists in Flocks. The greatest part of the Court of <hi>Persia</hi> is made up of these two Bodies. The <hi>Goulams</hi> have this peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they are very rarely known to revolt. For being all Slaves, and of different Nations, there are no ties of Affection or Kindred between them: And if the King has an occasion to punish any of them, the chief of their Body is to execute his orders. The <hi>Goulams</hi> carry no other Arms besides a Bow and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, with a Skain. Though some wear Coats of Mail, and Head-pieces: others Vambraces and Battel-Axes. These Horse-men never entrench in the Field like ours in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor have they any Field-Marshals to assign them quarters. For after the chief have taken up the best places, the rest set up their Tents as neer as they can to the Pavillion of the General.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tufenkgiler-Agasi</hi> is the General of the <hi>Tufenkgis,</hi> who compose the third Body of the Militia. This part of the Souldiery was but lately instituted, being compos'd of men taken from the Plough, as being most fit for labour. They are Foot-men with only a Scimiter and a Musket. But when they march, they have a Horse or a Mule between three or four, to carry their Baggage and Provisions. Their pay is not above four or five <hi>Tomans</hi> a year. And for their Officers, their pay is more or less according to their Quality and Command. They are in no great reputation, being laugh'd at by the old Souldiers, as being a company of poor Countrey-men, that dare not look an enemy in the face. Not but that the Infantry of <hi>Persia</hi> is able to do good service; though, as numerous as they are, the King never makes use of them, but in case of necessity. When he marches in person, he sends for eight or ten thousand, which he sends for out of what Province best pleases him, and they prove very useful to the Army, as Sutlers. This Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is compos'd of the Countrey-men that live in Tents, abiding in the Mountains all the Summer, and betaking themselves in the Winter to the hot Countrreys. Every Tribe or Family knows how many men it ought to set out. And there is not a Foot-man that has not his new-Suit in his Chest, and his Musket and Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in very good order. They are well train'd, and well disciplin'd; for every
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106224:128"/>
three months the Governor of the Province takes a review of all the Souldiers in his Province, and causes them to be exercis'd in his own presence. They are order'd to shoot at a mark, and they that hit it, are sure to have some reward from the Governor. When the King sends for any part of his Infantry, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently know who is to lead 'em; and they are all lusty, and well clad, never put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on their best Clothes but when they muster, or march into the Field. They pay to the King little or nothing: for of all their Cattel great and small, they pay but one in the hundred to him, and one <hi>Abassi,</hi> or 18 <hi>Sous</hi> of our Money.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eshek-Agasi,</hi> or chief of the <hi>Keshekshi's,</hi> who are the King's Guards, and carry a Musket with a very wide bore. They were but lately instituted by the <hi>Athemat-doulet,</hi> when he intended to destroy the <hi>Divan-begui.</hi> This Officer has about 2000 men under him, of which he disposes every night a certain number, round about the Palace. When the King sits in Council, he stands there with a Battoon in his hand, and throws himself to the ground when the King beckons to him to come and receive any command from his mouth. The <hi>Topigi-Bashi</hi> is the Master of the Ordnance, and ehief of the Sea-affairs, but he has little to do in either employment. For, as for the Cannon, there are only some two or three pittiful Guns in some of the Frontier-towns: And for Ships, there are none in <hi>Persia</hi> but what come from <hi>Europe</hi> or the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Ormns</hi> or <hi>Balsara.</hi> The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> themselves have no other Ships than some few large Barks in the <hi>Persian-</hi>Gulph, and in some parts of the <hi>Caspian-</hi>Sea, where they keep a Fleet against the <hi>Usbeck Tartars,</hi> the <hi>Kalmoukes,</hi> and other people.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Kaus</hi> or Governors of Provinces, they are generally chosen out of the body of <hi>Corschi's</hi> and <hi>Goulams;</hi> who are handsom persons, and generally much more Valiant than the natural <hi>Persians.</hi> For the natural complexion of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> is not good, as may be seen by the <hi>Gaures,</hi> the original Inhabitants of the Countrey, who are for the most part tann'd, and ill-shap'd. So that there is hardly a <hi>Persian,</hi> from the King to the meanest of his Subjects, who is not a <hi>Georgian,</hi> or sprung from the loins of <hi>Georgidns.</hi> For they fetch a great number of Slaves out of <hi>Georgia;</hi> by the frequent Marriages of whichwomen, the <hi>Georgian</hi> Valour and Beauty are become Natives of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kans</hi> or Governors of Provinces are as so many petty Kings, fear'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by all the people. And when they are settl'd, they are never depos'd, but upon repeated complaints of their excessive Tyranny. There are some of these Governments that yield the <hi>Kan</hi> seven or eight thousand <hi>Tomans.</hi> But they are bound to present the King every year at <hi>Nourons,</hi> or New-years-tide.</p>
                     <p>Under the <hi>Kans</hi> there are also Governors of lesser quality, who are also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preferr'd by the King, and cannot be depos'd by any person but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. If they abuse their Authority, the complaints brought against him are first carri'd to the <hi>Kan,;</hi> which, if they concern the Government of the Kingdom, the <hi>Kan</hi> is bound to inform the King thereof. But if the complaints are not considerable, then the <hi>Kan</hi> may do Justice himself, and make the <hi>Sultans</hi> know their duty.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a third sort of Governors, call'd <hi>Asephs,</hi> who are the King's Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants in places where he had <hi>Kans</hi> in former times; or where he ought to have them still, but only to save charges. For in the Provinces where <hi>Kans</hi> Govern, they and their Officers, almost equalling in name and number the Officers of the King's Houshold, devour all the profits of the Province, but what the <hi>Kan</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd annually to pay.</p>
                     <p>By what I have wrote as well concerning the King's Houshold, the Governors of his Provinces, and the Officers of his Army, it may be easily concluded that the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Court is the most magnificent and glorious of all the Courts of <hi>Asia;</hi> and besides, that it is the most Polite and Civil of all the <hi>Orient.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the second Order, containing all those that belong to the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, and their Courts of Justice; and, in general, of all the Gown-men; such as are chiefly the Officers of the Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</head>
                     <p>THE second of the three Estates of <hi>Persia</hi> comprehends the Gown-men, such as are the Doctors of the Law, the Officers of Justice, and those of the Chamber of Accounts.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Athemat-doulet</hi> is the Prime Minister in Temporals, the <hi>Sedre</hi> is the Prime Minister in Spirituals, and the High-Priest of the Law. However, he does not pretend to take place before the <hi>Athemat-doulet</hi> either in Council, or in the publick Ceremonies. There is this difference between the <hi>Sedre</hi> and the <hi>Mufti</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> that in <hi>Persia</hi> Ecclesiastical Dignities are no bar from Civil Employments; so that the <hi>Sedre</hi> is many times made <hi>Athemat-doulet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Dignity of <hi>Sedre</hi> is not limited to one single person, but may be divided between two, in regard there are two sorts of Legacies, the one from the King's of <hi>Persia,</hi> the other from particular persons. Therefore for the more careful Superintendency over these two sorts of Legacies, there are sometimes two <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi> appointed. The one is call'd <hi>Sedre-Kras,</hi> particular or peculiar <hi>Sedre,</hi> who manages all the Revenues of the Royal Foundations, and distributes them to the <hi>Mullaks</hi> and Students according to their merit. The other is call'd <hi>Sedre-el-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koufat,</hi> who has the management of private Foundations. In the year 1667 the King created two <hi>Sedres,</hi> and marri'd them to two of his Sisters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sedre</hi> has two men under him, whose Authority is almost equal to theirs. The one is call'd <hi>Speik-el-selom,</hi> and the other <hi>Cadi:</hi> and these are they that decide all controversies in Religion, judge of Divorces, make Contracts and publick Acts. These two Dignities are in the King's nomination: and in all the principal Cities of the Kingdom there are two of these Ecclesiastical Judges for all matters that concern the Law.</p>
                     <p>To every <hi>Mosquee</hi> there belongs a <hi>Pichnamaz,</hi> who is always first there before Prayers begin; and he teaches the people to Pray by learning of him, having their eyes always fix'd upon him to that end. This <hi>Picknamaz</hi> is the same with him whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Iman.</hi> The <hi>Moullah's</hi> are the Doctors of the Law, as are the <hi>Hodgia's</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and they are well paid out of the Legacies giv'n to the <hi>Mosquees,</hi> for reading every Friday, and interpreting the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the people. He that reads, sits in one Chair; and he that interprets, in another, somewhat lower upon the left-hand of the Reader. They are also bound to teach the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to all those that require it: and, as a mark of Sanctity, they wear a great white Turbant, with a single Chamlet-habit of the same colour. Their gate is grave, and their discourse very serious; yet all this is but pure hypocrisy. When they light into any considerable company of people, they presently rise, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort 'em to go to Prayers. At the same time they wash their heads, their hands, and their feet, and spread a felt upon the ground, or if they are poor, a single mat. Upon this, at one end, the <hi>Maulla</hi> kneels, at the other lies a flat Stone about the bigness of the paulm of a man's hand, which was brought from <hi>Mecca.</hi> Which Stones the <hi>Moullah's</hi> always carry about 'em; for being commanded while they are at their devotions often to kiss the ground, they rather choose to kiss a Stone brought from so holy a place, than the prophane Earth. They have a kind of a Mariners compass, which directs them punctually where <hi>Mecca</hi> stands, to the end they may know which way to turn when they say their Prayers. The Prayer which the <hi>Moulla's</hi> make, seems to be accompani'd with a great deal of zeal, and they take great notice all the while whether the company be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or no. Some <hi>Persians</hi> are so superstitious, that a <hi>Vizir</hi> of <hi>Schiras</hi> suffer'd his leg to rot off, because he would not let a Christian Chirurgeon touch him, for fear of being defil'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:106224:129"/>
There belongs also to every <hi>Mosquee</hi> a <hi>Monteveli,</hi> who looks after the repairs of the Building, and the Provision of what belongs to the <hi>Mosquee;</hi> together with a <hi>Mouazen,</hi> who cries morning and evening from the top of a Tower, <hi>That there is but one God, and that</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Colledges, the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Medrese;</hi> where there are a great number of Scholars bred up at little charge, out of the Legacies left to the Foundations. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them a Chamber without any Furniture, they being to provide a Coverlet and a <hi>Mattress</hi> for themselves. They have no certain Masters, but sometimes they go for their instructions to one, sometimes to another, seldom to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the Colledg, who is call'd <hi>Monderes,</hi> and is generally the greatest Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of them all. But there are several other persons in every good City that are forward to teach the Sciences to purchase honour to themselves. For which reason they are very liberal, to get a great company of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers together, who are as so many Trumpets to publish the wisdom of their <hi>Akroom</hi> or Doctor. But when their Liberality ceases, the Trumpets want breath at the same time.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to their manner of studying, the Student first reads two or three lines, and then the Doctor Expounds. Then another reads two or three lines more, and so one after another; every one rising up out of respect after he has done reading, and standing upright till the Doctor bids him sit down again. One of these Doctors shall teach all manner of Sciences in one day; for he is not learned that cannot talk of all. And certainly had the <hi>Persians</hi> those advantages of Books, and that method of study which we have in <hi>Europe,</hi> they would prove to be men of great understanding: for with those little helps they have, they will give a good account of their own Theology, of Logick, Physick, and the Mathematicks, wherein they strive to reach the bottom of things as deep as they can. Their Books are for the most part the works of an ancient <hi>Persian</hi> Author, whose name was <hi>Kodgia Nesir</hi> in the City of <hi>Thouss,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Korassan.</hi> Tis very probable he was well skill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> having translated into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> several Books out of those two Languages. They have some pieces of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> which are accounted the best in the West: The <hi>Almagistes</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> which they call <hi>Magesti;</hi> some tractates of <hi>Euclide,</hi> some fragments of <hi>Archimedes:</hi> the <hi>Opticks</hi> of <hi>Ebne, Heister,</hi> and other excellent Books. Some have affirm'd that they have been skill'd in the doctrin of <hi>Sines</hi> and <hi>Tangents</hi> for above this 800 years: and indeed they are very curious at this day in Mathematical Instruments. They have also a great inclination to Poetry, the chiefest grace whereof they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to consist in design of accidents, and high comparisons, observing Rhime as we do. As for Physick, they have <hi>Galen,</hi> whom they call <hi>Galenous; Averroes,</hi> whom they call <hi>Aboualt,</hi> or <hi>great Father;</hi> and <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> whom they call <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</hi> The most considerable of their Historians is <hi>Ronze el Sapha,</hi> who wrote a Chronology from the Creation of the World to his time; wherein there are abundance of fables, but little truth. He says that the World was inhabited by Devils for an infinite number of years before the Creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that God for their enormities depriv'd them of their power upon earth, and gave it to man to manage. Their Books, though deer, are very common, and every Trades-man buys 'em, being very ambitious to learn the Sciences themselves, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their children to do so too. They send them betimes to the School, which they call <hi>Meklebe,</hi> of which there are several in every Quarter. They make a hideous noise in their Schools, repeating their Lessons altogether aloud, while the Master corrects every Boy that does not keep along with the Cry. As for the children of persons of Quality, they have Tutors at home, never stirring out of doors till they are 18 years of age, unless it be to go a hunting or a shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now and them. Hence it comes to pass, that the Children are discreet, civil and modest; so that you shall never hear an ill word come out of their mouths.</p>
                     <p>In the Chamber of Accounts are many Officers, whom I look upon as Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. All the Books and Registers pass through their hands, particularly such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as concern'd the King's Revenue. All which are register'd in the Chamber of Accounts at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Defter-Krone.</hi> As to the Fee-Lands call'd <hi>Moulkerbar,</hi> which belong to particular persons, they owe to the King a certain
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106224:130"/>
annual Rent, which the Governors of Provinces exact with a severe extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mestempti</hi> and the <hi>Memalek</hi> are they that value the Rent of all Lands in Demesh, which is one of the principal charges of the <hi>Defter-Kroon.</hi> They also take cognisance of all the King's Farms, Quit-Rents, Provisions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of Receivers and Collectors. There is also a <hi>Mestempti</hi> to value Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Nazer</hi> controuls the <hi>Mestempti</hi> and the <hi>Memalek,</hi> and his hand is requir'd to all Papers of dispatch.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Deroga</hi> or Provost of the <hi>Dester-Kroon</hi> is to prosecute and punish all that are guilty of false Receipts, or of Exaction.</p>
                     <p>Into this Office are deliver'd all the Grants and Assignations of the wages of the King's Officers. Every man comes and receives his own, or sends for it to those places upon which this Money is assign'd.</p>
                     <p>In every Village or Borough there is a <hi>Reis,</hi> or chief of the place, to whom the Officers apply themselves for their Money: for should they terrify the Countrey-man, he would run quite away, and pay nothing. The greatest cheat in this Chamber of Accounts, is, that in regard the Officers keep the Roll of the Officers wages, they will give them divers Bills to receive little parcels at several places distant from one another, till the Sum be made up; to which trouble rather than the Kings servant will be put, he will give a good gratuity to the Officer to pay him all together. But because the Officers are not able to satisfy all that come, there are certain <hi>Thahsilders</hi> or hoarders up of Rent, who buy for ready Money as cheap as they can, such Bills as private men come to receive at the Chamber; and when they have got a good number together, they go and receive them altogether at the Chamber, and make great advantage. By this misgovernment of the <hi>Dester-Kroon,</hi> several persons are very much opprest. For he that has but 30 <hi>Tomans</hi> a year, shall be forc'd to give a good share out of it to have the rest in ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; which has been often the ruine of the <hi>Persian</hi> Army, through the abuses and defalcations put upon the poor Souldiers. During the Reign of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the 1; and toward the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> his Son, the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer was better regulated; but when the <hi>Persians</hi> came to be at Peace with their Neighbours, the King and his Lords have minded nothing less than the payment of the Souldiery.</p>
                     <p>The greatest part of the Lands in <hi>Persia</hi> belong to the King, and are only farm'd by private persons. The rest of the Lands are measur'd, and every Land pays so much a measure. The King also has a vast income by the Merchandizes that pay Custom and Toll. The Port of <hi>Bander-Abassi</hi> alone brings him one year with another, when least, besides accidents, neer upon 20000 <hi>Tomans.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the third Estate of the Kingdom, comprehending the Tradesmen and Merchants: as also of the Trades, Manufactures, and Commodities of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Commerce of <hi>Persia,</hi> as in all other Kingdoms, consists in the Trade of the Country and Forraign Traffick. Only with difference, that the Country Trade is in the hands of the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> the forraign Traffic in the hands of the <hi>Armenians</hi> only, who are as it were the Kings and the Noble mens Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to sell their silk.</p>
                     <p>As for the Handicraft trades, there are some Corporations that pay a certain yearly duty to the King, as Shoemakers, Cutlers, Smiths, and others. Some are free, as the Joyners and Masons: though he get by their labour as much as others pay him in money. For when the King requires twenty Masons for a work which is in hast, the <hi>Marmar Bashi</hi> who is their Chief, summons them together, and they that give most are excus'd. For when the King requires but twenty, he summons forty: and thus every man lives by his calling. The practice is the same with the Chief of the Joyners, and all other Trades, who are Officers pay'd by the King, and never work unless they please themselves, commanding all that are under their Jurisdiction. As for Carpenters and Joyners work, the <hi>Persians</hi> know little what belongs to it, which proceeds from the scarcity of Wood, that does not allow them materials to work upon. So that for Chairs, Tables and Bedsteads, there are no such things to be seen in <hi>Persia:</hi> the Joyners business being only to make Doors and Frames for Windows, which they make very neatly of several pieces of wood join'd together, so that a man can hardly put a Tennis Ball through the holes where they put the glass. Nor can it be expected that the <hi>Persians</hi> should work like other <hi>Europeans,</hi> having no other Tools then a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Chizzel, and one sort of Plainer, which a <hi>Frenchman</hi> brought among them.</p>
                     <p>Their nobler Arts are Writing, for Printers they know none. All their Books are writt'n, which is the reason they so much esteem that Art. There was an <hi>Armenian</hi> who had set up a Printing-Press at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and had Printed the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the seven Penitential Psalms, and was going about to Print the whole Bible, but not having the way of making good Ink, and to avoid the ill consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Invention, he was forc'd to break his Press. For on the one side the Children refus'd to learn to write, pretending they wrote the Bible themselves, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get it the sooner by heart: on the other side many persons were undone by it, that got their living by writing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> use three sorts of hands, the first is call'd <hi>Nestalick,</hi> or the Set-hand: the second <hi>Shakeste</hi> or <hi>Divanni,</hi> which is their Court-hand: the third <hi>Neskre,</hi> or the Running-hand, very like the <hi>Arabic.</hi> They write with small <hi>Indian</hi> Reeds; and say, that to write well, a man ought to lean so slightly upon his Pen, that should a fly stand upon the other end it would fall out of his hand. When they write they hold their Paper in one hand to turn it according to the motion of the Pen, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they could not make their dashes large and free, as the Character requires. They make their Paper of Cotton Fustian, very course, brown, and of no strength, for the least folding tears it. They sleek it with a sleek stone, and then rub it over to make it more sleek. Their Ink is made of Galls and Charcoal pounded together with Soot.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> reck'n four Languages among 'em. The <hi>Persian</hi> call'd <hi>Belick,</hi> that is, sweet and pleasing. The <hi>Turkish,</hi> call'd <hi>Sciascet,</hi> or the Rodomontado Language. The <hi>Arabian,</hi> to which they give the Epithite of <hi>Feschish</hi> or Eloquent: and the fourth, call'd <hi>Cobahet,</hi> or the Speech of the Country people. The <hi>Persian</hi> in use among the Gentry is compos'd almost of all <hi>Arabic</hi> words: by reason that the <hi>Persian</hi> is very barren. But the Gibbrish of the Country people is so corrupt that they in the City can hardly understand 'em. The <hi>Arabian</hi> is the Language of the Learned, in which tongue their Books are written. The Language of the Court
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106224:131"/>
is <hi>Turkish,</hi> but much more soft and elegant then at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> As for the <hi>Persian</hi> Language, it is spoken in the Courts of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour,</hi> in all which Courts a Noble man would take it for an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to be spok'n to in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>As for their Painters they only paint in miniature, and for Birds and Flowers they will draw them indifferently well: But for figures and stories they know not what belongs to any such thing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are most excellent Artists for manufactures of Gold, Silk and Silver, of which their rich Carpets and Tissues are made: nor do their Gold and Silver Manufactures ever grow black or loose their luster by long wearing or lying by. There are abundance that work in Silk stuffs of all sorts, and others that make Bonnets and Girdles of Gold and Silk. Others there are whose business it is to fast'n flowers of Gold and Silver to their Taffata's, with gum water, of which the women make Shifts and Drawers. And now they begin to make such large quantities of Taffata's, that they care not for the stuffs which are brought out of <hi>India,</hi> though they be much finer.</p>
                     <p>They also make great quantities of Linnen Cloth of all sorts of colours, upon which they fast'n several flowers with gum water, and some figures, though the Law forbid it. Which they learnt to do upon the <hi>Armenians</hi> carrying out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> some ill-favour'd cuts and pieces in distemper which they bought here without judgment: these pieces they hang before their doors, and those hollow places in the walls where they put their Quilts and Carpets when they rise.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are excellent Artists at Damasquing with Vitriol, or engraving Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask-wise upon Swords, Knives, and the like. But the nature of the Steel which they make use of, very much contributes to their Art, in regard they cannot perform the same work neither upon their own nor ours. This steel is brought from <hi>Golconda,</hi> and is the only sort of steel which can be damasqu'd. For when the workman puts it in the fire, he needs no more then to give it the redness of a Cherry, and instead of quenching it in the water as we do, to wrap it in a moist Linnen cloth: for should he give it the same heat as to ours, it would grow so hard that when it came to be wrought it would break like glass. I speak this to undeceive those people who think our Scimitars and Cut-lasses are made of steel of <hi>Damascus,</hi> which is a vulgar error; there being no steel but that of <hi>Golconda</hi> that can be Damask'd.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are also excellent Artists at making Bows and Arrows, and such other weapons as are us'd in that Country. As for Bridles and Saddles their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists far exceed ours, especially in their sowing, which they do so neatly and with so much art with a kind of back-stitch, that it looks almost like an embroidery. There are an infinite number that live by dressing Seal-skins and Goat-skins, the first to make boots for the Gentry and better sort of Merchants, the latter for the poor people.</p>
                     <p>There is also a sort of earthen ware made at <hi>Kerman</hi> which is very fine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brok'n looks as white within as without. It does not endure hear so well as <hi>Porcellane,</hi> which has this quality, that if you powre never so hot liquor into a <hi>Porcellane</hi> cup, neither the foot nor the brims a-top will be any thing the warmer.</p>
                     <p>There are abundance of poor people that get their living by mending glass To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipes, for when they are brok'n they join them together again with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mastic made of lime, and the white of an egg, then with a Diamond-pointed piercer they make holes in the glass, and bind the pieces together with a thin Latten-wire.</p>
                     <p>The most considerable commodities of <hi>Persia</hi> are the Silks which come out of the Province of <hi>Guilan.</hi> But there is not so much transported out of-<hi>Persia</hi> as men imagin. For formerly great quantities of Velvets, Tissues and Taffata's were transported out of <hi>Persia</hi> into these parts: but now we make them better and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is also a vast quantity of flat silk transported out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Turkie, Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> which the women use in embroidery: for the Colours being lively, they embroider their shifts, hankerchers, vails, and other linnen with it.</p>
                     <p>The Seal-skins and Goat-skins which are dress't in <hi>Persia</hi> are transported by the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106224:131"/>
                        <hi>Hollander</hi> into <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Japan.</hi> Great quantities also of both are transported into <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ronas,</hi> that famous Root, of which I have already spoken, is transported over all <hi>India,</hi> where there is also a great vent of <hi>Persian</hi> fruits pickl'd in Vinegar, as also of their sweet waters.</p>
                     <p>Their Pistaches grow in great abundance about <hi>Casbin;</hi> Almonds from the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>Yesd</hi> and <hi>Kerman,</hi> Raisins from several parts of the Kingdom, especially from <hi>Schiras:</hi> And their purgative Prunes, which they call <hi>Alonbacara,</hi> from the Frontiers that border upon <hi>Tartary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Great store of Quinces candied, and boxes of Marmaled made at <hi>Balsara,</hi> are thence transported into <hi>India,</hi> where they are bought up by the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Portugueses.</hi> For the <hi>Banians</hi> will eat none, for fear they should by accident bury a fly in their stomachs.</p>
                     <p>Great store of dry'd Fruits are brought out of the Country of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and transported to <hi>Tocat,</hi> to <hi>Diarbequir, Nineveh</hi> and <hi>Dagdat.</hi> Among the rest a sort of small Abricots, very pleasing to the taste, which being boyl'd in water make a pleasant syrrup, and are the only diet for the sick in those parts.</p>
                     <p>There are also great store of painted Calicuts made in <hi>Persia,</hi> which being course, are only worn and made use of by the poor, so that there is very little transported out of the Country, but what is carried into <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> also make a great deal of money of their Cattel; and to begin with their <hi>Camels,</hi> they sell vast numbers of them into <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Natolia.</hi> But the Governours of the Provinces are very unwilling to part with them; which very much abates the trade. For the <hi>Turks</hi> very highly esteem the <hi>Persian Camels,</hi> as being stronger than their own. They also sell great store of Horses and Mules; but that trade is not so considerable, the chiefest part being only sent into <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for their Sheep, 'tis a wonderful thing to see what prodigious numbers come out of the Province of the <hi>Medes</hi> and the Higher <hi>Armenia,</hi> and the Forraign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants come as far as <hi>Tauris</hi> and <hi>Hamadan</hi> to fetch them away. They drive them as far as <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and the greatest part of the Mutton which is spent in <hi>Natolia</hi> and <hi>Romania</hi> comes out of <hi>Persia,</hi> which very much enriches <hi>Persia</hi> with ready mony. But when Lamb is in season, as we travel with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans, we meet at every turn with flocks after flocks, the least of which consists of a thousand Lambs: and in regard there are some of those Lambs that are weary, and lag behind, we buy them at a very cheap rate, the Shepheards that are not able to carry them, being glad to be rid of 'em.</p>
                     <p>Formerly the Merchant Fewellers brought some Turquoises of the old rock out of <hi>Persia;</hi> but for these 15 years last past there have bin none found. The last time I was there I could only meet with three, which were but reasonable. As for those of the new rock, they are of no value, because they do not keep their colour, but turn green in a little time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Justice and Policy of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Justice of the <hi>Persians</hi> is very exact and very speedy. Suits are determin'd upon the place without any need of Advocates or Proctors. Not but that the Officers of Justice are easie to be corrupted, but in their unjust exactions, which they carry as secretly as possibly they can, they are sooner satisfi'd then the <hi>Turks:</hi> and if their injustice be discover'd, upon complaint to the King they are punisht without mercy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kans</hi> do Justice in their Provinces, as representing the Kings person. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, the King has a <hi>Divan Begui</hi> in every City, and the <hi>Kan</hi> places under him a <hi>Deroga,</hi> who is like the Lieutenant Criminal in <hi>France.</hi> He has under him an <hi>Aatas,</hi> who is a kind of Captain of the watch; who goes about the streets in the night to hinder disorders, and carries all people to Prison that he finds abroad at unseasonable hours, if they cannot give a good accompt of themselves. There is also a <hi>Kelonter,</hi> that is, the chiefest or greatest, who seems to resemble the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the People among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the Provost of Merchants in <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Kelonter</hi> is only responsible to the King, who places one in every City, and it is his business to defend the People from the injustice and oppressions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
                     <p>Murther is severely punish'd, nor will money save the Criminal. When the Murtherer is tak'n, they carry him before the <hi>Divan Begui,</hi> who makes quick work. For he delivers him to the Parents or kindred of the person slain, who carry him to the place of execution, and without any compassion torture him to death.</p>
                     <p>I remember the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Schiras</hi> had a Favourite, who falling in love with a young <hi>Persian</hi> Gentleman, would needs endeavour to have the use of his body. One day meeting upon the Road together, and lying at night under the same Tent, the Favourite about midnight came to his bed side, and after many sollicitations would have forc'd him. But being violently resisted, the Favourite for madness to see himself disappointed, and liable to be discover'd, stabb'd the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the heart, and fled to the Mountains. The Murther being divulg'd, the Mother, Widow and Sister of the young man repair'd to the <hi>Kan</hi> for Justice, who willing to save his Minion, offer'd them money: but they scorning his proffer, threaten'd to complain to the King. The <hi>Kan</hi> being thereupon constrain'd to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue his Favourite, at length took him and sent him to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> telling them that he would not judge of the Affair, but refer it to the King. The Mother, Widow and Sister immediately follow'd the Murtherer to <hi>Ispahan;</hi> and demanded Justice of the King with that eagerness, that though the King had an inclination to have spar'd the <hi>Kan's</hi> Favourite for his Masters sake, he was forc'd to abandon him, and to bid them pay themselves with his blood. Immediately he was carri'd to the <hi>Meydan,</hi> where the Widow first stabb'd him to the heart with a Dagger, then the Mother took her turn, and after the Sister; and then holding a Cup to receive his blood, drank every one a cup full to quench the thirst of their revenge.</p>
                     <p>Nor are they so exact in the punishment of Murther only; for they punish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in houses of Debauchery with a proportionable strictness, of which I will give the Reader two examples. A young <hi>Hollander,</hi> coming to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> presently put himself into a <hi>Persian</hi> habit; and going in the evening to a house of good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, met with certain <hi>Persians,</hi> with whom he happen'd to quarrel, and being well beaten for his pains, thought it not convenient to stay any longer where he had bin so ill entertain'd. Thereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Interpreter went and complain'd to the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> who inform'd the King. The King immediately sent for the people that had beaten the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and ask'd them why they abus'd a stranger? To which the others made answer that they saw no stranger, but only a man clad after the <hi>Persian</hi> garb. Whereupon the King told the Interpreter, that if the <hi>Dutch-</hi>man had worn his own Country habit, his Subjects durst not have abus'd him, but as the case stood, he had no reason to punish 'em.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:106224:132"/>
One day it happen'd that there was a great hubbub in one of those houses of debauchery, where the woman had prostituted her own Daughter. The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of it, commanded the Mother to be thrown headlong from a Tower: and that the Daughter should be torn a pieces by his doggs, which he keeps a purpose for such chastisements.</p>
                     <p>Above all things there is an extraordinary care taken for the security of the High-ways. For which purpose guards are set at convenient distances, who are ready to pursue upon the least noise of a Robbery, and who examin people whence they come and whither they go. If they answer not as they should, or trip in their Answers, they carry them before the next Governor. Those <hi>Radars</hi> are so posted over all <hi>Persia,</hi> that you need no more then send to the places where they keep station, to know what is become of any person that has committed a crime. For it is impossible to scape, all the Passes are so well guarded. If any one endeavours to travel through the Mountains or unfrequented roads, then the <hi>Radars</hi> who are in all places, seize such persons upon suspition, for not taking the direct road.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Caravan</hi> was one day setting out from <hi>Tauris</hi> for <hi>Ispahan,</hi> a poor fellow took an occasion to rob a Cloak-bag during the hurly-burly of packing up, and fled cross the fields not knowing his way: the Merchant missing his goods, complain'd to the Governour who having sought for him in vain, sent order to the Guards of the High-ways, to make a strict examination, and to send the person to him so soon as they had seiz'd him. In a short time the Thief was constrain'd to forsake his Cloak-bag and to come a thwart the fields for water. Who being examin'd by the <hi>Radars</hi> why he came alone by such a by way, and not knowing what to answer, was carri'd to the Governour. He was soon convicted and condemn'd to death, for Thieves find no mercy in <hi>Persia.</hi> Only they are variously put to death. For sometimes they are ty'd to a Camels tayl by the feet, and their bellies rip't open. Sometimes they are buried alive all but their heads, and starv'd to death: in which torment they will sometimes desire a Passenger to cut off their heads; though it be a kindness forbidden by the Law. But the most cruel punishment of all, is when they set the Thief a Horse-back, with his extended Arms fasten'd to a long stick behind: then larding him with lighted Candles, they suffer the Candles to burn into his very bowels. Another and I met two in this misery, who desir'd us to hasten their deaths, which we durst not do, only we gave them a Pipe of Tobacco according to their desire.</p>
                     <p>As for those that steal in Cities, they tye them by the heels to the tayl of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, and rip up their bellies: and then as the Camel drags the poor creature along the streets while one goes before him crying, <hi>The King has punish'd him for such a crime.</hi> If yet he be not dead, they hang him upon the next tree.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Radars</hi> have little wages, which makes them use their Rhetoric to get what honestly they can out of the Travellers, to whom they tell long stories of their care for the security of the high-ways.</p>
                     <p>If it happen that a Merchant be rob'd, the Governour of the Province is to make good to the Merchant whatever he has lost, according as he shall make out by his Oath or his Book. Nor dare the Governors deny satisfaction, fearing a complaint at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> I my self was rob'd of two Bales of goods, between <hi>Lar</hi> and <hi>Schiras,</hi> to the value of 1400 Piasters, but upon complaint to the Governour upon my own oath and shewing him my Book, he pay'd me all my loss in gold, and gave me a present in wine besides.</p>
                     <p>The Posts or <hi>Shappars</hi> are those that carry the Kings dispatches to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Provinces. When they are sent any whither, the Kings Esquire finds them a Horse, and a man that runs to the end of the Stage, to bring him back again. If these Curriers meet a Horseman upon the road, they have power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount him, if their own be not so good, or be tyr'd: and the Horseman must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run after his Horse, or send some body to the end of the Stage. Sometimes these Curriers abusing their power, within a quarter of an hour after they have chang'd their Horse, if they meet another better mounted, they will take away his Horse too. Nor dares the Horseman resist, though he be never so much too strong; for there is no pardon for them that lay so much as a finger upon one of these <hi>Shappars;</hi> at other times they will pretend to take away a mans Horse
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106224:133"/>
only to get money. But they are forbid to deal so by the <hi>Franks;</hi> and I have pass'd by them, when they have said nothing to me.</p>
                     <p>Their Government in relation to Belly-timber is the best in the world. For there is a <hi>Mohteseb,</hi> who is the chief of the Government, whose business it is to set a rate upon all sorts of Provision, being assisted by three or four more Assessors. Every first day of the week there is a public Proclamation of taxe upon the weight of every thing. Which Assessors in the evening advize together against the next day whether to raise or abate the price before set. This order was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd by the great <hi>Sha Abbas,</hi> and was in his raign more punctually observ'd then it has been since. By the by observe, that all provisions of belly-timber are sold by weight and not by measure: so that you may send a Child to Market; for if the Commodity be not weight,'tis well if the buyer be satisfy'd with having his money again. For if the seller be discover'd to sell by false weights, they are led about the streets with a <hi>Taktekolas,</hi> or a Bonnet like a Bee-hive upon their heads, and a Bell about their necks to expose'em first to the laughter of the people: after that they are fin'd, and receive so many drubs upon the soles of their feet.</p>
                     <p>If this good order were not observ'd in <hi>Persia,</hi> the poor would suffer very much. For the handicraft tradesmen that work all day in shops remote from their houses, where their wives are continually shut up, eat nothing at noon but a little fruit in season: and then in the evening when they leave work, they go to the Market and buy for their Families boyld or roast meat, of which there is great plenty. Therefore are they so exact, least so many poor labouring men should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
                     <p>One day a Baker of the City came to the <hi>Kan,</hi> complaining that the Judge of the Government had set too low a price upon bread, so that he should be a great loser. To whom the <hi>Kan</hi> made answer, that'twas not his business to alter the price: bidding him go to the Magistrate that was concern'd. But the Baker belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Kan</hi> could do any thing, sent him a present of fifty Tomans. The <hi>Kan</hi> seeing the ill design of the Baker to oppress the poor people, and the ill opinion he had of him as a seller of Justice, commanded him to be carri'd to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and there to be drub'd upon the soles of his feet till he pay'd the other fifty Tomans, which the <hi>Kan</hi> forthwith distributed to the poor, and caus'd the price of bread to be abated instead of raising it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Manners and Customes of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Manners and Customes of the people are usually correspondent to their Religion. The <hi>Persians</hi> never preserve the name of their Predecessors, but like the <hi>Jews,</hi> for distinction sake, say, such a one, the Son of such a one. When they Circumcise a Child and give him a Name, they write three or four Names like Lots in Paper, which are drawn by a Child, and which the Child draws, that is the Name of the Child. The women that are barren, swallow that which is cut from the Child, believing it will make them conceive.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are generally very inquisitive after the time to come, consulting their Astrologers like Oracles: The King has always two or three by him, to tell him the good or bad hour. There is an <hi>Almanac</hi> which is sold every year in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> which they call <hi>Tacuim;</hi> but is indeed an Ephimerides, containing the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Latitudes of the Planets, the Conjunctions and Oppositions; and other such things. This <hi>Tacuim</hi> is full of predictions about Wars, Sicknesses and Famin. It sets the proper seasons to put on new cloathes, to let blood, to Purge, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, with many other instructions of the same nature. They give great credit to this <hi>Tacuim,</hi> and they that can get one, govern themselves in all things according to the Rules there set down. Others to know the success of their affairs, go to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106224:133"/>
a Doctor of the Law, and desire him to open the <hi>Al-couran,</hi> and to tell them the issue of their business. Thereupon the Doctor muttering some strange words, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Alcouran</hi> is the Book of the Law, so entitl'd for its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as we say, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> opens the Book, and if he meets with affirmative commands, he declares the undertaking shall prosper. If negatives, he disswades from the enterprize. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Gardiner belonging to the Capuchin Friers, would needs go to one of those <hi>Moullah's,</hi> to know whether he should get by an Ox that he was about to buy. Whereupon the <hi>Moullah</hi> assur'd him he should reap great profit by his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but quite contrary, the Ox dy'd upon his hands within three days, to the great astonishment of the Gardiner. When a Capuchin tax'd the <hi>Moullah</hi> for the falsities of his pretended Art, the <hi>Moullah</hi> reply'd, that God knew that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner would spend his Money upon lewd Women, and therefore took from him the means and support of his debauchery.</p>
                     <p>They also use a sort of divination, which is call'd <hi>Rambé,</hi> by even or odd, the Masters of which mystery, call'd <hi>Rammals,</hi> keep Shops on purpose to delude the people. When they see people coming, they have persons suborn'd on purpose; who holding out their hands shut, ask the <hi>Rammal</hi> what he thinks they have in their hands. The Rammal at first seems to be at a stand; throwing certain Dice, call'd <hi>Kiabetain,</hi> the specks whereof are some even, some uneven; but when there are people enough gathered together, he tells point by point how many specks his fellow-Cheat has in his hands. Who counterfeiting astonishment, encourages the poor silly creatures that stand gazing, to spend something for a lye which they sell them. They also make use of the <hi>Faal;</hi> which is to open a Book, &amp; by numbers even or odd, to prognosticate good or bad fortune. In their interpretation of dreams, the Interpreter foretells the future to him that enquires conformable to what he says he saw in his dream. He has a great Book lying before him, full of little Pictures and <hi>Grotesco-</hi>work, wherein he strives to shew the people some Fantasm or Apparition, which they will tell you they saw in the night. These chears are usually practis'd about the Palace, where all the idle people flock together; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so upon the Road to <hi>Zulpha,</hi> where they lye upon the Road to catch the silly Passengers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are mightily addicted to ill language, and foul-mouth'd reproaches. So that when two men fall out, instead of fighting with their fists, they fight with their tongues, and curse one another. But they never blaspheme God: for if they should hear one swear, or wish themselves at the Devil, they would ery out in an astonishment, <hi>Is not that Fellow a fool to give himself upon trust to the Devil, and renounce Paradise?</hi> When they would affirm any thing to be true, all their Oaths are <hi>Ser-azire-sha, By the King's beloved head;</hi> or, <hi>Erva pigumbir,</hi> by the Spirit of the Prophet. I remember once at <hi>Galata,</hi> walking with some of the <hi>French</hi> Embassador's Servants, we saw two <hi>Turks:</hi> at Cuffs; after they were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, one of them gave the other a thousand curses; to which, the other reply'd no more than only this; I wish, said he, thy Soul may have no more repose in Paradise, than the Hat of a <hi>French-</hi>man has in this World, alluding to out manner of salutation, and putting off our Hats so often as we do.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are naturally great Dissemblers and Flatterers; and they make so their study to acquire esteem and applause. They love to give and receive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents: more especially to present the King. Which Presents are valu'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the estimate, they must send ten <hi>per cent.</hi> to the Serjeant Porter, and five <hi>per cent.</hi> to his Deputy: which, if they do not pay willingly, they are fotc'd to pay: which I saw the Deputy of the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company forc'd to do.</p>
                     <p>The Luxury and the Expences of the <hi>Persians</hi> is excessive, as I have in several places observ'd. And though it be against the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to make use of Gold or Silver-plate, which sets aside that metal only for Commerce and for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; none but the poor observe that Law, for the rich make no scruple to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are very much accustom'd to make mutual Visits one to another at their solemn Festivals, and to wish one another good cheer, and a merry season. The more noble sort stay at home to expect the Visits of their Inferiors, after that they get a Horseback, and return their Visits. The <hi>Curtisans</hi> continue their Visits all the year long, and going to the Noble-mens Houses, stay in the great Hall till they come out of their <hi>Harams.</hi> Whither, when the Noblemen come,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106224:134"/>
they lay their hands upon their stomachs, and bow, which is their manner of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting the Company that tarries for them. After some few Compliments, they get a Horseback, attended by all their Visitants, who accompany them to the King's House, in expectation of some kindness, by vertue of their favour. The favours which the King usually does to such people, is to send them to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Provinces with a Hawk or a <hi>Calaat,</hi> with order that the said Governours remember the Serjeant Porter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kan</hi> being advertiz'd that the <hi>Calaat</hi> is coming, he rides forth of the City to meet it, attended by all his principal Officers, the chief of the City, and the greatest part of the Inhabitants. The Juglers also must give their attendance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Drums and Trumpets, and all the Musick-makers. They rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz usually in a Garden one or two leagues from the City, where the King's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger stays with the <hi>Calaat.</hi> So soon as the Governour perceives him, he makes a low obeysance, and a Prayer for the King; giving God thanks for that the King is pleas'd to preserve him in his memory: then he puts on the <hi>Calaat,</hi> which is according to the quality of the Governour: sometimes the Robe alone; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Robe and Cloak: sometimes Robe, Cloak, Girdle, and Bonnet; to which, if he be a Grandee, are added the Scimitar and Dagger: which method is also observ'd toward Embassadors. When the <hi>Kan</hi> has put on the <hi>Calaat,</hi> he returns to the City with all his Retinue, goes to the King's House; (for the King has a House in every City,) kisses the Columns of the Gate, and makes certain other Prayers for the prosperity of the King: At length he rides home, where he makes a great Feast, shewing the <hi>Calaat</hi> to all persons that come to him, who by way of complement cry <hi>Moubarek-bashet,</hi> that is, <hi>may it be blest, and prove a good omen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are not much addicted to play: for besides, that the Law forbids it; the <hi>Meshaldar-Bashi</hi> has a power to fine and punish Gamesters, as I have said already. For which reason he has spies, to which the meaner sort of people dare not refuse entrance into their Houses: but the richer sort laugh at 'em; and will give 'em nothing. Among the <hi>Persian</hi> Games, there is one game at Cards which the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Gengesé.</hi> We have but four distinct marks upon ours, but they have eight. They also play at a kind of Chess, and at <hi>Trictrac;</hi> which two Games are most in use. The Shopkeepers play in the Streets with little Marble-bowls, not much unlike our Childrens Bowling-stones. But as for Bowling-greens, or Tennis-Courts, they know not what they mean.</p>
                     <p>Neither the <hi>Persians</hi> nor any of the Eastern People accustom themselves to walk as we do. And therefore when they see us walking to and fro together in a Garden-Ally for two or three hours together, they are amaz'd. They only spread a Carpet in the fairest place of the Garden, and set themselves down to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the verdure of the place: and if they rise, 'tis only to pull the fruit from the trees. For they love to eat what they gather themselves, never caring for what others have handl'd.</p>
                     <p>The Men never dance, only the Women of Pleasure, which are always sent for to their Feasts; where they dance open-fac'd, and shew a thousand postures to divertise the Company. Their juglers are every jot as good as ours; but whereas ours make use of Balls, they shew their tricks with large Hen-eggs. Their Dancers upon the Ropes far exceed ours. I have seen some of them that have ty'd a Rope to the top of a high Tower, and fasten'd the other to the ground, and then walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the top with their counterpoises in their hands, have laid themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rope upon their backs, and have slid to the bottom with a swiftness like lightning.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are altogether as superstitious as the <hi>Turks.</hi> Before they say their Prayers they are oblig'd to wash: every one having a Reservatory for water in his own House, which is always full of water. They plunge their heads in the water, wash their mouths, rub their forheads; and if a man shews them any nasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Vessel, there's water enough, they cry, for purification; though, if it be Pond-water, it must be four or five foot deep. But if it be Running-water, the least quantity in the World serves to purify 'em, and render 'em fit to pray: while they ground their beliefupon this maxim of the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that if it should run through <hi>Pishkill,</hi> or Camels-dung, it would be sufficient for purification. There is one sort of washing appointed by their Law, which is, to go to their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106224:134"/>
Baths after they have been with their Wives; and there are some so superstitious as to go there every day. These Baths are round Chambers, so close, that there is no light but what comes from little round windows made in the top of the roof. In the first place, there is the <hi>Krasiné,</hi> which is a Chamber seven or eight foot square; where, in the middle of the Room, is a great Copper-plate, in the form of a flat Bason, and underneath they make a fire of Brushes or Horse-dung: so that the Plate heats all the water which is in the Chamber: When it is hot enough, a servant belonging to the Bath goes up to the Terras, and winds a horn, to give notice to them that have a mind to come. Should a <hi>Persian</hi> or a <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> miss once in eight days, he would feel an itching all over his body not to be endur'd. For the pores, which the heat of the Bath had open'd, coming to be shut, the vapours of the body not able to get out, prick and tickle the skin. The Men go early in the morning, and stay till two hours after Sun-rising: At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Bath is the place where they undress; and when they are stript all but the secret parts, which they cover with a napkin, they pour hot water upon their shoulders; and then comes a man and rubs off all the sweat and filth of the Body with a coarse Cloath; after which they plunge themselves into a Reservato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of hot water, which they call <hi>Kolletain.</hi> But these common Baths are very dangerous, and many people of both Sexes have got the fowl Disease, who were never addicted to impurity.</p>
                     <p>There are also in <hi>Persia</hi> hir'd people, which they call <hi>Saka's,</hi> whose business it is to give water to the people as they go along the Streets. Their Barbers are very neat, and surpass ours for lightness of hand; for a man can hardly feel their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. They have also a Knife to pare the nails of the hands and feet, which they do very dextrously. As for their Beards, those that belong to the Law cut it with Scissers, but they leave it not so long as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, by much. But the Courtiers and Souldiers shave all off, except from their upper-lips, where they take it for a mark of great honour to wear long <hi>Mustaches,</hi> which they say is the ornament of the face.</p>
                     <p>The habit of the <hi>Persians</hi> is a Robe which they call <hi>Cabaye,</hi> that comes down a little below their knees. This is of very fine quilted Cloath, well cotton'd in the Winter, but much thinner in the Summer.. These Linnens would be very cheap, but that the Persons of Quality change their Robes every day. Their Sleeves are long, and close to their arms, and reaching as far as the wrist. The Robe is fit to their Bodies as far as the Wast; but then it is made wide and loose. Over this they wear a noble Girdle of Silk, adorn'd at the end with flowers of Gold, over which they were another Girdle of fine <hi>Kerman-</hi>wool. The richer sort are so vain as to wear three Girdles, two of Silk, and one of <hi>Kerman-</hi>wool, which is ty'd uppermost. Under the Robe or Vest they wear a short Wastcoat of flower'd Fustian quilted, their Shirts being of Silk of divers colours. They use as little Soap in <hi>Persia</hi> as they can; for Soap is very rare in <hi>Persia.</hi> When we come out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> we are forc'd to bring with us Linnen enough to serve us for six months, and then to carry it back again; for they wash much better in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> then in <hi>Persia.</hi> Their breeches being of Silk, come down to their Ankles, without any codpieces. Their <hi>Sesse,</hi> or Bonnet, which we call a <hi>Turban,</hi> is made of a piece of fine Silk mingl'd with Gold, being in form much like our large Pompions: the top thereof is a little flat; and here it is that the end of the Silk being garnish'd with flowers of Gold and Silver, ends in a kind of Posie. These Bonnets are very heavy, especially those that are for the most part nothing but Gold and Silver. The meanest of those is worth 200 Crowns; but there are some which the King and the great Lords wear, that are worth four or five hundred. You shall seldom meet an Officer of any Quality that does not wear a rich Jewel in his Bonnet. The Courtiers and Souldiery wear their Daggers upon their stomachs, stuck in their girdles. The meanest Souldier inlays the handle and sheath of his Dagger; but the Grandees have them all beset with Pearls. There was in the handle of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the Second's Dagger, a Diamond of above sixty Carats, which, with some other Stones that belong'd to it, was valu'd at 13000 <hi>Tomans,</hi> or 200000 Crowns. Over their Vest they wear a Justicoar, much like ours. It is fasten'd at the top with a button: and most usually they have nine tufted buttons before set by three and three at an equal distance: but they only
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106224:135"/>
serve for ornament. This Justicoar is either of Cloath, or Tissue; which in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is lin'd with <hi>Martins,</hi> or else with a grey Lambskin that comes from <hi>Korasan.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Persians</hi> love diversity of colours in their habits: for their Justicoar is of one colour, their Vest of another, their Breeches of another; and their Shooes, especially the Womens are green, red, yellow, or violet. The Girdle and <hi>Turban</hi> are always of strip'd Stuff, unless it be the <hi>Moullah's,</hi> which are always plain.</p>
                     <p>Besides all this, in the Winter they wear a long Cloak down to their heels, with sleeves of the same length, lin'd with rich Furs. The Persons of Quality, and some of the meaner sort of people make no more of Cloath of Gold and Siver, then we do of Druggets. A man that has but seven or eight <hi>Tomans</hi> a year, shall spend five in Clothes; which excess in habit is crept down among the Rabble, so that a man can hardly tell the Servant from the Master. And it is a Proverb among the <hi>Persians, Corbebé Lebas,</hi> fine Clothes make Men esteem'd at Court. Neither <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the Second, nor his Grandfather <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the First, would allow of this disorder, but that Men should go clad according to their conditions. For one day seeing one of his Servants with a pair of Cloath of Gold-breeches, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what wages he had? but when he understood that it was nothing neer sufficient to maintain him at that rate; to deter others from the like vanity, he order'd him so many <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> upon the soles of his feet, that he dy'd in a few days. Others say that the Fellow being surpriz'd at the King's Question, made him answer, that being troubl'd with the Gout, he had been advis'd to wear that sort of Stuff for its warmth. To which the King reply'd, that he had been told a very bad remedy, and that he would shew him a better and a shorter way to cure the Gout, and so commanded him to be drubb'd, as before is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>In regard it is very cold in <hi>Persia,</hi> they make use of three sorts of Furs. The Lamb and Fox's skin for the meaner sort, together with the Cat's and Fox's skin. But the third sort, which is the <hi>Martin</hi>'s Fur, is for Grandees of the Court, and other Persons of high Quality. They have also a way to make Callocks that will keep out the rain, the wind, and the cold, which are made of <hi>Kerman-</hi>wool, as our Felt-makers make their Hats.</p>
                     <p>And now I have said 'tis cold, give me leave to tell ye how they warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. In all Houses there are little Chambers, in the middle whereof there is a square hole about a foot deep, and three or four foot long, according to the bigness of the Chamber. Over the hole is a thing like one of our <hi>Tabourets,</hi> which covers the hole with a large Carpet, to keep in the heat of that which is kindl'd in the hole; so that being plac'd under the <hi>Tabouret</hi> as far as the wast, though as cold as ice before, in a minute you shall be almost in a sweat, and be ready to fall a-sleep, if you take not a great care. All the Nobility have Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with Chimneys, where they set the Wood upright; the Mantle-tree comes forward, low, and semi-circular. It is two or three foot deep, and as many wide, to avoid smoaking.</p>
                     <p>They are full of their Compliments, which they call <hi>Travezea:</hi> and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of salutation is quite different from ours. For they never uncover their heads, but bow, and lay their right-hand upon their brests. When they come into the company of their Betters, they fall upon their knees to set themselves upon their heels, which is a mark of respect.</p>
                     <p>The Women in <hi>Persia</hi> are very richly habited; but their habit is all of a piece, though little different in shape from the Mens. It is open before, and comes not down below the calf of the leg. Their Girdle is not ty'd fast, but hangs carelesly: their Sleeves are also close to their arms, and reach to their wrists. Upon their heads they wear a little Bonnet rais'd like a little spire, and adorn'd with pretious Stones, according to their Quality; from which Bonnet falls a veil behind, which is very graceful. They wear Breeches like the men, and their Shooes are almost like theirs. The Women of <hi>Ormus</hi> wear only a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle pair of Breeches with a shift over them. The <hi>Armenian</hi> Women wear besides, a little Justicoar without sleeves, and upon their heads, a fine Linnen-Coif ty'd under their chins. Their hair is gather'd into a long tress, to which they sometimes add more, which is false, to make a long lock that is done
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106224:135"/>
up in a Velvet or Sattin-Case embroider'd, and hangs behind down to the wast.</p>
                     <p>Handsome Women are very plentiful in <hi>Persia,</hi> as well the tawny as the white. For the Merchants that bring both from all parts, choose the handsomest they can pick out. The white Women are brought from <hi>Muscovia, Poland, Cirassia, Mengrelia, Georgia,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Tartary.</hi> The black from the coast of <hi>Melinda,</hi> and the Red-Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Women are seen by none but their own Husbands. They are very idle in their Houses, not so much as looking after any thing of Housewifery. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every thing is at the Husband's disposal, so that the Women are rather Slaves then Wives. They spend their time in taking Tobacco, after several fashions. When they go to the Baths, she's the Woman that wears the best Clothes, and brings the best Collation. They that have Slaves, cause 'em to rub their arms, their legs, and their thighs, till they fall asleep; having no other divertisement in their voluptuous Prison. The higher a-man is in dignity, the more he glories in having a great number of Wives and Slaves; and his absolute power keeps them in order either willingly, or by constraint.</p>
                     <p>There are two sorts of Eunuchs for the guard of the Sultanesses and the Wives of the Nobility: Some are white, but they never come neer the Women, but are order'd to guard the first doors of the <hi>Haram.</hi> The others are black, frightful to look upon, and flat-nos'd; who attend only upon the Women. If there be a necessity for a Woman of Quality to go abroad, the Eunuchs go before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with Battoons in their hands, to make the <hi>Corrouk,</hi> and drive all the people out of the way. When the King goes into the Countrey if any one be asleep in the high-way, and be perceiv'd before he wakens, he is immediately cut to pieces as he lies. In the time of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the Second, one of the Fellows that help'd to set up the Womens Tents, being weary, fell asleep in one of them upon the ground. When the Women came, they, seeing a man asleep, set up a shrieking; upon which, the Eunuchs coming in, wrapt up the Fellow in the Carpet as he lay, and carrying him into the Fields, buried him alive, Carpet and all.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Diseases of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the manner of curing them</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Persian</hi> Children are seldom sick of the small-Pox, but in lieu of that, they are very subject to Scald-pates, till ten or twelve years old. Which, it may be, proceeds from their shaving so young, and so often: for they shave at five or six months old, and two or three times a week.</p>
                     <p>As to the Pox, the <hi>Persians</hi> would be more troubl'd with it, but that the dry Air of the Countrey is an enemy to it: besides, they never lye twice with the fame Woman, without going to the Bath to sweat out the venom of that distemper. As for the Gout or Gravel, the <hi>Persians</hi> know not what it means: But the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> are troubl'd with the latter, especially those that in their youth accustom'd themselves to drink more Wine then Water.</p>
                     <p>To those that are troubl'd with the Cholick, they usually prescribe the eating of Horse-flesh; and I have seen many cur'd by that means.</p>
                     <p>Generally the <hi>Persians,</hi> especially the rich, or those that have wherewithal to live handsomely, are much less subject to Sickness then the people of <hi>Europe.</hi> Some take the reason to be, because of their <hi>China-</hi>drink, which they drink every Spring, boyling an ounce in three pints of water, and so continuing the Dose for ten or twelve days one after the other: all which time they keep a very moderate diet, and eat no fruit for a month together. This drink causes the Patient to sweat; and the sweat being wip'd off, dyes the Linnen, nay the very walls of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a yellow colour. As for any method of Physick, they have none in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:106224:136"/>
For the <hi>Dysentery,</hi> they take sower Curdl'd-milk, with Rice unbruis'd boyl'd in water, to which they add a little Rhubarb powder'd.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of a Disease they forbid Bread, and instead thereof prescribe Rice boyl'd in Hen-broath, or sometimes in fair water. For diet is the chief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which the Physitians prescribe in all Diseases, and account most soveraign. Indeed the remedy is well prescrib'd in many distempers; however it is by them never prescrib'd according to reason or method, but only according to custom; whereby it often comes to pass that they forbid that which is good, and prescribe that which is bad. If the Patient be so poor as not to be able to send for a Physitian, two or three men set him upon an Ass, with a Scarf about his neck, which denotes him to be a sick person, and so lead him to the Physitian; who presently seels his Pulse, lets him Blood, and by and by taking his Pen in his hand, in a small piece of Paper prescribes more Hog-wash at one stroke, then three mens bellys are able to contain.</p>
                     <p>When a Physitian is call'd to a Consultation, he pretends not to take any Money: But his <hi>Atar</hi> or Apothecary finds a way to have the Doctor satisfi'd for his pains. They never permit the Sick to change their Linnen, how nasty soever it be. When they come home to the Patient, though they find him ready to expire, they tell the Servants that he will certainly recover; but then, on the other side, they go to the Parents or Kindred of the Patient, and tell them that the Patient is in a desperate condition, and cannot live. By this means they save their credit; for happen what will, they have told truth either of the one side, or the other.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Persians</hi> divide the natural day into four parts. The first is from Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising to Noon; the Second from Noon to Sun-set: The third from Sun-set till Midnight; and the fourth from Midnight till Sun-rise. At Midnight, Morning, and Sunset, they make a most horrible din in every great City, of Kettle-Drums, Haut-boys, Latten-Basons, and other Instruments: upon which there are certain men hir'd to play for a quarter of an hour together, in some place where they may be heard all over the City. They have also great Cornets, about seven foot long, with deep mouths, which may be heard above half a league. But these Cornets are never us'd but in Cities where the <hi>Kans</hi> or Governours reside. These Instruments are also always employ'd at their great Solemnities; as also when the King creates any new Officer or Governour. These Instruments have also a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to play at all Houses where they understand there is a Male-child born. The meaner sort dare not refuse 'em; but the Nobility value not their priviledg of a straw.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> in the computation of time make use of Lunar-months. The first <hi>Mouharrem,</hi> the second <hi>Cepher,</hi> the third <hi>Rebia-el-Avel,</hi> the fourth <hi>Akner,</hi> the fifth <hi>Gemadil-Avel,</hi> the sixth <hi>Gemadil-Akner,</hi> the seventh <hi>Regeb,</hi> the eighth <hi>Shaabon,</hi> the ninth <hi>Ramezan,</hi> the tenth <hi>Shaval,</hi> the eleventh <hi>Zikadé,</hi> the twelfth <hi>Zil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagge.</hi> And every Month begins from the first appearance of the <hi>Crescent.</hi>

                     <p>In their Astronomical Accounts, and the Calculations of the Longitude and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Planets, for the composing their Almanacks, they make use of Solar-months, thus call'd: <hi>Azar</hi> 31 days. <hi>Onzon</hi> 30 days. <hi>Ajar</hi> 31. <hi>Harizon</hi> 30. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouzé</hi> 31. <hi>Ab</hi> 31. <hi>Eiloul</hi> 30. <hi>Techrion-el-Avel</hi> 31. <hi>Techrion-el-ilani</hi> 30. <hi>Ranon-el-Avel</hi> 31. <hi>Kanon-Elsani</hi> 31. <hi>Shaabat</hi> 28 or 29, answering to our <hi>February.</hi> The first month <hi>Azar</hi> begins upon our eleventh of <hi>March:</hi> so that it answer'd to our month of <hi>March</hi> before the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Reformation. Therefore they call this month <hi>Mah-Roami,</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> months. They also make use of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> months, which are thus call'd: <hi>Terverdin, Erdi-be-hoct, Kourdad, Tir, Mordad, Sheriver,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106224:136"/>
Mohré, Abon, Azer, Dei, Bahmen, Espendarmouzé,.</hi> The first month, <hi>Ferverdin;</hi> begins with the Vernal Equinox, every month not containing above 30 days, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the five which remain to the end of the year, which they call <hi>Kramsi Mouste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relzé.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The day of the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> is the first day of the year, which they call <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonze,</hi> and is one of their Principal Festivals. For that day all the Grandees ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at Court, and present the King according to their quality. If they can meet with nothing that is rare, they present him in Ducatts of Gold, and there are some that present him to the number of ten Thousand. They also give God thanks for preserving them to see the new year, and for preserving the fruits of the Earth from bad seasons, for the Corn is by that time well come up. Upon this first day of the year, if a <hi>Persian</hi> has not money to buy him a new habit, he will go and mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his own body to have one.

                        <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Feasts and ordinary Diet of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Persians</hi> are nothing eager after delicacies or dainties; both the nobler and the meaner sort being very temperate in dyet. In regard that wood is so scarce and dear about <hi>Ispahan,</hi> they never eat boyl'd meat above once a day: and as for their Dinner which they call <hi>Shate,</hi> it consists of bread, cheese-curds, milk, burnt wine, melons and other fruits in season, to which the rich add wet and dry sweet-meats: At night their usual food is <hi>Pilaw</hi> and rost meat. They buy their Provision from hand to mouth, especially the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> which is a double charge. But for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> they live thriftily, and buy at once a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of provisions to last for so long time.</p>
                     <p>Muttons, Kidds, Pullets and Pidgeons, are the usual dyet of the <hi>Persians;</hi> for as for Beef they very rarely eat it. The King and the great Lords will eat a piece of a Hare sometimes when they have been a hunting: but when they have kill'd a wild Boar, they send it always to some Christian, in expectation to be presented for the honour done him. They have no diversity of Victuals or made Dishes in <hi>Persia,</hi> their dyet being more proper to satisfie hunger, then to please a nice palate. Mutton and Lamb would be very good in <hi>Persia,</hi> if they knew how to roast it our way. But the <hi>Persians</hi> roast only at an oven, which is a hole made in the ground two foot and a half broad, and five or six foot deep. They burn nothing but bushes, and a kind of Turf mix'd with the dung of Cattel, and dry'd in the Sun. There are several roasting Cooks at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> that roast a whole Sheep at a time, where he that comes to buy may have as much cut out as he pleases. Other Cooks shops are only for boyl'd meat or rice: their fruits which they pickle up in Vinegar being the only sawce which they have.</p>
                     <p>As for their Bread it is very white, for they have wheat enough to furnish the whole Kingdom. They bake every day, making up their Dow in the form of a thin Cake, strow'd over with <hi>Sesamum.</hi> They bake these Cakes in their Ovens in the ground, covering the batch over with little round flint stones, that are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hot and retain the heat. At <hi>Ispahan</hi> they make a great fire in an earthen pot, and when it is hot they spread the Dow against the sides of the pot. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> make a sort of bread as thin as Paper, which they bake upon a thin Iron plate which is as thin as paper. Their Plate and Dishes are of red Copper tinn'd within side. For they are forbid to make use of Silver by the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Nor does the King use any other then Gold Plate, of which he has great store. They have also a sort of <hi>Porcellane</hi> made at <hi>Kerman.</hi> To eat their broths they make use of wood'n spoons: for as for their rice, which is thick, they take it up in their fingers, and wipe their hands upon their handkerchiefs.</p>
                     <p>The first thing set upon the Table is the Pipe, the Tobacco, and the dish of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106224:137"/>
Coffee; and indeed thus it is that they begin all their debauches. They suck and smoak of their Tobacco through water in a long glass bottle, by which means it comes cool into their mouths: else they would never be able to take it all day long as they do. They sing very little in their Cups: but they recite a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of wicked Verses, which they rehearse with a great deal of gravity. They are so accustomed to take Tobacco, both men and women, that a poor tradesman that has not above five <hi>Sous</hi> to spend, will lay out three of them in Tobacco. If they had none, they say they should not have <hi>damaque,</hi> that is, gladness in their hearts. Many will confess that their excessive taking Tobacco is hurtful; but if you tell 'em of it, they answer in a word, <hi>Adedchoud, 'Tis the custome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides their Tobacco they have also <hi>Opium</hi> made of Poppies, cut as they grow, out of which they draw the juice and make it into Pills. They take no more at first then the head of a pin, increasing their dose by degrees, till they come to take the quantity of half a wall-nut. When they are come to that pitch they dare not give over, for fear of endangering their lives, or addicting themselves to drink wine. In their youth you shall see these <hi>Theriakis</hi> or <hi>takers of Opium,</hi> with pale pensive and dejected countenances, and the use of their speech almost lost: If they omit to take for a day together this ill-continued drug that heats their brains, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses them to act ridiculously and to talk idly, when it has done working, they are as cold and stupid as before, which obliges 'em to take it again. For this reason they are short liv'd: or if they do live till forty, they complain heavily of the pains that proceed from the cold venome of the herb. They that have a mind to kill themselves, swallow a large piece, and drink Vinegar after it, to prevent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of any other Counterpoy on, and so they dye smiling.</p>
                     <p>They have another sort of drink to make themselves merry, which they call <hi>Kokomaar,</hi> compos'd of boyld Poppy seed. They take it in broth, and there are particular houses call'd <hi>Kokomaars Krone,</hi> where people meet to divertise those that see the ridiculous postures which that intoxicating drink causes them to shew. Before it works they quarrel with one another, and call one another all to naught; but never fight. When the drug begins to work, they grow friends; and some are for making complements, others for telling a long tedious story, which renders them very vain. They have also another sort of liquor, which is call'd <hi>Bongue,</hi> very bitter, being made of the leaves of Hemp and some other drug mix'd with it. It makes those that use it shamefully foolish and ridiculous, which is the reason the Law has forbid that and not the former. The <hi>Usbecks</hi> have brought into <hi>Persia,</hi> the Custome of taking in Pipes <hi>Tchouherse,</hi> which is the flower or rather the woolly substance which is found in hemp-closes. This fills the head with strange conceits, sometimes pleasant and sometimes furious; those that take it being quite besides their sences for two or three hours.</p>
                     <p>Their Feasts are thus order'd: The guests come in the morning to the house whither they are invited, and all the day long they spend their time in taking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco and telling stories. Between whiles they have Sweetmeats, Coffee, and Fruits set before them. In the evening the <hi>Sofra</hi> is spread, and the table serv'd with boil'd and roast. If the person that treats be of any quality, he has a kind of a Governour of his house, that sits upon his heels with a Ladle or great wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en spoon in his hand. Then the Inviter makes his complements to the chief of his guests, assuring him that the entertainment is only provided for him, only at his command he is ready to let the rest share with him. The Complements being thus pass'd, the Governour of the House with his great Spoon puts rice and meat upon the little plates, which the servants present by equal portions to every one of the guests. Then they fall too, taking out the rice by handfuls, and the meat with their fingers. Sometimes they mix curdl'd milk with their rice and meat, and making up a lump of all together as big as a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ball, put it all in their mouths at a time, which is the reason they never sit long at Table; one making room for another till they have all done: for as soon as one has done, another comes into his place without any farther Ceremony. They have several Liquors in the room in <hi>Porcellain</hi> Vessels, but at meals they only drink to drive down their meat and to prevent thirst. When all is done, they bring a Bason with an Ewre full of hot water to wash their hands and faces. After which the Inviter complements his guests, and every one returns home; at which
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106224:137"/>
time the servants are very diligent to bring every man his shoes, in hopes of some little piece of silver.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> entertain their friends in the same manner; only that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their Feasts with a cup of strong water, and some sweet-meats, after which they give a couple of hard Eggs to every one of the guests. The <hi>Persians</hi> also have soon done, but the <hi>Armenians</hi> eat swift, and a long time without drinking, which they never do till the end of the meal. After they have given thanks and taken away the cloth, then they fall to drinking to excess. He that gives the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment never thinks he has done well, till his guests are not able to find the way out of the room, and the more they tumble about the room, the less he thinks he has spent his money in vain.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the <hi>Persian</hi>'s are very Gentile, and afford their victuals with a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to all that will come and eat with them at Supper time: admiring at the custome of the <hi>Franks,</hi> who shut their doors when they sit down to their meals.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Marriages of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Persians</hi> betroth their Children very young, that is at nine or ten years; but among the <hi>Armenians</hi> there are some marry'd and lye together at five or six. The Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> allows them but four lawful Wives, whom they call <hi>Nekha.</hi> But there are others whom they call <hi>Amoutha</hi> or hir'd women, and of whom they may have as many as they can keep, and for so long time as they please, which is ratifi'd by the allowance of the Judg. They may also enjoy the Slaves whom they purchase. The Children both of the one and the other are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted lawful, and inherit all alike, without the distinction of Elder or Younger; but two Daughters can have but the share of one boy. When the womans time that was hir'd is out, the man dismisses her, and she is oblig'd to stay forty days before she engage again, that it may appear whither she be with Child or no.</p>
                     <p>The man gives to the woman that he marries a Dowry assign'd upon his Estate, and sends her money and silks to make her cloaths. The maid also sends something to him, but very little, and all by the interposition and intercourse of the women. For the two parties never see one another. Upon the wedding day, they send to the Bridegrooms house, by the sound of Drums and Trumpets, certain Horses and Men laden with the Brides goods, which is many times done out of vain-glory, and more for shew then substance. The Bridegroom is led a foot, attended by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral women with Tapers in their hands, and a noise of Drums and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments marching before them. Being come to the door of the Bridegrooms House, if he have promis'd a larger Dowry to the woman then he is able or willing to give, he keeps his door shut. The Parents of the Maid knock, and he declares he will not have her at that price. But at length after some contests on both sides they agree, and the Virgin enters with her Mother and all her Kindred. Then the <hi>Moullah</hi> reads the conditions of Marriage; which being done, the women retire into the inner part of the House, the men feasting by themselves, and the women by themselves.</p>
                     <p>This is all that is done upon the Wedding-day, but the following days are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways so pleasing, and it often follows that both parties do not agree, or that the husband misuses his wife. Then the woman that requires separation, requires the Dowry promis'd her by her husband: which the man oft-times refuses and if she persists in her demand, is many times so severely us'd by him, that she is constrain'd to cry, <hi>I'th Devils name let me go, I demand nothing of thee.</hi> Then they both repair to the <hi>Casi,</hi> or <hi>Cheit-Lesloon,</hi> who is a Doctor of the Law, and in his presence they discharge one another. This they may do by their Law three times.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106224:138"/>
After that, the same woman can never return to her Husband again.</p>
                     <p>The Children derive their Nobility from the Father, whither he be born of a Slave, or an <hi>Amoutha,</hi> or a Legitimate wife. The Nobility of the <hi>Persians</hi> which is call'd <hi>Negabet,</hi> is founded upon their being descended from <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They who claim that extraction, have the title of <hi>Mir</hi> or Prince: and their Daughters carry the appellation of <hi>Mirza</hi> or Princess. They are very numerous and very poor. But the title of <hi>Mir</hi> without a good Estate or high Employment signifies little or nothing.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Death and Burials of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>'TIs the Custome among the <hi>Persians,</hi> that when the Patient lyes very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously ill, they light several fires upon the Terrass of the House, to give the People notice to pray for him. So soon as the breath is out of his body, the whole house rings with cries and lamentations, especially of the women who tear their hair, and shew such antick postures, that a man would think them possess'd. In the midst of their tears they make long repetitions of the worthy actions of the deceas'd, and every foot they set up a yelling. Then they go and advertize the <hi>Casi,</hi> that such a one is dead, to whom the <hi>Casi</hi> answers <hi>Sarchoama Salamet-Bashet. May your head be in safety.</hi> In the mean while he seals a Licence to the <hi>Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derchour,</hi> to take the body and wash it in a house which is built on purpose near a running water. After that come a great number of <hi>Moullah's,</hi> with the Ensigns of the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which are long staffs like Pikes, at the end whereof are thin plates of Iron and Latten, so weak that they bend downward with the least motion: the bodies of the staves being wrapt about with certain pieces of Taffata. These <hi>Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lahs</hi> tear their throats crying out <hi>Alla, Alla, Alla,</hi> repeating nothing else, and dancing sometimes upon one foot and sometimes upon another; and because they that baul loudest get the most money, they put their thumbs in their ears with their fingers upon their cheeks, and tear their throats with all the force they have. The body being wash'd, the cloaths of the deceas'd belong to the <hi>Mourderchour.</hi> When they carry the Beire, it is the custome that every one that meets it, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers their shoulders to help carry, while the others ease themselves; for which the Kindred of the deceas'd make some acknowledgment. If he be a person of Quality, all his Horses are bridl'd and saddl'd, and others perhaps borrow'd: One carries his Turban, another his Scimitar, another his Bow, another his Arrows, another his Buckler, and whatever else is of any use to set forth his Quality and his Courage. The biggest Church-yard that belongs to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> is <hi>Calreston,</hi> but there is not one handsome Tomb in it. The <hi>Armenians</hi> lay a great stone over the grave, and the rich set up an Arch with four Pillars, under which they eat and drink in the shade when they visit the Tombs of their Ancestors.</p>
                     <p>Their graves are six foot long, six foot deep, and two foot wide, wherein they lay the bodies with their faces turn'd toward <hi>Mecca;</hi> and then they set up two tiles of each side his face to keep the earth from falling upon it. If he be a rich man, or have been a stout Souldier, they bury with him his Turbant, Scimitar, Bow and Arrows, and set Victuals by him; which part of the hole being made up with brick, the rest is fill'd up with earth. The <hi>Moulla</hi>'s alone return to the house of the deceas'd, where they have meat set before 'em, and are also farther pay'd for their singing and bawling. A while after the Kindred coming to visit the Heir, discourse him upon the contempt of the world, tell him that it is but as a <hi>Caravan,</hi> some of which arrive sooner at their journeys end then others. Eight days after the Heir returns their visits. As for the Grandees they order in their Wills that their bodies shall be either carry'd to <hi>Mecca</hi> or <hi>Meshed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As well the <hi>Persians</hi> as the <hi>Turks,</hi> believe that as soon as the grave is fill'd, that the two Angels <hi>Neguir</hi> and <hi>Manguer,</hi> revive the dead as far as his wast; ask him
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106224:138"/>
the reason of Faith, and which way he said his Prayers, and that according to his merits they use him well or ill. As for the torment of Souls before the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that only consists in a grief for not having arriv'd to those perfections and Sciences to which they might have attain'd, and consequently for not having attain'd to that perfection which God requir'd of them. Others hold that the Souls of the unfortunate are tormented with Dreams and Visions; but that the Souls of the happy always enjoy the sight of pleasing objects; till the <hi>Saheb-el-zaman,</hi> or Master of time shall come to confirm the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who shall kill <hi>Dedgar,</hi> who is like our <hi>Antichrist,</hi> with his own hand; at which time all then alive shall dye in an instant, and then shall happen the general Resurrection, which they call <hi>Moavedet-hechre.</hi> That the same Bodies and Souls shall unite to appear at the day of Judgment before the Throne of the great Judge of the world; and that to go thither they must pass over a bridge call'd <hi>Polserat,</hi> shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then the edge of a razor, which nevertheless the Mussulmen shall pass over without any danger with the swiftness of a bird. But that misbelievers shall fall as soon as ever they set their feet upon it, and shall fall into a torrent of fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand Devils arm'd with Cramp Irons, Pincers, and tenter-hooks. So that it is a kind of a Proverb among the <hi>Persians,</hi> if a man cannot obtain of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Justice of his bargain, or to yield to right, <hi>Well,</hi> says he, <hi>before thou passest</hi> Polserat, <hi>thou shalt restore it me double, for I will take hold of thy Coat, and hinder thee from getting over till thou hast given me satisfaction;</hi> But the craftier sort laugh at this, and make answer with a smile, <hi>Well, well, we will venture stumbling as we pass over</hi> Polserat. The Porter of Paradise whom they call <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suen</hi> shall open them the gate. There they shall sit upon the banks of the great <hi>Kausser,</hi> which is a fountain where their Prophet shall give them of the water to drink out of a Ladle, and that afterwards they shall have a great number of women created on purpose for them, with all sorts of most delicious food. And for fear of fouling this place of recreation and holiness with the excrements of eating and drinking, they say, that those things shall always evacuate in a persum'd sweat, and that they themselves shall always remain in that condition. Others more refin'd, and not believing material enjoyments, affirm that Beatitude consists in the perfect knowledge of the Sciences; and for the sences they shall have their satisfaction according to their quality.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> The Author departs from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Ormus,</hi> and describes the Road to <hi>Schiras.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Set forth out of <hi>Ispahan</hi> the 24. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1665. in the afternoon, and stai'd a League from the City, in a field whither some of my friends would needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me. About ten a clock at night, I set forward again, and travell'd till break of day; and then I came to a place where the <hi>Radars</hi> kept guard half a league from a great Town call'd <hi>Ispshaneck,</hi> which you are to cross. About ten a clock in the forenoon I came to <hi>Mahiar,</hi> where there is a very good Inn. But the Land between this and <hi>Ispahan</hi> is all very barren and without wood.</p>
                     <p>The 26<hi>th,</hi> three hours after midnight, I set forward through a dry Plain, which begins to grow more fruitful, about a League from <hi>Comshe</hi> a great City, where I arriv'd by eleven a Clock in the morning. In it are several Inns, and indifferent handsome ones, considering that they are built only of Earth. This City is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of a row of Villages that extend about half a League in length. About three quarters of a League on this side the City stands a neat <hi>Mosquee</hi> with a pond full of fish. But the <hi>Moullahs</hi> will not permit you to catch any, saying that they belong to the Prophet to whom the <hi>Mosquee</hi> is dedicated. However because it is a shady place in the Summer, Travellers rather choose to lye by this pond, then to shut themselves up in the City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:106224:139"/>
The 27<hi>th</hi> I travell'd from four in the morning till ten in the forenoon, through a plain sow'd with store of grain, and lodg'd in an Inn call'd <hi>Maksoube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 28<hi>th</hi> I departed two hours after midnight, and after eight hours travel through a barren plain, I arriv'd at <hi>Yesdecas,</hi> a little City built upon a rock in the midst of a great Valley, and lodg'd in an Inn at the foot of the Rock. The same day in the morning I pass'd on to a neat house with sine Gardens, call'd <hi>Amnebad;</hi> built by <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</hi> Governor of <hi>Schiras.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>March</hi> I departed an hour after midnight, and a little after I cross'd a short mountain, but so rugged and so craggie, that they have given it the name of <hi>Kotel-Innel-tebekeni,</hi> that is, <hi>the Mountain that breaks the Horses shoes.</hi> The next day we pass'd by a scurvy Castle call'd <hi>Gombessala;</hi> then travelling through a flat Country, I came by ten in the morning to <hi>Dehigherdou,</hi> or the Village of Wall-nuts. I endur'd very sharp weather all the morning, for all that Country, and that which I travell'd the next day, is very cold at some times of the year.</p>
                     <p>The second day I travell'd from midnight till ten a clock in the morning, through the Snow over a barren Plain to come to <hi>Cuzkuzar,</hi> where there is a new Inn well built.</p>
                     <p>The third I was a horseback from five in the morning till noon, first over the same Plain by a Lake side in a very bad way cover'd with snow that hid the holes; then passing a tedious long and rugged mountain, I descended to a Village call'd <hi>Asepas,</hi> where there is to be seen an old ruin'd Castle upon the point of a Hill. The Inhabitants were all <hi>Georgians</hi> by descent, but now turn'd all <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> I met with wine and fish, in regard of the many Rivolets, but the <hi>Caravahsira</hi> is old, and ill provided.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, setting out by day-break, I rode over a Plain, which <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> the first gave the <hi>Georgians</hi> to till, and in eleven hours I came to <hi>Ondgiom,</hi> a large Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage upon a River, over which there is a fair stone bridge.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, I got a horseback by two a clock in the morning, and had two leagues in the first place of deep miery way; afterwards I pass'd a steep Mountain, craggy and durty. I pass'd through a Village call'd <hi>Iman Shade,</hi> from the name of one of their Prophets that lyes buried there, and gave the Mountain its name, being all cover'd with bitter Almond-trees. I travell'd sometime between rude and craggy rocks, after which I met with a small River, which runs to <hi>Mayn,</hi> a little City where I lodg'd in a fair Inn.</p>
                     <p>The sixth, I departed three hours after midnight, and travell'd through a large Plain encompass'd with high and rugged Mountains; upon one of which that is divided from the other, stood a Castle which they say was ruin'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, of which at present there does not remain the least sign or footstep. I cross'd the river of <hi>Mayne</hi> over two stone Bridges, and then came to <hi>Abgherme;</hi> a place that stands in a Plain where there is an Inn half built; so call'd by reason of a Spring of hot waters that rises not far from it. In the morning I pass'd over a fair and long Causey, call'd <hi>Pouligor,</hi> being above 500 paces long, and 15 broad, divided also by certain Bridges, to give the water free passage, by reason the Country is very full of mershes. At the end of this Causey stands an Inn very well built, but the gants that haunt it will not suffer it to be frequented. I pass'd along by the foot of a Mountain, and after three hours travel, I stopp'd a while at an Inn that stands at the foot of another steep and craggie mountain.</p>
                     <p>I arriv'd at <hi>Schiras</hi> about six a clock at night. But here give me leave before I enter the City, to make two observations, the one touching the Road from <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> to <hi>Schiras,</hi> the other concerning the ruins of <hi>Tche-elminar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Road from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Schiras,</hi> observe that in winter time when the Snow is fallen, when you come to <hi>Yesdecas,</hi> you must of necessity leave the direct road, because it is impossible to pass the streights of those Mountains, which I have mention'd. Therefore you must keep the left hand road eastward, through the Plains, taking a guide along with you.</p>
                     <p>This way, which is the longer by two days journey, was formerly unknown, because of a River, that in one place beats upon a steep rock, and closes up the passage. But <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> with a vast expence of time and money, caus'd a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106224:139"/>
way to be levell'd out of the Rock about 15 or 20 foot above the River, which he secur'd to the water-side with a Wall three or four foot high. This way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues for half a league, and then you come to lye at a great Village in a Plain, where you take Guides to shew you the Fords of the River.</p>
                     <p>Having past the River, you cross over several fertil Plains water'd with great store of Rivers. Then you ascend a Mountain, from whence you have but a league and a half to <hi>Tche-clminar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the point of the Mountain, upon the right-hand of the great Road, are to be seen twelve Pillars still standing, that form a kind of a square. In the spaces of the Mountain are a great number of <hi>Niches,</hi> that are opposit to the Pillars, and were certainly the places where the ancient <hi>Persians</hi> put their Idols. Thence you come to <hi>Tche-elminar;</hi> where are to be seen a great many old Columns, some standing, and some lying upon the ground, and some ill-shap'd Statues, with little four-square dark rooms. All which together, easily perswades me, who have well consider'd the principal Pagods of <hi>Iudia,</hi> that <hi>Tche-elminar</hi> was only a Temple formerly dedicated to Idolatrous worship. And that which confirms my opinion, is, that there is no place more proper for an Idolatrous Temple then this, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the abundance of water. Besides, that the dark Rooms could be no other then the Chambers for the Priests,; and where the Rice and Fruits that were the feigned nourishment of the Idols, were the better secur'd from goats and flies.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Tche-elminar,</hi> you come to lye at a Village half a league farther, where is very good Wine. From thence to <hi>Schiras</hi> is a hard days journey; especially when the Snow begins to melt: for then the Road looks like a little Sea.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXI <hi>Of the City of</hi> Schiras.</head>
                     <p>THE City of <hi>Schiras</hi> lies in 78 degr. 15 min. of Longitude, and 29 deg. 36 min. of Latitude. It is seated in a Plain that extends it self about four leagues from the North to the South, and from the West to the East about five leagues. Upon the South-east there is a Lake of salt water four leagues in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass: leaving the Plain as you travel to the South, you pass between two Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which are not so close, but that they leave room for certain pleasant Valleys a league and a half wide.</p>
                     <p>The Soil about <hi>Schiras</hi> is good, and fruitful; and it is particularly famous for the most excellent Wines of all <hi>Persia.</hi> As for the City it self, there is nothng handsome in it: for it looks rather like a Town half ruin'd then a City. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was begirt with walls of Earth, which are now utterly decaid. The Houses are of the same Earth dri'd in the Sun, and whiten'd over with lime; so that when it happens to rain, when the Earth comes to be well moisten'd, the Houses fall of themselves. Only the Colledg which <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> built, and some of the <hi>Mosquees</hi> are are of Brick: and the best of those <hi>Mosquees</hi> is call'd <hi>Sha-Shiraque,</hi> which out of a particular devotion is kept somewhat better in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. However, there is nothing in it worth taking notice of. Upon the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east side, the City runs within a quarter of a league of the Mountain: and from a Stone-bridg, as you go out of the City to the foot of the Mountain, is a long Street in a streight line, where there stands a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> built by <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan.</hi> Without, it appears fair enough; but within, it falls to ruine. There is an <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal Piazza</hi> before the Gate, and in the middle of the <hi>Piazza</hi> an <hi>Octogonal Vase,</hi> which is fill'd by a little stream that runs through the Street from the Mountain. Both sides of the Street from the <hi>Mosquee</hi> to the Mountain are wall'd in: and at certain spaces are great Gates one against another, with rooms over them; the Windows whereof open into the Gardens behind the walls; all along by which runs a row of Cypress-trees in a direct line: and in the middle of the Street,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106224:140"/>
about two hunder'd paces on this side the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> is another <hi>Vase,</hi> which receives the same water as it runs from the Mountain. This Street was made by <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</hi> after he had cut the Mountain at the end of it, to shorten the way from <hi>Schiras</hi> to <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Schiras</hi> three or four Glass-houses, where they make great and small Bottles, to transport the Sweet-waters that are made in the City. There are also made the several sorts of Vessels wherein they pickle their fruits of all sorts, which they send in great quantities into <hi>India,</hi> to <hi>Sumatra, Batavia,</hi> and other places.</p>
                     <p>There is no Silk made, nor any other manufacture in <hi>Schiras:</hi> only there are some few <hi>Chites</hi> or Painted-cloaths made there, which nevertheless are very coarse, and in use only among the meaner sort.</p>
                     <p>As you go out of the City upon the North-west side, you meet with a long Alley or Walk, in three parts whereof are plac'd three Stones, which they call <hi>Mills.</hi> At the end of this walk is a Garden call'd <hi>Bay-Sha,</hi> or the King's Garden. Over the Gate whereof is a great Room half ruin'd: and at the end of a large Walk planted with Cypress-trees, stands a neat piece of building, but altogether neglected. Upon the left-hand whereof is a great Pond pav'd with Free-stone, being all the beauties of the Garden: which, it is true, was full of Fruit-trees, Roses and <hi>Jasmins;</hi> yet, for want of order, it look'd like a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>From the Garden to the Hill is a Plain of two leagues long, and one broad; which is all but one large Vinyard belonging to several persons. Beyond the Vinyard rise very high Mountains, from whence fall several little Springs that form a River, which is call'd <hi>Bend-Emir,</hi> from the name of a Town where the biggest Spring rises. This River of <hi>Bend-Emir</hi> waters the whole Vineyard of <hi>Schiras;</hi> where it never rains from Spring till Autumn: which is the reason that in the Summer there is no water in the very Channel next the City.</p>
                     <p>Their Wines are the best in <hi>Persia;</hi> but there is not so great a quantity made as people imagin. For, of all this great Vineyard, and in all the places round about the City for four or five leagues together, good part of the Grapes are dri'd, and a greater quantity pickl'd: and of the Wine, there are many Vessels full, which are burnt for the benefit of the poor Travellers, and Carriers, who find it a great refreshment to drink it with water.</p>
                     <p>Their Wine, as all other things, is sold by weight, and not by measure: In the year 1666, a most plentiful year for Wine, the Provision of the King's House amounted to 50000 <hi>Mens</hi> of <hi>Keukné,</hi> or the ancient <hi>Men</hi> containing nine pound of ours, at sixteen ounces to the pound, (being the only weight for Wine,) and the King allows as much to the <hi>Franks,</hi> as for his own Houshold. The Jews of <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> who boast themselves of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> make above a hunder'd and ten thousand <hi>Mens,</hi> it being their chiefest livelihood; but the Governour of <hi>Schiras</hi> knows how to share with them in their profit. The whole account of Wine made at <hi>Schiras</hi> amounts to 200025 <hi>Mens,</hi> or 4125 Tuns, at three hunder'd pints to the Tun.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Schiras</hi> is an ancient <hi>Mosquee,</hi> wherein is the Sepulcher of a <hi>Sadi,</hi> whom the <hi>Persians</hi> esteem the best of their Poets. It has been a very fair one, accompani'd with a large Building, which was once a Colledg; but it runs to ruine, as do also many other Edifices within the City. Just against this <hi>Mosquee</hi> you descend by a pair of Stairs into a large Well, at the bottom whereof is a <hi>Vase</hi> full of Fish, which no-body dares to touch, it being Sacriledg to rob the <hi>Sadi</hi> of what belongs to him. A little beyond this <hi>Mosquee,</hi> upon a high Rock, stand the ruines of a Castle; and upon the top of all the Rock is a square Well cut out of the Rock. It is very deep, and ten or twelve foot broad: formerly, they told me, their Adulteresses were all thrown into it. There is one wonderful Well in this City; which is 15 years rising, and 15 years falling; that is, the water is one fifteen years rising to the top, and another fifteen years sinking to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Schiras</hi> two or three <hi>Bazars</hi> well built, through the midst whereof the water runs in a Channel.</p>
                     <p>To the South-west, a good league from the City, there is a little Hill divided from the great Mountain, upon which Hill are three Gates to be seen, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106224:140"/>
of an Idolatrous Temple. There were four Gates, but the South-Gate is tumbl'd down: the rest are standing, compos'd of three Stones: Upon both the Stones that make the Jaums, there are two figures in half Relief, with their faces one looking upon another, with their arms extended; one holding in his hand a Pan, out of which issues a flame of fire; and the other a Towel folded up. The other Statue holds as it were a Purse in one hand, and a bowl of Fire in the other; the Figures being as big as the Life, only their faces are spoil'd; and as for the other doors, they are both the same.</p>
                     <p>Two Musquet-shot from thence, in a plain, rises a little Mountain, from the North-side of which fall many Springs that meet in a large Pond full of Fish. Some high Trees grow there, to shade the Habitation of a <hi>Dervi's</hi> that lives there. The place is pleasant, and all the Springs together fill a Channel large enough to water the neighbouring Fields. Here it was that certainly the ancient Idolaters came to wash, and thence went to the Temple to say their Prayers, and make their Offerings.</p>
                     <p>Half a league beyond, at the foot of a Mountain, is a place about 500 paces in compass, whence there fall a good number of Springs that meet in a Pond, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd with high Trees, and full of Fish. In one corner of the Mountain stand Figures, cut out of the Rock much bigger than the Life. The two which are uppermost look one upon another; and that upon the left-hand carries a large Turbant, such as the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> wears when he goes to the <hi>Divan.</hi> From his <hi>Turbant</hi> to the middle of his Forhead, he was bound with the Tresses of his own hair, the ends whereof were fasten'd together with large Buckles behind in his neck. His habit was a Robe after the ancient fashion, with a kind of a Cutlace by his side. Nor did the opposite Statue much differ from this, only instead of a Turbant, he wore a kind of Miter upon his head. The two other Statues underneath the former, stretch'd forth their arms one to the other: the one representing a Man, the other a Woman. The Man seem'd to present the Woman a Nosegay of Flowers; but in truth it was a difficult thing to discern them, in regard they were both cover'd with a Fig-tree that grew just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them out of the rock.</p>
                     <p>About two thousand paces farther, there is a Lake of salt water about ten leagues in compass, which is fill'd by several Springs that fall from the Mountains: and here it is that the people make a great quantity of Salt. There runs into it also a salt River, over which you cross upon a large stone-Bridg about three miles from <hi>Schiras,</hi> in the way to <hi>Bander-Abassi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Half a league from the City are two remarkable Wells: the one upon the top of the Mountain, the other upon the descent, cut out of the Rock: both of an extraordinary depth. There is no water in either, because they are half full of Stones, which they that come to see the Wells, throw into 'em. There are also to be seen the ruines of a Castle formerly built there for the Guard of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. But since <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> made the new way, he caus'd all those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses to be defac'd, as being expensive to the King, and burthensome to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, from whom the Guards exacted Toll in those places. Now all the ways are free, and the Merchants travel securely.</p>
                     <p>About half a league from the City, toward the North, upon the brow of a high Mountain, stands a little <hi>Mosquee,</hi> like a Hermitage: and fifteen foot below it gushes out a fair Spring, which is the best in the places neer to <hi>Schiras.</hi> Neer to it is a little place encompast with a Pale, with four Pillars that uphold a Ceeling. Here it is that a <hi>Dervis</hi> sits, and entertains all them that come to visit him, to whom he presents Tobacco, according to the custom of the Countrey. This place is one of the best Prospects in all <hi>Syria,</hi> from whence you behold one way all the plain of <hi>Schiras,</hi> and all the City from one end to the other, with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. But people go not thither for the fair Prospect, or to visit the <hi>Dervis,</hi> but to admire a Cypress-tree not above three or four paces from the Prospect, planted among the Rocks; and of that bigness, that four men can can hardly fathom it: it is proportionably high, and is look'd upon to be the fairest Cypress-tree in all <hi>Persia,</hi> where so many grow besides. This Tree is fed by the Spring which I have mention'd, falling some eight or ten foot below into a Cistern, which is always full; whence through a Canal it runs into a Garden in the plain some seven or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106224:141"/>
eight hunder'd paces from the Mountain. In this Garden are to be seen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of a Palace of one of the ancient Kings of <hi>Persia:</hi> yet what is still to be seen, does not declare it to have been very magnificent. The King was call'd <hi>Padsha quieshel,</hi> the <hi>Scald-pated King.</hi> A thing not to be wonder'd at, in regard there are few <hi>Persians</hi> but such as either have or have had scald heads.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues from <hi>Schiras,</hi> to the South-west, at the foot of the great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, stands a Hermitage, call'd <hi>Pir-Bouno,</hi> where three or four <hi>Dervis</hi> live, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pleasant place; for the <hi>Dervis</hi> always choose out the most delightful places to pitch their Tents in: where they sit smoaking their Pipes with that gravity, that if the King himself should come by, they would not stir to give him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. That which adds to the pleasure of that Hermitage, is a fair Spring of water that refreshes the Garden, and the number of fair Trees that are about it.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of a league from the City, toward the West, is to be seen a Church-yard encompast with Walls; in the middle whereof, looking toward <hi>Mecca,</hi> stands a Monument very much frequented by the <hi>Dervis,</hi> and other devout people, who say their Prayers there, it being the Sepulcher of <hi>Hougia Hafiz,</hi> for whom they have a very great veneration. The year of his decease is set down upon his Tomb; being in the year 1381: and he purchas'd that great esteem among the <hi>Persians,</hi> for having compos'd a great Book of Morality, and for that he was also one of the best Poets of his time. He has left one great Poem behind him in the praise of good Wine; which has caus'd many to aver, that <hi>Hougia-Hafiz</hi> was no good <hi>Mussul-man,</hi> in regard he has so highly prais'd a thing which is so strictly forbidd'n by the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neer to the Church-yard is a fair Garden, which men go to see for the beauty of the Cypress-trees, which are its chief ornament. They are to be admir'd for their height and bigness, among which there is one that was planted by the hand of <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the Great himself, in the year 1607; and it may well deserve to have been planted by the hand of a Monarch; for it was bigger then the rest that had been planted above a hunder'd years before.</p>
                     <p>Without the City, upon the North-side, at the foot of the Mountain, is a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den belonging to the ancient Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> call'd <hi>Bag-Firdous.</hi> It is full of Fruit-trees, and Rose-trees in abundance. At the end of the Garden, upon the descent of a Hill, stands a great piece of Building, and below a large Pond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords it water. The rich Inhabitants of <hi>Schiras</hi> have been formerly very curious to have fair Gardens, and have been at great expences to that purpose. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Schiras,</hi> nor at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> is there any thing that may compare with those lovely Paradises of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many Inns in <hi>Schiras,</hi> but the <hi>Franks</hi> generally lodg at the Convent of the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friars: and they that would be more private, lodg at another House that belongs also to the same Friars, which they would fain sell, as being a charge to 'em at this time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> A continuation of the Road from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Ormus,</hi> from <hi>Schiras</hi> to <hi>Bander-Abassi.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE sixth of <hi>March,</hi> by eight of the Clock in the morning, I departed from <hi>Schiras;</hi> and after six hours travel through the plain that continues fertil for a league together beyond the City, I came to an Inn call'd <hi>Badaadgi.</hi> The water is bad, being as it were luke-warm. Here cold weather begins to cease. The next day I set out by break of day, and came to a large and well-built Inn, only it stood remote from any Town. It is call'd <hi>Mouzaffert,</hi> and is the only place in <hi>Persia</hi> where I met with black <hi>Saligots,</hi> or Water-nuts, as big and as good as ours in <hi>Dauphine.</hi> The Countrey breeds nothing but Goats and Sheep: and about two leagues off runs a River along by the Mountain to the West.</p>
                     <p>The 18<hi>th</hi> I departed by day-break, and travell'd eleven hours through a stone-Countrey, cover'd with bitter Almond and Turpentine-Trees. I lodg'd in a fair Inn, call'd <hi>Paira,</hi> neer to a River that comes from the West, and makes the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey fertil. There is some Wood in the Valleys, and some Villages appear on the other side of the River toward the South.</p>
                     <p>The 19<hi>th</hi> I set out by four of the Clock in the morning, and travell'd along a Valley, wherein were many Villages receiving the benefit of the River last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. About eight in the morning I stopt at an Inn built in an <hi>Octogonal</hi> form, a good league from the River, with several Villages between. The name of the Inn is <hi>Kaffer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 20<hi>th</hi> I set out two hours after midnight, and travell'd till ten in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a dry Valley. By the way I met several Shepherds and Herdsmen, who were forsaking the hot Countreys, and driving toward <hi>Schiras</hi> for cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>They that travel upon their own Horses, and would see one of the richest parts of <hi>Persia,</hi> and some Antiquities, setting out from <hi>Kaffer,</hi> instead of following the <hi>Caravan-</hi>road, take the right-hand way by the side of the River, that runs a league and a half from the same Inn. When you have past the River, the way is very streight, and lies for two leagues together through a steep Rock, the Mountain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right, and the River upon the left, where there is not room in some places for two Horses to ride a-brest. All along this way, toward the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are little paths that lead to Caverns, some of which are so large, that they will contain two or three thousand men. Having past this way, you come into a Plain call'd <hi>Dadivan,</hi> four or five leagues in circuit; the greatest part of which is planted with Orange-trees, Citrons, and Granats. Some of these Orange-trees two men can hardly fathom, being as high as our Walnut-trees; and this is one of the most delicious situations in all <hi>Persia.</hi> I have travell'd through it several times, and sometimes only to divertise my self. The rest of the Plain is sow'd with Rice and Wheat. You set up your Tents under these Trees, and then the Countrey people bring Provision of several sorts, especially Partridges, Hares, and wild Goats. The River that crosses the Plain is full of Carps, Barbels, Pikes, and Crey-Fish. I remember one time a Countrey-man carri'd me down to the water, and before my face took up a Fish with his hand. He was so nimble at it, that having caught one which he did not think big enough, he threw it back again, and took up another. Now in regard that Travellers generally stay about ten or twelve days in that place, the Tumblers that live there-abouts, fail not to come and give you a Visit, to shew ye some of their tricks, and to tast your <hi>Schiras</hi> Wine. The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> usually spend the end of the Summer in this Plain, for the benefit of the River, and the Trees: which become so large and fair, by means of the River, which the Countrey-men bring in by Canals, and shut it up in Ponds, among the Trees, to water their Grounds; which is all the good this River does in <hi>Persia:</hi> for all the rest of its course is through cragged Rocks, and salt Marshes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:106224:142"/>
The 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> by ten in the morning, I came to an Inn which was call'd <hi>Moushek,</hi> which is a-lone-House at the foot of a Rock. There is a Spring about five hunder'd paces from it, but the water is hot, and has a sulphury tast; so that the Cattel will hardly drink it. Therefore you must go to a Cistern about two Musquet-shot from the Inn, where there is one newly set up, instead of another that was there before, into which a Jew once chanc'd to fall in, and was therefore broken by the superstitious <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three quarters of a league from <hi>Moushetz</hi> are two roads that lead to <hi>Lar,</hi> the one for the Camels, the other for the Horses and Mules. The first is the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est by three days journey, and is call'd the Road of the Desert; for after you have past a great Town inhabited only by Camel-Masters, where you lye the first night, between that and <hi>Lar,</hi> you shall meet with nothing of Houses but only Herdsmens Tents, that feed sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. Upon the Camels Road there are another sort of Fowl like the great Partridges in their bodies, but their legs and feet resemble those of wild Ducks. The Camels take this Road, because it is impossible for them to pass the Mountain <hi>Jarron,</hi> over which the Horses and Mules are hardly able to travel.</p>
                     <p>I set out from <hi>Moushek</hi> the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> at two in the morning, and having travell'd till eight through a plain, but stony Countrey, I came to the little City of <hi>Jarron,</hi> which is rather to be call d a Forrest of Palm-trees that bear excellent Dates. I lodg'd in an Inn five hunder'd paces from the City, and staid there two days.</p>
                     <p>The 24<hi>th,</hi> setting out presently after midnight, I travell'd a good hour, and then I began to mount the steep Mountain of <hi>Jarron,</hi> which is very high, and very long; but the descent is the most dangerous that ever I saw in all my Travels; and besides that, the Moon did not shine. Being at the top, after you have descended three or four hunder'd paces, you meet with a Bridg of one Arch, that reaches from one Mountain to another: a bold piece of Architecture, not enough to be admir'd, being rais'd at the charges of <hi>Iman-Kouli-Kan</hi> for the benefit of Travellers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the bottom of this, you must pass two others as steep in their ascent as in the descent; upon the top of one of which stands a Cistern, which, though it be very large, is generally emptied by the end of the Summer. Upon these Mountains there is such an infinite quantity of Partridg that a man cannot miss that will but shoot. By eight in the Morning I came to an Inn which is call'd <hi>Shakal,</hi> which is a-lone House in a Desert Countrey, but stor'd with bitter Almond-trees, and Turpentine-trees. Approaching neer to the Inn, you meet with two or three Cisterns, which are a great comfort to Travellers, water being very scarce upon this Road. There are at <hi>Shakal</hi> nine or ten <hi>Radar's</hi> for the Guard of the Road, who are also Masters of the Inn: So soon as you are alighted, they ask you if you will eat any Kid, being sure of their blow, and having no more to do but to go to the Mountain and fetch one, where they swarm. There are store of Partridges, which are almost as big as Pullets; of which you may easily kill as many as you please.</p>
                     <p>The 25<hi>th</hi> I travell'd five hours, from morning till noon. An hour after I took Horse, I met with a Mountain, the descent whereof was very steep. They call it the Mountain of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>shen,</hi> at the foot whereof is a Fountain of excellent water. A good league farther you meet with a fair Inn call'd <hi>Mouezeré,</hi> in the midst of a pleasant Grove, where there is an excellent Spring of water; but because there is no food to be had, you must go as far as <hi>Detadombé,</hi> a Village seated in a plain. A quarter of a league on this side, upon the top of a Mountain, appears the ruins of an old Castle; the Village it self being surrounded with Palm-trees. The Inn is a good one, provided with a very good Cistern.</p>
                     <p>The 25<hi>th</hi> I travell'd through a plain for three hours, and stopt at <hi>Banarou,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City well built, at the foot of a high Mountain; upon which appears the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of a large Castle. <hi>Bonarou</hi> is the Frontier Town of the Province of <hi>Fars,</hi> bordering upon the Province of <hi>Lar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 26<hi>th</hi> I departed an hour after midnight, and travell'd till nine in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, partly through the Plain, and partly through the Mountains, where I saw an old Tower for the guard of the Road. I staid at <hi>Bihry,</hi> a little City seated upon a plain, that borders upon a high Mountain. The Inn is new, and very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106224:142"/>
built by the Mother of <hi>Aimas, Kan</hi> of <hi>Lar,</hi> when the great <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> took this Countrey from the <hi>Gaures,</hi> whom he constrain'd to turn <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 27<hi>th</hi> I set out at four of the Clock in the morning, and about seven I past through a Village seated in a small plain. A league from thence I lodg'd in an Inn call'd <hi>Pai-Cotali;</hi> that is to say, the foot of the Mountain, as being built at the foot of the Mountain. From thence to <hi>Lar</hi> is not above four or five hours tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling; but the way is very bad, and several swift Torrents are to be past over.</p>
                     <p>You may take another Road from <hi>Bihry,</hi> upon the right-hand toward the West; it is the shorter way by two or three leagues: but so bad, and so narrow, that in many places two Horsemen cannot ride a-brest, being for the most part all Rocks and Precipices.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lar</hi> is the Capital City of the Province of the same name, which formerly bore the title of a Kingdom. It is but of an ordinary bigness, enclos'd on both sides with high Mountains, being built round about a Rock, upon which there stands a Castle of Free-stone, wherein the King keeps a Garrison. The whole Country is very hot, nor have they any water but Rain water, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in Cisterns, and which sometimes causes a wide Torrent that runs by one side of the City, and falls from a Cascade two stories high, made of Free-stone. In the City and parts adjacent, grow a great number of trees, especially Date trees and Tamarisk. The Gardens also and Mountains are full of Orange trees.</p>
                     <p>There are but two Inns in <hi>Lar,</hi> the one within the City, which is not a very good one; the other at the end of the City toward <hi>Ormus,</hi> which would be convenient, but that it is always afloat when the Rains fall; for which reason the <hi>Franks</hi> generally lye at the <hi>Hollanders</hi> House at the end of the City. And there is a necessity for staying at <hi>Lar,</hi> to change the Camels; for the Camels that come from <hi>Ispahan</hi> can go no further; every City having their particular priviledges. Which sometimes proves prejudicial to the Merchant, in regard the Governour will delay the change of the Camels till he is presented.</p>
                     <p>The Fortress of <hi>Lar</hi> takes up the whole surface of the top of the Rock; and there is but one way to climb it up, with great difficolty. It is more long than broad; and the four corners are fortifi'd with four Bastions, or Bulwarks, between which are rais'd several Towers, for the Souldiers Lodgings. That Fortress is the Royal Prison, whither the King sends such Prisoners as he takes in war, or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes by stratagem. I met with two there, one a Prince of <hi>Georgia,</hi> the other of <hi>Mengrelia.</hi> The two Princes had each of them a Toman a day allow'd them, and ten or twelve Servants to wait upon them. Upon one of the corners of the Castle, toward the West, was built a Banquetting House with three or four Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. In the middle of the Court stands the Magazine, full of Bows and Arrows. Bucklers and Muskets, enough to arm fifteen hundred men. For the Inhabitants of the Province, but more especially of the City of <hi>Lar,</hi> are accounted the best Musqueteers in <hi>Persia,</hi> and the best at making the Barrels of Muskets, all but the Breach, which they know not how to order so well as we. The Governours House answers to the great Road; but there is nothing at all of nearness without, only before the door there is a good handsome Court, about sixty paces square, and clos'd in with Walls, which leads you into two large Bazars of good Stone, very well arch'd.</p>
                     <p>The most part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Lar</hi> are Jews, who are famous for several Silk Manufactures, especially for making neat Girdles. The Countrimen were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads a kind of a felt of fine wool, and very well wrought. It resembles a Cap not yet shap'd, with four Corners behind, and cut on the sides; and these sorts of Caps are made at <hi>Kerman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are an infinite number of Cisterns, as well within the City, as in the parts adjacent; and all but little enough, in regard that sometimes it does not Rain for three years together. When the Rains fall they do nor fill their Cisterns the first day, but rather cover them quite up, till the earth be well soak'd. Now for the distribution of this water they take an excellent course; for they never keep open above three Cisterns at a time; and when they do op'n them, the Governour or some other person appointed for that purpose, is present; so precious is water
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106224:143"/>
in that place, though never so bad. The water thus standing in the Cisterns some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for many years together, breads worms, so that whither you strain it, or boil it, there will appear a kind of foulness in it, which is the seed of these worms. And this corruption it is that breeds worms in the legs and feet of men; which puts me in mind, that after my return to <hi>Paris,</hi> the fifth time of my travelling, I had one came out of my left foot an Ell an a half long, and another from under the ankle of my right foot half an Ell long.</p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>April</hi> I set out from <hi>Lar</hi> by five in the morning, and travell'd till three in the afternoon, through a barren stony Country, except it were only one Village call'd <hi>Tcherkah;</hi> near to which I met with some Corn-land, and several Palm-trees. I lodg'd at a little Inn call'd <hi>Shamzenghi.</hi> It is low, built like a Cross, with four doors to receive the cool winds every way. All the Inns are built in this fashion between this and <hi>Bander,</hi> and near to one another for the ease of Travellers. As for the Beasts, they lye without, for they have no Stables. All the Houses from <hi>Lar</hi> to <hi>Ormus</hi> are built after one manner. For there is a kind of a Pipe, like a Chimney, that runs from the bottom to the top to gather wind.</p>
                     <p>The second I left <hi>Shamzenghi</hi> about four in the afternoon, because the heat is cool'd by a gentle breeze toward the evening. Three hours I travell'd through a barren Plain, afterwards over most fearful Rocks, and about ten at night I came to <hi>Cormout,</hi> a great Village well stor'd with Palm-trees.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Lar</hi> to <hi>Cormout</hi> is the worst way in all <hi>Persia.</hi> For many times there is no water to be found.</p>
                     <p>The third, I parted from <hi>Cormout</hi> a little after midnight; and having travell'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hours in very bad way, full of great stones and filthy puddles, I came to a new Inn call'd <hi>Tenquidalen.</hi> In the middle of it is a little vase of running water, fed by a little stream that falls from the Mountain. But the water being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing brackish, they have since that built a very fair Cistern. They also broach'd the Mountain to bring the water into a Plain, which was barren before, but is now fruitful, and beautifi'd with two good Villages. This was done by a rich Merchant, whose Children enjoy the Revenues of both.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, I set forward an hour after midnight, and travell'd through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited Countrey, full of wide Torrents when the rain falls. There are but two small Inns upon the Road, and about eight in the morning I arriv'd at that which they call <hi>Gourba-Sarghant.</hi> It was built with the Money which a Merchant of <hi>Ormus</hi> left for that purpose; whose strength fail'd him in that very place, for want of a resting place. This Inn is not far from a Village that stands upon the Mountain to the North.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, setting out a little after midnight, I travell'd till seven in the morning through a dry and desert Countrey, yet stor'd with Lentisk-trees, and lay at a good Village call'd <hi>Cauvrestan,</hi> where the people were mowing large Fields of Barly. Here, if the Inn be full, you may lye at the Countrey-mens Houses, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to entertain Travellers, and get well by it. This place is famous for water-Melons, as big as our Pumpkins; and are the best in all <hi>Persia.</hi> The meat is very red, and as sweet as Sugar, which is a great refreshment to Travellers. The <hi>Ketonter</hi> of the place gave me two Raddishes, one weighing 30, the other 45 pounds, and were very good meat.</p>
                     <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> I set out after midnight, and travell'd till it was day through plains of Sand, over which it is impossible to find the way without a guide. About three a Clock in the morning I cross'd over two Bridges joyn'd together by a long Causey. Before I came to the first, I rode over another for a good quarter of a league, which Causey runs on a great way to the second Bridg, under which flows a salt River; the shoar of which is full of moving sands; so that before those Bridges were made, it was dangerous to foard it without a guide.</p>
                     <p>This Causey and the two Bridges were made and built by a <hi>Persian,</hi> whose name was <hi>Aly;</hi> who wanting employment at home, apply'd himself to the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> who lik'd him so well, that he made him General of his Army. Being thus advanc'd, he also turn'd Merchant, and trading first with one Vessel, then with two, got a great Estate. At length, all that he had thus got in forty years, to get himself a name in <hi>Persia,</hi> he employ'd in making this Causey and the two Bridges.</p>

These Bridges are both built over a River that comes from toward <hi>Kerman,</hi> and is swell'd by other streams that fall from the Mountains with a great noise, and discharges it self into the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, neer to <hi>Bander-Congo;</hi> but becomes brackish by passing through Mountains that are nothing but Salt.</p>
                     <p>From the great Bridg to <hi>Guitchi</hi> is one of the most pleasant Countries in all <hi>Persia,</hi> being a continu'd Grove. <hi>Guitchi</hi> is a place accommodated with two Inns, one a very fair one, and convenient; the other very ill seated, by reason of the dust that continually annoys it, standing upon a sandy ground. It stands neer ten or twelve <hi>Arabian</hi> Tents; so that as soon as you come to the Inn, the <hi>Arabian</hi> Women presently bring Milk and Butter, and other refreshments.</p>
                     <p>A league and a half from <hi>Guitchi</hi> you meet with two Roads, one upon the left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that seems more beaten, the other upon the right. There a man may easily be deceiv'd that has no guides. For the left-hand way is a dangerous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and a kind of a continu'd Labyrinth among Rocks and Precipices. The right-hand way, which is the best, is all upon the sand to <hi>Bander-Abassi,</hi> and is usually a days journey. You meet with two Inns by the way, the last of which is call'd <hi>Bend-Ali,</hi> built by the Sea-side.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ben-Ali</hi> to <hi>Bander-Abassi,</hi> is but a little more then two leagues through a Countrey abounding in Palm-trees.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of the Island of <hi>Ormus,</hi> and of <hi>Bander-Abassi.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ORmus</hi> is an Island in 92. <hi>d.</hi> 42. <hi>m.</hi> of Longitude, and in 25. <hi>d.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. It lies at the mouth of the <hi>Persian Gulph,</hi> two good Leagues from the firm Land. There is neither tree nor herb that grows in it: for it is all over cover'd with Salt, which is very good and as white as snow. And as for the black shining Sand-dust of <hi>Ormus,</hi> it is very much us'd for standishes.</p>
                     <p>Before the <hi>Portugueses</hi> came to <hi>Ormus,</hi> there was a City where the Kings of <hi>Ormus,</hi> who were also Kings of <hi>Larr,</hi> resided. When the <hi>Portugals</hi> took it, there were in it two young Princes, Sons of the deceased King, whom they carri'd into <hi>Spain.</hi> Where, in regard they were handsomely proportion'd, though somewhat swarthy, the King entertain'd them very kindly, and gave them an honourable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. One day that he had shew'd them the <hi>Escurial</hi> and all the chief pieces of Architecture in <hi>Madrid,</hi> the King ask'd them what they thought of living in <hi>Spain.</hi> To whom they answer'd, that they had seen nothing but what was worthy admiration, but then fetching a deep sigh, and perceiving the King desirous to know the meaning of it, they gave him to understand that it was for grief that they must never more sit under their own Tree. For near to the City of <hi>Ormus</hi> was a <hi>Bannians</hi> tree, being the only tree that grew in the Island.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> being masters of the Island from an ill-built City, rear'd it to that hight of Magnificence which that Nation admires; so that the very barrs of their doors and windows were all guilt. The Fortress was a noble thing, and in good repair: and they had also a stately Church dedicated to the Virgin, where they were also wont to walk. For other place of promenading they had none. Since the <hi>Persians</hi> took it, the Castle indeed stands in good repair, with a Garrison in it: but the City is gone to ruine; for the Dutch carried most of the stones away to build <hi>Battavia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between the Island of <hi>Ormus,</hi> and the Continent the Sea is not very deep; for the great ships that sail in and out of the <hi>Gulf,</hi> pass by the other side of the Island. As for the Fortress which stands upon a poynt of the Island, it is almost encompass'd with the Sea, and lyes right over against <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bander Abassi,</hi> so call'd because the great <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> the first brought it into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, is at present a City reasonably well built, and stor'd with large ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, over which are the lodgings of the Merchants. While the <hi>Portugueses</hi> kept <hi>Ormus,</hi> though they liv'd in the City, all the trade was at <hi>Bandar-Abassi,</hi> as being the most secure Landing-place upon all the Coast. About 15 years ago it was an op'n town, but because it was an easie thing then to get into the Town, and rob
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106224:144"/>
the Custome-house in the night, it has bin since enclos'd with walls. To this place come all the ships that bring Commodities from <hi>India</hi> for <hi>Persia, Turkie,</hi> or any part of <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Europe.</hi> And indeed it would be much more frequented by the Merchants from all Regions and Countries.</p>
                     <p>But the Air of <hi>Bander</hi> is so unwholesome and so hot, that no strangers can live there, in probability of health, unless it be in the months of <hi>December, January, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> and <hi>March;</hi> though the Natives of the Country may perhaps stay without prejudice to the end of <hi>April.</hi> After that they retire to the cooler Mountains, two or three days journey off, for five or six months, where they eat what they gain'd before. They that venture to stay at <hi>Gomron</hi> during the hot weather, get a malignant Fever, which if they scape death, is hardly ever cur'd. However it bequeaths the yellow Jaundies during life to the party. <hi>March</hi> being pass'd the wind changes, and blowing at west south west, in a short time it grows so hot and so stifling, that it almost takes away a mans breath. This wind is by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> call'd <hi>El-Samiel,</hi> or the poysonous wind, by the <hi>Persians Bade-Sambour,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it suffocates and kills presently. The flesh of them that are thus stifl'd feels like a glewie fat, and as if they had been dead a month before.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1632. riding from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Bagdat,</hi> I and four more <hi>Persian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants had bin stifl'd but for some <hi>Arabians</hi> that were in our Company. For when they perceiv'd the wind, they caus'd us to light, lye down upon our bellies and cover our selves with our Cloaks. We lay so for half an hour, and then rising we saw our horses were in such a sweat, that they were hardly able to carry us. This happen'd to us two days journey from <hi>Bagdat.</hi> But this is observable, that if a man be in a Boat upon the water when the same wind blows, it does no harm though he were naked at the same time. Sometimes the wind is so hot that it burns like Lightning.</p>
                     <p>And as the Air of <hi>Gomron</hi> is so bad and dangerous, the soil is worth nothing: For it is nothing but Sand, nor is the water in the Cisterns very good. They that will be at the charge fetch their water from a fountain three leagues from <hi>Bander,</hi> call'd the water of <hi>Issin.</hi> Formerly there was not an herb to be seen: but by often watering the ground, Lettice, Radish and Onions have begun to grow.</p>
                     <p>The People are swarthy, and wear nothing about them but only a single shirt. Their usual dyet is dates and fish. Which is almost the dyet of their Cattel, for when they come home from browsing the barren bushes, they give them the heads and guts of their fish boyl'd, with the kernels of the Dates which they eat.</p>
                     <p>The Sea of <hi>Bander</hi> produces good Soles, good Smelts and Pilchards. They that will have oysters must have 'em caught on purpose, for the people eat none.</p>
                     <p>Upon Land they want neither for wine of <hi>Schiras</hi> nor <hi>Yesd;</hi> nor for Mutton, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Partridge, which are their ordinary dyet.</p>
                     <p>There are two Fortresses, one upon the East, the other toward the West. The Town increases in trade and building, and fills with inhabitants, who build their houses with the remaining ruins of <hi>Ormus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason why the Trade is settl'd rather at <hi>Bander Abassi,</hi> then at <hi>Bander Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> where the Air is good and the Water excellent, is because that between <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Congo</hi> lie several Islands, which make the passage for ships dangerous, besides that the often change and veering of the wind is requir'd: neither indeed is there water enough for a Vessel of 20 or 25 guns. Then the way from <hi>Congo</hi> to <hi>Lar</hi> is very bad. From <hi>Bander Abassi</hi> to <hi>Lar</hi> it is very good, and provided with good Inns.</p>
                     <p>From the day that a Merchant takes up mony at <hi>Gomron,</hi> he is bound to return it in three months, and the change goes from six to twelve <hi>per Cent.</hi> When the Goods come to <hi>Ispahan</hi> or any other place, the Merchant is not to touch them, till he has pay'd the money which he borrow'd, unless the Creditor will trust him farther. Some <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants take up money at <hi>Gomron</hi> to pay it at <hi>Suratt;</hi> where they take up other money for <hi>Ispahan;</hi> at <hi>Ispahan</hi> for <hi>Erzerom</hi> or <hi>Bagdat,</hi> paying the old debt with the new sums, which they take up in each place. The money taken up at <hi>Erzerom</hi> is pal'd at <hi>Bursa, Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Money taken up at <hi>Bagdat</hi> is pai'd at <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I always made accompt, that to take up money at <hi>Golconda</hi> for <hi>Ligorn</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> at change for change, the money returns at the cheapest rate, to 95 <hi>per Cent.</hi> but more oftentimes it amounts to a hunder'd.</p>

                     <p>The City of <hi>Candahar</hi> is the chief of one of the Conquer'd Provinces of <hi>Persia,</hi> having been often the occasion of war between the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> At length <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> became Master of it, the Prince that then raign'd there, choosing to put himself under the Protection of the King of <hi>Persia</hi> rather then of great <hi>Mogull:</hi> but upon this condition, that the Governour should be always one of his race. And therefore <hi>Alimerdan-Kan</hi> was the Son of the last Prince of <hi>Candahar.</hi> That Prince left behind him such a vast Treasury, that his Plate
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106224:145"/>
was all of Gold, and he had so much Gold in his Coffers, that when he went to the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> he would not accept of any thing for his maintenance, but contented himself with one of the highest Dignities in the Empire, which he enjoy'd till his death. At <hi>Jehanabad</hi> he built a most neat House, with a fair Garden upon the River.</p>
                     <p>He got his wealth in some measure, for the greatest part came by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, by the great advantages which he made of the <hi>Caravans</hi> that then pass'd oft'ner through <hi>Candahar</hi> then they do now adays. For by delaying the Merchants at the Custome-house, and by treating them himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving treatments from them again, he caus'd them to spend their Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they were forc'd to recruit again at <hi>Candahar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grand <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> left the peaceable Possession of <hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Sha-Sefi</hi> his Grand-child. In whose time <hi>Alimerdan-Kan</hi> deliver'd it up to the Great <hi>Mogul. Sha Abbas</hi> the Second retook it in the year 1650. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Sha-gehan</hi> sent his eldest Son to drive him out. But though his Army consisted of three hundred thousand men, yet the place was so well defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he lost the best part of his Army before it. The next year <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jehan</hi> sent another Army under the Command of <hi>Sultan-Sujah,</hi> but he had no better success then his Brother. Thereupon <hi>Begum Saheb, Sha-jehan's</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Daughter, and passionately belov'd by him even to Incest, bearing the greatest sway in the Kingdom, and having a vast Treasure, rais'd an Army at her own charges, and made <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> Commander of it. After many as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> discoursing with his Generals one day who should have the honour if he took the City, and being told that his Sister would have the honour in regard she had rais'd the Army, the Prince either jealous of his Sister, or else not loath to give occasion of being envy'd by his Brothers, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted it no more, and when the rains came, rais'd his siege.</p>

                     <p>Thus I have finish'd the most considerable Observations as well in reference to <hi>Turkie</hi> as to <hi>Persia.</hi> I have been curious to understand things, and have lookt with a strict eye upon them: and I am oblig'd to inform the Reader, that he must not travel into <hi>Asia,</hi> in expectation of mending his experience in any of the nobler Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Goldsmiths work, or Turning. As for the Coverlets, Embroideries, Tissues of Gold and Silver, which are made in <hi>Persia,</hi> and which we admir'd formerly in <hi>France,</hi> all these give place to our new manufactures. Insomuch that the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves admire the rich goods of <hi>Europe,</hi> and when we carry any thither, they are immediately bought up by the King and the Nobility. They neither understand any thing of Architecture: nor is there any thing in all <hi>Asia</hi> that equalls the Riches and Beauty of the <hi>Loure,</hi> or of any other of the Kings houses in <hi>France,</hi> which infinitely excell in workmanship all the magnificence of the Eastern Monarchs. Which has made me with astonishment admire that so many Travellers have ascrib'd to <hi>Persia</hi> and other Regions of <hi>Asia,</hi> those beauties for which they were never beholding either to Art or Nature. For if all they have said had been true, those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could never have escaped my sight; and I dare assure the Reader that I have describ'd the naked truth of things as really they are.</p>

And twenty Sous make a Livre.</note> Larin, and signities the same with our Crowns. The Five Pieces are as much in value as one of our Crowns; and the Ten Half-Larins as much. Only the Five Larins want in weight Eight Sous of our Crown. This is that which the <hi>Emirs,</hi> or Princes of <hi>Arabia</hi> take for the Coining of their Money; and the profit which they make by the Merchants that travel through the Desart, either into <hi>Persia</hi> or the <hi>Indies.</hi> For then the <hi>Emirs</hi> come to the <hi>Caravans,</hi> to take their Tolls, and to change their Crowns, Reals, or Ducats of Gold, for these Larins. For they must of necessity pass that way. And they must use very smooth words to boot; for there is nothing to be got by rough Languages. If they see the Merchants will not change their Money, then will they refuse to take their Toll; but making as if they had not time to cast up the accompt, they go a hunting, and leave the Merchants fifteen or twenty days without saying any thing more to them; while they in the mean time spend their provisions, not knowing where to get more. If the <hi>Caravan</hi> goes on without paying their Tolls, these <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince's will either cut them in pieces, or take away their Camels, or rob them of all they have, as they have several times done. In one Journey that I made, one of these Princes kept us one and twenty days; after which we thought our selves happy to be quit of him, when we had given him whatever he demanded. If these five Larins did but weigh as much as the Crown, or Real of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Merchants would never be much troubled. But when they come to <hi>Persia,</hi> or the <hi>Indies,</hi> they must carry their Money to the Mint, as I have said in another place, and loose above eight Sous in a Crown, which amounts to 14 <hi>per Cent.</hi> As for what remains, the Larins are one of the ancient Coins

of <hi>Asia;</hi> and though at this day they are only currant in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and at <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sara,</hi> nevertheless, from <hi>Bragdatt</hi> to the Island of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> they traffick altogether with the Larin, and all along the <hi>Persian Golf;</hi> where they take 80 Larins for one <hi>Toman,</hi> which is 50 <hi>Abassi's.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>ALL the Gold and Silver which is brought into the Territories of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> is refined to the highest perfection before it be coined into Money.</p>
                     <p>The Roupy of Gold weighs 2 Drams and a half, and 11 Grains, and is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued in the Country at 14 Roupies of Silver. We reckon the Roupy of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at 30 Sous. So that a Roupy of Gold comes to 21 Livres of <hi>France;</hi> and an Ounce of Gold to 58 Livres, and 4 Deneer's. This Gold is like that which we buy at 54 Livres an Ounce. And if you bring this Gold in Ingots, or Ducats of <hi>European</hi> Gold, you shall have always 7 and a half profit; if you can scape paying any thing to the Custom-houses. The Half-Roupy comes to 10 Livres 10 Sous; and the Quarter-Roupy to 5 Livres 5 Sous. As I have said, you must reckon the Silver Roupy at 30 Sous, though it weigh not above 3 Drams; whereas our pieces of 30 Sous weigh 3 Drams, and half 4 grains; but the Roupy is much the better Silver. In a word, they that understand Traffick well, and carry hence Gold or Silver to the Territories of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> get always 7 or 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> profit, provided they take care to shun the Custom-houses. For if you pay them, the 7 or 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which you might make profit, goes to them; and so the Roupy comes to 30 Sous, the Half to 15, and the Quarter to 7 and a half, the Eighth part to 3 Sous and 9 Deneers.</p>
                     <p>As for their Copper Money, sometimes 'tis worth more, sometimes less, as Copper comes to the Mint. But generally the biggest sort is worth 2 Sous of our Money, the next 1 Sous, the next to that 6 Deneers.</p>
                     <p>As for their Shell Money, the nearer you go to the Sea, the more you give for a Pecha; for they bring them from <hi>Maldives.</hi> Fifty or 60 of these make a Pecha, which is that piece of Coin that is worth but 6 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer's.</p>
                     <p>For their Money of Mamoudi's, half Mamoudi's, and Almonds, all that sort of Money is only currant in the Province of <hi>Guzeratt,</hi> the principal Cities whereof are <hi>Surat, Barocha, Cambaya, Broudra,</hi> and <hi>Amadabat.</hi> Five Mamoudi's go for a Crown, or a Real. For small Money they make no use of these Shells, but of little Almonds, which are brought from about <hi>Ormus,</hi> and grow in the Desarts of the Kingdom of <hi>Larr.</hi> If you break one of the Shells, it is impossible to eat the Almond, for there is no <hi>Coloquintida</hi> so bitter; so that there is no fear least the Children should eat their small Money. They have also those little pieces of Copper which are call'd Pecha, 6 Deneer's in value. They give 20 for a Mamoudi, and 40 Almonds for a Pecha; sometimes you may have 44, according to the quantity which is brought. For some years the Trees do not bear, and then the price of this sort of Money is very much raised in that Country; and the Bankers know how to make their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>

They have excellent Corn, and Grapes, but they make on Wine, though they make some <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> They want neither Oxen nor Cows; but their Horses are little, weak, and ill-shap'd. All the Trade which these people have with their Neighbours, is in Copper, whereof they have two extraordinary Mines, from whence they furnish the greatest part of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Territories; out of which they have Salt in Exchange, not having any of their own. This Salt costs them dear, in regard it is four months tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to the place where they fetch it, that is to say, from the Territories of <hi>Maton-cha</hi> to the <hi>Indian</hi> Coast towards <hi>Bacaim.</hi> They travel upon Oxen, and the same Oxen carry their Copper.

He lays also a great Imposition upon Salt, as well that which is spent by his own Subjects, as upon that which is carried abroad. This is all Sea-coast Salt, which comes from the Territories of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and is brought from the Sea-coast to <hi>Ganges,</hi> and so over <hi>Ganges</hi> is carried as far as the fiftieth and five and fiftieth Degree.

They are as heavy as the new ones; and though they be no better Gold, yet some years since they went at 20, and 25 <hi>per cent.</hi> more than the new ones; the reason is, for that the Bankers being all Idolaters, they are so superstitious as to believe, that if they melt down that Money, some calamity will befall their Country; and they hold this for such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, that for fear the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> should melt it, they paid him for certain years 20000 Pagods. But you must observe, that these old Pagods are no-where currant but in the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda.</hi> For my part, I think it is more for their profit than out of any superstition, that they make use of them in that manner. For in all the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> in matter of trade, they never mention any but the old Pagods, though they make their payments in new Pagods, or Roupies; and in this case they who receive those new Pagods, or those Roupies, play their game so well, that they gain a fourth part, or a half, and sometimes one <hi>per Cent.</hi> alledging for the reason, that those new Pagods are either the King of <hi>Visapour</hi>'s, or the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Carnatica</hi>'s, or the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Velouche</hi>'s, or the <hi>English,</hi> or the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> And they make as much of the Roupies; for there is no considerable payment made, which is not received by the <hi>Cheraff</hi> or Banker, making it good to the Seller, who sometimes has no need of his Money in a month or two, and so he receives the interest of it, though it be but for two days. If the payment be made in old Pagods, and that the sum amount to two or three hundred, or three or four thousand, the Banker takes them all, and viewing them one after another, he divides them into five or six parts; and then poising them all, he says of some, that they are more us'd than others, and that having passed through many hands, there is a waste of the mettal about one <hi>per Cent.</hi> Others, says he, want not above half one <hi>per Cent.</hi> others but a fourth part. These Pagods have been bor'd some half tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, others a quarter thorough; and it is a wonderful thing what this boring amounts to. For in regard these Pagods are very thick, and cannot be clipt, those that are Masters of the trade, take a Piercer, and pierce the Pagod tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the side, half way or more, taking out of one piece as much Gold as comes to two or three Sous. And provided they be not taken in the fact, they chuse rather to follow this trade than any other; there being no handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft tradesmen among the <hi>Indians,</hi> that gain more than three Sous a day. After they have drawn out the piercer, they knock upon the holes with a little hammer, and are so cunning in closing up the holes again, that he must be very skilful indeed, that can discover the cheat. For this reason, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive any payment till they have shew'n the Pieces to the <hi>Cheraff</hi> or Banker; and though he looks only on two or three Pieces, he takes a Sous. They have also another cunning trick, and the more the Banker is in credit,

the more he gains; for if he makes any payment, according to the quantity of the sum, he puts the Pagods by fifty or a hundred together in little bags, and seals them up with his Seal, and writes upon the bag the number of the Pagods within; and so delivers them to him to whom he makes the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the party makes use of them, he never opens the bag, but gives them as they are, to him to whom they are due; who goes to the same Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker that seal'd the bags. The Banker seeing his Seal whole, makes answer, that the Pieces are good, and in that manner they shall pass all the year without opening the bags. But when ever they change the hand, they send for the same Banker, who always will have so much <hi>per Cent.</hi> for his visit. But as I have said, the Merchant leaves them in his hand to get interest; who then pays eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> for a year, and sometimes twelve. Thus the Bankers have always the greatest part of the Money in the Kingdom in their hands, of which they make large profit. 'Tis the custom in that Country, every Month to pay the Soldiery; but for the most part, the Soldiers, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and other Officers will not stay still the Month be up, but come to the Bankers, who discount after the rate of eighteen or twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> by the year, besides that they pay them in these Pagods, against which others would often object. If there be any large Diamond to be sold in any Country, these Bankers have intelligence of it presently; or if there be any fair Ruby, 'tis not long before they have it in pawn; for every year when the Merchants return from <hi>Pegu,</hi> and have any Rubies, most commonly they are in debt; and in regard it is the custom to pay within fifteen days after the Merchant comes ashoar, he pawns his best goods he has for payment, as well of the freight of the Ship, as of what he may have taken up at <hi>Pegu.</hi> After that he sells the worst of his goods to pay the Banker, who lent him the Money upon his arrival. Those that work in the Diamond Mines, or the Merchants that hire the Mine, when they have any fair Stones, they sell them to these Bankers, because there is ready Money; or else they pawn them to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, till they can find a Chapman to buy them.</p>

since the present King of <hi>England</hi> married the Princess of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who had in part of her Portion the famous Port of <hi>Bombeye,</hi> where the <hi>English</hi> are very hard at work to build a strong Fort, they coin both Silver, Copper, and Tinn. But that Money will not go at <hi>Surat,</hi> nor in any part of the Great <hi>Mogul's</hi> Dominions, or in any of the Territories of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings; only it passes among the <hi>English</hi> in their Fort, and some two or three Leagues up in the Country, and in the Villages along the Coast; the Country people that bring them their Wares, being glad to take that Money; otherwise they would see but very little stirring, in regard the Country is very poor, and the people have nothing to sell but <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> made of Coco-Wine and Rice.</p>

I made this observation, being at the Diamond-Mines, and in other parts of the <hi>Indies</hi> where there is any great Trade.

It has in the middle upon one side the mark of the <hi>Holland</hi> Company, to distinguish it from others. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> Roupies of Silver are quite contrary to their Pagods of Gold, which are more esteemed by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> than those of the Princes of the Country. For they make far less account of these Roupies of Silver; and if you pay any great sum in these pieces, though the Silver be as good as the others, you must lose one half <hi>per Cent.</hi>

Now they shun that loss, and make the same profit which the Bankers did, coining all these mettals into money. Though in every Voyage which they make to <hi>Japan,</hi> they generally lose one Vessel by storm; yet some years they make five or six Millions of Livres profit, all freights discharged, and hazards escaped.

                     <head>Lumps or Pieces of Gold and Silver which go for Money in the Kingdom of <hi>China;</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>YOu are first to take notice, that in all the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> there is no Money coin'd, either Gold or Silver, that their small Money is Copper, and that they make use in payments only of Lumps or Pieces of Gold and Silver, which have every one their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar weight, as is here'represented.</p>
                     <p>The Pieces of Gold mark'd <hi>Fig.</hi> 1, and 2. are by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> call'd <hi>Golt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schut,</hi> that is to say, a Boat of Gold, because they are in the form of a Boat. Other Nations call them Loaves of Gold; and there are but two different sizes of them. The Gold is of such a goodness, that an Ounce in <hi>France</hi> would not be worth less than 42 Franks. The great Pieces come to twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gelders of <hi>Holland</hi> Money, and thirteen hundred and fifty Livres of our Money. The other Piece, which weighs but half as much, is in value accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its proportion.</p>
                     <p>As for their Pieces of Silver, they are of several sizes, and different weight. <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. weighs six Drams and a half, and 23 Grains; and the Silver being

very near in goodness to the <hi>Parisian,</hi> it comes to fifty-nine Sous, and eight Deneers of our Money. The other Pieces, as well great as small, are in value according to their weight.</p>
                     <p>In great payments they make use of <hi>Ingots,</hi> that come to a hundred <hi>Franks</hi> in value; and they have little Pieces of Silver that are not worth above a Sous.</p>
                     <p>When they buy any Commodity, if they have not whole Pieces enough to make up the sum, they have always instruments ready, to cut off so much from a great piece as will perfect the payment.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Chineses</hi> transport their Golden Loaves, or their Boats, into other Countries, the Merchants cut them in the middle, not daring to trust the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> who have often deceiv'd them; and none have been more cheated than the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> For they have a way to stuff their Loaves of Gold, insomuch that you shall sometimes find in the middle, a third part of Copper or Silver. In all sorts of Bargains the <hi>Chineses</hi> are so cunning, that there are few stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whom they do not over-reach; especially, in <hi>Batavia,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> when they come first. They carry their weights always along with them, being like a <hi>Roman</hi> Beam, or a Stelleer, about eight Inches long, with which they weigh all the Gold and Silver which they receive. As for the small Money both in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tunquum,</hi> it is of Copper. It is made as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. They also thread these pieces, there being a hole in the middle, 12, 25, 50, and 300 upon a string; because they will not put themselves to the trouble of telling them, when the number exceeds a dozen.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SUltan Selim,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Gehanguir Patcha,</hi> the ninth King of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Father of <hi>Cha-gehan,</hi> was a great Lover of Women: but he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection for one among the rest, which he kept in his <hi>Seraglio;</hi> and which he had Espous'd, as meriting more than ordinary. She was a Woman of a Sublime Wit, and very liberal; and she knew so well how to please the King's humour, and to divertize him, that he could not live without her. She had two Names; the one was <hi>Nour-gehan-begum,</hi> which signifies the <hi>light of the World;</hi> and this was the Name which was engraven upon her Signet: for as I have observ'd in my Relations, they never Sign any thing, but only set their Seals. The other Name, by which she was call'd at Court, was <hi>Nour-mahall,</hi> which signifies the <hi>Light of the Seraglio.</hi> She was always a great enemy to the King's two Sons; more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the second, who was called <hi>Sultan Kourom:</hi> and who afterwards coming to the Throne, called himself <hi>Cha-gehan.</hi> He set himself to oppose all the designs of this Princess: who, for her part, had such an Ascendant over the King, that she perswaded him to spend the greatest part of the year in the Country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand soliciting certain <hi>Raja</hi>'s upon the Frontiers to rise against him, that she might engage him in the Wars, and keep him from the company of his Sons. This Queen, being altogether Ambitious, made it her business to please the King, that she might the more easily accomplish her designs; and having a great desire to eternize her Memory, she could not think of a better way, than to Coin a good quantity of Money in her own Name: and of a different stamp from that which the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings were wont to Coin. For you must take notice, that all the Coins of those Kings have only the Characters of the Countrey upon each side of the Piece. But this Queen caus'd one of the twelve Signs to be stamp'd upon upon each side of Hers, which is contrary to the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that forbids all manner of representations. However, she had never brought her design about, had <hi>Sultan Kourom</hi> been at Court. But she took her time, when the King had caus'd the eyes of his eldest Son, <hi>Sultan Kosrou</hi> to be put out, because he had taken up Arms against him, with an intention to depose him from his Throne. For after he had obtain'd that Victory, he sent his second Son, <hi>Sultan Kourom,</hi> into <hi>Decan,</hi>

with a powerful Army against the King of <hi>Visapour,</hi> who was in Rebellion. Queen <hi>Nourmahall</hi> seeing her self deliver'd from those that were able to cross her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and particularly from <hi>Saltan Kourom,</hi> the most Potent, and the most inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate of all her enemies, and believing it seasonable to discover her purpose to the King, set her self to flatter him more than she was wont; inventing new ways to divertize him, sometimes with Hunting, and sometimes in the <hi>Haram,</hi> with Balls and Comedies: One day that the King was extremely well-pleas'd, and having drank briskly, began to be very merry; after the Queen had Danc'd in his presence, he took her, and set her by him, protesting to her, that he lov'd her above all the Princesses in his Court; and that but for her, he had dy'd for grief, to see that his Son <hi>Sultan Kosrou</hi> should be so traiterously bold, as to endeavour to deprive him of his Scepter. The Queen seeing the King so highly affected toward her, fail'd not to make use of so favourable an opportunity. To which purpose, Sir, said she, if it be true that your Majesty has that kindness for me, of which you would perswade me to assure my self, I know you will grant me one favour which I have passionately desir'd a long time; that I may only Reign as Sovereign the space of twenty four hours. This request surpriz'd the King, and kept him very sad for some days, being unwilling to deny her any thing, and yet being as loth to grant her a Boon of so high a nature. In the mean time the Queen ply'd the King with Pastime and Divertisements, pretending to take no notice of his melancholy. At length the fist day after she had made her Petition, the King no longer able to resist her Charms, nor the strong Passion he had for her, told her he would retire for twenty four hours, and that she might assume the absolute Command of the Kingdom during that time. At the same time he caus'd all the Grandees that were then at Court, to be sent for into his presence, and then commanded them to obey her, and punctually to execute her Orders, as if it were he himself that spoke to them. It was a long time before that the Queen had made every thing ready, and that she had secretly hoarded up great quantities of Gold and Silver in all the Cities where the Mints were appointed, and had distributed the Stamps as she thought convenient. And indeed it was a wonderful thing, that a Woman should so politickly carry on so great a design, as to have four and twenty Stamps engrav'd, and to keep in a readiness in Gold and Silver above two Millions in all the Cities, without being discovered to the King, or any of the Court. There were none but the Mint-Masters that knew any thing of her design, whom she engag'd by large promises, and larger hopes; as believing that she could certainly obtain her desire one day of the King; and then, if she had her Materials ready, that she could do her business in twenty four hours. The day being appointed, she sent away Messengers to all the Cities, commanding them on that day to Coin <hi>Roupies</hi> of Gold and Silver, to the value already mention'd. When the King and the Grandees came to understand the business, they were strangely surpriz'd; especially <hi>Sultan Kourom,</hi> the Queens implacable enemy, who, as some persons of the Countrey assur'd me, fainted away at the news, and did not come to himself in a good while after. The thing was so suddenly done, especially in the Cities neer at hand, that within two hours after she was sate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, she caus'd several quantities of that Gold and Silver to be thrown among the people, which during the Reign of <hi>Gehan-guir</hi> went currantly for <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.</hi> But when <hi>Sultan Kourom,</hi> who took upon him the Name of <hi>Cha-gehan</hi> came to the Crown after the death of his Father, he forbad all persons to use those <hi>Roupies</hi> upon pain of death, and commanded all that had any of them, either in Gold or Silver, to carry them to the Mint; where they should receive the value of them, to the end they might be melted down. For which reason they are at present very rare, particularly those in Gold; among the rest, two or three of them are so hard to be found, that an hundred Crowns has been given for one of them. The <hi>Roupies</hi> of Gold are worth one and twenty <hi>Livres</hi> of our Money: and those of Silver, thirty <hi>Sous.</hi> The Queen, during her Reign of twenty four hours, had that respect for the King, that on the back-side of the Pieces whereon the twelve Signs were Engraven, she caus'd the Name of <hi>Gehan-guir</hi> to be stamp'd with her own, and the name of the place where they were Coin'd, all in <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters.</p>

of the <hi>Indians</hi> descended: and therefore for his satisfaction, I will tell him in a few words. Her Father, a <hi>Persian</hi> by Nation, a man naturally Ambitious, and who in his own Country was no more than a bare Captain of Horse, without any hopes of rising to any higher preferment, travel'd into the <hi>Indies,</hi> to serve the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> who was then <hi>Gehan-guir,</hi> with an intention of raising his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in a strange Country. <hi>Gehan-guir</hi> had then many Enemies, the Kings of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour</hi> being in Rebellion against him, and several <hi>Raja's</hi> having taken their part. So soon as he came to kiss the Kings Hands, the King took a liking to him, and gave him immediately the Command of five hundred Horse. And because he was very well skill'd in Astrology, (which is a Science to which the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> are very much addicted) the King esteem'd him the more, and in a short time made him General of his Army. But afterwards, forgetting his duty, and the benefits he had received, he join'd with <hi>Sultan Kosrou, guir</hi>'s eldest Son; and having gain'd a great part of the Army, they conspir'd together to depose the King, and set up his Son in his stead. There was at that time in the Court, an <hi>Eunuch</hi> of great wit, who did more mischief to the Army in his Closet, than he could have done in the Field. This <hi>Eunuch,</hi> so soon as intelligence was brought of the Rebellion, told the King, that if his Majesty pleas'd, he would deliver <hi>Kosrou</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral into his hands in a short time, without so much as striking one stroke, or losing one man. He was as good as his word in part, for he so order'd his business, by his politick contrivances, that the General was brought to the King, who would not presently put him to death. <hi>Sultan Kosrou</hi> escap'd that bout, and continu'd the War many years against his Father, who at length took him in Fight, and caus'd his eyes to be pull'd out. The King detaining the General in custody, his Wife and his Daughter found a way to save his life, as you shall hear. The Daughter of the <hi>Persian</hi> General, who was his only Child, was about fourteen years of Age, the most accomplish'd Beauty at that time in all the Kingdom; she was most rarely educated, and could both write and read the <hi>Arabian, Persian,</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Languages. The Mother and the Daughter went every day to Court, to hear what would become of the General; and understanding at length, that the King intended either to put him to death, or to banish him, they came to the <hi>Haram,</hi> and casting themselves at his Majesties feet, they humbly begg'd pardon, the one for her Husband, the other for her Father; which they easily obtain'd; the King being surpriz'd at the Beauty of the Virgin, to whom he afterwards surrender'd his Affections. All the Court was astonish'd afterwards, how the General and his Wife could keep, so private, a Daughter that was so incomparably fair, that it should not come to the Kings knowledg. At length he lov'd her so tenderly, that not being able to deny her the liberty of Reigning one whole day in his place, he gave her leave to share with him afterwards in the Government. And she it was, that gave motion to all the most important Affairs of State; the King excusing himself to the Grandee's of his Court, who wonder'd why he let the Queen bear so great a sway, by telling them, that she was fit for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that it was time for him to take his ease.</p>

                     <p>I Have observed in my Relations, that in all parts of our <hi>Europe,</hi> where they Coin Money, there are great Sums transported all over <hi>Asia,</hi> where they go currantly. But for the Money of <hi>Muscovy</hi> there is great loss in transporting it any where else; because the Prince enhances it to so high a value. The pieces as well of Gold as Silver are very good Metal; for the Gold in worth is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher than our <hi>Lewis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 1 and 2. This piece of Gold weighs 14 Grains; and to take the Gold at 48 Grains the Ounce, would amount to 20 Sous, one Deneer, and one half-peny of our Money. But going in <hi>Muscovy</hi> for 24 Sous, there would be nineteen and an half loss to transport it any where else.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 3 and 4. Is a piece of Silver that weighs eight Grains; and to take an Ounce of Silver at three Livres ten Sous, it comes to a Sous of our Money. But in the Countrey you have but fifty of these pieces, or at most sometimes fifty two for one of our Crowns, or a Real of <hi>Spain,</hi> or an <hi>High-German</hi> Rixdollar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 5 and 6. Is a piece of Silver also which only goes in <hi>Muscovy.</hi> But I cannot tell in what Province it is Coin'd, in regard there are no Arms upon it, and that the most knowing persons, to whom I shewed them, could not tell me what the Characters meant; which makes me think it is very ancient. The piece weighs 25 Grains, which comes to three of our Sous, one Deneer, and one half-peny.</p>
                     <p>This is all that I could collect of most certainty, concerning the Money and Coins of the East, during the long course of my Travels. Nor do I believe that any person has undertaken, before me, to write upon the same Subject. If any one of my Readers desires to see the real Pieces themselves, as well in Gold and Silver, as in Tin, Copper, Shells and Almonds, he may, without question, obtain the Favour from <hi>Monsieur,</hi> the first President, to whose Study I devoted them all, together with certain Medals, of which that Supreme Senator, most skilful in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, has great store, being still curious in searching after what is rare.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN this Relation of my <hi>Indian,</hi> I will observe the same Method as in the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of my <hi>Persian</hi> Travels; and begin with the description of the Roads, which lead you from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Dehly</hi> and <hi>Gehanadatt,</hi> where the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi> Resides at present.</p>
                        <p>Though the <hi>Indies</hi> stretch themselves front <hi>Persia</hi> for the space of above 400 Leagues together, from the Ocean to that long Chain of Mountains that runs through the middle of <hi>Asia</hi> from the East to the West, and which was known to Antiquity by the Name of <hi>Mount Caucasus,</hi> or <hi>Mount Taurus;</hi> yet there are not so many ways to travel out of <hi>Persia</hi> into the <hi>Indies,</hi> as there are to travel out of <hi>Turky</hi> into <hi>Persia;</hi> by reason that between <hi>Persia</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> there are nothing but vast Sands and Desarts, where there is no water to be found. So that you have but two Roads to choose, in going from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Agra.</hi> The one is partly by Land, and partly by Sea; taking Ship at <hi>Ormus.</hi> The other altogether by Land, through <hi>Candahar.</hi> The first of these two Roads is amply describ'd, as far as <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> at the end of my first Book of my <hi>Persian Travels.</hi> So that I am now only to speak of the manner of Sailing from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Suratt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no Sailing at all times upon the <hi>Indian</hi> as upon the <hi>European</hi> Seas: You must observe the proper seasons, which being elaps'd, there is no more ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing. The Months of <hi>November, December, January, February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> are the only Months in the year to Embark from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Suratt;</hi> and from <hi>Suratt</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106224:163"/>
to <hi>Ormus:</hi> But with this difference, that there is no stirring from <hi>Suratt</hi> after the end of <hi>February;</hi> but you may Sail from <hi>Ormus</hi> till the end of <hi>March,</hi> or the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>April:</hi> For then the Western-winds, that bring rain along with them into <hi>India,</hi> begin to blow. During the first four Months there blows a North-east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, which carries them from <hi>Suratt</hi> to <hi>Ormus</hi> in fifteen or twenty days. Then veering a little to the North, it serves as well for those that are bound for <hi>Suratt,</hi> as those that are bound from thence. Then the Merchants generally provide for a Voyage of thirty, or five and thirty days. But if they would Sail from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Suratt</hi> in fourteen or fifteen days, they must take Shipping either in <hi>March,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>April;</hi> for then the Western-wind blows full in their Stern.</p>
                        <p>The Vessels which Sail from <hi>Ormus</hi> run within sight of <hi>Mascate</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> bearing off to Sea for fear of coming too near the <hi>Persian</hi> Coast. They that come from <hi>Suratt,</hi> do the same thing, to make the Entry of the Gulf. But neither the one nor the other touch at <hi>Mascate,</hi> to avoid paying Customs to an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, who took that place from the <hi>Portugals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mascate</hi> is a City situated just by the Sea-side, over against three Rocks that make the Entry into the Harbour very difficult, and at the foot of a Mountain upon which the <hi>Portugals</hi> have three or four Forts. It is observed that <hi>Mascate, Ormus,</hi> and <hi>Balsara,</hi> are the three places in the East where the heat is most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable. Formerly only the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>English</hi> understood this Course of Navigation; but some years after the <hi>Armonians, Mahometans, Indians,</hi> and <hi>Banians,</hi> have built them Vessels. But it is not so safe to Embark in them, for they neither understand the Sea so well, nor are they so good Pilots.</p>
                        <p>The Vessels that Sail to <hi>Suratt,</hi> which is the only Part in the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> Sail within fight of <hi>Diu,</hi> and the <hi>Point</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and come to an Anchor afterwards in the Road of <hi>Couali,</hi> which is not above four Leagues from <hi>Suratt,</hi> and two from the Mouth of the River toward the North, They transport their Wares from one place to another, either by Waggons, or in Boats. For great Vessels cannot get into the River of <hi>Suratt</hi> till they have unladen, by reason of the Sands that choak it up. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> return as soon as they have landed their Wares at <hi>Couali,</hi> and so do the <hi>English,</hi> it not being permitted to either to enter into the River. But some years since, the King has given the <hi>English</hi> a place to Winter in, during the rainy Seasons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Suratt</hi> is a City of an indifferent bigness, defended by a pittiful Fortress, by the foot whereof you must pass, whither you go by Land or by Water. It has four Towers at the four Corners, and in regard there are no Platforms upon the Walls, Guns are planted upon woodden-Scaffolds. The Governour of the Fort only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Souldiers in the Fort, but has no Power in the City, which has a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Governour to receive the King's Customs, and other Revenues through the Extent of his Province.</p>
                        <p>The Walls of the Town are only of Earth, and the generality of the Houses like Barns, being built of Reeds, plaistered with Cow-dung, to cover the void spaces, and to hinder them without from discerning between the Reeds what is done within. In all <hi>Suratt</hi> there be but nine or ten Houses which are well built: whereof the <hi>Cha-bander,</hi> or chief of the Merchants has two or three. The rest belong to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Merchants; nor are those, wherein the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> dwell less beautiful; every President, and every Commander, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful to repair them; which they put upon the account of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. However, they do but hire those Houses; the King not suffering any <hi>Frank</hi> to have an House of his own, for fear he should make a Fortress of it. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin</hi> Friars have built them a very convenient Convent, according to the Model of our <hi>European</hi> Houses, and a fair Church; for the building of which, I furnish'd them with good part of the Money. But the Purchase was made in the Name of a <hi>Maronite</hi> Merchant of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Chelebi,</hi> of whom I have spoken in my <hi>Persian</hi> Relations.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Customs, Money, Exchange, Weights and Measures of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>TO avoid Repetitions, which cannot be shunn'd in the Course of long Travels; it behoves me to let the Reader understand what belongs to the Custom-houses, Money, Exchange, Weights and Measures of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When your Commodities are unladen at <hi>Suratt,</hi> you must carry them to the Custom-house adjoyning to the Fort. They are very severe, and very exact in searching the people. Particular Merchants pay from four to five <hi>per Cent</hi> at the Custom-house for all sorts of Ware. But for the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Holland-</hi>Company; they pay less: But I believe if they did but cast up what it costs them in Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Presents which they are oblig'd every year to send to the Court, they would not pay much less for their Wares, than particular Merchants.</p>
                        <p>Gold and Silver pay two in the Hundred, and when it is brought into the Custom-house, the Master of the Mint comes and takes it, and Coins it into the Money of the Countrey. They agree with him upon the day wherein he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to return the new Pieces: And for so many days as he makes them stay after that, he pays them Interest, according to the proportion of the Silver which he receives. The <hi>Indians</hi> are very subtil and crafty in matters of Money and Payments; three or four years after the Silver is coin'd, it loses half <hi>per Cent.</hi> and goes at the same rate as old Silver; for, say they, it is impossible but that it should lose in passing through so many hands. You may carry all sorts of Silver into the Dominions of the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> For in all the Frontier Cities there is a Mint, where it is purified to the highest perfection, as is all the Gold and Silver in <hi>India,</hi> by the King's Command, and coin'd into Money. Silver in Bars, or old Plate, which is bought without paying for the fashion, is the Silver by which you shall lose least: For as for coin'd Silver, there is no avoiding the loss of the Coinage. All their bargains are made, with a condition to pay in coin'd Silver, within the present year.. And if you make payment in old Silver, you must resolve to lose according to the time since it was first-coin'd. In all places far remote from Cities, where the vulgar people have no great knowledge in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and where there are no Changers, they will not receive a piece of Silver, without putting it in the fire, to try whether it be good or no: And this is the common practice at all Ferries and passages over Rivers. In regard their Boats are only made of Ofier, covered over with an Ox-hide, and by consequence are very light; they keep them in the Woods, and will not take them upon their shoulders, till they have received their Money.</p>
                        <p>As for their Gold, the Merchants have so many cunning tricks to hide it, that it seldom comes to the knowledg of the Customers. They do all they can to shift off paying the Customs; and that, so much the rather, because they do not run so much hazard as at the Custom-houses of <hi>Europe.</hi> For in the <hi>Indian</hi> Custom-houses, if a man be caught in the fraud, he is quitted by paying double; ten in the hundred; instead of five: The King comparing the venture of the Merchant to a game at Hazard, where he plays quit or double. The King had granted to the <hi>English</hi> Captains, that they should not be search'd when they came a-shore. But one day one of the <hi>English</hi> Captains going to <hi>Tata,</hi> one of the greatest Cities in <hi>India,</hi> a little above the Mouth of the River <hi>Indou,</hi> as he was going to pass the River, he was stopp'd by the Officers of the Custom-house, who search'd and rifl'd him; what-ever he could alledg to the contrary. They found Gold about him, of which he had already carried off several quantities, at several times, that he had gone from his Ship to the City; but they quitted him, upon paying the usual Custom. The <hi>English-</hi>man, vex'd at such an affront, resolv'd to revenge himself; which he did after a very pleasant manner. He caus'd a sucking-pig to be roasted, and putting it, together with the dripping, and sawce, in a <hi>China-</hi>platter, covered with a linnen-cloath, he gave it a Slave to bring along after him to the City;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106224:164"/>
imagining what would fall out. As it pass'd before the Custom-house, while the Governors or the <hi>Cha-bander,</hi> and the Mint-Master were sitting in the <hi>Divan,</hi> they fail'd not to stop him; and as the Slave went forward with the Plate cover'd, they told his Master that he must come into the Custom-house, and that they must see what he carried. The more the <hi>English-</hi>man cry'd, <hi>that the Slave car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried nothing that paid any duties,</hi> the less he was believ'd; so that after a long debate he took the Plate from his Slave, and carried it himself into the <hi>Divan;</hi> the Governour and the <hi>Cha-bander,</hi> gravely ask'd him, why he would not be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Laws? Upon which the <hi>English-</hi>man, replying in a great heat, that he carried nothing which paid any duty, threw the Pigg among them with such a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Sawce and Pigg flew all upon their Garments. Now in regard that Swines-flesh is an abomination to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who believe every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd that touches it; they were forc'd to change their Clothes, take down the Tapestry of the <hi>Divan,</hi> to pull down the <hi>Divan</hi> it self, and build another, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to say any thing to the <hi>English-</hi>man; for the <hi>Cha-bander,</hi> and Mint-master are very observant to the Company, by whom they reap a great deal of profit. As for what concerns the Heads of the Companies, as well <hi>English,</hi> as <hi>Dutch,</hi> and their Associates, they have so great a respect for them, that they never search them at all, when they come a-shore; though they will not stick to conceal their Gold, like particular Merchants, and to carry it about them. The Trade of <hi>Tata;</hi> formerly very great, begins now to decay, because the Mouth of the Rivers grows more dangerous, and full of shallows every day more than other, the Sand-hills having almost choak'd it up.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>English</hi> finding they had learn'd the trick of rifling their Clothes, studi'd out other little ways and contrivances to conceal their Gold: And the fashion of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perriwigs being newly come out of <hi>Europe,</hi> they hid their <hi>Jacobus's, Rose-Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Ducats</hi> in the net of their Perriwigs, every time they came a-shore.</p>
                        <p>There was a Merchant that had a mind to convey some boxes of Coral into <hi>Suratt,</hi> without the knowledg of the Customers. He swam then into the Town, some days before the Ship was unladed, when it might be done securely before the Customers had any suspition of any thing. But the Merchant repented him afterwards, the Commodity being spol'd. For the water of <hi>Suratt</hi> River being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thick and muddy, there clung to the Coral, which had lain a long time in the water, a slime like a white crust or skin, which was difficult to be got off; so that after the Coral was polish'd, he lost by it above twelve <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I come now to the Money which goes for currant through the whole extent of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Dominions; and to all the sorts of Gold and Silver, which is carri'd thither in <hi>Ingots</hi> to make profit thereof.</p>
                        <p>In the first place you must observe that it is very profitable to buy Gold and Silver which has been wrought, to melt it into <hi>Ingots,</hi> and to refine it to the highest purity: For being refin'd, you pay not for the portage of the Alloy, which was mix'd with it before: And carrying the Gold and Silver in wedges, you pay neither to the Prince nor to the Mint what they exact for Coinage. If you carry coin'd Gold, the best pieces are <hi>Jacobus's, Rose-Nobles, Albertus's,</hi> and other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pieces, as well of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as of other Countreys, and all sorts of Gold that have been coin'd in former Ages. For by all those old Pieces the Merchant is sure to gain. You may also reckon for good Gold, and which is proper to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd thither, all the <hi>Ducats</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> as well those coin'd by the several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as by the Imperial Towns, together with the <hi>Ducats</hi> of <hi>Poland, Hungary, Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Danemark;</hi> and indeed all sorts of <hi>Ducats</hi> are taken to be of the same goodness. The <hi>Venetian Ducats</hi> of Gold formerly pass'd for the best, and were worth four or five of our <hi>Sous,</hi> more than any others; but about a dozen years ago they seem to have been alter'd, not going now for any more than the rest. There are also <hi>Ducats</hi> which the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> coins at <hi>Cairo,</hi> and those of <hi>Sally,</hi> and <hi>Morocco:</hi> But these three sorts are not so good as the others, and are not worth so much as they by four <hi>Sous</hi> of our Money.</p>
                        <p>Over all the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> all the Gold and Silver is weigh'd with weights, which they call <hi>Tolla;</hi> which weigh nine Deneers, and eight grains of our weights. When they have any quantity of Gold and Silver to sell, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> use yellow Copper-weights, with the King's mark, to avoid cousenage. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106224:164"/>
with these weights they weigh all the Gold and Silver at once, provided it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount not to above a hunder'd <hi>Tolla's.</hi> For the Changers have no other weights, but from one <hi>Tolla</hi> to a hunder'd; and a hunder'd <hi>Tolla's</hi> come to 38 Ounces, 21 Deneers, and 8 Grains. As for the Gold and Silver which is not coin'd, if there be much, they essay it; and having put it to the touch, they bid to the utmost value to out-vye one another.</p>
                        <p>In regard there are some Merchants that have above forty or fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Ducats at a time, the <hi>Indians</hi> weigh them with a weight which is just the weight of a hunder'd Ducats, which is also mark'd with the Kings Mark, and if the hundred <hi>Ducats</hi> weigh less than the weights, they put in so many little stones till the Scales are even; and after all is weigh'd, they make good to the Changer the weight of those little stones. But before they weigh these Gold-Coins, whether they be <hi>Ducats</hi> or other Pieces, they put the whole quantity into a Charcoal-fire, till they be red-hot; and then quench the fire with water, and take them out again. This they do to find out them which are false, and to melt off the Wax and Gum, which is cunningly dropt upon them to make them weigh the more. But because there are some Pieces so artfully hollow'd and stopt up again, that you cannot perceive it, though they have been in the fire, the Changers take the Pieces, and bend them; by which they know whether they are good or no; and those which they suspect they cut in pieces. After they have viewed them all, they refine those which they do not take to be good, and pay for so much as proves to be good, as for good Ducats. All this Gold they coin into that sort of Money which they call Roupies of Gold; except those Ducats, which are stamp'd only upon one side, which they sell to the Merchants that come from <hi>Tartary,</hi> and other Northern Parts, as from the Kingdoms of <hi>Boutan, Ason,</hi> and other remote parts. With these Ducats, the Women of those Countries chiefly adorn themselves, hanging them upon their Head-attire, and fixing them upon their forheads. As for the other Ducats, that have no figures, they are not so much as enquir'd after by the Northern Merchants.</p>
                        <p>As for all the other Pieces of Gold, there are great quantities of them fold to the Goldsmiths, to the Gold-wyar-drawers, and in general to all that work in Gold. For if they could put their Metal unmade into Roupies, they would never coin; which they can only do at the Coronation of their Kings, to throw Silver Roupies among the people; or to sell them to the Governours of the Provinces, and other Grandees of the Court, who then want great quantities of them to present to the new King at his first coming to his Throne. For they have not always Jewels or other things rich enough to present him, as well as that time, as at another Festival, of which I shall speak in due place, when they weigh the King every year. At such times I say, they are very glad of Gold Roupies; as also to present to such Favourites at the Court, by whose interest they hope to gain higher Commands, and more considerable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>
                        <p>In one of my Travels, I found by experience the vertue of these Roupies of Gold. <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> Father of <hi>Orang-zeb</hi> who now reigns, had given to one of the Lords of his Court, the Government of the Province of <hi>Tata,</hi> whereof <hi>Symdi</hi> is the Metropolis. Now though the very first year of his Government, there were very great complaints made against him, by reason of the Tyranny which he exercised over his people, and his great extortions, the King suffer'd him to continue four years, and then recall'd him. All the people of <hi>Tata</hi> were overjoy'd, believing the King had call'd him away, only to put him to death; but it fell out quite otherwise; for the King caress'd him, and gave him the Government of <hi>Halabas,</hi> more considerable than that which he had quitted. This kind reception, which he had at the Kings hands, proceeded from this, that before he came to <hi>Agra,</hi> he had sent before him a present of 50000 Roupies of Gold, and about 20000 Roupies of Gold more to <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> who had then the whole power in her hands; as also to other Ladies and Lords at the Court, to support his Reputation. All the Courtiers are very desirous to have a great quantity of Gold; because it lies in a little room, and then because they covet, as a great Honour, to leave vast Sums behind them, to their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, of which the King must not know. For as I shall tell you in another place,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106224:165"/>
when any great Lord dies, the King is Heir to all his Estate; his Wife having no more than his Jewels.</p>
                        <p>But to return to our Roupies of Gold; you must take notice, that they are not so currant among the Merchants. For in regard one of them is not worth above fourteen Roupies, which make one and twenty Livres of our Money, at thirty Sous the Roupie, and that there are sew of these Roupies of Gold to be had, but in the Houses of Great Men; when it falls out that they make any pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will put them at a Roupie of Silver, or at least at a sourth part of a Roupie more than it is worth, which will never turn to the Merchants profit. <hi>Cha-Est-Kan</hi> the King's Unckle, to whom I had sold a parcel of Goods at 96000 Roupies, when he came to pay me, ask'd me what Money I would be content to take, whether Gold or Silver. Before I could return him an answer, he added, that if I would leave it to him, I should take Gold Roupies: Nor did he give me this advice, but because he believ'd it would turn to his advantage: I told him I would be rul'd by him; thereupon he caus'd his Servants to tell me out so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Roupies in Gold, as made up the just Sum which was due: But he would force me to take the Roupie in Gold for fourteen Roupies and an half in Silver, though among the Merchants they went but for fourteen. I was not ignorant of it; but I thought it best to receive my Money according to the Prince's humour, in hopes he might make me amends another time, either for the whole, or part of what I might lose. I let him alone two days, after which I went to him again, and told him I had tried to put off his Roupies at the price I had received them; so that in the payment of 96000 Roupies, I had lost 3428 and one 16<hi>th.</hi> the Roupie of Gold which he forc'd me to take at fourteen Roupies and an half of Silver, being worth but fourteen. Thereupon he fell into a passion, and told me he would see as many Lashes bestow'd upon the Changer, or <hi>Holland-</hi>Broker, whose fault so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were; that he would teach them to understand Money; that they were old Roupies, and were worth more by a sixteenth part of a Silver Roupie, than the Roupies which were coin'd at that time. In regard I knew the humour of the <hi>Asiatic</hi> Princes, with whom there is no contesting, I let him say what he pleas'd; but when he came to himself, and began to put on a smiling look, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd him that he would be pleas'd to let me return the Summ which I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the next day; or else that he would be pleas'd to pay me what was wanting, and that I would take a Roupie at 14 and one 16<hi>th.</hi> since he assur'd me they were worth so much. The Prince for a while gave me a scurvy look, not so much as speaking one word. At length he ask'd me, whether I had still the Pearl, which he had resus'd to buy. I told him I had, and immediately pull'd it out of my Bosome, and gave it him. The Pearl was large, and of a good water, but ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shap'd; which was the reason he refus'd it before. When I had given it to him, well, said he, let us talk no more of what is past; how much will you have, in a word, for this Pearl? I ask'd him seven thousand Roupies, and indeed rather than I would have carri'd it into <hi>France,</hi> I would have taken three. If I give thee, said he, seven thousand Roupies for this Pearl, I shall make thee amends for the loss thou complain'st of in the first bargain. Come to Morrow, and I will give thee five thousand Roupies, and that's very fair: Thou shalt have also a Calaat and an Horse. I made my obeysance to him, and desir'd him to give me an Horse that should be young, and fit for service, because I had a great journey to take. The next day he sent me a Robe, a Cloak, two Girdles, and a Cap; which is all the Apparel that the Princes are wont to give to those to whom they intend any Honour. The Cloak and Robe was of Satin purfled with Gold; the two Girdles strip'd with Gold and Silver; the Cap was of Calicut, dy'd into a Flame-colour, with stripes of Gold: The Horse had no Saddle, but was covered with a green Velvet foot-cloath, edg'd about with a small Silver-fringe. The Bridle was very strait, with Silver-studs in some places. I believe the Horse had never been back'd; for so soon as I brought him to the <hi>Holland-</hi>House, where I then lodg'd, a young man got upon his back; but he was no sooner on, but the Horse flung and pranc'd at that rate, that having kick'd down an Hutt that stood in the Court, he had like to have kill'd the <hi>Hollander.</hi> Finding that such a Resty-Horse was not for my turn, I sent him back to <hi>Cha-est-Kan,</hi> and relating the Story to him, I told him I did not believe that he desir'd I should return into my Countrey to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106224:165"/>
bring him back some rarities which I had promis'd him, as he made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did. All the while I talk'd, he laugh'd, and afterwards sent for the Horse which his Father in his life time us'd to ride upon. It was a tall <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Horse, that had formerly cost five thousand Crowns, but was then twenty eight years old. They brought him bridl'd and saddl'd, and the Prince would needs have me get up in his presence. He had one of the most stately walks that ever I knew in a Horse; and when I alighted, well, said he, art thou sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? I dare say, that Horse will never give thee a fall. I thank'd him, and at the same time took my leave of him; and the next day, before my departure, he sent me a great Basket of Apples. It was one of the six that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jehan</hi> had sent him, as they came from the Kingdom of <hi>Kachemir;</hi> there was in the Basket also a great <hi>Persian Melon:</hi> All this might be worth a hundred Roupies, which I presented to the <hi>Holland</hi> Commanders Wife. As for the Horse, I rode him to <hi>Golconda,</hi> where I sold him for five hundred Roupies, as old as he was, being a good lusty Beast.</p>
                        <p>To return to our discourse of Money, I will add this to what I have said already, that you must never carry <hi>Louis's</hi> of Gold to the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor <hi>Spanish</hi> nor <hi>Italian</hi> Pistols, nor any other sort of Money coin'd within these few years; for there is great loss by it; for the <hi>Indians</hi> refine all, and count only upon the refinings. Lastly, every one strives to steal the custom of their Gold; and when the Merchant has got the knack of concealing it, he may gain five or six of our Sous in every Ducat.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the sorts of Silver Money; which you must distinguish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Money of the Country, and Forreign Money: And first of the Forreign Coins.</p>
                        <p>The Forreign Silver Coins which are carried into the <hi>Indies,</hi> are the Rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollars of <hi>Germany</hi> and the Reals of <hi>Spain.</hi> The first are brought by the Merchants that come from <hi>Poland,</hi> from the Lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi> and the Borders of <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi> The others by those that come from <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and the greatest part by the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who sell their Silk into <hi>Europe.</hi> All these Merchants endeavour to convey their Silver through <hi>Persia</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discovered; for if the Customers find it out, they will be forced to carry their Silver to the Mint-Masters to be coined into <hi>Abassi's,</hi> which is the Kings Coin; and these <hi>Abassi s</hi> being carried into <hi>India,</hi> are again coined into Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, whereby the Merchant loses ten and a quarter <hi>per Cent.</hi> as well by reason of the coinage, as by paying the Kings duties in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To let you understand in a few words, how they came to lose this ten and a quarter <hi>per Cent.</hi> from <hi>Persia</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and sometimes more, according to the nature of the Reals, which they usually carry into <hi>Persia;</hi> you must call to mind, what I have already said concerning the Money and Exchanges of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the first Volume. I observ'd, that a Real in <hi>Persia</hi> goes for 23 <hi>Chaez,</hi> which make three <hi>Abassi's</hi> and a quarter; and that sometimes, when Silver is scarce, they will give a <hi>Chaez</hi> and a half for one. That the <hi>Abassi</hi> is worth four <hi>Chaez,</hi> and the <hi>Toman</hi> fifty <hi>Abassi's,</hi> or two hundred <hi>Chaez.</hi> If you carry six <hi>Tomans</hi> and a half to the <hi>Indies,</hi> you have for every <hi>Toman</hi> twenty-nine <hi>Roupies</hi> and a half; and consequently for six <hi>Tomans</hi> and a half, a hundred and ninety-one <hi>Roupies</hi> and a quarter. If you carry to the <hi>Indies</hi> Reals of <hi>Sevilo,</hi> for a hundred you shall have from 213 to 215 Roupies. If you carry <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Reals, for a hundred you shall have no more than 212. So that when for a hundred Reals you have but two hundred and twelve Roupies, you gain ten Reals and a quarter, in an hundred Reals; but by the <hi>Sevillian</hi> Reals you profit eleven <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are three or four sorts of <hi>Spanish</hi> Reals, and they give for a hundred according to their goodness, from 218 to 214 and 215 Roupies. The best of all are those of <hi>Sevil,</hi> for when they are full weight, they will give for a hundred, 213 Roupies; and sometimes 215, according as Silver is either scarce or plentiful.</p>
                        <p>The Real of <hi>Spain</hi> ought to weigh three Drams, seven Grains and a half more than two Roupies. But the Silver of the Roupies is much better. For the Roupy is in weight eleven Deneers and fourteen Grains; but the <hi>Sevil</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106224:166"/>
Real, like our white Crown, is but just eleven Deneers. The <hi>Mexican</hi> Real goes at ten Deneers and twenty-one Grains. For the <hi>Spanish</hi> Real, that weighs seventy-three Vals, you have four Mamoudi's and a half, and one Mamoudi is worth twenty Pecha's; but they must be very good, and as I have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, seventy-three Vals in weight: eighty-one Vals making an Ounce, one Val coming to seven Deneers.</p>
                        <p>For the Rixdollars of <hi>Germany,</hi> in regard they are heavier than the Reals, they will give you for an hundred, as high as an hundred and sixteen Roupies. Where you are to take notice, that in giving for an hundred Reals, or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Rixdollars, two hundred and fifteen, or two hundred and sixteen Roupies, it seems that every Roupy ought to be worth less than thirty Sous. But if the Merchant count the portage of the Silver, and the Customs, he will find that every Roupy will stand him in more. But that the Merchant may make his profit, he must take notice, that all the Reals of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and those of <hi>Sevil,</hi> are in weight one and twenty Deneers and eight Grains, that is, five hundred and twelve Grains; and for those that are no better than our white Crown, they are to be in weight one and twenty Deneers and three Grains, which makes five hundred and nine Grains. All Dollars and Reals are weigh'd, a hundred at a time, and when they are wanting in weight, they add little stones, as when they weigh Gold, according to what I shall tell you by and by.</p>
                        <p>We come now to the Money of the Country. The <hi>Indian</hi> Money is the Silver Roupy, the Half, Quarter, Eighteenth and Sixteenth part. The weight of the Roupy is nine Deneers and one Grain; the value of the Silver is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Deneers and fourteen Grains. They have also another sort of Silver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which they call Mamoudi's, but this goes no-where but in <hi>Surat,</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Guzerat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> have also a sort of small Copper Money, which is call'd Pecha; which is worth about two of our Liards, a Liard being the fourth part of a Sous. There is also the Half Pecha, two Pecha's, and Four Pecha's. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custom of the Province where you travel, you have for a Roupy of Silver more or less of these Pecha's. In my last Travels, a Roupy went at <hi>Surat</hi> for nine and forty Pecha's. But the time was, when it was worth fifty, and another time, when it went but for six and forty. At <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanabat,</hi> the Roupy was valued at fifty-five and fifty-six Pecha's. And the reason is, because the nearer you go to the Copper Mines, the more Pecha's you have for a Roupy. As for the Mamoudi, it is always valued at forty Pecha's.</p>
                        <p>There are two other sorts of small Money in the Dominions of the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gull,</hi> which are little bitter Almonds and Shells. These little bitter Almonds, which are brought out of <hi>Persia,</hi> are only made use of in the Province of <hi>Guze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratt;</hi> as I have observed in the first part of my Relations. They grow in dry and barren places among the Rocks, and the Tree, that bears them, is almost like our Bastard <hi>Spanish-Broom.</hi> They call these Almonds <hi>Baden:</hi> Nor is there any <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida</hi> so bitter. They give for a Pecha sometimes thirty five, and sometimes forty.</p>
                        <p>Their other small Money are the little Shells which they call <hi>Cori;</hi> the sides whereof turn circularly inward: Nor are they to be found in any part of the World, but in the <hi>Maldives</hi> Islands. They are the greatest part of the Revenue of the King of that Island. For they are transported into all the Territories of the Oreat <hi>Mogull;</hi> into the Kingdoms of <hi>Visapour</hi> and <hi>Golconda;</hi> and into the Islands of <hi>America</hi> to serve instead of Money. Near the Sea they give 80 for a Pecha. But the further you go from the Sea, the less you have; so that at <hi>Agra,</hi> they will not give you above 50 or 55 for a Pecha. As to what remains accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Accompt of the <hi>Indians,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>100000 Roupies make a Lekke.</p>

Exchange. In regard that these Bankers hold a Correspondence with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Province, they raise as they please themselves, the Roupie for the Pecha's, and the Pecha's for the Shells. All the Jews that deal in Money and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in the Empire of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> are accounted a most subtil sort of people. But in the <hi>Indies</hi> they would be scarce thought fit to be Apprentices to these Bankers. They have one very bad custom in making of Payments: And I have already observ'd it, in reference to their Roupies of Gold. When they make any Payment in that sort of money, they tell ye, 'twas a great while ago that any Silver Roupie was coin'd; that they are worth less than those which are new, or but lately coin'd; for that by passing through many hands they wear away, and become lighter. And therefore when you make any bargain, you must always agree to be paid in Roupies <hi>Cha-jenni,</hi> that is, in new Silver; otherwise, they will
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106224:167"/>
pay you in Roupies coin'd some fifteen or twenty years ago, and upward; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you will lose four in the hundred. For they will have one fourth, or at least one eighth <hi>per Cent.</hi> allow'd for those that were coin'd but two years before: So that the poor people that cannot read the year wherein the Roupies were coined, are subject to be cheated; for they will always abate a Pecha or half a Pecha upon a Roupie, or three or four Cori's upon a Pecha.</p>
                        <p>As for counterfeit Silver, there is very little among them. If you receive one false Roupie in a Bagg from any particular person, 'tis better to cut it to pieces, and lose it, than to speak of it; for if it should come to be known, there might be danger in it. For you are commanded by the King's Law to return the Bagg where you received it; and to return it from one to another, till you can find out the Counterfeiter; who, if he be apprehended, is only sentenc'd to lose his hand. If the Counterfeiter cannot be found, and that it be thought that he who paid the Money is not guilty, he is acquitted upon some small amercement. This brings great profit to the Changers. For when there is any Summ of Money received or paid, the Merchants cause him to look it over, and for their pains, they have one sixteenth of a Roupie in the hundred.</p>
                        <p>As for the Money which is paid out of the <hi>Sarquet,</hi> or King's Exchequer, there is never any found that is counterfeit: For all the Money that is carried in thither, is exactly view'd by the King's Bankers: The Great Lords have also their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bankers. Before they put up the Money into the Treasury, they throw it into a great Charcoal-fire, and when the Roupies are red-hot, they quench the fire, by throwing water upon it; and then take out the Money. If there be any Piece that is white, or that has the least mark of Alloy, it is presently cut in pieces. As often as these Roupies are carried into the Treasury, they mark the Pieces with a Puncheon, which makes an hole, but not quite through; and there are some Pieces that have seven or eight holes made in that manner, to shew that they have been so many times in the Exchequer. They are all put, a thousand Pieces together, in a bagg, seal'd with the Seal of the great Treasurer; and the number of years superscrib'd, since they were coin'd. And here you are to take notice, whence the Treasurers profit arises, as well that of the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, as that of the particular Treasurers of the Great Lords of the Kingdom. When there is any bargain made, they agree for new Roupies coin'd the same year: but when they come to receive the payment, the Treasurers will make it in old Roupies, wherein there is a loss of six <hi>per Cent.</hi> So that if they will have new Silver, the Merchants must compound with the Treasurer. In my fift Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I went to visit <hi>Cha-Est-Kan</hi> according to my promise, to let him have the first sight of what I brought along with me. So that as soon as I arrived at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratt,</hi> I sent him word; and received his Orders to meet him at <hi>Choupart,</hi> a City in the Province of <hi>Decan,</hi> to which he had laid Siege. Coming to him, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, and a few words, I sold him the greatest part of what I had brought along with me out of <hi>Europe:</hi> And he told me that he expected every day, that Money should be sent him from <hi>Suratt</hi> to pay the Army, and to pay me also at the same time for what he had bought of me. I could not imagin however, that so great a Prince as he, that commanded so great an Army, had not store of Money by him; but rather conjectur'd, that he had an intention to make me some abatement, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those Pieces which he would put upon me in payment, as he had serv'd me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It fell out, as I faresaw. But for Provisions for my self, my Men, and my Horses, he took such order, that there was great plenty brought me, night and morning, and for the most part he sent for me my self, to his own Table. Ten or twelve days thus past away, and not a word of the Money that I expected: So that being resolv'd to take my leave of him, I went to his Tent. He appeared to be somewhat surpriz'd, and looking upon me with a frowning-brow; wherefore will you be gone, said he, before you are paid? or who d'you think, shall pay you afterwards, if you go away before you receive your Money? Upon these words, with a countenance as stern as his, my King, replied I, will see me paid. For his goodness is such, that he causes all his Subjects to be paid, that have not received satisfaction for such Goods as they sell in forreign Countries. And what course will he take, answer'd he in a great choler: with two or three stout Men of War, said I, which he will send either to the Port of <hi>Suratt,</hi> or toward the Coasts to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106224:167"/>
wait for the Ships that come from <hi>Mocca.</hi> He seemed to be netled at that reply, but not daring to give any more way to his choler, he ordered his Treasurer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to give me a Letter of Exchange to <hi>Aurengabad.</hi> I was the more glad of that, because it was a place through which I was to pass in my way to <hi>Golcanda;</hi> besides that, it would spare me the carriage and the hazards of my Money. The next day I had my Bill of Exchange, and took leave of the Prince, who was nothing displeased, but told me, that if I return'd to the <hi>Indies,</hi> I should not fail to come and see him, which I did in my sixt and last Voyage. When I came to <hi>Suratt,</hi> he was at <hi>Bengala,</hi> where I sold him all the rest of my Goods that I could not put off either to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> or the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to return to the payment of my Money, I was no sooner arrived at <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabat,</hi> but I went to find the great Treasurer; who no sooner saw me, but he told me, he knew wherefore I came; that he had received Letters of advice three days before, and that he had already taken the Money out of the Treasury to pay me. When he had brought me all the Baggs, I caused my Banker to open them, who saw them to be Roupies, by which I was to lose two in the hundred. Upon that I thank'd the Treasurer very heartily, telling him, I understood no such deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that I would send and complain of him to <hi>Cha-Est-Kam;</hi> and declare to him, that he should either give order that I should be paid in new Silver, or else let me have my Goods again, which I presently did. But not receiving an answer so soon as I knew I might have done, I went to the Treasurer, and told him, I would go my self, and fetch away my Goods. I believe he had received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what to do; for seeing I was resolved to go; he told me he was very unwilling I should put my self to so much trouble, and that it would be better for us to agree among our selves. After many contests about the two in the hundred, which he would have made me lose, I was contented to abate one, and had lost the other, had I not happily met with a Banker who wanted Silver, and had a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to pay at <hi>Golconda;</hi> so that he was glad to make use of mine, and gave me a Bill to be paid at <hi>Golconda,</hi> being my full Summ, at fifteen days fight.</p>

These thirteen pieces differing all in goodness, they never make use of them, but when any question arises concerning a small quantity of Silver, or of any wrought Silver. For they refine all their great quantities. All that kind of Silver is bought by the weight which they call <hi>Tolla,</hi> which weighs nine Deneers, and eight Grains, or 32 Val's; 81 Val's, making an Ounce: So that an hundred Tolla's make 38 Ounces, 21 Deneers, and 8 Grains.</p>

This Ball is about the bigness of one of our Tennis-Balls; and the Stone is such a one as our Goldsmiths generally use.</p>
                           <p>Thus much of the Custom-houses and Money currant among the <hi>Indians.</hi> It remains to speak of their manner of Exchange.</p>
                           <p>As all the Goods which are made in the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogull,</hi> and some part of the Kingdoms of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour</hi> are brought to <hi>Suratt</hi> to be transported into several parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> the Merchants, when they go from <hi>Surat</hi> to buy Commodities in the several Cities where they are made, as at <hi>Lahor, Agra, Amadabat, Seronge, Brampour, Daca, Patna, Banarou, Golconda, Decan, Visapour,</hi> and <hi>Dult ab at,</hi> take up Money at <hi>Surat,</hi> and are discharg'd at the places where they go by giving kind for kind. But when it happens that the Merchant is short of Money in those places, and that there is a necessity for him to take up Money to compleat his Markets, he must then return it at <hi>Suratt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Months, paying monthly for the Change.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Lahor</hi> to <hi>Suratt</hi> the Exchange goes at six and a quarter <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From <hi>Amadabat,</hi> from one, to one and an half.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Seronga,</hi> at three.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Brampour,</hi> from two and an half, to three.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Daca,</hi> at ten.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Banarou,</hi> at six.</p>
                           <p>From the three last places they make their Bills of Exchange only to <hi>Agra;</hi>
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106224:168"/>
and at <hi>Agra</hi> they make others for <hi>Suratt,</hi> the whole at the same price as I have set down.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Golconda,</hi> from four to five.</p>
                           <p>And for <hi>Goa</hi> the same.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Decan</hi> at three.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Visapour</hi> at three.</p>
                           <p>From <hi>Dultabat,</hi> from one to one and an half.</p>
                           <p>Some years the Exchange rises from one to two <hi>per Cent.</hi> by reason of certain Raja's or petty Vassal Princes that disturb Trade, every one pretending that the Merchandizes ought to pass through his Countrey, and pay Toll. There are two particularly between <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Amadabatt,</hi> the one called the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Antivar,</hi> and the other the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Bergam,</hi> who very much molest the Merchants for this very cause. But you may avoid passing through the Territories of these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, taking another road from <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Suratt,</hi> thorough <hi>Seronge</hi> and <hi>Brampour.</hi> But they are fertil Lands, divided with several Rivers, without Bridges or Boats, and it is impossible to go that way, till two months after the rains are fallen. Which is the reason that those Merchants who must be at <hi>Suratt</hi> when the season permits them to take the Sea, are forc'd to pass through the Territories of these two <hi>Raja's,</hi> because they can pass that way at all times, even in the time that the rains fall, which only knit and harden the Sand.</p>
                           <p>Nor are you to wonder that the Exchange runs so high; for they that trust out their Money, run the hazard, by obligation, of losing their Money, if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants should be robb'd.</p>
                           <p>When you come to <hi>Suratt</hi> to Embarque, there is Money enough. For it is the greatest Trade of the Grandees of the <hi>Indies</hi> to venture their Money by Sea from thence for <hi>Ormus, Balsara,</hi> and <hi>Mocca;</hi> nay even as far as <hi>Bantam, Achen,</hi> and the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands. For <hi>Mocca</hi> and <hi>Balsara,</hi> the change runs from 22 to 24 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And to <hi>Ormus,</hi> from 16 to 20. And to the other places which I have named, the change runs proportionable to the distance.</p>
                           <p>I have but one word to say of their Weights and Measures; I have given you in the Margin the fift part of an Ell of <hi>Agra,</hi> and the fourth part of an Ell of <hi>Amadabat</hi> and <hi>Suratt.</hi> As for their Weights, the <hi>Men</hi> is generally 69 Pound, and the Pound 16 Ounces. But the <hi>Men</hi> which they weigh their <hi>Indico</hi> withal, is but 53 Pound. At <hi>Suratt</hi> they talk of a <hi>Serre,</hi> which is one and three fourths of a Pound, and the Pound is 16 Ounces.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of their Carriages, and the manner of Travelling in India.</head>
                        <p>BEfore we set forward upon the road, it will be convenient to speak of their Carriages, and the manner of travelling in <hi>India;</hi> which, in my opinion, is more commodious than any thing that has been invented for ease in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> Quite otherwise it is in <hi>Persia,</hi> where they neither make use of Asses, Mules, or Horses, but transport all their Wares to the <hi>Indies</hi> upon Oxen, or in Wains, their Countreys being so near to one another. If any Merchant carries an Horse out of <hi>Persia,</hi> 'tis only for shew, or to walk in his hand, or to sell to some <hi>Indian</hi> Prince.</p>
                        <p>They will lay upon an Oxes back 300, or 350 pound weight. And it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing to see ten or twelve thousand Oxen at a time all laden with Rice, Corn and Salt, in such places where they exchange these Commodities: Carrying Corn where only Rice grows, Rice where only Corn grows, and Salt where there is none at all. They make use of Camels sometimes, but very rarely, they being particularly appointed to carry the luggage of great Personages. When the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son requires hast, and that they would speedily conveigh their Merchandize to <hi>Suratt</hi> to ship them off, they load them upon Oxen, and not in Wains. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Territories of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> are very well manur'd, the Fields
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106224:169"/>
are senc'd with very good Ditches; and to every Field there belongs a Pond to preserve the water. There is this great inconvenience for Travellers; that when they meet with these numerous Caravans in streight places, they are forc'd to stay two or three days till they are all past by. They that drive these Oxen, follow no other Calling as long as they live, nor do they dwell in houses; yet they carry their Wives and Children along with them. There are some among them that have an hundred Oxen of their own, others more or less; and they have always one, who is their Chief, that takes as much state as a Prince, and has his Chain of Pearl hanging about his neck. When the Caravan that carries the Corn, and that which carries the Salt happen to meet, rather than yield the road, they frequently enter into very bloody Disputes. The Great <hi>Mogull</hi> considering one day that these quarrels were very prejudicial to Trade, and the transportation of necessary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions from place to place, sent for the two Chiefs of the Caravan, and after he had exhorted them, for the common good and their own interest, to live quietly together, and not to quarrel and fight when they met, gave to each of them a Leck, or an hundred thousand Roupies, and a Chain of Pearl.</p>
                        <p>That the Reader may the better understand the manner of travelling in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> he is to take notice, that among the Idolaters of that Countrey there are four Tribes, which are called <hi>Manari's,</hi> each of which may consist of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Souls. These people live always in Tents, and live only upon the transporting of Merchandize from Countrey to Countrey. The first of these Tribes carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Corn, the second Rice, the third Pulse, and the fourth Salt, which they setch from <hi>Suratt,</hi> and all along from as far as <hi>Cape-Camorin.</hi> These Tribes are also distinguished in this manner: Their Priests, of whom I shall speak in another place, mark the forheads of the first, with a red-Gum, about the bredth of a Crown; and then they draw a streak all the length of his nose, sticking grains of Wheat upon it, sometimes ten, and sometimes twelve. Those of the second Tribe are mark'd with yellow-Gum in the same place, with grains of Rice. Those of the third are mark'd with a grey-Gum, down to the shoulders, and grains of Millet. Those of the fourth Tribe carry tied about their necks a Bagg, with a great lump of Salt in it, weighing sometimes eight or ten pounds, (for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier it is, the more they glory in carrying it;) and with this Bagg they thump their stomacks, as a sign of repentance every morning before they say their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They have all in general a little line or twist, like a Scarf, about their necks at the end whereof hangs a little Silver-box, like a Relique-box, wherein they enclose a little superstitious writing which their Priests give them; they tie them also about their Oxen and other Cattel, which are bred in their Herds, for which they have a particular affection, and love them as tenderly as children, especially if they have no children of their own. Their Women wear only a piece of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut white or painted, some six or five times doubled from their wasts down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. From their wasts upward they cut their flesh into several forms of Flowers, as they do that apply Cupping-glasses, which they paint in various colours with the juice of Grapes, that their skin seems to be all made of Flowers.</p>
                        <p>Every morning, while the men load the Beasts, and that the Women fold up the Tents, the Priests that follow them, set up in the most convenient place of the Plain where they lodg'd a certain Idol in the form of a Serpent in wreaths, upon a Perch six or seven foot high; to which they come all in files to worship, their Women going three times about. After the Ceremony is over, the Priests take care of the Idol, and load it upon an Ox particularly appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                        <p>The Caravan of Waggons seldom exceeds the number of an hundred or two hundred at most. Every Waggon is drawn by ten or twelve Oxen; and attended by four Souldiers, which the person that owes the Merchandize is oblig'd to pay. Two of them march upon each side of the Waggon, over which there are two Ropes thrown a-cross, the ends whereof they hold in their hands, to the end, that if the Waggon come to lean on one-side in ill-way, the two Souldiers on the other side may keep it from over-turning, by pulling the Ropes with all their strength.</p>
                        <p>All the Waggons that come to <hi>Suratt,</hi> either from <hi>Agra,</hi> or any other parts of the Empire, and which return through <hi>Agra,</hi> or <hi>Jánabatt,</hi> are bound to carry
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106224:169"/>
back the Lime that comes from <hi>Barocha,</hi> which, after it is temper'd, and laid on, becomes as hard as Marble.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the manner of travelling in <hi>India,</hi> to which purpose they make use of Oxen instead of Horses, and there are some, whose pace is as easy as the amble of our Hackneys. But you must take a care, when you either buy or hire an Ox to ride upon, that the horns be not above a foot in length. For if they be longer, when the flies begin to sting, he will chafe, and toss back his horns, and strike them into the stomack of the Rider, as oftentimes it has hapned. These Oxen are rid like our Horses, and instead of Snaffles or Bitts, they have only a Rope drawn through the muscly part of the muzzle or nostrils. In firm ground where there are no stones, they never shooe their Oxen; but only in rough pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where not only the stones but the heat will wast and chop the hoof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>Europe</hi> we tie our Oxen by the horns, the <hi>Indians</hi> only put a thick truss upon their necks, that keeps fast a Coller of Leather four fingers broad, which they have nothing to do but to put about their necks when they fasten them to the Waggon.</p>
                        <p>They use also for Travel little Coaches, but very light, that will hold two persons; but generally they ride alone for more ease; carrying only their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Cloak-Bags along with them; with a small Vessel of Wine, and a small quantity of Provisions, for which there is a proper place under the Coach, where they tye the two Oxen. These Coaches have their Curtains and Seats like ours, yet are not hung: But in my last Travels I caus'd one to be made after our manner; and the two Oxen that drew it, cost me near upon six-hundred Roupies. Nor is the Reader to wonder at the price; for there are some of these Oxen that are very strong, and that will travel upon the trot twelve or fifteen leagues a-day for sixty days together. When they have gone half the days journey, they give them two or three Balls, as big as one of our two-penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaves, of Wheat kneaded up with butter and black-sugar. The hire of a Coach comes to a Roupie a-day more or less. From <hi>Suratt</hi> to <hi>Agra</hi> is forty days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and you pay for the whole journey from forty to forty-five Roupies. From <hi>Suratt</hi> to <hi>Golconda,</hi> being almost the same distance, the same price is observed; and by the same proportion you may travel over all the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They who have more to spend, for their own ease make use of a <hi>Pallanquin,</hi> wherein they travel very commodiously. This is a sort of little Couch six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven foot long, and three broad, with balisters round about it. A sort of Cane; call'd <hi>Bambouc,</hi> which they bend like an Arch, sustains the covering of the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanquin,</hi> which is either of Satin or Cloath of Gold; and when the Sun lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one side, a Slave that goes by the side, takes care to pull down the covering. Another Slave carries at the end of a long stick a kind of Target of Osier, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with some gentile stuff, to preserve the person that is in the <hi>Pallanquin</hi> from the heat of the Sun, when he turns and lies upon his face. The two ends of the <hi>Bambouc</hi> are fastned on both sides to the body of the <hi>Pallanquin</hi> between two sticks join'd together like a <hi>Saltir</hi> or St. <hi>Andrews-cross,</hi> every one of those two sticks being five or six foot long. There are some of these <hi>Bambouc's</hi> that cost two-hundred Crowns; I my self have paid an hundred and twenty. Three men for the most part apply themselves to each of these two ends to carry the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanquin</hi> upon their shoulders; some on the right, and some on the left, and they go swifter than our Sedan-men, and with a much more easy pace, as being that which they practice from their youth. You give to every one for all things not above four Roupies a Month; but it stands you in above five if the journey be long, and exceed sixty days labour.</p>
                        <p>Whether it be in Coach, or <hi>Pallanquin,</hi> he that will travel honourably in the <hi>Indies,</hi> must take along with him twenty or thirty armed men, with Bows and Arrows some, others with Musquets; and they have the same rate with those that carry the <hi>Pallanquin.</hi> Sometimes for more magnificence they carry a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> do, for the honour of their Companies. These Souldiers are not only for shew, but they watch for your defence, keeping Centinels, and relieving one another, and are very studious to give content. For you must know, that in the Towns where you take them into service, they have a Chieftain, that is responsible for their fidelity, who for his good word has two Roupies a-piece of every one.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:106224:170"/>
In the great Villages there is generally a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> that commands, of whom you may buy Mutton, Pullets, or Pidgeons. But where there live none but <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> there is nothing but Flower, Rice, Herbs and Milk-meats to be had.</p>
                        <p>The great heats in <hi>India</hi> enforcing the Travellers, that are not accustomed to them, to travel by night, and rest in the day-time; when they come into any fortified Towns, they must be gone before Sun-set, if they intend to travel that night. For night coming on, and the Gates being shut, the Commander of the place, who is to answer for all the Robberies that are committed within his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, will let no person stir forth, telling them that it is the King's order, to which he must be obedient. When I came to any of those Towns, I bought my Provisions, and went out again in good time, and staid in the Field under some Tree, in the fresh air, till it was time to set forward.</p>
                        <p>They measure the distances of places in <hi>India</hi> by <hi>Gos,</hi> and <hi>Costes.</hi> A <hi>Gos</hi> is about four of our common leagues, and a <hi>Coste</hi> one league. It is now time to travel from <hi>Surat</hi> for <hi>Agra,</hi> and <hi>Janabat,</hi> and to observe what is most remarkable upon the Road.</p>

                        <p>I Am no less well acquainted with all the principal Roads that lead to the chief Cities of <hi>India,</hi> than those of <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Persia;</hi> for in six times that I have travell'd from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> I have gone twice for one from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> and many other places of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Empire. But it would be tiresome to the Reader to carry him more than once the same way, on purpose to make a relation of every particular journey, and the accidents that accompany them: And therefore it will suffice to give an exact description of the Roads, without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularizing the distinct times that I went.</p>
                        <p>There are but two Roads from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> one through <hi>Brampour</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronge,</hi> the other through <hi>Amadabat.</hi> The first shall be the Subject of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Barnoly,</hi> costes 14</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Barnoly</hi> is a great Borough-Town, where you are to ford a great River; and this first days journey you cross a mixt Countrey, part Wood, part through Fields of Wheat and Rice.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Barnoly</hi> to <hi>Bahor,</hi> costes. 10</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bahor</hi> is also a large Village upon a Lake, about a league in compass. Upon the side whereof is to be seen a good substantial Fortress; though there be no use made of it. Three quarters of a league on this side the Village you ford a small River, though not without great difficulty, by reason of the Rocks and Stones that hazard the over-turning of the Coach. This second days-journey you travel almost altogether through Woods.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Balor</hi> to <hi>Kerkoa,</hi> or as it is call'd at this day, <hi>Carvansera de la Begum,</hi> costes. 5</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Carvansera</hi> or Inn is very large and commodious; being built out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by <hi>Begum-saheb</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cha-jehan.</hi> For formerly the journey from <hi>Balor</hi> to <hi>Navapoura</hi> was too great: And this place being upon the Frontiers of those <hi>Raja's</hi> that sometimes will not acknowledg the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> whose Vassals they are, there was no <hi>Caravan</hi> that past by which was not abused; besides that it is a wooddy-Countrey. Between <hi>Carvansera</hi> and <hi>Navapoura</hi> you ford a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; as also another very neer to <hi>Navapoura.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Navapoura</hi> is a great Town full of Weavers; but Rice is the greatest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of that place. There runs a River through the Countrey, which makes it very fruitful, and waters the Rice, that requires moisture. All the Rice which grows in this Countrey has one peculiar quality, that makes it more particularly

esteem'd. The grain of it is less by one half, than the grain of the common Rice; and when it is boil'd, no snow is whiter; but besides all that, it smells of Musk; and all the Grandees of the <hi>Indians</hi> eat no other. When they would make an acceptable Present to any one in <hi>Persia,</hi> they send him a sack of this Rice. This River which passes by <hi>Kerkoa</hi> and those other places I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, empties it self into the River of <hi>Surat.</hi>

                        <p>At <hi>Tallener</hi> you are to pass the River, which runs to <hi>Baroche;</hi> where it is very large, and empties it self into the Golf of <hi>Cambaya.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Brampour</hi> is a great City, very much ruin'd, the Houses being for the most part thatch'd with straw. There is also a great Castle in the midst of the City, where the Governour lies; the Government of this Province is a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble command; and is only conferr'd upon the Son or Unckle of the King. And <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> the present King, was a long time Governour of this Province in the Reign of his Father. But since they came to understand the strength of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Bengala,</hi> which formerly bore the Title of a Kingdom, that Province is now the most considerable in all the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Countrey. There is a great Trade in this City, and as well in <hi>Brampore,</hi> as over all the Province, there is made a prodigious quantity of Calicuts very clear and white, which are transported into <hi>Porsia, Turkey</hi> and <hi>Muscovia, Poland, Arabia,</hi> to <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> and other places. There are some which are painted with several colours, with flowers, of which the Women make Veils and Scarfs; the same Calicuts serve for Coverlets of Beds, and for Handkerchiefs. There is another sort of Linnen which they never dye, with a stripe or two of Gold or Silver quite through the piece, and at each end from the bredth of one inch to twelve or fifteen, in some more, in some less, they fix a tissue of Gold, Silver, and Silk, intermix'd with Flowers, whereof there is no wrong-side, both sides being as fair the one as the other. If these pieces, which they carry into <hi>Poland,</hi> where they have a vast utterance, want at each end three or four inches at the least of Gold or Silver; or if that Gold or Silver become tarnish'd in being carried by Sea from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Ormus,</hi> and from <hi>Trebizan</hi> to <hi>Mangala,</hi> or any other parts upon the Black-Sea, the Merchant shall have much ado to put them off without great loss. He must take care that his goods be packt up in good Bales, that no wet may get in; which for so long a Voyage requires great care and trouble. Some of these Linnens are made purposely for Swathbands or Shashes, and those pieces are call'd <hi>Ornis.</hi> They contain from 15 to 20 Ells; and cost from an hunderd to an hunderd and fifty Roupies, the least not being under ten or twelve ells. Those that are not above two ells long are worn by the Ladies of Quality for Veils and Scarfs, of which there is a vast quantity ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Turkey.</hi> They make at <hi>Brampour</hi> also other sorts of Cotton-Linnen; for indeed there is no Province in all the <hi>Indies</hi> which more abounds in Cotton.</p>
                        <p>When you leave the City of <hi>Brampoure,</hi> you must pass another River, besides that which I have mention'd already. There is no Bridge, and therefore when the water is low, you ford it; when the rains fall, there are Boats attending.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Brampour</hi> it is 132 Costes; and these Costes are very short in the <hi>Indies;</hi> for you may travel one of them in a Coach in less than an hour.</p>
                        <p>I remember a strange tumult at <hi>Brampoure,</hi> in the year 1641, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Surat;</hi> the cause whereof was thus, in short: The Governour of the Province who was the King's Nephew by the Mother's-side, had among his Pages a young Boy that was very beautiful, and of a very good Family, who had a Brother in the City that liv'd as a <hi>Dervich;</hi> and for whom
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106224:171"/>
all the Town had a very great veneration. One day the Governour, being alone in his Chamber, did all that lay in his power, by vertue of Gifts and Caresses, to have had the use of his Body; but the Boy detesting his abominable purpose, made his escape from him, and came and told his Brother. The <hi>Dervich,</hi> without deliberating what Councel he had to give his younger Brother, gave him a Sword, such a one as he might easily hide under his Garment; and told him, that if the Governour urg'd him any more, that he should make a shew of complying with him, but that when he went about to do the fact, he should be sure to run him into the Guts. The Governour, who knew nothing of what the Page had reveal'd to his Brother, ceas'd not every day to court him to consent to his infamous lust; and being one day alone with him in a small Apartment of a Banquetting-House, at the lower end of his Garden, he sent for his Page to fan him, and to keep off the Flies, after the fashion of the Country; for it was about noon, when every one goes to sleep. Then did the Governour begin again to press the young Page; and finding that he made no resistance, he thought he should suddenly accomplish his design. But the Page seeing him ready to commit the act, stab'd him three times into the Belly, before he could open his mouth to cry out for help. That done, the Page went out of the Palace, without any disturbance In his countenance; so that the Guards believ'd that the Governour had sent him out upon some errand. The <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vich</hi> understanding by his Brother what had pass'd, to save him from the fury of the people, and to discover the Infamy of the Governour, caus'd the rest of the <hi>Dervichs</hi> his Companions, to take the Banners of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that were planted round the <hi>Mosquee;</hi> and at the same time with loud cries encourag'd all the rest of the <hi>Dervichs, Faquirs,</hi> and others that were good <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> to follow him. In less than an hours time he had got together an infinite multitude of the Rabble, and the <hi>Dervich</hi> marching at the head of them, they made directly to the Palace, crying out with all their might, <hi>Let us dye for</hi> Mahomet, <hi>or let us have that infamous person deliver'd up into our hands, to the end the Dogs may eat him after his death, not being worthy to be enterr'd among the Musselmen.</hi> The Guard of the Palace was not in a condition to resist so great a Multitude, so that they must have been forced to have yeilded to their fury, had not the <hi>Deroga</hi> of the Town, and some five or six Lords, found a way to make themselves to be heard, and to appease them, by representing to them, that they ought to have some respect to the Nephew of the King; by that means obliging them to retire. That night the Body of the Governour was sent to <hi>Agra,</hi> with his <hi>Haram;</hi> and <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> who then reign'd, being inform'd of the accident, was not much troubl'd, because he is Heir to all the goods of his Subjects; and at the same time he bestow'd upon the Page a small Government in the Province of <hi>Bengala.</hi>

                        <p>Before we go any farther, you must take notice, that where-ever you meet with the word <hi>Sera,</hi> it signifies a great Enclosure of Walls and Hedges, within which are about fifty or sixty Huts, cover'd over with Straw. There are some men and women that there put to sale Flower, Rice, Butter, and Herbs, and make it their business to bake Bread and boil Rice. If there be any <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> in that place, he will go to the City, and buy a little piece of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or a Fowl; and those that sell Victuals to the Travellers, always cleanse the Hut which they take up, and put into it a little Bed with girths, to lay a Mattress or Quilt upon, which the Travellers carry along with them.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Seronge</hi> is a great City, the most part of the Inhabitants whereof are <hi>Banian</hi> Merchants, and Handicraft-trades-men from Father to Son, which is the reason that there are in this City several Houses of Stone and Brick. There is also a great Trade for all sorts of painted Calicuts, which are called <hi>Chites;</hi> which is the cloathing of all the meaner sort of people both in <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Turkey:</hi> Of which in other Countreys also they make use, for Coverlets for Beds, and Table-napkins. They make the same sort of Calicuts in other Countreys as well as at <hi>Seronge,</hi> but the colours are not so lively; besides, that they wear out with often wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whereas those that are made at <hi>Seronge,</hi> the more you wash them the fairer the colours shew. There runs a River by the City, the water whereof has that vertue, that it gives that beauty and liveliness to the colours. And all the while the rains fall, the Workmen will make these prints upon their Cottons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Patterns which the Forreign Merchants give them; for when the waters are ceas'd the water is the thicker; and the oftener they dip their Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuts, the better the colours hold.</p>
                        <p>There is also made at <hi>Seronge</hi> another sort of Calicut, which is so fine, that when a man puts it on, his skin shall appear through it, as if he were naked. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are not permitted to transport it. For the Governour sends it all to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and to the principal Lords of the Court. Of this, the Sultanesses, and great Noblemen's Wives make them Shifts and Garments in hot-weather: And the King and the Lords take great pleasure to behold them in those Shifts, and to see them Dance with nothing else upon their Bodies.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Brampore</hi> to <hi>Seronge</hi> is an hundred and one costes, which are longer than those from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Brampore;</hi> for the Coach is a full hour, and sometimes five quarters, going one of these costes. In these hundred leagues of the Countrey you travel whole days journeys along by most fertil Fields of Corn and Rice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lovely Champaign, where you meet with very little Wood; and from <hi>Seronge</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> the Countrey is much of the same nature: And because the Villages lye thick together, your journey is the more pleasant; besides, that you may rest when you please.</p>

                           <hi>Callabas</hi> is a great Town, which was formerly the Residence of a <hi>Raja,</hi> who paid Tribute to the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> But when <hi>Orang-zeb</hi> came to the Crown, he not only cut off his, but a great number of the heads of his Subjects. There are two Towers near the Town, upon the high-way, and round about the Towers are several holes, like windows; and in every hole, two foot distant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is fix'd a man's head. In my last Travels in the year 1665, it had not been long since that Execution had been done; for then all the Heads were whole, and caus'd a very ill smell.</p>

                           <hi>Collasar</hi> is a little Town, all the Inhabitants whereof are Idolaters. As I past through it upon my last Travels, there were brought to it eight Pieces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, the one carrying 48 pound-Bullet, the rest 36. Every Piece was drawn
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106224:172"/>
by 24 Yoke of Oxen. A very strong Elephant follow'd the Artillery, and when they came to any bad-way, where the Oxen were at a stand, they brought up the Elephant, who heav'd the Cannon forward with his Trunk. Without the Town, all along the high-way, there grows a vast number of great Trees, which they call <hi>Mangues;</hi> and in many places neer the Trees are to be seen little Pagods, with every one an Idol at the door. The Elephant passing by one of the Pagods, before which I was lodg'd, at the door whereof there stood three Idols about five foot high; so soon as he came near one, he took it up in his trunk, and broke it in two pieces; the next he took, he threw it up so high, and so far, that he broke it in four pieces; and carried away the head of the third along with him. Some thought that the Governour of the Elephant had taught him what to do, and made signs to him, which however I did not observe; nevertheless the <hi>Banians</hi> were very much offended, though they durst not say any thing; for there was a Guard of above two thousand men that convoy'd the Artillery, all Souldiers of the King, and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> besides <hi>Franguis,</hi> or <hi>Franks, English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> that were Cannoneers. The King sent this Artillery to his Army in <hi>Decan,</hi> being at Wars with the <hi>Raja Sova-gi,</hi> who the year before had plunder'd <hi>Surat;</hi> of whom I shall have occasion to speak in another place.</p>

                           <hi>Gate</hi> is a strait passage of the Mountains, a quarter of a league in length, the descent whereof leads from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Agra.</hi> At the entry thereof you see the ruins of two or three Castles, and the Road is so narrow, that two Waggons can hardly go a breast. They that come from the South to go to <hi>Agra,</hi> as from <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, Goa, Visapore, Golconda, Maslipatan,</hi> and other places, cannot avoid these streights, there being no other Road but this, especially if you take the Road from <hi>Amadabat.</hi> Formerly there was a Gate at each end of the streight, and at that end which is next to <hi>Agra,</hi> there are five or six Shops of <hi>Banians,</hi> that sell Flower, Butter, Rice, Herbs and Pulse. In my last Travels I staid at one of these Shops, to carry for the Coaches and Waggons, all the Passengers alighting at the foot of the Streights. Not far off there is a great Magazin full of sacks of Rice and Corn; and behind every sack lay a Serpent thirteen or fourteen foot long, and proportionable in bigness. A Woman that went to fetch Corn out of one of those sacks, was bitten by one of those Serpents, and perceiving her self wounded, ran out of the Magazin, crying out <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> that is, <hi>O God, O God;</hi> whereupon several <hi>Banians,</hi> men and women came running to her relief, and bound her arm very hard above the wound, thinking to stop the venom from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any higher. But all in vain, for immediately her face swell'd, and turn'd black, and she dy'd in less than an hour. The <hi>Ragipou's,</hi> who are the best Souldiers among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and are all Idolaters, came in just as the woman was expiring, and about four of them entring with their Skains, and Half-pikes in their hands into the Magazin, kill'd the Serpent. The people of the Village took and threw it without the Town, and immediately there came a great number of Birds of prey, which lighting upon the Carrion, devour'd it in less than an hours time. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the woman took her body, carri'd it to the River, wash'd it, and then burnt it. I was forc'd to stay two days at that place, because there was a River to pass, which instead of falling, swell'd at that time, by reason of the rains that fell for three or four days together: So that I was constrain'd to go half a league lower before I could cross it. They always endeavour'd to ford this River; for otherwise they must be compell'd to unload the Waggon into the Boats; and also to carry the Goods in their arms for above half a league, which is worse way than can be imagin'd. The people get their livings by the Passengers, from whom they extort as much as they can, there being none but they that know the ways: Otherwise it would be an easy thing to make a Bridg, there being no want either of Wood or Stone near at hand. For the passage is nothing but thorough Rocks, that lie between the Mountain and the River; so that the waters when they swell, overflow all the Road, in-so-much that no-body can pass it, but they who are very well acquainted with it.</p>

                           <hi>Nader</hi> is a great City upon the descent of a Mountain, at the top whereof is a kind of a Fortress; all the Mountain being encompast with walls. The greatest part of the Houses, as in all other Cities of <hi>India,</hi> are thatch'd with straw, one Story high; but the Rich-men's Houses, are two Stories, and terrass'd. Round about the City are several great Ponds to be seen, which were formerly encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past with hewn-stone, but now are not at all look'd after; yet there are very fair Monuments about them. The same River which we past the day before, and which we repass four or five <hi>Costes</hi> on this side <hi>Nader,</hi> encompasses three parts of the City and Mountain, like a <hi>Peninsula,</hi> and after a long winding-course which it takes, falls at length into <hi>Ganges.</hi> At <hi>Nader</hi> they make a great quantity of quilted-Coverlets, some white, others embroidered with Flowers of Gold, Silk and Satin.</p>

                           <hi>Goualeor</hi> is a great City ill-built, like all the rest, after the manner of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> it is built all along the side of a Mountain that lies upon the West-side of it; and which at the top is encompast with Walls and Towers. There are in this Enclosure several Ponds made by the rains; and what they sow there is sufficient to keep the Garrison: For which reason it is esteem'd one of the best in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> Upon the descent of the Hill, which looks towards the North-east, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jehan</hi> built an House of Pleasure; from whence there is a Prospect over all the City, and indeed it may serve for a Garrison. Below the House are to be seen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Idols cut out of the Rock, representing the shapes of their Gods: And among the rest, there is one of an extraordinary heighth.</p>
                        <p>Since the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings became Masters of this Countrey, this Fortress of <hi>Goualeor</hi> is the place where they secure Princes and great Noblemen. <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> coming to the Empire by foul-play, caus'd all the Princes and Lords whom he mistrusted, to be seiz'd one after another, and sent them to the Fortress of <hi>Goua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leor;</hi> but he suffer'd them all to live, and enjoy their Estates, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> his Son acts quite otherwise: For when he sends any great Lord to this place, at the end of nine or ten days he orders him to be poison'd; and this he does that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not exclaim against him for a bloody Prince.

                        <p>FRom <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Baroche,</hi> costes</p>
                        <p>All the Countrey between these two Cities is full of Corn, Rice, Millet, and Sugar-Canes. Before you enter into <hi>Baroche,</hi> you must Ferry over the River which runs to <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and falls into the Golf that carries the same name.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Baroche</hi> is a great City, to which there belongs a Fortress, of which there is no use made at this time. But the City has been always very famous, by reason of the River, which has a particular quality to whiten their Cottons; which are brought thither from all parts of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Territories, where they have not that convenience. In this place are made a great quantity of Baffa's, or long and large pieces of Cotton. These Cottons are very fair, and close woven; and the price of these pieces is from four to an hundred Roupies. You must pay Custom at <hi>Baroche</hi> for all Goods that are brought in and carri'd out. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> have a very fair House in the City; and I remember once, that coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one day in my return from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Agra</hi> with the President of the <hi>English,</hi> presently the Mountebanks came about him, and ask'd him if he would see any of their tricks. The first thing they did was to light a great fire, and to heat cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Iron-chains red-hot, and wind them about their bodies, making as if they felt a great deal of pain, but in truth receiving no harm at all. Then they thrust a piece of a stick into the ground, and ask'd the Company what Fruit they would have. One told them, he would have <hi>Mengues;</hi> then one of the Mountebanks hiding himself in the middle of a Sheet, stoopt to the ground five or six times one after another. I was so curious to go up stairs, and look out of a window, to see if I could spy what the Mountebank did; and perceived, that after he had cut himself under the armpits with a Razor, he rubb'd the stick with his Blood. After the two first times that he rais'd himself, the stick seem'd to the very eye to grow. The third time there sprung out branches with young buds. The fourth time the Tree was covered with leaves; and the fift time it bore flowers. The President of the <hi>English</hi> had then his Minister with him, having brought him from <hi>Amadabat</hi> to Christen the Commander of the <hi>Hollander</hi>'s Child, to which he had promised to be Godfather. The <hi>English</hi> Minister protested that he could not give his consent that any Christian should be a spectator of such delusions. So that as soon as he saw that those Mountebanks had of a dry-stick, in less than half an hour, made a Tree four or five foot high, that bare leaves and flowers as in the Spring-time; he went about to break it, protesting he would not give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to any person that should stay any longer to see those things. Thereupon the President was forc'd to dismiss the Mountebanks, who wander about the Countrey with their Wives and Children just like Gipsies; and having given them to the value of ten or twelve Crowns, they went away very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
                        <p>They that are curious to see <hi>Cambaya,</hi> never go out of their way above five or six Costes, or thereabout. For when you are at <hi>Baroche,</hi> instead of going to <hi>Broudra,</hi> you may go directly forward to <hi>Cambaya,</hi> from thence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Amadabat.</hi> But whether it be for business, or out of curiosity, the latter Road is never to be taken; not only because it is the longest way, but because of the danger in crossing the mouth of the Golf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cambaya</hi> is a great City at the bottom of the Golf that bears its name. Here it is that they shape those fair <hi>Agats,</hi> that come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> into Cups, Hasts of Knives, Beads, and other sorts of Workmanship. In the parts adjacent to the City, they also make <hi>Indigo</hi> of the same nature of that of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106224:173"/>
                           <hi>Sarquess;</hi> and it was famous for traffick at the time when the <hi>Portugueses</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd in <hi>India.</hi> There are to be seen at this day, in the Quarter next the Sea, very fair Houses, which they had built, with very rich Furniture, after the <hi>Portugal</hi> manner; but now they are uninhabited, and fall to decay every day more and more. There were then such good Orders observ'd in <hi>Cambaya,</hi> that two hours after day was shut in, every Street was lockt up with two Gates, which are still to be seen; and still they continue to lock up the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Streets, as also the Streets that lead into the Town. One of the chief reasons why the Town has lost the greatest part of its Trade is, because that formerly the Sea run close up to <hi>Cambaya,</hi> so that little Vessels easily anchor'd by it; but afterwards the Sea daily lost in that part, so that a small Ship could not ride within five or six Leagues of the City.</p>
                        <p>There are a great number of Peacocks in the <hi>Indies,</hi> especially in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Baroche, Cambaya,</hi> and <hi>Broudra.</hi> The flesh of the young ones is white and well-tasted, like ours, and you shall see vast numbers of them all day in the Fields, for at night they roost upon the Trees. 'Tis a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come near them in the day, for as soon as they perceive themselves hunted, they fly away as swift as a Partridg among the Bushes; so that it is impossible for any man to follow them without tearing his Cloaths all to rags; therefore are they only to be taken in the night time, to which purpose they have this invention. They approach the Tree with a kind of a Banner, upon which there is a Peacock painted to the life on both sides; at the top of the stick are fasten'd two lighted Candles, the brightness whereof amazing the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, causes him to stretch out his Neck toward the end of the stick, to which there is a Rope ty'd with a sliding knot, which he that holds the Banner draws, when he finds that the Peacock has put his Neck into it. But you must have a care of killing either Bird, or any other Animal in the Territories, of which the idolatrous <hi>Raja's</hi> are Masters; which it is nothing dangerous to do in those parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> where the Governours are <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and give liberty to Fowl or Hunt. It happen'd one time that a rich <hi>Persian</hi> Merchant, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Dantivar,</hi> shot a Peacock upon the road, and kill'd it, either out of rashness, or ignorance of the Customs of the Country. The <hi>Bannians</hi> incens'd at the attempt, which is accounted among them a most abominable sacriledg, seiz'd upon the Merchant, and all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the value of 300000. Roupies, and tying him to a Tree, whipt him in so terrible a manner for three days together, that the man dy'd.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Cambaya</hi> you go to a little Village distant some three Costes, where there is a Pagod, to which all the <hi>Indian</hi> Curtisans come to make their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. This Pagod is full of a great number of naked Images, among the rest, there is a large Figure of one that seems to resemble <hi>Apollo,</hi> with his privy parts all uncover'd. When the old Curtisans have got together a good sum of Money in their youth, they buy young Slaves, whom they teach to Daunce, and sing wanton Songs, and instruct in all the mysteries of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Art. And when these young Girls are eleven or twelve years old, their Mistresses send them to this Pagod, believing it will bring them good fortune, to offer and surrender up themselves to this Idol.</p>
                        <p>From this Pagod to <hi>Chiidabad</hi> you have six Costes. This is one of the fairest Houses of the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> with a wide Enclosure, wherein he has vast Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and large Ponds, with all the pleasures and curiosity whereof the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the <hi>Indians</hi> is capable.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Chiidabad</hi> to <hi>Amadabad</hi> you have but five Costes; and so I return to <hi>Baroche,</hi> and the common Road.</p>

                           <hi>Amadabat</hi> is one of the greatest Cities in <hi>India;</hi> and where there is a mighty Trade for Silk-Stuffs, Hangings of Gold and Silver, and others mix'd with Silk; for <hi>Saltpeter, Sugar, Ginger</hi> candid and raw; <hi>Tamarins, Mirobolans,</hi> and flat
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106224:174"/>
                           <hi>Indigo,</hi> which is made at a great Town, not far from <hi>Amadabat,</hi> called <hi>Sarquess.</hi> There was in that place a <hi>Pagod,</hi> which the <hi>Mahumetan's</hi> have pull'd down, and built a <hi>Mosquee</hi> in the place. Before you enter into it, you must cross three large Courts pav'd with Marble, and encompast with Galleries; nor must you enter into the third Court till you have pull'd off your shooes. The inside of the <hi>Mosquee</hi> is adorn'd with <hi>Mosaic-</hi>work, the greatest part whereof is of <hi>Agats</hi> of divers colours, which they fetch from the Mountains of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> not above two days journey off. There are several Sepulchres of the ancient Idolatrous Kings, that look like little Chappels, of <hi>Mosaic-</hi>work, built upon a Vaut that is under the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. There runs a River from <hi>Amadabat</hi> toward the North-west, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rainy-seasons that continue three or four Months together, is very wide and rapid, and does much mischief every year. It is so with all the other Rivers in <hi>India;</hi> and after the rains are fallen, you must stay six weeks or two months before you can ford <hi>Amadabat-</hi>River, where there is no Bridg. There are two or three Boats; but they are of no use, when the stream is so swift; so that you must stay till the waters are fall'n. But the people of the Countrey will not stay so long; for to cross from one River to another, they only make use of Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, which they blow up and fill with wind, and then tye them between their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks and their bellies. Thus the poor men and women swim cross this River, and when they would carry their children along with them, they put them in certain round pots of Earth, the mouth whereof is four-fingers wide, and drive the Pots before them. This puts me in mind of a Passage, when I was at <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabat</hi> in the year 1642, which is too remarkable to be omitted.</p>
                        <p>A Countrey-man and a Countrey-woman one day past the River as I have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and having a child about two years old, they put it into one of these Pots, so that there was nothing but the head appear'd. Being about the middle of the River, they met with a little bank of Sand, where there lay an huge Tree, which the stream had carri'd thither; whereupon the Father shov'd the Pot toward that part, to rest himself a-while. When he came near the Tree, the trunk whereof lay somewhat above the water, a Serpent leapt out from among the roots, into the Pot where the Infant was. The Father and the Mother frighted at the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and having almost lost their senses, let the Pot go a-drift where the stream carri'd it, and lay almost dead themselves at the bottom of the Tree. About two leagues lower, a <hi>Banian</hi> and his Wife with a little Infant, were washing themselves in the River before they went to eat. They descry'd the Pot a-far-off, with the half of the Infant's-head that appear'd above the hole. The <hi>Banian</hi> immediately swims to the relief of the child, and having stopp'd the Pot, drives it to the shoar. The Mother follow'd by her own, comes presently to take the other child out of the Pot, at what time the Serpent that had done no harm to the other child, shoots out of the Pot, and winding about hers, stings it, and infuses its venom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Insant, so that it dy'd immediately. However, the accident, being so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, did not trouble those poor people; who rather believ'd it to have happen'd by the secret disposal of their Deity, who had taken from them one child, to give them another for it, with which opinion they presently comforted themselves. Some time after, the report of this accident coming to the ears of the first Countrey-man, he comes to the <hi>Banian</hi> to tell him how the mischance had happen'd, and to demand his child of him; the other <hi>Indian</hi> affirming that the child was his, and that his God had sent it him, in the place of that which was dead. To be short, the business made so loud a noise, that it was at length brought before the King, who order'd, that the child should be restor'd to the Father.</p>
                        <p>At the same time there happen'd another very pleasant accident in the same City of <hi>Amadabat.</hi> The Wife of a rich Merchant <hi>Banian,</hi> nam'd <hi>Saintidas,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having had a child, and manifesting her eager desire to have one, a servant of the House took her a-side one day, and told her, that if she would but eat that which he would give her, she should be with child. The woman desirous to know what she was to eat, the servant told her it was a little fish, and that she should eat but three or four. Now the Religion of the <hi>Banians</hi> forbidding them to eat any thing that has life, she could not resolve at first to yield to his proposal; but the servant having promised her that he would so order the matter, that she
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106224:174"/>
should not know whether it were fish or no that she eat, she resolv'd to try his receit, and went the next night to lie with her Husband, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction which she had received from the servant. Some time after, the woman perceiving that she was big, her Husband happen'd to die, and the kindred of the deceased would have his Estate. The Widow opposed them, and told them that it behov'd them to stay, till they saw whether the child she went withal, would live or no. Her kindred were surpriz'd to hear such news that they so little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and tax'd her for one that either ly'd or jested with them; knowing that the woman had liv'd fifteen or sixteen years with her Husband, yet never had been with child. Seeing therefore that her kindred still tormented her, she went and threw her self at the Governour's feet, to whom she related all that had past, who thereupon order'd that the kindred should stay till the woman was deliver'd. Some days after she had lain-in, the kindred of the deceas'd Merchant, who were persons of Credit, and gap'd after so fair an inheritance, affirm'd that the child was not legitimate, and that she had it not by her Husband. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to understand the truth of the matter, calls for the Physitians; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Infant should be carri'd to the <hi>Bath,</hi> saying, that if the Receit which the Mother had made use of, were real, the sweat of the child would smell of fish; which was done accordingly, and the Experiment prov'd true. Thereupon the Governour order'd that the child should have the Estate, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant being so proud to be his Father: But the Kindred, troubl'd that such a fat Morsel had escap'd their mouths, appeal'd to the King. Upon their relation of the story, the King wrote to the Governour to send him the Mother and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, to the end the Experiment might be made in his presence: which having the same success as before, the kindred succeas'd their claim, and the Estate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd to the Mother and the Infant.</p>
                        <p>I remember also another pleasant Story which was related to me at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> where I have been ten or twelve times. A Merchant with whom I often dealt, and who was very well belov'd by <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> Governour of the Province, and the King's Unckle, had the reputation never to have told a lye. <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> after the three years of his Government were expir'd, according to the custom of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and that <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> the King's Son was come into his place, retir'd to <hi>Agra,</hi> where the Court then was. One day, discoursing with the King, he told him, that he had seen many rare things in the Governments, with which his Majesty had honour'd him, but that one thing above all the rest had astonish'd him, to have met with a Rich Merchant that had never told a lye, and yet he was above threescore and ten years of age. The King surpriz'd at a thing so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, signified to <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> his desire to see the person, and commanded him to send for him to <hi>Agra,</hi> which he did. The Old-man was very much troubl'd, as well in regard of the length of the way, it being a journey of 25 or or 30 days, as for that he was to make a Present to the King. In short, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one, esteem'd at forty-thousand Roupies, to carry <hi>Betlé</hi> in, enchas'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and Emraulds. When he had made his obeysance to the King, and given him his Present, the King ask'd him only what was his name, to whom he replied, that he was call'd the man that had never told a lye. Then the King ask'd him who was his Father? Sir, said he, I cannot tell; his Majesty satisfi'd with that answer, stopt there, and unwilling to trouble him any farther, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Elephant to be given him, which is a very great Honour, and ten-thousand Roupies to bear his charges home.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Banians</hi> have a great Veneration for Apes, and there are some which they breed up in their Pagods to worship. There are three or four Houses in <hi>Amad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abat</hi> which they make use of for Hospitals for Cowes, Oxen, Apes, and other fick or maim'd Beasts; and they carry all they can find thither to preserve them. This is also very remarkable, that every Tuesday and Friday, all the Apes in the places adjoyning to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> of their own accord come to the City, and get upon the tops of their Houses, where they lye, during the excessive heats. And therefore upon those days the people never fail to set ready in their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasses, Rice, Millet, Sugar-Canes in their seasons, and other such-like things. For if the Apes did not find their provision when they came, they would break the Tiles where-with the rest of the House is cover'd, and do a great deal of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106224:175"/>
And you must here take notice also, that the Ape never eats any thing whïch he does not very well like the scent of before-hand; and before he swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows any-thing, he lays up his Magazin against future hunger; filling his bags with provision, which he keeps till next day.</p>
                        <p>I have said, that the <hi>Banians</hi> have a particular Veneration for the Ape; of which I will give you one Example, among many, that I could bring. Being one day at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> at the House belonging to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> a young man of that Nation newly arriv'd to serve in the Factory, not knowing the custom of the Countrey, and seeing a great Ape upon a Tree in the Court, would needs shew a piece of activity, or rather a trick of youth, to kill the Ape with a small Gun. I was at Table then with the <hi>Dutch-</hi>Commander; and we no sooner heard the blow, but we heard as soon a loud noise of <hi>Banians,</hi> that wait upon the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company, who came to complain bitterly of him that had kill'd the Ape. They would all have been gone; so that the Commander had much ado, and made many excuses before he could appease them, and oblige them to stay.</p>
                        <p>In the Neighbourhood about <hi>Amadabat,</hi> there are a great number of Apes. And this is observable, that where there are a great number of those Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, there are very few Crows. For as soon as they have built their Nests and laid their Eggs, the Apes get upon the Trees and throw their Eggs to the Ground. One day returning from <hi>Agra,</hi> and departing out of <hi>Amada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat</hi> with the <hi>English</hi> President, who came hither about some business, and was returning to <hi>Surat,</hi> we pass'd through a little Forrest of Trees, call'd <hi>Mangues,</hi> some four or five Leagues from <hi>Amadabat;</hi> there we saw a vast number of great Monkeys, male and female, and many of the females holding their young ones in their Arms. We had each of us our Coach, and the <hi>English</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent causing his to stop, told me he had an excellent and very neat Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buss, that was presented him by the Governour of <hi>Daman,</hi> and knowing I could aim well, he desir'd me to try it, at one of those Apes. One of my Servants, who was born in the Country, making me a sign not to venture, I endeavoured to disswade the President from his design; but it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; so that I took the Harquebuss, and kill'd a female Monkey, who lay stretch'd out upon the Boughs, letting her little ones fall to the ground. But it fell out as my Servant had forewarn'd me. For immediately all the Monkeys that were upon the Trees, to the number of sixty, came down in a great fury, to have leap'd into the Presidents Coach, where they would soon have strangled him, had we not prevented them by closing the Shutters, and had we not had a great number of Servants, that with much ado kept them off. And though they came not to my Coach, yet I was very much afraid of my self; for they pursued the President's Coach above a League, and they were stout lusty Monkeys.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Chitpour</hi> is a very good City, so called by reason of the great Trade for painted-Calicuts, which are called <hi>Chites:</hi> Near which, some four or five-hundred paces toward the South, there runs a small River. Arriving at <hi>Chitpour</hi> in one of my Voyages, I pitch'd my Tent under two or three Trees at the end of a wide-place neer the Town. A little while after I saw four or five Lions appear, which were brought to be tam'd; which they told me took them up five or six months; and their way to do it, is this: They tye the Lions at twelve paces distance one from another by the hinder-legs, with a Rope fasten'd to a great woodden-stake set deep in the ground, with another cord about the neck, which the Master holds in his hand. These Stakes are planted in the same Line, and in another Parallel they stretch out another Cord as long as the space, which the bodies of the Lions so dispos'd of, as I have describ'd, take up. The two Cords which hold the Lion ty'd by the two hinder-feet, give him liberty to spring out as far as that long Cord; which is a mark to those that stand to provoke and incense the Lions, by throwing stones and pieces of wood at them, not to venture any farther: The people run to see the sight, and when the Lion, provok'd, gives a spring toward the Cord, the Master
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106224:175"/>
holds another in his hand, ty'd about his neck, that pulls him back. Thus they accustom the Lion by degrees to be familiar with the people, and at my coming to <hi>Chiapour,</hi> I saw this Divertisement without stirring out of my Coach.</p>
                        <p>The next day I had another, meeting with a knot of <hi>Faquirs,</hi> or <hi>Mahometan Dervichs.</hi> I counted fifty-seven, among whom, he that was the Chief or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, had been Grand Esquire to <hi>Cha-jehan-guir,</hi> having left the Court, when <hi>Sultan Boulaki,</hi> his youngest Son, was strangl'd by Order of <hi>Cha-jehan;</hi> there were four others, who next to the Superior, were chief of the Company, who had been also great Lords in the same <hi>Cha-jehan's</hi> Court. All the Cloaths those five <hi>Dervichs</hi> had, were only four ells of Orange-colour-Calicut to hide what modesty will have hid before and behind, and every one of them a Tygers-skin over their shoulders ty'd together under their chins. They had led before them eight fair Horses saddl'd and bridl'd; three whereof had Bridles of Gold, and Saddles cover'd with Plates of Gold, and the other five had Bridles of Silver cover'd with Plates of Silver, and a Leopard's-skin upon every one. The other <hi>Dervichs</hi> had only a Cord for their Girdle, to which was fasten'd a piece of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut only to cover their private parts. Their hair was ty'd in wreaths round about their heads after the manner of a Turbant. They were all well-arm'd, the most part with Bows and Arrows, some with Muskets, and others with Half-pikes, with another sort of weapon which we have not in <hi>Europe;</hi> that is to say, a sharp piece of Iron like the side of a Platter without a bottom, which they wind eight or ten times about their necks, and carry like a Calves Chaldron. They draw out these Iron-Circles as they intend to make use of them; and they will throw them with such a force against a man, that they shall fly as swift as an Arrow, and go very neer to cut a man in two in the middle. They had every one, besides all this, an Hunting-Horn, which they wind, making a prodigious noise when they come to any place, and when they go away; together with a Grater or Rasp, being an Iron-Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made like a Trowel. This is an Instrument which the <hi>Indians</hi> carry gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally about them when they travel, to scrape and make clean the places where they intend to rest; and some of them, when they have scrap'd all the dust to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into an heap, make use of it instead of a Mattress or Pillow to lie easily upon. There were some of them that were arm'd with long Tucks; which they had bought either of the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Portugals.</hi> Their Luggage consisted of four great Chests full of <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Books, and some Kitchen-housholdstuff: They had also ten or twelve Oxen to carry their sick. When the <hi>Dervichs</hi> came to the place where I lay with my Coach, having about fifty persons with me, as well of the people of the Countrey, as of my own servants; the Chief or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of the Troop seeing me so well-attended, enquir'd what <hi>Aga</hi> that was; and desir'd me to let him have that place which I had taken up, as being the most convenient in all that place, for him and his <hi>Dervichs</hi> to lodg. When they told me the quality of the Chief, and the four <hi>Dervichs</hi> that attended him, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be civil, and to yield to their request; and thereupon I left them the place free. After they had well-water'd the place, and laid the dust, they lighted two fires, as if it had been in the frost and snow, for the five principal <hi>Dervichs,</hi> who sate and chaf'd themselves before and behind. That very evening, after they had supp'd, the Governour of the Town came to complement the principal <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vichs,</hi> and during their stay, sent them Rice and other things, which they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to eat. When they come to any place, the Superior sends some of his Crew a begging into the Towns and Villages, and what Alms they get, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently distributed equally among them; every one of them taking care to boil his own Rice. What is over and above they give to the Poor in the evening; for they reserve nothing till next day.</p>

                           <hi>Bargant</hi> is in the Territories of a <hi>Raja,</hi> to whom you pay duties. In one of my journeys to <hi>Agra,</hi> passing through <hi>Bargant,</hi> I did not see the <hi>Raja,</hi> but only his Lieutenant, who was very civil to me, and made me a Present of Rice, Butter, and Fruit in season. To make him amends, I gave him three Shashes of Gold
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106224:176"/>
and Silk, four Handkerchiefs of painted Linnen, and two Bottles, the one full of <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and the other full of <hi>Spanish-</hi>Wine. At my departure he sent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of twenty Horse four or five leagues along with me.</p>
                        <p>One evening, being about to lodg upon the Frontiers of the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Bargant,</hi> my people came to me and told me, that if we took the Road through <hi>Bargant,</hi> we should go neer to have all our throats cut, for that the <hi>Raja</hi> of that place liv'd altogether upon Robbery. So that unless I hir'd an hunder'd more of the Countrey-people, there was no likelihood of escaping those Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booters. At first I argu'd with them, and tax'd their Cowardice, but fearing to pay for my rashness afterwards, I sent them to hire fifty more, for three days only, that we cross'd the <hi>Raja</hi>'s Countrey: for which they ask'd me every one four Roupies, which is as much as you give them for a whole Month. The next day as I was about to set forward, my Guard came and told me they would leave me, and that they would not venture their lives, desiring me not to write to <hi>Agra</hi> to their Captain, who was responsible for them, that they had left me against my will. Three of my servants also did as they did, so that I had no body left with me, but a man that lead an Horse in his hand, my Coachman, and three other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and so I set forward under the protection of God. About a league from the place which I had left, I perceived some part of my Convoy following me. Thereupon I stopt my Coach to stay for them, and when they came neer, I bid them advance if they intended to go along with me. But seeing them fearful, and unresolv'd, I bid them go about their business, telling them I had no need of such Cowards as they were. About a league from thence I discover'd upon the brow of an Hill about fifty Horse, four of which came riding up to me; when I perceived them, I alighted out of my Coach, and having with me some thirteen Spit-fires, I gave to every one of my men an Harquebuss. The Horse-men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, I kept my Coach between them and me, and had my Gun ready cockt, in case they should assail me. But they made me a sign, that I should fear nothing; only that the Prince was a Hunting, and had sent to know what Strangers past through his Territories: I made answer, that I was the same <hi>Franguy</hi> that had past by five or six weeks before. By good luck, the very same Lieutenant to whom I had made the Present of <hi>Aquavitae</hi> and <hi>Spanish-</hi>Wine, follow'd those four Horsemen. And after he had testify'd how glad he was to see me, he ask'd me if I had any Wine; I told him I never travell'd without that: For indeed the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> had presented me with several Bottels at <hi>Agra.</hi> So soon as the Lieutenant was return'd to the <hi>Raja,</hi> the <hi>Raja</hi> himself came to me, and told me I was welcome; and bid me rest my self in a shady-place which he pointed to, about a league and an half from the place where we were. In the evening he came, and we staid together two days to make merry; the <hi>Raja</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with him certain Morrice-dancers, without which the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> can never think themselves heartily merry. At my departure the <hi>Raja</hi> lent me 200 Horse, to convoy me to the Frontiers of his Territories, for three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for which I only gave them three or four pound of Tobacco. When I came to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> the people would hardly believe that I had had so kind a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from a Prince, that was noted for abusing strangers that past through his Countrey.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>I Have made an exact description of some part of the Road, and brought the Reader as far as <hi>Candahar;</hi> it remains, that I carry him from <hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Agra;</hi> to which there are but two ways to go, either through <hi>Caboul,</hi> or through <hi>Mlultan.</hi> The latter way is the shorter by ten days journey. But the Caravan never goes that way. For from <hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Multan</hi> you travel almost all the way through Desarts; and sometimes you travel three or four days without meeting any water. So that the most ordinary and beaten Road, is through <hi>Caboul.</hi> Now from <hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Caboul,</hi> is twenty-four days journey; from <hi>Caboul</hi> to <hi>Lahor,</hi> twenty-two; from <hi>Lahor</hi> to <hi>Dehly,</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banabat,</hi> eighteen; from <hi>Dehly</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> six; which with the sixty days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Farat,</hi> and the twenty from <hi>Farat</hi> to <hi>Candahar,</hi> makes in all from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> an hundred and fifty days journey. But the Merchants that are in haste, take Horses, three or four together in a company, and ride the whole journey in sixty, or sixty-five days at most.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Multan</hi> is a City where there is made a vast quantity of Linnen Calicuts, which was all transported to <hi>Tuta,</hi> before the Sands had stop'd up the mouth of the River; but since that, it is carry'd all to <hi>Agra,</hi> and from <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> as is the greatest part of the Merchandize which is made at <hi>Lahor.</hi> But in regard carriage is so dear, very few Merchants traffick either to <hi>Multan</hi> or at <hi>Lahor;</hi> and many of the Workmen have also deserted those places, so that the Kings Revenues are very much diminished in those Provinces. <hi>Multan</hi>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106224:177"/>
is the place whither all the <hi>Banians</hi> come, that trade into <hi>Persia,</hi> where they follow the same Trade as the <hi>Jews,</hi> and out-do them in Usury. They have a particular Law among them, which permits them to eat Fowl upon certain days in the year; and not to have more than one Wife among two or three Brothers, the eldest whereof is accounted the Father of the Children. This City also breeds abundance of Dancers, of both Sexes, that spread themselves all over <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I come now to the Road from <hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> through <hi>Caboul</hi> and <hi>Lahor.</hi>

                        <p>In all these forty <hi>Costes</hi> of way, there are but three pitiful Villages; where sometimes, though very rarely, you have Bread and Barley for your Horses; but the surest way is to carry provision along with you. In the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> there blows a hot Wind in those parts, that takes away a mans breath, and kills him upon the place; being of the same nature with those Winds, of which I have spoken in my <hi>Persian</hi> Relations, that blow at certain seasons near <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Moussul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caboul</hi> is a large City, very well fortified; and is the place where those of <hi>Usbek</hi> come every year to sell their Horses. They reckon, that there are bought and sold, every year, above sixty thousand. They bring also out of <hi>Persia,</hi> great numbers of Sheep, and other Cattel; it being the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Persians, Tartarians,</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> There is also Wine to be had; but Provisions go off at a very good rate.</p>
                        <p>Before I go any farther, I must take notice of one thing in particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the people call'd <hi>Augans,</hi> who inhabit from <hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Caboul,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Mountains of <hi>Balch,</hi> a sturdy sort of people, and great Robbers in the night-time. It is the custom of the <hi>Indians</hi> to cleanse and scrape their tongues every morning with a crooked piece of a root, which causes them to void a great quantity of Flegm and Rhume, and provokes vomiting. Now though those people that inhabit the Frontiers of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>India</hi> practice the same thing; nevertheless they vomit very little in the morning, but when they come to eat, as soon as they have swallowed two or three bits, their lungs begin to swell, and they are constrain'd to go forth and vomit; after which, they return again to their Victuals with a very good appetite. Should they not do so, they would not live above thirty years; and besides, they would be troubl'd with the Dropsy.</p>

Father <hi>Roux</hi> the Jesuit and his Companion, going this way to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and not having the King's Passport, were forc'd to return back to <hi>Lahor,</hi> where they embark'd upon the River for <hi>Scimdi,</hi> from whence they past into <hi>Persia.</hi>

                           <hi>Lahor</hi> is the Metropolis of a Kingdom, built upon one of the five Rivers that descend from the Mountains of the North to swell the River <hi>Indus;</hi> and give the name of <hi>Peniab</hi> to all the Region which they water. This River at this time flows not within a league of the Town, being subject to change its Channel, and many times does very great mischief to the adjoyning Fields, through the rapid deluges which it makes. The City is large, and extends it self above a league in length. But the greatest part of the Houses, which are higher than those of <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Deli,</hi> fall to ruine, by reason of the excessive rains that have overflowed a great number of them. The King's Palace is an indifferent fair one, and is not, as formerly it was, upon the River, which is fall'n off above a quarter of a league from it. There is Wine to be had at <hi>Lahor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I must observe by the by, that after you have past <hi>Lahor,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Kakemir,</hi> that lies upon it toward the North, none of their Women have any hair upon any part of their bodies, and the Men but very little upon their chins.</p>

                        <p>Before you go any farther, you are to take notice that all the way from <hi>Lahor</hi> to <hi>Dehly,</hi> and from <hi>Dehly</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> is a continual Walk set on both sides with fair Trees; an object most pleasing to the sight: But in some places the Trees are decaid, and there is no care taken to Plant others in their stead.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dehly</hi> is a great City near the River <hi>Gemma,</hi> which runs from the North to the South, afterwards from the West to the East; and aftaer it has past by <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Kadione,</hi> empties it self into the <hi>Ganges.</hi> After <hi>Cha jaehan,</hi> had built the new. City of <hi>Gehanabad,</hi> which he call'd by his own Name; and where he chose rather to keep his Court, than at <hi>Agra,</hi> because the Climate is more temperate. <hi>Dehly</hi> is almost come to ruine, and indeed is nothing but an heap of Rubbish; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Houses remaining but only for poor people. The Streets are narrow, and the Houses of <hi>Bambouc,</hi> as over all the rest of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Neither are there above three or four Lords of the Court that reside at <hi>Dehly,</hi> where they set up their Tents in great Enclosures, and in the same manner lodg'd the Reverend Jesuit that was at Court.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gehanabad,</hi> as well as <hi>Dehly,</hi> is a great City; and there is nothing but a single Wall that makes the separation. All the Houses of particular men consist of great Enclosures, in the midst whereof is the place for Lodgings. The greatest part of the Lords do not live in the City, but have their Houses without, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the water. As you enter into <hi>Gehanabad</hi> from <hi>Dehly,</hi> you meet with a long and broad Street, on each side whereof are Vaults, where the Merchants keep shops, being only plat-form'd at the top. This street ends in the great <hi>Piazza</hi> before the King's House; and there is another very fair and large Street, that runs toward another Gate of the same Palace, in which live the great Merchants that keep no Shops.</p>
                        <p>The King's Palace takes up above half a league in circuit: The Walls are of fair cut-Stone with Battlements. The Moats are full of water, pav'd with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. The great Gate of the Palace has nothing in it of magnificence; no more than the first Court, into which the great Lords may enter upon their Elephants.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106224:178"/>
Having past that Court, you enter into another long and large passage, with fair Portico's on both sides. Under which are several little Chambers, where part of the Horse-Guard lies. These Portico's are rais'd some two foot above the ground, and the Horses which are ti'd without, feed upon the steps. In some places there are great Gates that lead to several Apartments; as to the Womens Lodgings, and to the Seat of Justice. In the midst of the passage runs a Cut full of water, leaving a fair Walk on each side, where, at equal distances, are little Basons or Fountains.</p>
                        <p>This long Passage carries you into a great Court, where the <hi>Omra</hi>'s, that is to say, the great Lords of the Kingdom, such as the <hi>Basha's</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the <hi>Kan's</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> keep Guard in Person. They have low Lodgings round about the Court, and their Horses are ti'd to their doors.</p>
                        <p>From this second Court you pass into a third, through a great Portal; on one side whereof there is a little Hall, rais'd some two or three steps high from the ground. This is the Wardrobe where the Royal Garments are kept; and from whence the King sends for the <hi>Calaat,</hi> or a whole Habit for a man, when he would honour any Stranger, or any one of his own Subjects. A little farther, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Portal, is the place where the Drums, Trumpets, and Hautboys are laid up; which they sound and beat a little before the King enters into his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat, to give notice to the <hi>Omrah's;</hi> and they make the same noise when the King is ready to rise. Entring into the third Court, you see the <hi>Divan</hi> before you, where the King gives Audience. This is a great Hall rais'd some four-foot-high above the superficies of the Court, with three sides open. Thirty-two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars sustain as many Arches; and these Columns are about four-foot-square, with Pedestals and Mouldings. When <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> first began to build this Hall, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have enrich'd it, and inlaid it all over with those Stones that seem to be naturally painted, like those in the Great Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi>'s Chappel. But having made a trial upon two or three Pillars, about two or three-foot-high, he found that there would not be Stones enough, of that sort, in the World to finish the work; besides the vastness of the Sum it would come to. So that he left off his design, contenting himself with a Painting of several flowers.</p>
                        <p>In the middle of this Hall, next to the side which looks toward the Court, there is a Throne erected upon a kind of Theater, where the King gives Audience, and pronounces Judgment. The Throne is a little Bed, with four Columns, about the bigness of one of our Field-Beds, with a Canopy, Backpiece, Boulster and Counterpoint, all embroider'd with Diamonds. Besides all this, when the King comes to sit upon the Throne, they throw over the Bed a Coverlet of Cloath of Gold, or some other richly-embroider'd Silk, and he ascends by three little steps, two-foot-broad. On one side of the Bed is erected an <hi>Umbrello</hi> upon a Staff, as long as an Half-Pike. Upon one of the Pillars of the Throne hangs one of the King's Weapons, upon another his Buckler; upon another his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metar; and then his Bow and Quiver of Arrows, and other things of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Below the Throne there is a place some twenty-foot-square, encompast with Balusters, which at some times are cover'd with Plates of Silver, at other times with Plates of Gold. At the four Corners of this small enclosure sit the four Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of State, who as well in Civil as Criminal Causes, do the duty of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates. Many Lords stund about this Balostrade; and there is also the Musick plac'd, that plays all the while the King is in the <hi>Divan.</hi> This Musick is so sweet and soft, that it never takes off the mind from the seriousness of business at that time manag'd. The King being sat upon his Throne, some great Lord stands by him; generally it is some one of his own Children. Between eleven a Clock and Noon, the <hi>Nahab;</hi> who is the chief Minister of State, like the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> makes a report to the King of what has past in the Chamber where he Presides, which is at the Entry of the first Court; and when he has done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the King rises. For you must take notice, that from the time that the King is sate upon his Throne, till he rises, no person whatsoever is permitted to stir out of the Palace; and yet I can say that the King dispenc'd with my performance of this Law so generally observ'd by all the Court: The occasion whereof was thus in short.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106224:178"/>
Being one day going out of the Palace, while the King was sitting in the <hi>Divan,</hi> upon some urgent business that would admit of no delay, the Captain of the Guards held me by the arm, and told me I should go no farther; I contested and argued the Case with him for some time, but finding his usage to be very boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, I lifted up my Cane, and had certainly strook him in my passion, had not two or three of the Guards that saw all the passages, held my hand. Happily for me at that time, the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who was then the King's Unckle, came by, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the ground of our quarrel; order'd the Captain of the Guards to let me go. After that he made a report to the King how the matter stood; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evening the <hi>Nahab</hi> sent me one of his Servants to tell me, it was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's pleasure, that I might come in or go out of the Palace, though he were sitting in the <hi>Divan,</hi> as I pleas'd my self; for which I went the next day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd thanks to the <hi>Nahab.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Toward the middle of the same Court there is a small Channel some five or six inches broad, where while the King is sitting upon the Seat of Justice, they that have business are to stand. Further it is not lawful for them to go, till they are call'd; and, Embassadors themselves are not exempted from this custom. When an Embassador comes as far as this Channel, the Master of the Ceremonies calls out toward the <hi>Divan</hi> where the King is sitting, that such an Embassador craves Audience of his Majesty. Then one of the Secretaries of State declares it to the King; who oftentimes makes as if he did not hear: But some time after lifting up his eyes, he casts them upon the Embassador, making him a sign by the same Secretary, that he may approach.</p>
                        <p>From the Hall of the <hi>Divan,</hi> turning to the left, you walk upon a Terrass, where you discover the River. Over this Terrass the King passes into a little Chamber, from whence he goes into his <hi>Haram.</hi> In this little Chamber it was that I had my first Audience of his Majesty; as I shall relate in another place.</p>
                        <p>Upon the left-hand of the Court where the <hi>Divan</hi> is built, stands a little <hi>Mosquee</hi> neatly built; the <hi>Cupola</hi> whereof is cover'd with Lead perfectly guilded. Here the King goes to hear Prayers every day, except it be Fridays, when he is to go to the great <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which is a very fair one, and plac'd upon an high Platform, rais'd higher than the Houses of the City, and there is a noble ascent to it. That day that the King goes to the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> they place huge rails of wood round about the steps, as well to keep off the Elephants, as out of respect to the <hi>Mosquee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The right-side of the Court is taken up with Portico's, that make a long Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, rais'd from the ground about half a foot; and these are the King's Stables, into which you have many doors to enter. They are also full of stately Horses, the worst whereof stands the King in three-thousand Crowns; and there are some that cost him ten-thousand. At the door of every one of these Stables hangs a kind of Mat made of <hi>Bambouc,</hi> that cleaves like our Osiers. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we bind our Osier-twigs with the same Osier, they bind their <hi>Bambouc's</hi> with wreath'd-Silk, which is delicate work, but very tedious. These Mats are to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Flies from tormenting the Horses; there being two Grooms to an Horse, one of which is still employ'd in sanning the Beast. There are also Mats spread before the Portico's, and before the Stable-door; which they spread or take away as occasion requires. And the Floor of the Gallery is cover'd with fair Carpets, which is taken away in the evening, and the Horses Litter strow'd in the same place. Which Litter is nothing but the Horse-dung dri'd in the Sun, and then squeez'd a little flat. The Horses that are brought into <hi>India</hi> either out of <hi>Persia, Arabia,</hi> or the Countrey of <hi>Vsbech,</hi> change their food: For in <hi>India</hi> they never give them Hay nor Oats. Every Horse in the morning having for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion three loaves made of Meal, Wheat, and Butter, as big as one of our six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny-loaves. 'Tis an hard matter to bring them to this diet at first; it being sometimes three or four Months before they can do it. The Groom is forc'd to hold their tongue in one hand, and to thrust down the bread with the other. When Sugar-Canes or Millet are in season, they give them that diet about noon; and in the evening, two hours before Sun-set, they give them a measure of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Chiches which the Groom squeezes between two stones, and mixes with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106224:179"/>
This is instead of Barley and Oats. As for the King's other Stables, where he has also very fine Horses, they are scurvy places, ill-built, which deserve not to be mention'd.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Gemene</hi> is a fair River that bears good big Boats, which running to <hi>Agra</hi> loses its name, falling into <hi>Ganges</hi> at <hi>Hallabas.</hi> The King has several small <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines</hi> at <hi>Gehanabad</hi> upon the River, to take his pleasure in; and they are very curiously trimm'd after the manner of the Countrey.</p>

                        <p>At <hi>Cheki-sera</hi> is one of the greatest Pagods of the <hi>Indians,</hi> together with an Hospital for Apes; as well for those that breed there-abouts, as for those that come from the neighbouring-parts, which the <hi>Banians</hi> are very careful to feed. This Pagod is call'd <hi>Matura,</hi> and it was formerly in far greater veneration than it is at this day. The reason is, because the <hi>Gemene</hi> ran then just at the very foot of the Pagod; wherein the <hi>Banians,</hi> as well those of the Countrey, as those that came from remote parts in Pilgrimage, had the convenience to wash themselves before they went to their Devotions; and when they had perform'd them, to wash again before they eat; which they are not to do ere they have wash'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving also that if they wash in running-water, their sins will be the more easily defac'd. But some years since the River, changing its course more to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, comes not within a good league of the Pagod, which is the reason that the Pilgrims have deserted it.</p>

                           <hi>Agra</hi> lies in 27 deg. 31 min. of Lat. and in a Sandy-soil, which causes extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of heat. It is the biggest City in <hi>India,</hi> and formerly the Residence of their Kings. The Houses of great Persons are fair, and well-built; but the Houses of the meaner-sort are as plain, as in all the other Cities of <hi>India.</hi> They are built a good distance one from another, and hid by the height of their Walls, to keep their Women from being seen: So that it may be easily conjectur'd that their Cities are nothing so pleasant as ours in <hi>Europe.</hi> Add to this, that <hi>Agra</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compast round with the Sands, the heats are there very excessive, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> to remove from thence, and to keep his Court at <hi>Gehanabad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All that is remarkable in <hi>Agra</hi> is the King's Palace; and some Monuments as well near the City, as in the parts about it. The Palace of the King is a vast piece of ground encompast with a double-wall, which is terrass'd in some parts, and in those parts are built certain Lodgings for some of the Officers of the Court: The <hi>Gemene</hi> runs before the Palace; but between the Wall and the River there is a large space of ground, where the King causes his Elephants to fight. This Field is on purpose near the water, because that the Elephant which gets the victory, being in a fury, they could not bring him to himself, did they not drive him into the River: to which end they are forc'd to have recourse to Policy, by tying Squibs and Crackers to the end of an Half-Pike, and then giving fire to them to fright him into the water: for when he is in but two or three-foot-deep, he is presently appeas'd.</p>
                        <p>There is a wide <hi>Piazza</hi> upon one side of the City before the Palace, and the first Gate, wherein there is nothing of magnificence, is guarded by a few Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Before the King removed his Court from <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Gehanabad,</hi> when he went into the Countrey for some time, he gave to some one of his greatest <hi>Omrah's,</hi> who was his Confident, the Guard of his Palace, where his Treasure lay;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106224:179"/>
and till the return of the King he never stirr'd out of the Gate, where he lodg'd, neither by night nor day. At such a time as that it was, that I was permitted to see the Palace of <hi>Agra.</hi> The King being deparred for <hi>Gehanavad,</hi> whither all the Court followed him, together with the Women, the Government of the Palace was given to one that was a great Friend to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and indeed to all the <hi>Franguis. Menheir Velant,</hi> chief of the <hi>Holland-Factory</hi> at <hi>Agra,</hi> so soon as the King was departed, went to visit the Lord, and to present him according to custom. The Present was worth about 6000 Crowns, and consisted in Spices, Cabinets of <hi>Japan,</hi> and fine <hi>Holland-</hi>Cloath. He desir'd me to go along with him when he went to Compliment the Governour. But the Lord being offended that he had put himself to so much charge, forc'd him to carry the Present back again, taking only one <hi>Japan-</hi>Cane, of six that were in the Present, telling him he would have no more, out of the kindness which he had for the <hi>Franguiz.</hi> Nay, he would not so much as take the Gold-head and <hi>Ferula,</hi> but caus'd them to be taken off. The Complements being over, the Governor ask'd <hi>Menheir Velant,</hi> wherein he might serve him: whereupon he desiring the favour, that since the Court was gone, he might see the inside of the Palace, the Governor granted his request, and order'd six men to attend him.</p>
                        <p>The first Gate where the Governor of the Palace lies, is a long blind Arch, which leads you into a large Court all environ'd with Portico's; like our <hi>Piazza</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> The Gallery in front is larger and higher than any of the rest, sustain'd by three ranks of Pillars, and under those Galleries on the other side of the Court which are narrower and lower, are little Chambers for the Souldiers of the Guard. In the midst of the large Gallery, is a Nich in the Wall, into which the King descends out of his <hi>Haram</hi> by a private pair of Stairs, and when he is in, he seems to be in a kind of a Tomb. He has no Guards with him then, for he has no reason to be afraid of any thing; there being no way to come at him. In the heat of the day he keeps himself there only with one Eunuch, but more often with one of his Children, to fan him. The Great Lords of the Court stay below in the Gallery under the Nich all the while.</p>
                        <p>At the farther end of this Court is another Gate that leads into a second Court encompast with Galleries, underneath which, are little Chambers for some Officers of the Palace. The second Court carries you into a third, which is the King's Quarter. <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> had resolv'd to cover with Silver all the Arch of a Gallery upon the right-hand. And a French-man, <hi>Austin de Bordeaux</hi> by name, was to have done the work: but the King not finding any one in his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so capable as the <hi>French-</hi>man was to treat with the <hi>Portugals</hi> at <hi>Goa</hi> about some important affair he had at that time; the design was laid aside: For they being afraid of <hi>Austin</hi>'s Parts, poison'd him upon his return to <hi>Cochin.</hi> This Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery is painted with branch'd-work of Gold and Azure, and the lower-part is hung with Tapestry. There are several doors under the Gallery that lead into little square-Chambers; of which we saw two or three open'd, and they told us all the rest were such. The other three sides of the Court lie all open, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but a single Wall, no higher than for a man to lean over. On the side that looks toward the River there is a <hi>Divan,</hi> or a kind of out-jutting Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone, where the King sits to see his Brigantines, or to behold his Elephants fight. Before the <hi>Divan</hi> is a Gallery, that serves for a Portico; which <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> had a design to have adorn'd all over with a kind of Lattice-work of Emraulds and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies that should have represented to the life Grapes when they are green, and when they begin to grow red. But this design which made such a noise in the World, and requir'd more Riches, than all the World could afford to perfect, remains unfinish'd; there being only three Stocks of a Vine in Gold, with their leaves, as the rest ought to have been; and enamel'd in their natural colours, with Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, Rubies and Granates wrought into the fashion of Grapes. In the middle of the Court stands a great Fat to bath in, 40 foot in Diameter, cut out of one entire grey-stone, with steps wrought out of the same stone within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                        <p>As for the Monuments which are in and about <hi>Agra,</hi> they are very fair ones; for there is scarce an Eunuch belonging to the King's <hi>Haram,</hi> that is not very ambitious of leaving a fair Monument behind him. Indeed, when they have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106224:180"/>
heap'd together great Sums, they would fain be going to <hi>Mecca,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rich Presents to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> unwilling to let his Money go out of his Countrey, will seldom permit them leave to undertake that Pilgrimage: and therefore not knowing what to do with their Money, they employ a great part thereof in Monuments, to perpetuate their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                        <p>Of all the Monuments that are to be seen at <hi>Agra,</hi> that of the Wise of <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> is the most magnificent; she caus'd it to be set up on purpose near the <hi>Tasimacan,</hi> to which all Strangers must come, that they should admire it. The <hi>Tasimacan</hi> is a great <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Market-place, compos'd of six great Courts, all encompassed with <hi>Portico's;</hi> under which there are Warehouses for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; and where there is a prodigious quantity of Calicuts vended. The Monument of this <hi>Degum,</hi> or <hi>Sultaness,</hi> stands on the East-side of the City, upon the River side, in a great place enclosed with Walls, upon which there runs a little Gallery, as upon the Walls of many Cities in <hi>Europe.</hi> This place is a kind of Garden with Compartiments, like our Garden-plots; but whereas our Walks are made with Gravel, here the Walks are black and white Marble. You enter into this place through a large Portal; and presently upon the left hand you espy a fair Gallery, that looks towards <hi>Mecca;</hi> wherein there are three or four Niches, wherein the <hi>Mufti</hi> comes at certain hours to pray. A little beyond the middle of the place, toward the Water, are three great Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, one rais'd above another, with four Towers at the four Corners of each, and Stairs within, upon the top whereof they call the people before the time of their prayer. On the top there is a <hi>Cupola,</hi> little less magnificent than that of <hi>Val de Grace</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> it is cover'd within and without with black Marble, the middle being of Brick. Under this <hi>Cupola</hi> is an empty Tomb; for the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> is inter'd under the Arch of the lowest Platform. The same change of Ceremonies which is observ'd under ground, is observ'd above. For they change the Tapestries, Candles, and other Ornaments at several times, and there are always <hi>Mollah's</hi> attending to pray. I saw the beginning and compleating of this great work, that colt two and twenty years labour, and twenty thousand men always at work; so that you cannot conceive but that the Expence must be excessive. <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> had begun to raise his own Monument on the other side of the River; but the Wars with his Son, broke off that design, nor did <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> now reigning, ever take any care to finish it. There is an <hi>Eunuch</hi> who commands two thousand men, that is entrusted to guard not only the Sepulcher of the <hi>Begum,</hi> but also the <hi>Tasimacan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On another side of the City, appears the Sepulcher of King <hi>Akabar.</hi> And as for the Sepulchers of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> they have only one Platform, with four little Chambers at the four Corners. When you come to <hi>Agra</hi> from <hi>Dehly,</hi> you meet a great <hi>Bazar;</hi> near to which there is a Garden, where King <hi>Jehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guire,</hi> Father of <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> lies interr'd. Over the Garden Gate you see the Tomb it self, beset with Portraitures, cover'd with a black Hearse-Cloath, or Pall, with Torches of white Wax, and two <hi>Jesuits</hi> attending at each end. There are some who wonder, that <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> against the practice of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who abhor Images, did permit of carving; but the reason conjectur'd at is, that it is done upon the consideration that his Father and himself learnt from the <hi>Jesuites</hi> certain principles of Mathematicks and Astrology. Though he had not the same kindness for them at another time; for going one day to visit an <hi>Armenian,</hi> that lay sick, whose name was <hi>Corgia,</hi> whom he lov'd very well, and had honour'd with several Employments, at what time the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> who liv'd next to the <hi>Armenians</hi> house, rang their Bell; the sound thereof so displeas'd the King, as being a disturbance to the sick person, that in a great fury he commanded the Bell to be taken away, and hung about his Elephants neck. Some few days after, the King seeing his Elephant with that great Bell about his neck, fearing so great a weight might injure his Elephant, caus'd the Bell to be carried to the <hi>Couteval,</hi> which is a kind of a rail'd place, where a Provost sits as a Judg, and decides differences among the people of that Quarter, where it has hung ever since. This <hi>Armenian</hi> had been brought up with <hi>Cha-jehan;</hi> and in regard he was an excellent Wit, and an excellent Poet,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106224:180"/>
he was very much in the Kings favour, who had confer'd upon him many fair Commands, though he could never either by threats or promises win him to turn <hi>Mahometan.</hi>

                        <p>I Departed from <hi>Agra</hi> toward <hi>Bengala</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1665, and that day I reach'd no farther than a very bad Inn, distant from <hi>Agra,</hi> costes 3</p>
                        <p>The 26<hi>th</hi> I came to <hi>Beruzabad,</hi> costes 9</p>
                        <p>This is a little City where, at my return, I received eight thousand Roupies, being the remainder of the Money which <hi>Giafer-Kan</hi> ow'd me for Wares that he had bought at <hi>Janabat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The 27<hi>th</hi> to <hi>Serael Morlides,</hi> costes 9</p>
                        <p>The 28<hi>th</hi> to <hi>Serail Estanja,</hi> costes 14</p>
                        <p>The 29<hi>th</hi> to <hi>Serail Haii-mal,</hi> costes 12</p>
                        <p>The 30<hi>th.</hi> to <hi>Serail Sekandera,</hi> costes 13</p>
                        <p>The 1<hi>st</hi> of <hi>December</hi> to <hi>Sanqual,</hi> costes 14</p>
                        <p>I met that day 110 Waggons, every Waggon drawn by sixOxen, &amp; in every Waggon 50000 Roupies. This is the Revenue of the Province of <hi>Bengala,</hi> with all charges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and the Governor's Purse well-fill'd, comes to 5500000 Roupies. A league beyond <hi>Sanqual,</hi> you must pass a River call'd <hi>Saingour,</hi> which runs into <hi>Gemine,</hi> not above half a league distant from it. You pass over this River of <hi>Saingour</hi> upon a Stone-bridg, and when you come from toward <hi>Bengala</hi> to go to <hi>Seronge</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> if you have a mind to shorten your journey ten days, you must leave <hi>Agra-</hi>Road, and come to this Bridg, and so Ferry over <hi>Gemine</hi> in a Boat. But generally <hi>Agra-</hi>Road is taken, because the other way you must travel five or six days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the stones; and also for that you are to pass through the Territories of certain <hi>Raja's,</hi> where you are in danger of being robb'd.</p>
                        <p>The second day I came to an Inn call'd <hi>Cherourabad,</hi> costes 12</p>
                        <p>When you are got about half the way, you pass through <hi>Gianabad,</hi> a little City, near to which, about a quarter of a League on this side, crossing a Field of Millet, I saw a <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> feeding upon Millet-Canes, which a little Boy of nine or ten years old gave him to eat. When I came near the Boy, he gave me some Millet to give the <hi>Rhinoceros;</hi> who immediately came to me, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his chops three or four times; I put the Millet into his mouth, and when he had swallow'd it, he still open'd his mouth for more.</p>
                        <p>The 3<hi>d</hi> I came to <hi>Serrail Chajeada,</hi> costes 10</p>

                        <p>Formerly this Village had another name; but being the place where <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeb</hi> gave Battel to his Brother <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who was Governor of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Bengala; Aureng-zeb,</hi> in Memory of the Victory he had won, gave it his own name, and built there a very fair House, with a Garden, and a little <hi>Mosquee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> to <hi>Alinchan,</hi> costes 9</p>
                        <p>Two leagues on this side <hi>Alinchan,</hi> you meet the River <hi>Ganges. Monsieur Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> the King's Physitian, and another person whose name was <hi>Rachepot,</hi> with whom I travell'd, were amaz'd to see, that a River that had made such a noise in the World, was no broader than the River <hi>Seine</hi> before the <hi>Lovre;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving before, that it had been as wide as the <hi>Danaw</hi> above <hi>Belgrade.</hi> There is also so little water in it from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> when the rains fall, that it will not bear a small Boat. When we came to <hi>Ganges,</hi> we drank every one of us a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106224:181"/>
Glass of Wine, mixing some of the River-water with it; which caus'd a griping in our bellies: But our Servants that drank it alone, were worse tormented than we. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who have an House upon the Bank of <hi>Ganges,</hi> never drink the water of this River, until they have boil'd it. But for the natural Inhabitants of the Countrey, they are so accustom'd to it from their youth, that the King and the Court drink no other. You shall see a vast number of Camels every day, whose business only it is to fetch water from the <hi>Ganges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The 7<hi>th,</hi> I came to <hi>Halabas,</hi> costes 8</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Halabas</hi> is a great City, built upon a point of Land where <hi>Ganges</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> meet. There is a fair Castle of hew'n Stone, with a double Moat; where the Governour resides. He is one of the greatest Lords in <hi>India;</hi> and being very sickly, he has always about him ten <hi>Persian</hi> Physicians. He had also in his service, <hi>Claudius Maille</hi> of <hi>Bourges,</hi> who practises Chyrurgery and Physick both together. This was he that advis'd us not to drink of <hi>Ganges</hi> Water, which would put us into a looseness; but rather to drink Well-water. The chief of these <hi>Persian</hi> Physicians, whom this Governour hires with his Money, one day threw his Wife from the top of a Battlement to the ground; prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that act of cruelty, by some jealousies he had entertain'd. He thought the fall had kill'd her, but she had only a Rib or two bruis'd; whereupon the Kindred of the Woman came and demanded justice, at the feet of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The Governour sending for the Physician, commanded him to be gone, resolving to retain him no longer in his service. The Physician obey'd, and putting his maim'd Wife in a <hi>Pallanquin,</hi> he set forward upon the Road with all his Family. But he was not gone above three or four days journey from the City, when the Governour finding himself worse than he was wont to be, sent to recall him; which the Physician perceiving, stab'd his Wife, his four Children, and thirteen female Slaves, and return'd again to the Governour, who said not a word to him, but entertain'd him again into his service.</p>
                        <p>The eighth day I cross'd the River in a large Boat, having stay'd from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till noon upon the bank-side, expecting Monsieur <hi>Maille,</hi> to bring me a Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the Governour. For there stands a <hi>Deroga</hi> upon each side of the River, who will not suffer any person to pass without leave; and he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what sort of Goods are transported; there being due from every Waggon four Roupies, and from every Coach one; not accounting the charge of the Boat, which you must pay beside. The same day I went to <hi>Sadoul-serail,</hi> costes 16</p>
                        <p>The ninth, to <hi>Yakedel-sera,</hi> costes 10</p>
                        <p>The tenth, to <hi>Bouraki-sera,</hi> costes 10</p>
                        <p>The eleventh, to <hi>Banarou,</hi> costes 10</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Banarou</hi> is a large City, and handsomly built; the most part of the Houses being either of Brick or Stone, and higher than in any other Cities of <hi>India;</hi> but the inconveniency is, that the Streets are very narrow. There are many Inns in the Town; among the rest, one very large, and very handsomely built. In the middle of the Court are two Galleries, where are to be sold Calicuts, Silks, and other sorts of Merchandise. The greatest part of the Sellers, are the Workmen themselves; so that the Merchants buy at the first hand. These Workmen, before they expose any thing to sale, must go to him that has the stamp, to have the Kings Seal set upon their Linnen and Silks; otherwise they would be fin'd, and lambasted with a good Cudgel. This City is scituated upon the North side of <hi>Ganges,</hi> that runs by the Walls, and into which there falls also another River, some two Leagues upward toward the West. In <hi>Banarou</hi> stands one of the Idolaters principal Pagods, whereof I shall speak in my second Book, when I come to treat of the Religion of the <hi>Banians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About five hundred paces from the City Northward, there is a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> where are to be seen many <hi>Mahometan</hi> Sepulehers; whereof some are very curious pieces of Architecture. The fairest are every one in the middle of a Garden enclosed with Walls, wherein there are Holes some half a foot square, through which Passengers may have a sight of the Tomb within. The most considerable of all is as it were a four square Pedestal, every square whereof is forty paces wide. In the midst of this Platform rises a Column thirty-two or thirty-five foot high, all of a piece, which three men can hardly embrace.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106224:181"/>
The Stone is of a grey colour, and so hard that I could not scrape it with my Knife. As it is Pyramidical, there is a great Bowl at the top, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass'd at the upper end with huge Grains of Wheat. All the fronts of the Tomb are full of figures of Animals cut in the Stone; and it has been higher above ground than now it seems to be, for several old men, that look'd to some of the Sepulchers, assur'd me, that within these fifty years it had sunk above thirty foot into the Earth. They tell you moreover, that it is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of one of the Kings of <hi>Boutan,</hi> who was interr'd here after he had left his own Countrey to conquer this Kingdom, out of which he was driven by the Successors of <hi>Tamerlane.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Boutan</hi> is the place from whence they fetch Musk, and I will give you a description of it in my third Book.</p>
                        <p>I stay'd at <hi>Banarou</hi> the 12<hi>th</hi> and 13<hi>th;</hi> and during those two days it rain'd continually, but not so as to stop my journey; so that the evening of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day I cross'd the <hi>Ganges,</hi> with the Governours Pass-port. Before you go into the Boat, they search the Travellers baggage; wearing Apparel how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pays nothing of Custom, but only Merchandise.</p>
                        <p>The 13<hi>th,</hi> I went to <hi>Baterpour,</hi> costes 2</p>

                        <p>The same day in the morning, after I had travel'd two Leagues, I cross'd a River call'd <hi>Carnasarsou;</hi> and three Leagues from thence I cross'd another, which they call <hi>Saode-sou;</hi> both which I foarded.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Saseron</hi> is a City at the foot of certain Mountains, near to which there is a great Lake. In the middle whereof there is a small Island, with a fair <hi>Mosquee</hi> built upon it; wherein is to be seen, the Sepulcher of a <hi>Nahab</hi> or Favourite, call'd <hi>Selim-Kan;</hi> who built it when he was Governour of the Province. There is a fair Bridg to cross over into the Island, pav'd and lin'd with large free Stone. Upon one side of the Lake is a great Garden, in the middle whereof is another fair Sepulcher of the Son of the same <hi>Nahab, Selim-Kan,</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father in the Government of the Province. If you would go to the Mine of <hi>Soulmelpour,</hi> whereof I shall speak in the last Book of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, you must leave the great Road to <hi>Patna,</hi> and bend to the South through <hi>Exberbourgh,</hi> and the famous Fortress of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> of which I shall treat in the same place.</p>
                        <p>The 18<hi>th,</hi> I ferry'd in a Boat over the River <hi>Sonsou,</hi> which descends from the Southern Mountains; after you have cross'd it, the Merchandise pays a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Toll.</p>
                        <p>The same day I travel'd on to <hi>Daoud-Nagar-sera,</hi> where there is a fair Tomb, costes 9</p>

                        <p>In the morning I met a hundred and thirty Elephants, great and small, which they were leading to <hi>Dehli</hi> to the great <hi>Mogul.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Patna</hi> is one of the greatest Cities of <hi>India,</hi> upon the Bank of <hi>Ganges,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the West; not being less than two Leagues in length. But the Houses are no fairer than in the greatest part of the other Cities of <hi>India;</hi> being cover'd with <hi>Bambouck,</hi> or Straw. The <hi>Holland</hi> Company have a House there, by reason of their Trade in Saltpeter, which they refine at a great Town call'd <hi>Choupar,</hi> which is also scituated upon <hi>Ganges,</hi> ten Leagues above <hi>Patna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Coming to <hi>Patna,</hi> we met the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in the Street returning from <hi>Chou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par,</hi> who stop'd our Coaches to salute us. We did not part, till we had emptied two Bottles of <hi>Sohiras</hi> Wine in the open Street; which is not taken notice of in that Country, where people meet with an entire freedom without any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                        <p>I stay'd eight days at <hi>Patna,</hi> during which time there fell out an accident,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106224:182"/>
which will let the Reader understand, that <hi>Sodomy</hi> does not go altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd among the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> A <hi>Mimbachi,</hi> who commanded a thousand Foot, went about to abuse a young Boy in his service; and who had several times resisted his attempts; complaining also to the Governour, and telling him withall, that if his Master persisted to urge him any more, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly kill him. At length the Captain took his opportunity, at a House which he had in the Country, and forc'd the Boy. The Boy o'rewhelm'd with grief and rage, took his opportunity also to revenge himself; and being one day hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Master, about a quarter of a League from any of his other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he got behind him, and cleft his head with his Hanger. After he had done, he rode full speed to the City, crying out all the way, that he had kill'd his Master for such a reason; and went immediately to the Governours Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who sent him to prison; but he let him out at the end of six months; and notwithstanding all the endeavours which the Captains Kindred us'd to have had him put to death, the Governour durst not condemn him, for fear of the people, who affirm'd that the Boy had done well.</p>
                        <p>I parted from <hi>Patna</hi> in a Boat for <hi>Daca,</hi> the nine and twentieth of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> between eleven and twelve at noon; and had the River been deep, as it uses to be after the Rains, I had taken Boat at <hi>Hallabas,</hi> or at least at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narou.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The same day I came to lye at <hi>sera-Beconcour,</hi> costes 15</p>
                        <p>Five Leagues on this side <hi>Beconcour,</hi> you meet with a River call'd <hi>Pompon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sou,</hi> which comes from the South, and falls into <hi>Ganges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The thirtieth to <hi>Sera-d' Erija,</hi> costes 17</p>
                        <p>The one and thirtieth, after we had travel'd four Leagues, or thereabout, we met with the River <hi>Kaoa,</hi> which comes from the South. Three Leagues lower, you meet with another River call'd <hi>Chanon,</hi> which comes from the North. Four Leagues farther, you discover the River <hi>Erguga,</hi> which runs from the South; and at length, six Leagues, beyond, the River <hi>Aquera,</hi> falling from the same part of the World; all which four Rivers lose their Names in the <hi>Ganges.</hi> All that day I saw great Mountains toward the South, distant from <hi>Ganges</hi> sometimes ten, and sometimes fifteen Leagues, till at length I came to lodg in <hi>Monger-</hi>City, costes 18</p>
                        <p>The first day of <hi>January;</hi> 1666, after I had gone by Water two hours, I saw the <hi>Gandet</hi> fall into the <hi>Ganges,</hi> flowing from the North. This is a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that carries Boats.</p>
                        <p>That eveining I lay at <hi>Zangira,</hi> costes 8</p>
                        <p>But in regard of the winding of <hi>Ganges</hi> all that days journey, I might well reckon them by Water two and twenty Leagues.</p>
                        <p>The second day, from between six in the morning till eleven, I saw three Rivers that threw themselves into <hi>Ganges,</hi> all three descending from the North.</p>
                        <p>The first is call'd <hi>Ronova,</hi> the second <hi>Then</hi> the third <hi>Ghanan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I came to lye at <hi>Baquelpour,</hi> costes 18</p>
                        <p>The third, after four hours upon the <hi>Ganges,</hi> I met the River <hi>Katare,</hi> which comes from the North; and lay at a Village call'd <hi>Pongangel,</hi> at the foot of certain Mountains that descend to <hi>Ganges</hi> it self, costes 13</p>
                        <p>The fourth, an hours rowing beyond <hi>Pongangel,</hi> I met a great River, call'd <hi>Mart-Nadi,</hi> coming from the South; and I lay at <hi>Rage-Mehale,</hi> costes 6</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rage-Mehale,</hi> is a City upon the right hand of <hi>Ganges;</hi> and if you go by Land, you shall find the high-way, for a League or two, pav'd with Brick to the Town. Formerly the Governours of <hi>Bengala</hi> resided here; it being an excellent Country for hunting, besides that it was a place of great Trade. But now the River having taken another course, above a good half League from the City, as well for that reason, as to keep in awe the King of <hi>Aracan,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Portuguese Banditi,</hi> who are retir'd to the mouths of <hi>Ganges,</hi> and made excursions even as far as <hi>Daca</hi> it self; both the Governour and the Merchants have remov'd themselves to <hi>Daca,</hi> which is at present a large City, and a Town of great Trade.</p>
                        <p>The sixth, being arriv'd at a considerable Town, call'd <hi>Donapour,</hi> six Leagues from <hi>Rage-Mehale,</hi> I parted with Monsieur <hi>Bernier,</hi> who was going to <hi>Casenbasar,</hi>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:106224:182"/>
and thence to <hi>Ogouli</hi> by Land; for when the River is low, there is no going by Water, by reason of a great Bank of Sand that lies before a City call'd <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqui.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I lay that night at <hi>Toutipour,</hi> distant from <hi>Rage-mehale,</hi> costes 12</p>
                        <p>I saw there at Sun-rising a great number of Crocodiles lying upon the Sand.</p>
                        <p>The seventh, I came to <hi>Acerat,</hi> costes 25</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Acerat</hi> to <hi>Daca,</hi> it is counted by Land forty-five Leagues. All that day I saw such a vast number of Crocodiles, that I had a great desire to shoot at one, to try whether the vulgar report were true, that a Musket-shot would not pierce their skin. The bullet hit him in the jaw, and made the blood gush out; however he would not stay in the place, but plung'd into the River.</p>
                        <p>The eighth, I saw again a great number lying upon the bank of the River, and made two shot at two with three bullets at a time. As soon as they were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they turn'd themselves upon their backs, opening their throats, and di'd upon the spot.</p>
                        <p>That day I came to lie at <hi>Douloudia,</hi> costes 17</p>
                        <p>The Crows were here the cause that we found a very fair Fish, which the Fisher-men had hid among the Osiers by the side of the River; for when our Water-men saw the Crows in great numbers hovering, and making an hideous noise about the Osiers, they presently conjectur'd that there was something more than ordinary: and they made so diligent a search, that at length they found an excellent dish of meat.</p>
                        <p>The ninth, two hours after noon, we met with a River call'd <hi>Chativor,</hi> that runs from the North, and we lay at <hi>Dampour,</hi> costes 16</p>
                        <p>The tenth, we lay by the River-side in a place remote from Houses, and we travell'd that day, costes 15</p>
                        <p>The eleventh, toward evening, being come to that part where <hi>Ganges</hi> divides it self into three Arms, whereof one runs to <hi>Daca;</hi> we lay at a large Town, upon the entry of the great Channel, which Town is call'd <hi>Jatrapour,</hi> costes 20</p>
                        <p>They that have no luggage, may make a short-cut from <hi>Jatrapour</hi> to <hi>Daca,</hi> and save much ground, by reason of the many windings of the River.</p>
                        <p>The twelf, about noon, we past by a large Village call'd <hi>Bagamara,</hi> and came to lie at <hi>Kasiata,</hi> another great Town, costes 11</p>
                        <p>The thirteenth, about noon we met with a River, two leagues from <hi>Daca,</hi> call'd <hi>Laquia,</hi> which runs from the North-East. Iust against the Point where the two Rivers join, there stands a Fortress of each side, with several pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Half a league lower, appears another River call'd <hi>Pagalu,</hi> upon which there is a fair Bridg of Brick, which <hi>Mirza-Mola</hi> caus'd to be built. This River comes from the North-East; and half a league upward appears another River call'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damtali,</hi> that runs from the North, over which there is another Bridg of Brick. On both sides of the River are several Towers, as it were enchas'd with several heads of men, executed for robbing upon the high-way.</p>
                        <p>About evening we came to <hi>Daca,</hi> having travell'd by water that day, costes 9</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Daca</hi> is a great Town, that extends it self only in length; every one coveting to have an House by the <hi>Ganges-</hi>side. The length of this Town is above two leagues. And indeed from the last Brick-Bridg which I mention'd, to <hi>Daca,</hi> there is but one continued row of Houses separated one from the other; inhabited for the most part by Carpenters, that build Galleys and other small Vessels. These Houses are properly no more than paltry Huts built up with <hi>Bambout's;</hi> and daub'd over with fat Earth. Those of <hi>Daca</hi> are not much better built: The Governor's Palace is a place enclos'd with high Walls, in the midst whereof is a pittiful House, built only of Wood. He generally lodges in Tents, which he causes to be set up in a great Court of that Enclosure. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> finding that their Goods were not safe in the ordinary Houses of <hi>Daca,</hi> have built them a very fair House; and the <hi>English</hi> have another, which is reasonably handsom. The Church of the <hi>Austin-Friers</hi> is all of Brick, and is a very comely Pile.</p>
                        <p>When I travell'd last to <hi>Daca,</hi> the <hi>Nahab Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> who was then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Bengala,</hi> was at War with the King of <hi>Arakan,</hi> whose-Naval-Force consists generally of 200 Galeasses, attended by several other smaller Vessels. These Galeasses run through the Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and enter into the mouth of <hi>Ganges,</hi>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:106224:183"/>
the Sea flowing up higher then <hi>Daca. Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> Uncle to King <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeb,</hi> the present <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the best Head-piece that ever was in all his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, found out a way to corrupt several of the King of <hi>Aracan</hi>'s Captains, so that of a sudden forty Galeasses, commanded by <hi>Portugals,</hi> came and join'd themselves with him. To engage more firmly all this new multitude to his service, he gave a larger pay to all the <hi>Portugal-</hi>Officers, and to the Souldiers proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: But those of the Countrey had no more than their ordinary pay doubl'd. 'Tis an incredible thing to see how swiftly these Galeasses cut their way in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some are so long that they carry fifty Oars of a side; but they have but two men to an Oare: There are some very curiously painted, and upon which there is no cost of Gold and Azure spar'd. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have some of their own to transport their Goods; and sometimes they are forc'd to hire others, whereby many people get a good livelihood.</p>
                        <p>The next day after my arrival at <hi>Daca,</hi> which was the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> I went to wait upon the <hi>Nahab;</hi> and presented him with a Garment of Cloath of Gold, lac'd with a Gold-needle-work Lace of Point of <hi>Spain;</hi> with a Scarf of Gold and Silver of the same Point; and a very fair Emrald-Jewel. Toward evening, being return'd to the <hi>Hollander</hi>'s House, where I lodg'd, the <hi>Nahab</hi> sent me Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, <hi>China-</hi>Oranges, two <hi>Persian-</hi>Melons, and three sorts of Pears.</p>
                        <p>The fifteenth, I shewed him my Goods, and presented the Prince with a Watch, in a Gold-Enamell'd-Case; with a pair of little Pistols inlaid with Silver, and a very fair Prospective-Glass. What I gave to the Father and the Son, a young Lord, about ten years old, stood me in above five thousand Livres.</p>
                        <p>The sixteenth, I treated with him about the Prizes of my Goods: And at length I went to his Steward to take my Letter of Exchange to be paid at <hi>Casen-Bazar.</hi> Not but that he would have paid me my Money at <hi>Daca;</hi> but the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who understood things better than I did, told me it was very dangerous to carry Mony to <hi>Casen-Bazar,</hi> whither there was no going, but over the <hi>Ganges</hi> by water, the way by land being full of Bogs and Fens. And to go by water is no less dangerous, by reason that the Boats which they use, are very apt to tip over upon the least storm: And when the Mariners perceive that you carry Money along with you, 'tis an easy thing for them to overset the Boat, and afterwards to come and take up the Money that lies but at the bottom of the River.</p>
                        <p>The twentieth, I took leave of the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who desir'd me to come and see him again, and caus'd a Pass to be deliver'd me, wherein he gave me the title of one of the Gentlemen of his House, which he had done before, when he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Amadabad,</hi> when I went to him, to the Army, in the Province of <hi>Decan,</hi> into which the <hi>Raja-seva-gi</hi> was enter'd, as I shall relate in another place. By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of these Passes I could travel over all the Countreys of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> as being one of his Houshold.</p>
                        <p>The one and twentieth, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made a great Feast for my sake; to which they invited the <hi>English,</hi> and some <hi>Portuguese's,</hi> together with the <hi>Austin-</hi>Friers of the same Nation.</p>
                        <p>The two and twentieth, I made a Visit to the <hi>English,</hi> whose President then was Mr. <hi>Prat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the twenty-third to the twenty-ninth, I bought up Goods, to the value of 11000 Roupies; and after I had embark'd them, I took my leave.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-ninth, in the evening, I departed from <hi>Daca,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me company for two leagues, with their little Barques Arm'd: Nor did we spare the <hi>Spanish-</hi>Wine all that time. Having been upon the River from the twenty-ninth of <hi>January</hi> to the eleventh of <hi>February,</hi> I left my Goods and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Barque at <hi>Acerat;</hi> where I took a Boat that carri'd me to a great Village call'd <hi>Mirdapour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day I hir'd an Horse for my self, but not finding another for my Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, I was forc'd to hire two Women, who carri'd it for me. That evening I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Casen-Basar,</hi> where I was welcom'd by <hi>Menheir Arnold Van Wachttendonk,</hi> Director of all the <hi>Holland-</hi>Factories in <hi>Bengala,</hi> who invited me to lie at his House.</p>
                        <p>The fourteenth, <hi>Menhoir Wachttendonk</hi> return'd to <hi>Ouguely,</hi> where is the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Factory. The same day one of my Servants brought me word that my People and Goods, which I had left behind in the Barque, had been in very
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106224:183"/>
great danger, by reason of the high Winds that had blown for two days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                        <p>The fifteenth, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> lent me a Pallekis, to go to <hi>Madesou-basarki.</hi> This was a great Town three Leagues from <hi>Casen-basar,</hi> where lay <hi>Cha-Est-Kan</hi>'s Receiver General, to whom I presented my Bill of Exchange. He told me it was very good, and that he would willingly have paid me, had he not receiv'd order the night before, not to pay me, in case he had not paid me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. He did not tell me the reason that mov'd <hi>Cha-Est-Kan</hi> to act in that manner; so that I went home to my Lodging infinitely surpriz'd at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
                        <p>The sixteenth, I wrote to the <hi>Nahab,</hi> to know the reason why he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his Receiver General to pay me.</p>
                        <p>The seventeenth in the evening, I took water for <hi>Ougueli,</hi> in a Bark of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Oars, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> lent me; and that night and the next I lay upon the River.</p>
                        <p>The nineteenth toward evening, I pass'd by a large Town call'd <hi>Nandi,</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than which the Sea does not flow. Here the Wind blew so fiercely, and the Water grew so rough, that we were forc'd to stay three or four hours, and ly by the shore.</p>
                        <p>The twentieth, I arriv'd at <hi>Ougueli,</hi> where I stay'd till the second of <hi>March.</hi> During which time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> bid me very welcome, and made it their business to shew me all the divertisements which the Country was capable to afford. We went several times in Pleasure-Boats upon the River, and we had a Banquet of all the Delicacies that the Gardens of <hi>Europe</hi> could have afforded us. Salads of all sorts, Colewarts, Asparagus, Pease, but our chiefest Dish was <hi>Japon</hi> Beans; the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being very curious to have all sorts of Pulse and Herbs in their Gardens, though they could never get Artichokes to grow in that Country.</p>
                        <p>The second of <hi>March</hi> I left <hi>Ougueli,</hi> and the fifth arriv'd at <hi>Casenbasar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day I went to <hi>Madesou-Barsaki,</hi> to know whether the <hi>Nahab</hi> had sent any other orders to his Receiver. For I told you a little before, that I wrote upon the place to <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> to complain of his proceedings, and to know the reason why my Bill of Exchange was not paid. The Director of the <hi>Holland</hi> Factories writ a Letter also in my behalf, which I enclosed, wherein he represented to the <hi>Nahab,</hi> that I was too well known to him, as having been formerly with him at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> in the Army in <hi>Decan,</hi> and other places, to deserve such hard usage. That he ought to consider, that I being the only person that brought the chiefest rarities of <hi>Europe</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> it was not the way to make me eager of returning any more, as he himself had invited me to do, to send me away in a discontent. Besides, that the credit of my report would discourage others from coming to the <hi>Indies,</hi> fearing the same usage as I had receiv'd. Neither mine nor the Directors Letter produc'd that effect which we expected. Nor was I much better satisfi'd with the new order which the <hi>Nahab</hi> sent to his Receiver; which was to pay me, abating twenty thousand Roupies of the sum which we had agreed upon; and if I would not take the remainder, that I might come and fetch my goods again.</p>
                        <p>This ill dealing of the <hi>Nahab,</hi> proceeded from a scurvy trick that was play'd me by three Canary-birds at the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court. The story whereof was thus in short:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> that now reigns, at the instigation of two <hi>Persians</hi> and a <hi>Banian,</hi> has brought up a custom very much to the disadvantage of Merchants, that come out of <hi>Europe,</hi> and other parts, to sell Jewels at Court. For whether they come into <hi>India</hi> either by Land or Sea, the Governour of the place where they first arrive, has order to send them to the King, together with their goods, whether they will or no. As the Governour of <hi>Surat</hi> dealt by me, in the year 1665, sending me to <hi>Delhi,</hi> or <hi>Jehanabad,</hi> where the King was. There were then attending upon his Majesty, two <hi>Persians</hi> and a <hi>Banian,</hi> who are entrusted to view and examine all the Jewels which are to be sold to the King. One of those <hi>Persians</hi> is call'd <hi>Nahab-Akel-Kan,</hi> that is, the <hi>Prince of the Spirit;</hi> who keeps all the Kings Jewels. The name of the other is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106224:184"/>
                           <hi>Mirza-Mouson,</hi> whose business is to rate every stone. The <hi>Banian,</hi> whose name is <hi>Nalikan,</hi> is to see whether the Stones be false or not, or whether they have any defect. These three men have obtain'd a Licence from the King, to view, before ever he does, whatever forreign Merchants shall bring to Court, and to present their goods to him themselves. And though they are under an Oath not to take any thing from the Merchants, yet they extort whatever they can get from them, though it be to their ruine. When they see any thing that is lovely, and likely to bring great profit, they would perswade you to sell it to them for less by half than the thing is worth; and if you refuse to let them have it, when they are in the Kings presence, they will set a price upon it at half the value; knowing that <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> is not very covetous of Jewels, loving his Money far better. Upon the Kings Festival-day, of which I shall speak in another place, all the Princes and Nobility of the Court pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him with most magnificent gifts. And when they cannot meet with Jewels, they send him Roupies of Gold, which the King likes far better than Stones; though Jewels are the more honourable present. Therefore when this Festival draws nigh, he issues out of his Treasury, a great quantity of Diamonds, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, Emraulds, and Pearls, which he who is entrusted to prize the Stones, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers to several Merchants to sell to the Nobility, who are bound to present the King; by which means the King gets the Money and his Jewels again.</p>
                        <p>There is also another thing very disadvantageous to a Merchant Jeweller, which is, that when the King has seen the Stones, no Prince or Nobleman that knows of it, will ever buy them. Besides, while these three persons, who are entrusted to view the Jewels, are considering and examining them at their Lodgings, several <hi>Banians</hi> resort thither, who are expert, some in Diamonds, some in Rubies, some in Emraulds, and others in Pearls, who write down the weight, goodness, cleanness, and colour of every piece. So that when a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant goes afterwards to any Prince or Governour of any Province, these people send them a note of what he has, and the price, which they set down at half the value. For in trade these <hi>Banians</hi> are a thousand times worse than the <hi>Jews;</hi> more expert in all sorts of cunning tricks, and more maliciously mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in their revenge. Now you shall hear what a trick these unworthy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple serv'd me.</p>
                        <p>When I arriv'd at <hi>Gehanabad,</hi> one of them came to my Lodging, and told me, he had order from the King to see what I had brought, before I expos'd my goods in the Kings presence. They would have rather that the King had not been at <hi>Gehanabad,</hi> for they would have then endeavour'd to have bought them themselves, to gain thereby, by selling them again to the King, or the Nobility upon occasion; which they could never perswade me to. The next day they came to see me all three, one after another; and they would needs have of me, amongst other things, a Jewel of nine great Pearls, in the fashion of a Pear, the biggest whereof weigh'd thirty Carats, and the least sixteen; together with another single Pearl like a Pear, of fifty-five Carats. As for the Jewel, the King took it; but for the single Pearl, they finding that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could say, I would not be wrought upon to sell them any bargains, so order'd it, that before I had shew'd my Jewels to the King, <hi>Giafer-Kan</hi> the Kings Uncle saw, and kept it, telling me he would give me as good a price as the King; and desir'd me not to speak of it, for indeed he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to make a present to the King.</p>
                        <p>When the King had made choice of such of my Jewels as he pleas'd, <hi>Giafer-Kan</hi> bought of me several pieces, and at the same time agreed with me for the great Pearl. Some days after he paid me, according as we had agreed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for the Pearl, upon which he would have abated me ten thousand Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. For the two <hi>Persians</hi> and the <hi>Banian</hi> had malitiously inform'd him, that at my first arrival, they could have bought the Pearl for eight or ten thousand Roupies less than I had valu'd it to him; which was absolutely false. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Giafer-Kan</hi> telling me, that if I would not take his Money, I might have my Jewel again; I took him at his word, assuring him, he should never see it again as long as he liv'd. And I was as good as my word. And indeed that which made me the more resolute was, that I was resolv'd to carry some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>something
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106224:184"/>
which was considerable to <hi>Cha-Est-Kan;</hi> for could I have had my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon my arrival at <hi>Surat</hi> to have gone to him, I would never have seen the King at <hi>Gehanabad;</hi> about which I had a very great quarrel with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Surat.</hi> For when I came to visit him, he told me presently, that the case was alter'd from what it had been since my last being there, for that the King was resolv'd to have the first view of all Curiosities imported into his Kingdom. I was above four Months contending in vain with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but nothing would serve; I must go to the King, and for fear I should take another Road, he sent fifteen Horsemen along with me as far as <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I went for <hi>Bengala,</hi> these Overseers of the Jewels, our of meer spite, and, it may be, set on by <hi>Giafer-Kan,</hi> to be reveng'd of me for denying to let him have my Jewel, writ to <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> that I intended to shew him certain Jewels, among the rest a very fair Pearl, which I had sold to <hi>Giafer-Kan;</hi> but that he had given it me again, because he understood that I would have made him pay for it, ten thousand Roupies more than it was worth. They wrote also the particular proportion of all the other Stones which I carry'd. And upon this false and malicious advice it was, that <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> who receiv'd not this information till he had deliver'd me my Bill of Exchange, would abate me for my whole parcel, twenty thousand Roupies, which he reduc'd at length to ten thousand; and well I had it too.</p>
                        <p>Since I told you before, what a Present I gave to <hi>Cha-Est-Kam;</hi> I think it not amiss to tell you, what I gave the King, to <hi>Nahab Giafer-Kan,</hi> to the Eunuch of the Grand <hi>Begum, Aurengzeb</hi>'s Sister, the Great Treasurer, and the Porters of the Treasury. For you must take notice, that whoever he be, that craves Audience of the King, they ask him in the first place, where the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is which he intends for the King; and examine whether it be fitting to present to his Majesty. For no man must come into his presence empty handed, though it be an honour dearly purchas'd. Coming then to <hi>Gehanabad,</hi> I went to make my obeisance to the King; and this is the Present which I made him.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, a Buckler of Brass highly emboss'd, and very richly guilt, the cost of the Guilding alone amounting to two hundred Ducats of Gold, or eighteen hundred Livres; the value of the whole piece coming to four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand three hundred seventy eight Livres. In the middle thereof was the story of <hi>Curtius,</hi> who threw himself and his Horse into the <hi>Barathrum,</hi> when the Earth gap'd, near <hi>Rome.</hi> Round the outermost Circle of the Buckler, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the siege of <hi>Rochel.</hi> It was wrought by one of the best Workmen in <hi>France,</hi> by the order of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> All the great Lords that were about <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> at that time, were charm'd at the beauty of the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and told him, he could not do better, than to put it upon the great Elephant, which carry'd the Standard before his Majesty when he march'd into the Field.</p>
                        <p>I presented him also with a Battle-Axe of Chrystal of the Rock, the sides whereof were set with Rubies and Emraulds, enchas'd in Gold in the body of the Chrystal, which cost three thousand one hundred and nineteen Livres.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I presented him with a Saddle after the <hi>Turky</hi> fashion, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with little Rubies, Pearls, and Diamonds, which cost two thousand eight hundred and ninety-two Livres.</p>
                        <p>I presented him also with another Saddle and Foot-cloath, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, to the value of one thousand seven hundred and thirty Livres. The whole Present amounting to twelve thousand one hundred and nineteen Livres.</p>
                        <p>The Present which I made to <hi>Giafar-Kan,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Unkle, was a Table, with other nineteen pieces to make a Cabinet, all nataurl Stones, of divers colours, representing the shapes of several Birds and Flowers. The work was made at <hi>Florence,</hi> and cost two thousand one hundred and fifty Livres.</p>
                        <p>A perfect Ruby Ring, which cost one thousand and three hundred Livres.</p>
                        <p>To the great Treasurer, I presented a Watch in a Gold Case, set with small Emraulds, at seven hundred and twenty Livres.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:106224:185"/>
To the Potters of the Kings Treasury, and those that deliver out the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of the Treasury, two hundred Roupies, at three hundred Livres.</p>
                        <p>To the Eunuch of the Great <hi>Begum,</hi> Sister to <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> a Watch in a painted Case, which cost two hundred and sixty Livres.</p>
                        <p>All these Presents which I made, as well to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> as to <hi>Cha-Est-Kan, Giaser-Kan,</hi> his Majesties Uncles; as also the Great Treasurer, to the Stewards of the Houses of the <hi>Kan</hi>'s, and those that brought me twice the <hi>Calaat,</hi> or Habit of Honour from the King, and as many times from the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> his Sister, and once from <hi>Giafar Kan;</hi> all these Presents, I say, came to twenty-three thousand one hundred fourscore and seven Livres. So true it is, that they who have any business to do at the Court of the great Princes, as well in <hi>Turky</hi> as in <hi>Persia</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> must not pretend to do any thing in reference to their affairs, till they have their Presents, and those very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, ready. Besides, that his Purse must be continually open to divers Officers of meaner reputation, who may be able to serve him. I did not mention in my first Volume the Present which I made to him that brought me the <hi>Calaat</hi> from the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to whom I gave two hundred Crowns.</p>

                        <p>I Have made several journeys to <hi>Golcondan,</hi> and have taken several Roads; sometimes by Sea embarking from <hi>Ormus</hi> for <hi>Malispata;</hi> sometimes set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out from <hi>Agra,</hi> but most often from <hi>Surat,</hi> which is the chiefest land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of <hi>Indolstan.</hi> But in this Chapter I will only speak of the common Road from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Golconda;</hi> wherein I comprehend that of <hi>Agra;</hi> which Road comes in at <hi>Dultabat,</hi> as I shall afterwards relate, making mention only of two journeys which I made in 1645, and 1652, for fear of tiring the Reader.</p>
                        <p>I departed from <hi>Surat</hi> in the year 1645, upon the nineteenth of <hi>January,</hi> and came to ly at <hi>Cambari,</hi> costes 3</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Dultabat</hi> is one of the best Fortresses in the Kingdoms of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> upon a Mountain every way steep; the only way to it being so narrow, that but one Horse, or one Camel can go at a time. This City is at the foot of the Mountain, very well wall'd. And this place of such importance, which the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s lost, when the Kings of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour</hi> revolted from them, was retaken in the Reign of <hi>Jehan-guire,</hi> by a subtle stratagem. <hi>Sultan Courom,</hi> who was afterwards call'd <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> commanded in <hi>Decan</hi> the Army of the King his Father; and <hi>Ast-Kan,</hi> Father in Law to <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> who was one of the Generals, gave the Prince some sort of language which so highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that immediately sending for one of his Papouche's, or Shoo's, he caus'd him to have six blows given him upon the Bonnet, which among the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106224:185"/>
                           <hi>Indians</hi> is the highest indignity can be put upon a man, after which he is no more to appear in the Prince's presence. This was done by consent between the Prince and the General, to deceive the World, more especially any Spies which the King of <hi>Visapour</hi> might have in the Prince's Army. The report of <hi>Ast-Kan's</hi> disgrace was immediately spread abroad: and he himself flying for Sanctuary to the King of <hi>Visapour,</hi> who had not cunning enough to discern the imposture, was welcom'd by the same King, and assur'd of his protection. <hi>Ast-Kan</hi> seeing himself so well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiv'd, begg'd leave of the King, that he might retire with ten or twelve of his Women, and as many of his Servants, into the Fortress of <hi>Dultabat,</hi> which was granted. He enter'd the Town with eight or ten Camels, the two <hi>Cajava's</hi> or Litters on each side of the Camel being close shut, to keep the Women from being seen. But instead of Women, he had put into every <hi>Cajava</hi> two Souldiers, all bold and resolv'd men, as were also every one of the suppos'd Eunuchs that led the Camels: so that he had no great difficulty to cut the Garrison in pieces, not being upon their guard; and to make himself Master of the place, which has been ever since under the Power of the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> There are in the place a great number of excellent Pieces of Cannon, and the Cannoniers are generally <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Hollanders.</hi> True it is, that there is one little Mountain higher than the Fortress; but there is hardly any way to it, but through the same Fortress. There was a <hi>Dutch-</hi>Engineer, who after he had serv'd the King fifteen or sixteen years, desir'd leave to be gone, and the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company it self, that had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the Service, did all they could to obtain it; but they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver procure it; because he was an excellent Cannonier, and very skilful in making Fire-works. The <hi>Raja Jesseing,</hi> who is the most Potent of all the Idolatrous Princes of <hi>India,</hi> and who was most powerfully Instrumental to put the Crown upon <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s Head, was sent as <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of the Army of this King, against the <hi>Raja Seva-gi;</hi> and passing by the Fortress of <hi>Dultabat,</hi> this <hi>Dutch-</hi>Cannonier went to wait upon him, all the Cannoniers of the Army being <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi> as well as he. The <hi>Hollander</hi> laying hold of this opportunity, told the <hi>Raja,</hi> that if he would procure him a Licence to depart, he would shew him a way to get up Cannon, and to mount them upon that Mountain which commanded the Fortress: for they had already wall'd it about, and put Souldiers upon it to keep it secure. The <hi>Raja</hi> pleas'd with his proposal, assur'd him that he would procure him the King's Licence, if he perform'd what he had propos'd. Thereupon the <hi>Hollander</hi> undertaking and accomplishing his design, the <hi>Raja</hi> was as good as his word, and obtain'd of the King to dismiss the <hi>Dutch-</hi>Cannonier: who came to <hi>Surat</hi> when I was there, about the beginning of the year 1667; whence he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd for <hi>Holland.</hi>

                           <hi>Aureng-abat</hi> was formerly but a Village, till <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> made it a City, though it be not wall'd. It grew to be thus enlarg'd, as well by reason of a Lake two leagues about, upon which the Village is built, as for the Memorys-sake of his first Wife, who is dead, by whom he had his Children. She is Interr'd toward the end of the Lake, upon the West-side, where the King has built a <hi>Mosquee,</hi> with a stately Monument, and a fair Inn. The <hi>Mosquee</hi> and the Monument were rear'd at a great expence, being cover'd with white-Marble, which is brought from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> by Waggon; being a journey of four Months. Going one time from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Golconda,</hi> I met five days journey from <hi>Aureng-abat,</hi> more than three-hunder'd Waggons laden with this Marble, the least whereof was drawn by twelve Oxen.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> and the Wars which it has maintain'd for some few years last past.</head>
                        <p>THE whole Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> take it in general, is a good Countrey, abounding in Corn, Rice, Cattel, Sheep, Poultry, and other necessaries for human life. In regard there are great store of Lakes in it, there is also great store of Fish. Above all the rest, there is a sort of Smelt, that has but one bone in the middle, which is most delicious food. Nature has contributed more than Art, toward the making these Lakes, whereof the Countrey is full; which are generally in places somewhat rais'd, so that you need do no more than make a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Dam upon the plain-side to keep in the water. These Dams or Banks are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times half a league long: and after the rainy seasons are over, they open the Sluces from time to time to let out the water into the adjacent Fields; where it is receiv'd by divers little Channels to water particular grounds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bagnagar</hi> is the name of the Metropolis of this Kingdom; but vulgarly it is call'd <hi>Golconda,</hi> from the name of a Fortress, not above two leagues distant from it, where the King keeps his Court. This Fortress is about two leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, and by consequence requires a numerous Guard. It is as it were a Town where the King keeps his Treasure: having left <hi>Bagnagar,</hi> ever since it was sack'd by the Army, which <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> brought against it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bagnagar</hi> is then the City, which they vulgarly call <hi>Golconda;</hi> and it was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Great Grandfather of the present King; upon the importunity of one of his Wives, whom he passionately lov'd, whose name was <hi>Nagar.</hi> Before that, it was only a place of Pleasure, where the King had very fair Gardens, till at length his Wife continually representing to him the delicacies of the situation for the building a City and a Palace, by reason of the River; he laid the foundations, and order'd that it should bear the name of his Wife, calling it <hi>Bag-Nagar,</hi> that is to say, the Garden of <hi>Nagar.</hi> This City lies in seventeen degrees of Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wanting two minutes. The Countrey round about is a flat Countrey, only neer the City are several Rocks, as you see about <hi>Fontain-Bleau.</hi> A great River washes the Walls of the City upon the South-west-side, which, neer to <hi>Maslipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> falls into the Gulf of <hi>Bengala.</hi> At <hi>Bagnagar</hi> you cross this River over a Bridg no less beautiful than <hi>Pont-Neus</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> The City is little less than <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> well-built, and full of windows. There are many fair large Streets, but not being well-pav'd: they are dusty, as are all the Cities of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> which is very offensive in the Summer.</p>
                        <p>Before you come to the Bridg, you must pass through a large Suburb, call'd <hi>Erengabad,</hi> about a league in length; where live all the Merchants, the Brokers, Handicraft-Trades, and in general, all the meaner sort of people; the City being inhabited only by persons of Quality, Officers of the King's House, Ministers of Justice, and Officers of the Army. From ten or eleven in the forenoon, till four or five in the evening, the Merchants, Brokers and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men come into the City to trade with the Forreign Merchants; after which time they return to their own Houses. In the Suburb are two or three fair <hi>Mosquees,</hi> which serve for Inns for the Forreigners, besides several Pagods in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-parts. Through the same Suburb lies the way to the Fortress of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So soon as you are over the Bridg, you enter into a large Street, that leads you to the King's Palace. On the right-hand are the Houses of some Lords of the Court; and four or five Inns two Stories-high: wherein there are fair Halls, and large Chambers to let in the fresh Air. At the end of this Street there is a large <hi>Piazza;</hi> upon which stands one of the sides of the Palace; in the middle whereof there is a Balcone, wherein the King comes to sit, when he pleases to give Audience to the People. The great Gate of the Palace stands not upon this <hi>Piazza,</hi> but upon another very neer adjoyning; and you enter first into a large
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106224:187"/>
Court surrounded with Portico's, under which lies the King's Guards. Out of this Court you pass into another, built after the same form, encompast with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fair Apartments, the Roofs whereof are terrass'd. Upon which, as upon those where the Elephants are kept, there are very fair Gardens, wherein there grow Trees of that bigness, that it is a thing of great wonder, how those Arches should bear so vast a burthen.</p>
                        <p>About fifty years since, they began to build a magnificent Pagod in the City; which would have been the fairest in all <hi>India,</hi> had it been finish'd. The Stones are to be admir'd for their bigness: And that wherein the Nich is made, which is on that side where they say their Prayers, is an entire Rock, of such a prodigious bulk, that it was five years before five or six-hunder'd men, continually employ'd, could hew it out of its place. They were forc'd also to rowl it along upon an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with wheels, upon which they brought it to the Pagod; and several affirm'd to me, that there were fourteen-hunder'd Oxen to drawit. I will tell you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after the reason it remains imperfect: For had it been finish'd, in all reason it had excell'd all the boldest Structures of <hi>Asia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the other side of the City, as you go to <hi>Maslipatan,</hi> there are two great Lakes, being each about a league in compass, wherein there ride several Pinks richly adorn'd for the King's Pleasure; and upon the Banks are several fair Houses that belong to the Principal Lords of the Court.</p>
                        <p>Upon three sides of the City stands a very fair <hi>Mosquee,</hi> wherein are the Tombs of the Kings of <hi>Golconda:</hi> and about four in the afternoon there is a Dole of Bread and <hi>Pilau</hi> to all the Poor that come. If you would see any thing that is rare, you must go to view these Tombs upon a Festival-day. For then from morning till night they are hung with rich Tapestry.</p>
                        <p>As for the Government and Policy which is observ'd in this City: In the first place, when a Stranger comes to the Gates, they search him exactly, to see if he have any Salt or Tobacco about him; for those Commodities bring the King his greatest Revenue. Sometimes a Stranger shall wait a day or two, before he shall have leave to enter. For a Souldier first gives notice to the Officer that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Guard, and then he sends to the <hi>Deroga,</hi> to know what he shall do. Now, because it many times happens that the <hi>Deroga</hi> is busy, or gone to take a walk out of the City, or else for that sometimes the Souldier himself pretends he cannot find the <hi>Deroga,</hi> only to create himself more errands, to get the more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; a Stranger is forc'd to endure all this delay, sometimes, as I have said before, for a day or two.</p>
                        <p>When the King sits to do Justice, I observe that he comes into the Balcone that looks into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and all that have business stand below, just against the place where the King sits. Between the People and the Walls of the Palace are fix'd in the ground three rows of Poles, about the length of an Half-Pike, to the ends whereof they tye certain ropes a-cross one upon another. Nor is any person whatsoever permitted to pass beyond those bounds, unless he be call'd. This Bar, which is never set up, but when the King sits in Judgment, runs along the whole bredth of the <hi>Piazza;</hi> and just against the Balcone there is a Bar to open, to let in those that are call'd. Then two men, that each of them hold a Cord by the end, extended all the bredth of the passage, have nothing to do but to let fall the Cord, for any person that is call'd to step over it. A Secretary of State sits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low under the Balcone, to receive all Petitions; and when he has five or six to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he puts them in a Bag, and then an Eunuch, who stands in the Balcone neer the King, lets down a string, to which the Bag being ti'd, he draws it up, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it to his Majesty.</p>
                        <p>Every Munday the chiefest of the Nobility mount the Guard, every one in their turn, and are never reliev'd till at the eight days end. There are some of these Lords that have five or six thousand men under their command; and they lye encamp'd in their Tents round about the City. When they mount the Guard, every one goes from his own Habitation to the Rendevouz; but when they are reliev'd, they march in good order over the Bridg, thence through the long Street into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where they draw up before the Balcone. In the first place, march ten or twelve Elephants, more or less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the Captain of the Guard. There are some of these
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106224:187"/>
Elephants that carry Cages, which in some sort resemble the Body of a little Coach; there are others that have but one man to guide them, and another in the Cage who carries a Banner.</p>
                        <p>After the Elephants, follow the Camels by two and two, sometimes to the number of thirty or forty. Every Camel carries a kind of Packsaddle, upon which is fasten'd a little Culverine, which a certain Engineer, clad in a skin from head to foot, and sitting upon the Crupper of the Camel, with a lighted Match in his hand; dextrously manages from one side to another before the Balcone, where the King sits.</p>
                        <p>After them come the Coaches, attended by the Domestick Servants of the Commander: Next to them follow the lead-Horses, and then the Lord appears, to whom all this Equipage belongs, attended by ten or twelve Curtisans, that stay for him at the end of the Bridg, and skip and dance before him to the <hi>Piazza.</hi> Behind him the Cavalry and Infantry march in good order: Which being a shew, wherein there was much of delight and state, all the while I staid at <hi>Bagnabar,</hi> which was about four Months, I had the divertisement to see them out of my Lodging in the great Street every week as they march'd by.</p>
                        <p>The Souldiers wear no other Clothes than only three or four ells of Calicut, with which they cover half their Bodies behind and before. They wear their hair very long, and tie it up in a knot upon the top of the crown, like the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have no other Headgear than only a piece of Linnen with three cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, one that comes to the middle of the head, and the other two, which they tie under their chins. The Souldiers do not wear Hangers or Scimitars like the <hi>Persians;</hi> but broad Swords like the <hi>Switzers,</hi> as well for a thrust, as a blow, which they hang in a Girdle. The Barrels of their Muskets are stronger than ours, and much neater; for their Iron is better, and not so subject to break. Their Cavalry carry Bows and Arrows, a Buckler and a Battel-Ax, an Headpiece and a Jacket of Mail, that hangs down from the Headpiece over their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                        <p>There are so great a number of common Women as well in the City as in the Suburbs, and in the Fortress, which is like another City, that there are generally above twenty thousand set down in the <hi>Deroga</hi>'s Book; without which licence, it is not lawful for any Woman to profess the Trade. They pay no tribute to the King; only they are oblig'd to come, a certain number of them, with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness, and their Musick every Friday, and present themselves before the Balcone. If the King be there, they dance before him: if he intend not to come, an Eunuch comes into the Balcone, and makes them a sign to retire. In the cool of the evening they stand at the doors of their Houses, which are for the most part little Huts; and when night comes, they set up a Candle or a lighted Lamp for a Signal: Then it is also that they open all the Shops where they sell <hi>Tari;</hi> which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain drink made of the juice of a Tree, and is as sweet as our new Wines. They fetch it some five or six leagues off, upon Horses, that carry two earthen-Bottles of each side, and trot at a great rate; of which there come every day to the City above five or six-hunder'd. The King has a considerable Revenue by the Impost which he lays upon this <hi>Tari.</hi> And for that reason he permits so many common Women, in regard it is for their sake that so much <hi>Tari</hi> is consum'd; those that sell it, for that cause, keeping their Shops by those Houses.</p>
                        <p>These sort of Women are so nimble and active, that when the present King went to see <hi>Maslipatan,</hi> nine of them undertook to represent the figure of an Elephant; four making the four feet, four the body, and one the trunk; upon which the King, sitting in a kind of Throne, made his entry into the City.</p>
                        <p>All the Men and Women of <hi>Golconda</hi> are well proportion'd, and of comely statures; and fair enough in their councenances; only the Countrey-people are a little more swart.</p>
                        <p>The present King of <hi>Golconda</hi> bears the Name of <hi>Abdoul-Coutou-Sha;</hi> and I will tell the Reader in a few words, from whence he drew his Original. In the Reign of <hi>Axbar</hi> King of <hi>India,</hi> the Father of <hi>Jehan-Guir,</hi> the Territories of the Great <hi>Moguls</hi> did not extend farther Southward then <hi>Narbider;</hi> to that the River which runs by it, and which coming from the South, empties it self into <hi>Ganges,</hi> separated their Dominions from the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Narsingue,</hi> that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106224:188"/>
stretch'd as far as <hi>Cape-Comorin,</hi> the other <hi>Raja</hi>'s being only his Subjects, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him. This <hi>Raja</hi> and his Successors have been always at Wars with them that succeeded to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> or <hi>Temur-leng</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> and their Power was so great, that the last <hi>Raja,</hi> who was at War with <hi>Akbar,</hi> brought into the Field four Armies under as many Generals. The most considerable of his Armies lay in those Provinces, which at this day are call'd the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda;</hi> the second was quarter'd in the Provinces of <hi>Visapour,</hi> the third in the Province of <hi>Dultabat,</hi> and the fourth in the Territories of <hi>Brampour.</hi> The <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Narsingue</hi> dying without Children, the four Generals divided among themselves the Countreys which they possess'd with their Army, and took upon them the title of Kings, the one of <hi>Golcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> the other of <hi>Visapour,</hi> the other of <hi>Brampour,</hi> and the fourth of <hi>Dultabat.</hi> Though the <hi>Raja</hi> were an Idolater, nevertheless his four Generals were <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> and he of <hi>Golconda</hi> was of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> descended from an Ancient Family of the <hi>Turcomans,</hi> which inhabit the Country of <hi>Hamadan</hi> in <hi>Persia.</hi> This General, as I have said, was more considerable than any of the rest; and some few days after the death of the <hi>Raja,</hi> they won a famous Victory from the <hi>Mogul;</hi> so that he could not hinder them from assuming their several Sovereignties. But after that, <hi>Jehan-Guir,</hi> the Son of <hi>Akbar,</hi> conquer'd again the Kingdom of <hi>Brampour, Cha-jehan</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehan-Guir</hi> recover'd the Kingdom of <hi>Dultabat,</hi> and <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> the Son of <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> recover'd some part of the Kingdom of <hi>Visapour.</hi> As for the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> neither <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> nor <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> disturb'd him, but let him rest in peace, upon condition that he should pay to the <hi>Mogul</hi> an annual tribute of 200000 Pagods. At present the greatest <hi>Raja</hi> on this side <hi>Ganges</hi> is the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Velou,</hi> whose Territories extend to <hi>Cape-Comorin,</hi> and who succeeded to some part of the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Narsingue:</hi> But in regard there is no Trade in his Countrey, and by consequence no concourse of strangers, there is little notice taken of him. The present King of <hi>Golconda</hi> has no Sons, but three Daughters, who are all married.</p>
                        <p>The Eldest Espous'd one of the Kinsmen of the <hi>Grand Chek</hi> of <hi>Mecca.</hi> Nor must we forget some passages that fell out before this Marriage. The <hi>Chek</hi> coming to <hi>Golconda</hi> in the habit of a <hi>Faquir,,</hi> for some Months lodg'd without the Gate of the Palace, disdaining to give any answer to several Courtiers, that demanded what his business was. At length the thing being made known to the King, he sent his chief Physitian, who spoke good <hi>Arabick,</hi> to know of the <hi>Chek</hi> what he had to request, and the reason of his coming. The Physitian, and some other Lords of the Court that discours'd him also, finding him to be a person of great Wit and Learning, brought him to the King, who was very well satisfi'd with his aspect and his presence. But at length the <hi>Chek</hi> declaring to him, that he came to Espouse the Princess; that proposal very much surpriz'd the Prince, and was look'd upon by the greatest part of the Court, as made by a person not well in his wits. At first the King only laugh'd at him. But when he found him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately persevering in his demand, in-so-much that he threaten'd the Countrey with some strange Calamity, if the Princess were not given to him in Marriage, he was committed to Prison, where he lay a long time. At length the King think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more to the purpose to send him back into his own Countrey, caus'd him to be ship'd away at <hi>Mastipatan,</hi> in a Vessel that carri'd Goods and Pilgrims to <hi>Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> whence they travell by land to <hi>Mecca.</hi> About two years after the same <hi>Chek</hi> return'd again to <hi>Golconda,</hi> and order'd his affairs so well, that he Espous'd the Princess, and won an high reputation in the Kingdom, which he governs at this day, and is very Potent. He it was that kept the King from surrendring the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress of <hi>Golconda,</hi> whither he was retir'd, when <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> and his Son took <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar,</hi> as I shall tell you by and by, threatning to kill him, if he would not resolve to hold it out, and not deliver the keys to the enemy. This bold action wss the reason which made the King love him ever afterwards; and that he takes his counsel in all weigty affairs, not as he is the King's Son-in-Law, but as he is a great Minister of State, and the chiefest person, next the King, in all the Court. He it was that has put a stop to the finishing the great Pagod in <hi>Bagnagar,</hi> having threaten'd the whole Kingdom with some great Calamity, if they went forward with the work. This Prince is a passionate Lover of all those that profess the Mathematicks, and understands them as well. For which reason, though he be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106224:188"/>
a Mahumetan, he is a great Favourer of all the Christians, who are vers'd in that Science, as he has particularly testifi'd to Father <hi>Ephrahim,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> passing through <hi>Golconda</hi> for <hi>Pegu,</hi> whither he was sent by his Superiors. He did all he could to oblige him to stay in the Country, and offer'd to build him a House and a Church at his own expences; telling him, he should neither want employment, nor Hearers, in regard there were several <hi>Portuguese</hi> Christians, and several <hi>Armenians</hi> that came thither to trade. But Father <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> having a particular Order to go to <hi>Pegu,</hi> could not accept of his Offer; yet when he went to take his leave of the <hi>Check,</hi> he presented him with a <hi>Calaat,</hi> the most noble that was in his Wardrobe; being the whole habit; the Cap, the <hi>Cabay</hi> or large Vest, the <hi>Arcalou</hi> or short Cassock, two pair of Drawers, two Shirts, and two Scarfs, which they wear about their necks, and over their heads to keep off the heat of the Sun. The Friar was surpriz'd at the present, and gave the <hi>Check</hi> to understand, that it was not proper for him to wear it: however the <hi>Check</hi> would force him to take it, telling him he might accommodate some of his Friends with it. Two months after Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> bestow'd the same Present upon me, being at <hi>Surat;</hi> for which I return'd him thanks.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Check</hi> seeing he could not detain the Father, and unwilling he should go a foot from <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Mastipatan,</hi> oblig'd him to take an Oxe, with two Men to lead it; and because he could not perswade him to take also thirty Pagods, which he presented the Father withall, he commanded the two men, when they came to <hi>Mastipatan,</hi> to leave the Oxe and the thirty Pagods with him, which they did very punctually; for otherwise at their return to <hi>Golconda,</hi> they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their lives. I will finish the History of Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when I come to the discription of <hi>Goa,</hi> which is the principal place that the <hi>Portugals</hi> have in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second Daughter of the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> was married to <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humad,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Aurengzeb;</hi> the occasion whereof was this: <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimola,</hi> Generalissimo of the King of <hi>Golconda</hi>'s Army, and who had been very serviceable to his Master, to settle the Crown upon his head, according to the custom, left with the King as a mark of his fidelity, both his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Hostage; for he was sent to reduce certain <hi>Raja's</hi> in <hi>Bengala,</hi> that were in Rebellion. He had several Daughters, but only one Son, who had a great train, and made a great noise at Court. The reputation and riches which <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimola</hi> had gain'd, rais'd him up several Enemies, who endeavour'd in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to ruine him, and to put him out of the Kings favour. They pretended that the great power of <hi>Mirgimola</hi> was very much to be suspected; that all his designs tended to dethrone him, and to settle the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Son; that it behov'd him not to stay till the remedy were past cure, but to rid himself of an Enemy, so much the more to be fear'd, the closer he kept his intentions; and that the shortest and best way was to poyson him. The King being easily perswaded, gave them leave and authority to act as they pleas'd for his security; but having miss'd of their design for three or four times together, <hi>Mirgimola's</hi> Son began to smell the plot; and immediately gave advice thereof to his Father. It is not known what instructions he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his Father; but so soon as he had his answer, he went to the King, and spoke boldly to him, taxing him with the services which his Father had done him, and that without his assistance he had never come to the Crown. The young Lord, naturally of a fiery disposition, kept on this discourse, so displeasing to the King, till at length his Majesty flung away; and the Lords that were present, fell upon the young man, and basely misus'd him. At the same time also he was arrested and committed to prison, together with his Mother and Sisters. Which action, as it made a great noise at Court, coming to <hi>Mirgimola's</hi> ears, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd him, that having an Army under his command, and being belov'd by the Soldiers, he resolv'd to make use of the advantages he had, to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the injury done him. He was then not far from <hi>Bengala,</hi> being sent, as I said before, to reduce certain <hi>Raja's</hi> to obedience, whose Territories lye upon the <hi>Ganges;</hi> and <hi>Sultan-Sujah, Cha-jehan</hi>'s second Son, being then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Bengala,</hi> the General thought it his best way to address himself to him; as being the next Prince, with whom he might join his Forces against
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106224:189"/>
the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> whom he look'd upon now no more as his Master, but as one of his most inveterate Enemies. Thereupon he wrote to the Prince to this effect: That if he would join with him, he would give him an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to possess himself of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Golconda;</hi> and that he should not neglect so fair an opportunity to enlarge the Dominions of the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul,</hi> the succession whereof might as well concern him, as any of the rest of his Brothers. But the Answer which <hi>Sultan-Sujah</hi> sent him, was contrary to his expectation; who told him, that he could not tell how to trust a person, who as he went about to betray his King, might more easily be drawn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a Foreign Prince, whom he had inveigl'd only for the sake of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and that therefore he should not rely upon him. Upon <hi>Sultan-Sujah's</hi> refusal, <hi>Mirgimola</hi> wrote to <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> who was then in his Government of <hi>Brampoure,</hi> who being not so nice as his Brother, accepted of the proposal that was made him. Thus while <hi>Mirgimola</hi> advanc'd with his Troops toward <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar, Aurengzeb</hi> hasten's toward <hi>Decan,</hi> and both Armies being join'd, they came to the Gates of <hi>Bagnabar</hi> before the King was in a posture to receive them. He had only time to retreat into his Fortress of <hi>Golconda,</hi> to which <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> after he had rifl'd the City of <hi>Bagnabar,</hi> and plunder'd the Palace, lay'd a close Siege. The King seeing himself thus vigorously press'd, sent away to <hi>Mirgimola</hi> his Wife and Children very honourably. For there is vertue and generosity in the <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Europeans;</hi> of which I will give you an illustrious Example in the person of the King of <hi>Golconda.</hi> Some days after the Enemy had besieg'd the Fortress, a Canoneer espying <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> upon his Elephant, riding about to view the Fortifications of the Castle, told the King, being then upon the Bastion, that if he pleas'd he would fetch off <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> with a Canon-shot; and at the same time was about to give fire, but the King holding his hand, told him he perceiv'd it well enough, but that it behov'd Kings to be better Husbands of the Lives of Princes. The Canoneer obey'd the King, and instead of shooting at <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> he took off the Head of the General of his Army, who was a little before him; which put a stop to the Assault they were about to have giv'n, the Army being in a confusion upon his death. <hi>Abdul-jaber-Beg,</hi> General of the King of <hi>Golconda's</hi> Army, lying not far from the Camp, with a flying Army of four thousand Horse, understanding the disorder of the Enemy by reason of the loss of their General, laid hold of so favourable an opportunity, gave them a desperate charge in that confusion, and putting them to the rout, pursu'd them till night, for four or five Leagues. Some few days before the General's death, the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> finding that his provisions fail'd him in the Fortress, was about to have deliver'd the Keys; but as I said before, <hi>Mirza-Mahomed,</hi> his Son-in-Law, snatch'd them out of his hand, and threatn'd to kill him, if he persever'd in that resolution. Which was the reason, that the King who lov'd him not before, had ever after the greatest affection imaginable for him as long as he liv'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> being thus constrain'd to raise his Siege, stay'd some days to rally his Troops; and having receiv'd a recruit of fresh men, return'd again to the Siege, with new resolutions. But <hi>Mirgimola,</hi> who had still some kindness for the King remaining in his breast, would not permit <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> to use the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of extremity, but by his wit and good management gain'd a suspension of Arms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> the Father of <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> had formerly had great kindnesses shew'n him by the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> to whom he fled, after he had lost the Battel, together with his eldest Brother, which he fought against <hi>Jehan-guir</hi> his Father, with whom he made War. The eldest Son was taken, and <hi>Jehan-guir</hi> caus'd his eyes to be put out; but <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> being more wary, fled, and was entertain'd by the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> with whom he enter'd into a particular and strict friendship; <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> making an Oath to his Benefactor, that he would never wage. War against him upon any occasion whatever. <hi>Mirgimola</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing that it would be no difficult thing to bring two Kings, that were Friends, to an accommodation, wrought underhand with both, toward the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of a Peace. And he so brought his business about, that the King of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> writ a Letter first to <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> wherein he submissively requested him
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106224:189"/>
to be an Arbitrator between <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> and him, promising to submit wholly to him, and to sign such Articles as he should propose. By the same policy of <hi>Mirgimola, Cha-jehan</hi> was advis'd, in answer to the King of <hi>Golconda's</hi> Letter, to propose a Match between his second Daughter and <hi>Sultan Mahomed,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> upon condition that after the death of the King her Father, the Son-in-Law should inherit the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda.</hi> This proposition being accepted, the Peace was concluded, and the Nuptials celebrated with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Magnificence. As for <hi>Mirgimola,</hi> he quitted the service of the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> and went with <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> to <hi>Brampour.</hi> Soon after <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> made him his Prime Minister of State, and Generalissimo of his Armies; and he it was that so potently assisted <hi>Aurengzeb</hi> to get the Crown, by the defeat of <hi>Sultan-Sujah.</hi> For <hi>Mirgimola</hi> was a person of great wit, and no less understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Military than in State affairs. I had occasion to speak with him several times; and I have no less admir'd his justice, than his dispatch to all people that had to do with him; while he gave out several Orders, and sign'd several Dispatches at the same time, as if he had but one entire business in hand.</p>
                        <p>The other Princess of <hi>Golconda</hi> was promis'd to <hi>Sultan Sejed,</hi> another <hi>Chek</hi> of <hi>Mecca;</hi> and the Match went on so fairly, that the day was appointed for the celebration of the Nuptials; but <hi>Abdoul-Jaber-Beg,</hi> General of the Army, with six other Lords, went to the King to divert him from his intention; and they brought it so to pass, that the Match was broken off, and the Princess was given in Marriage to <hi>Mirza-Abdoul-Cofing,</hi> the Kings Cousin; by whom she has two Sons, which have wholly annull'd the Pretentions of <hi>Aurengzeb's</hi> Son; whose Father now keeps him in Prison, in the Fort of <hi>Gavaleor,</hi> for having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Uncle <hi>Sultan Sujah's</hi> part against him. The Princess had been given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Mirza-Abdoul-Cofing,</hi> but for his debauchery, which render'd him little regarded by the King. But since his marriage he is very much reclaim'd.</p>
                        <p>Now the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> does not stand in so much fear of the <hi>Moguls;</hi> for in imitation of them, he keeps his Money in his own Country, and has already hoarded up a Treasury sufficient to maintain his Wars. Besides, he is altogether addicted to the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> so that he will not wear a Bonnet, like the other <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> because they say <hi>Haly</hi> wore none; but another sort of attire for the head. Which is the reason that the <hi>Persians,</hi> that come into <hi>India</hi> to seek their fortune, apply themselves rather to the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> then to the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> Such is the condition of the King of <hi>Visapour</hi> also, whom the Queen, Sister to the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> takes care to educate in the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> which invites great numbers of <hi>Persians</hi> into her Service.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>FRom <hi>Maslipatan</hi> they count it an hunder'd <hi>costes</hi> or leagues, taking the right way. But if you go by the <hi>Diamond-Mine,</hi> which in the <hi>Persian</hi> Language is call'd <hi>Coulour,</hi> in the <hi>Indian, Gani;</hi> they reckon it an hunder'd and twelve leagues: and this is the Road which I generally took.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Tenara,</hi> costes 4</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tenara</hi> is a sweet place, where there are four very fair Houses, to every one of which belongs a large Garden. One of the four standing upon the left-hand along the High-way, is much more beautiful then any of the other three. It is built of Free-stone two stories high, wherein there are several fair Galleries, Halls, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and lodging-Chambers. Before the front of the House is a large four-square <hi>Piazza,</hi> little inferior to the <hi>Place Royale</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> Upon every one of the other three fronts there is a great Portal, on each side whereof there is a fair Platform rais'd from the earth above four or five-foot-high, and well-Arch'd, where Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers of Quality are lodg'd. On the top of each Portal there is a strong Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luster,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106224:190"/>
and a little Chamber for the Ladies. When Persons of Quality care not to be in their Houses,, they set up Tents in their Gardens; and you must take notice that there is no dwelling for any person but only in the three Houses; for the fourth, which is the fairest, belongs only to the Queen. When she is not there however, any body may see it, and take a walk in the Garden, which is a very lovely place, and well-stor'd with water. The whole <hi>Piazza</hi> is encompast with several Chambers for the lodging of poor Travellers; who every day toward the evening have an Alms bestow'd upon them, of Rice, or Pulse, which they boil ready to their hands. But for the Idolaters that eat nothing which is provided by other hands, they give them flower to make Bread, and a little Butter. For when their Bread is bak'd like a broad thin Cake, they dip it in the melted-But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                        <p>From <hi>Lakabaron</hi> to <hi>Coulour</hi> or <hi>Gani,</hi> of which I shall speak in my discourse of the Mines, costes 11</p>
                        <p>The greatest part of the way from <hi>Lakabaron</hi> to <hi>Coulour,</hi> especially when you come near to <hi>Coulour,</hi> is very rocky; so that I was forc'd in some places to take my Coach off the Carriages, which was presently done. If you meet with any good Earth between those Rocks, there you shall find <hi>Cassia-</hi>Trees, that bear the best <hi>Cassia,</hi> and the most laxative in all <hi>India.</hi> Which I found by its working with my men that eat of it by the way.</p>
                        <p>There runs a great River by the Town of <hi>Coulour,</hi> which falls into the Gulf of <hi>Bengala</hi> neer <hi>Mastipatan.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>From <hi>Kah-Kaly</hi> to <hi>Bezouar,</hi> costes 6</p>
                        <p>Near to <hi>Bezouar</hi> you must repass the River of <hi>Coulour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From <hi>Bezouar</hi> to <hi>Vouchir,</hi> costes 4</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Vouchir</hi> to <hi>Nilimor,</hi> costes 4</p>
                        <p>About half the way between <hi>Vouchir</hi> and <hi>Nilimor,</hi> you must cross a great River upon a Float-boat of Timber, there being no other kind of Boat in that place.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Nilimor</hi> to <hi>Milmol,</hi> costes 6</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Milmol</hi> to <hi>Mastipatan,</hi> costes 4</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mastipatan</hi> is a great City, the Houses whereof are only of Wood, built at a distance one from another. The place it self, which stands by the Sea, is famous for nothing but the Road for Ships which belongs to it, which is the best in the Gulf of <hi>Bengala;</hi> and from hence they set Sail for <hi>Pegu,</hi> for <hi>Siam,</hi> for <hi>Aracan,</hi> for <hi>Bengala,</hi> for <hi>Cochinchine,</hi> for <hi>Mecca,</hi> and for <hi>Ormus,</hi> as also for the Islands of <hi>Madagascar, Sumatra</hi> and the <hi>Manille's.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You must take notice, that from <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Mastipatan,</hi> there is no travelling by Waggons, by reason of the high Mountains, Lakes and Rivers that make the Road very streight and impassable. 'Tis a very difficult thing to carry a little Coach thither; for I was forc'd to have my own taken off the Carriages, and so to have it lifted out of the bad way. The Road is every jot as bad between <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Cape-Comorin;</hi> a Waggon being hardly so much as made mention of all the way; for that there is no other way to travel, or for the carriage of Goods, than with Horses and Oxen. But instead of Coaches, they have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of <hi>Pallekie's,</hi> wherein you are carried with more speed and more ease than in any part of <hi>India.</hi>

                        <p>YOu may go from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> partly by Land, and partly by Sea. But the Road being very bad by Land, generally Travellers go by Sea, and hiring an <hi>Almadier,</hi> which is a Barque with Oars, they go by the Shoar to <hi>Goa:</hi> though sometimes the <hi>Malavares</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Pirats are very much to be fear'd all along those Coasts, as I shall tell you in due place.</p>
                        <p>The way from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> is not reckon'd by <hi>Costes,</hi> but by <hi>Gos,</hi> one of which makes four of our common Leagues.</p>

                        <p>The great danger which you run along the Coast, is the hazard of falling into the hands of the <hi>Malvares,</hi> who are violent <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and very cruel to the Christians. I saw a bare-foot <hi>Carmelite-</hi>Friar who had been taken by those Pirats. This Friar, to get his ransom the sooner, they put to that kind of torture, that his right-arm was shorter by one half then his left, and so it was with one leg. The Captains do not give above six Crowns to every Souldier for the whole six months that they are usually out at Sea: Then the Souldiers may return home, and if their Captains will have them stay longer, they must allow'em more pay. They seldom venture out above 20 or 25 leagues at Sea, which is no great hazard of the Vessel. But sometimes the <hi>Portuguese's</hi> snap them, and then they either hang 'em up presently, or throw 'em over-board. These <hi>Malavares</hi> carry sometimes 200, sometimes 250 men, and they sail together in Squadrons of ten or fifteen Barques to attack a great Vessel, not caring a rush for the great Guns. They come board and board so suddenly, and cast such a quantity of Pots of Artificial Fire upon the deck, that if there be not speedy remedy appli'd, they will presently do a world of mischief. Generally our Seamen, knowing the custom of these Pirats, when they come within ken, presently shut up the Scuttles, and fill the deck with water, to hinder the Fire-Pots from doing execution.</p>
                        <p>An <hi>English</hi> Captain, whose name was Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> coming from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> not far from <hi>Cochin,</hi> met a Squadron of these <hi>Malvares,</hi> consisting of 25 or 30 of these Barques. Who came board and board, and vigorously attack'd him. The Captain seeing he could not withstand their first Fury, put fire to some Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder, and blowing up the deck, blew a great number of the Pirats into the Sea. Nevertheless, the rest were nothing discourag'd, but boarded the Ship a second time. The <hi>English</hi> Captain seeing there was no help, put his men into two Shallops, and staying behind in his Cabin, where the Pirats could not enter so suddenly, he set fire to a Train which he had laid, that reach'd to all the rest of the Powder, and at the same time leaping into the Sea, was taken up by his own men. In the mean time the Ship being all a-fire, the Pyrats leapt into the Sea also. But for all this, the two Shallops, wherein there were about forty <hi>English,</hi> were taken by the rest of the <hi>Malvares,</hi> that were Fresh-men; and I was then at breakfast with the <hi>English</hi> President, Mr. <hi>Fremelin,</hi> when he receiv'd a Letter from Captain <hi>Clark,</hi> that he was a Slave to <hi>Samorin,</hi> who is the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble King all along the Pirats Coast. The Prince would not leave the <hi>English</hi> in the hands of those Scoundrels, knowing that they would have been in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their lives, by reason that above twelve-hunder'd Women had lost their Husbands, in the two times that the Ship had been fir'd. However the King
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106224:191"/>
found a means to appease them, promising to each of them that had lost their Husbands two <hi>Piasters,</hi> every <hi>Piaster</hi> being four shillings a piece, which came to above two thousand four hundred Crowns, besides four thousand, which were to be paid for the Ransom of the Captain and the other Sea-men, immediately the President sent the Money, and I saw them at their return, some in health, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in violent Feavers. The <hi>Malavares</hi> are a People so superstitious, that they never touch any thing that is foul or soyl'd, with their Right Hands, but only with the Left, the Nails of which Fingers they let grow, and use instead of Combs, for they wear their Hair long like the Women, tying it about their Heads in wreaths, and binding it with a Linnen cloath with three corners.</p>
                        <p>Since I have mention'd <hi>Daman,</hi> I will tell you in a few words how that City was besieg'd by <hi>Aureng-Zeb</hi> the present Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> Some are of opinion that Elephants do great matters in War; which may be sometimes true, but not alwaws; for very often instead of doing mischief to the Enemy, they turn upon those that lead them, and rout their own party as <hi>Aureng-Zeb</hi> found by experience, at the Siege of this City. He was twenty days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Daman,</hi> and resolv'd at length to Storm it upon a Sunday, believing that the Christians were like the Jews and would not defend it upon that day. He that commanded the Place was an old Souldier, who had serv'd in <hi>France,</hi> and had three Sons with him. In the Town were eight hundred Gentlemen, and other stout Souldiers, who came from all parts to signalize their valour at that Siege. For though the <hi>Mogul</hi> had in his Army above forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, he could not hinder relief from being put into <hi>Daman</hi> by Sea, in regard that he wanted Ships. The Sunday that the Prince intended to Storm, the Governour of <hi>Daman,</hi> as had been order'd at the Councel of War, caus'd Mass to be said presently after Midnight, and then made a Sally with all his Cavalry and some part of his Infantry, who were to fall on upon that quarter which was guarded by two hundred Elephants. Among those Elephants they flung a great number of Fire-works, which so affrighted them in the dark of the Night, that knowing not whither they went, nor being to be rul'd by their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, they turn'd upon the Besiegers with so much fury, that in less than two or three hours half the Army of <hi>Aureng-Zeb</hi> was cut in pieces, and in three days the Siege was rais'd; nor would the Prince after that, have any more to do with the Christians.</p>
                        <p>I made two Voiages to <hi>Goa</hi> the one at the beginning of the year 1641. the second at the beginning of the year 1648. The first time I stay'd but five days, and return'd by Land to <hi>Surat.</hi> From <hi>Goa</hi> I went to <hi>Bicholly,</hi> which is upon the main Land, thence to <hi>Visapour,</hi> thence to <hi>Golconda,</hi> thence to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-abat,</hi> and so to <hi>Surat.</hi> I could have gone to <hi>Surat</hi> without passing through <hi>Golconda,</hi> but my business led me that way.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Visapour;</hi> costes. 85</p>
                        <p>Which takes up generally eight days journey.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Visapour</hi> to <hi>Golconda,</hi> costes. 100</p>
                        <p>Which I travel'd in nine days.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Aureng-abat,</hi> the Stages are not so well order'd, being sometimes sixteen, sometime twenty five, sometimes twenty Leagues asunder.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Aureng-abat</hi> to <hi>Surat</hi> takes up sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen, sometimes sixteen days journey.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Visapour</hi> is a great scambling City, wherein there is nothing remarkable, neither as to the publick Edifices, nor as to Trade. The Kings Palace is a vast one but ill built; and the access to it is very dangerous, in regard there are abundance of Crocodiles that lie in the Water which encompass it. The King of <hi>Visapour</hi> has three good ports in his Dominions, <hi>Rejapour, Daboult,</hi> and <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paten.</hi> The last is the best of all, where the Sea beats upon the foot of the Mountain, and you have fourteen or fifteen Fathom Water near the Land. Upon the top of the Mountain there is a Fort, with a Spring of Water in it. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paten</hi> is not above five days journey from <hi>Goa</hi> to the North. And <hi>Rabaque,</hi> where the King of <hi>Visapour</hi> sels his Pepper, is as far distant from it to the East. The King of <hi>Visapour</hi> and the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> have been formerly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the Great <hi>Mogul:</hi> but now they are absolute of themselves.</p>

                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106224:191"/>
This Kingdom was for some time disquieted by the revolt of <hi>Nair-seva-gi,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King of <hi>Visapour</hi>'s Guards; After which the young <hi>Seva-gi</hi> his Son conceiv'd so deadly a hatred against the King, that he made himself the head of certain <hi>Banditi,</hi> and as he was both wise and liberal, he got together so many Horse and Foot, as made a compleat Army; the Souldiers flocking to to him from all parts, for the reputation of his Liberality. And he was just about to have led them to action, when the King of <hi>Visapour</hi> happen'd to dye without Children, so that with little or no trouble he got possession of one part of the Coast of <hi>Malavar;</hi> taking <hi>Rejapour, Rasigar, Crapaten, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boul,</hi> and other places. They report that upon his demolishing the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Rasigar,</hi> he found vast Treasures, which help'd him to pay his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were alwayes well paid. Some years before the death of the King, the Queen perceiving no probability of having any Children, adopted a little Boy, upon whom she bestow'd all her affections, and caused him to be brought up in the Doctrine of <hi>Haly</hi>'s Sect, The King upon his Death-bed caus'd this Adopted Son to be Proclaim'd King; but <hi>Seva-gi</hi> having a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army continu'd the War, and much disturb'd the Regency of the Queen. At length he made the first propositions for Peace; which was concluded upon conditions, that he should quietly enjoy the Territories; which he had subdu'd, that he should become Tributary to the King, and pay him the half of all his Revenue. The young King being thus fix'd in his Throne, the Queen Regent went in Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca;</hi> and I was at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> when she pass'd through the Town in her return home.</p>
                        <p>When I made my second Voiage to <hi>Goa,</hi> I embark'd in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Vessel call'd the <hi>Maestricht,</hi> which carry'd me to <hi>Mingrela,</hi> where I landed the eleventh day of <hi>January,</hi> 1648.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mingrela</hi> is a large Town, extended half a League in length upon the Sea, in the Territories of <hi>Visapour.</hi> It is one of the best Roads in all <hi>India,</hi> where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> take in fresh Provisions every time they sail to block up <hi>Goa,</hi> as also when they are bound upon Trade for many other parts of <hi>India.</hi> For at <hi>Mingrela</hi> there is both excellent Water, and excellent Rice. This Town is also very famous for <hi>Cardamoms,</hi> which the Eastern people esteem the best of Spices, not being to be had in any other Countrey; which makes that sort of Commodity very scarce and very dear. There is also made great store of course Calecuts, that are spent in the Countrey; besides great quantities of course Matting, that serves to pack up goods. So that both in respect of Trade, as also for the furnishing their Ships with fresh Provisions, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauders</hi> have a Factory in the Town. For, as I said before, not only all Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels that come from <hi>Batavia,</hi> from <hi>Japon,</hi> from <hi>Bengala, Ceylan,</hi> and other places, and those that are bound for <hi>Surat,</hi> the <hi>Red Sea, Ormus, Balsara, &amp;c.</hi> both going and coming, come to an Anchor in the Road of <hi>Mingrela,</hi> but also while the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are at Wars with the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and lye before the Bar of <hi>Goa,</hi> where they have usually eight or ten Sail, they send their small Barks to <hi>Mingrela</hi> for Provisions. For the <hi>Hollanders</hi> lye eight Months in a year before the mouth of the Port of <hi>Goa,</hi> so that there can nothing pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Goa</hi> by Sea all that time. You must also take notice, that the Bar of <hi>Goa</hi> is also stopt up some part of the year by the Sands which the South and West-winds that precede the great Rains, cast up; so that there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a foot, or a foot and a half Water for very small Boats. But when the great Rains come, the Water swells and carrying away the Sands, opens a passage for the great Vessels.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Observations upon the present State of the City of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>GOA</hi> lies in 15 Degrees, 32 minutes of Latitude, in an Island six or seven leagues about, upon the River of <hi>Mandoua,</hi> ten leagues from the mouth of the River. The Island abounds in Corn and Rice, and bears several sorts of Fruit, as <hi>Manga's, Anana's, Adam</hi>'s-<hi>Figs,</hi> and <hi>Coco's.</hi> But most certainly a Pippin is far beyond all those fruits. All those that have seen <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> agree with me, that the Port of <hi>Goa,</hi> the Port of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Toulou,</hi> are three of the fairest Ports of all our vast Continent. The City is very large, and the Walls are of good Stone. The Houses are for the most part very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently built, especially the <hi>Viet-Roy</hi>'s Palace. There are in it a great number of Apartments, and in one part of the Rooms and Chambers, which are very large, hang several Pictures, wherein are severally painted by themselves, the Ships that come from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> with those that are bound from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with the name of the Vessel, the Captain, and the number of Guns which the Ship carries. If the City were not so closely environ'd with Hills, it would doubtless be better inhabited, and the air would be much more wholsome. But these Mountains keep off the cool winds, which is the reason that the heats are very excessive. Beef and Pork is the ordinary diet of the Inhabitants of <hi>Goa.</hi> They have good store of Poultry, and some few Pidgeons; but though <hi>Goa</hi> be very neer the Sea, Fish is very scarce. They have abundance of all sorts of Sweet-meats, and feed upon them very much.</p>
                        <p>Before the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had brought down the power of the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> there was nothing to be seen at <hi>Goa,</hi> but Magnificence and Riches: but the <hi>Dutch</hi> having every where got their Trade out of their hands, they have lost their springs of Gold and Silver, and are fallen from their former splendor. In my first Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Goa</hi> I met with people of fashion, that had above two-thousand Crowns Revenue; at my second Voyage the same persons came privately to me in the evening, to beg an Alms; yet abating nothing, for all that, of their inherent pride and haughtiness: Nay, their Women will come in <hi>Palleki's</hi> to the door, and stay while a Boy, that attends them, has brought you a Complement from his Mistress. Then usually you send them what you please, or carry it your self, if you have a curiosity to see their faces; which rarely can be done, because they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a veil from head to foot. Moreover, if you go your self to present them your Charity, they will give you a little note, containing a recommendation of some religious Person, who signifies what substantial persons they have been, and how they came to fall to decay. Sometimes, if the person be handsom, she is desir'd to walk in; and to take a Collation, which lasts most commonly till the next day. Hadnot the <hi>Portugals</hi> so many Fortresses to keep upon the Land; or had, not, out of their contempt of the <hi>Hollander</hi> they neglected their affairs, they could never have been reduc'd to so low a condition.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Portugueses</hi> have no sooner made the <hi>Cape of Good-Hope,</hi> but they are all <hi>Fidalgues</hi> or Gentlemen; and add the Title of <hi>Dom</hi> to the single name of <hi>Pedro</hi> or <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> which they receiv'd at their Baptism: From whence they are call'd the <hi>Fidalgues</hi> or Gentlemen of the <hi>Cape of Good-Hope.</hi> As they change their Names, they also change their Nature; for it may be truly said, that the <hi>Indian-Portugals</hi> are the most revengeful persons, and the most jealous of their Wives of any persons in the World. And when the least suspition creeps into their noddles, they rid themselves of them either by Poison or Dagger. If they have an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they never pardon him; but if he be a person of that courage that they dare not grapple with him, their Masters have attending upon them a sort of black Slaves, that if they command them to kill any one, the Slaves will do it with a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; which they do either with a Dagger, or a Pistol, or else by knocking the party on the head with a club, which they always carry, about the length of an Half-Pike. If it happen that they stay too long before they can meet with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106224:192"/>
ere they can dispatch their mischief; and that they cannot conveniently meet the person to be murther'd, in the Fields or in the City, they are no such Saints, but they will kill him at the very Altar, while he is at his devotions; of which I saw two fatal presidents, the one at <hi>Goa,</hi> the other at <hi>Daman.</hi> At <hi>Daman</hi> three or four of these black Slaves perceiving some persons whom they were to murther, at Mass in the Church, discharg'd their Muskets at them through the windows, never considering what other mischief they might do to any other persons, against whom they had no quarrel or design. The same thing happen'd at <hi>Goa,</hi> where seven men were kill'd close by the Altar, and the Priest that said Mass was dangerously wounded at the same time. Nor do their Courts of Justice take any cognizance of these crimes, for generally the guilty persons are the chiefest of the Countrey. As for their Suits of Law, there is no end of them, for they are manag'd by the <hi>Canarins,</hi> who are Natives of the Countrey, whose business it is to follow the Law; the most subtil and crafty sort of people in the World.</p>
                        <p>To return to the ancient Power of the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> most certain it is, that if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had never come among them, you should not have seen a bit of Iron in any <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchant's House; but all Gold or Silver; for they needed no more than to make three or four Voyages to <hi>Japan,</hi> the <hi>Philippin,</hi> or <hi>Molucca</hi> Islands, or to <hi>China</hi> to enrich themselves; gaining at their return above five or six for one upon rich Merchandizes. The very Souldiers as well as the Captains and Governors enrich'd themselves by Trade. There was not any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, unless it be the Governor, who was not a Trader; or if he does Trade, it is in another man's name, for he has Revenue enough without it. Formerly it was one of the fairest employments of the World to be <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Goa:</hi> and there are but few Monarchs, that have Governments at their disposal, which are equal in value to some of those which depend upon this <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi> The chief Command is that of <hi>Mozambique</hi> for three years. In those three years the Governor gets above four or five-hunder'd-thousand Crowns, and sometimes more, if in all that time they receive no losses from the <hi>Cafres.</hi> These <hi>Cafres</hi> are people that bring Gold for the Commodities which they carry away; and if any one of them happen to dye, going or coming, whatever you trusted them withall is lost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redemption. The Governour of <hi>Mozambique</hi> trades also with the Negro's that inhabit all along the Coast of <hi>Melinda;</hi> and they ordinarily pay for the goods they buy, either in Elephants Teeth, or Ambergreese. When I was last in <hi>Goa,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Mozambique,</hi> who return'd to <hi>Goa</hi> after he had been three years in his Command, had by him only in Ambergreese, two hundred thousand Crowns, not reckoning his Gold, and his Elephants Teeth, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to a far larger sum.</p>
                        <p>The second Government was that of <hi>Malaca,</hi> by reason of the Custom which was there to be paid. For it is a Streight through which all Vessels that are bound from <hi>Goa,</hi> for <hi>Japon, China, Cochinchina, Java, Macassar,</hi> the <hi>Phillippin</hi> Islands, and many other places, must of necessity pass. They may sail another way by the Island of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> toward the West, and so through the Streight of <hi>Sonde,</hi> or else leave the Island of <hi>Java</hi> to the North; but when the Ships return to <hi>Goa,</hi> they must shew a discharge from the Custom-House of <hi>Malaca,</hi> which obliges them to go that way.</p>
                        <p>The third Government is that of <hi>Ormus,</hi> by reason of the great Trade which is there, and the Custom which all Ships are to pay that are bound in and out of the <hi>Persian Golf.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Ormus</hi> exacted great Tolls from those that went to the Island of <hi>Bakren</hi> to fish for Pearls, for if they did not take a Licence from him, he would sink their Vessels. The <hi>Persians</hi> at present exact this Custom from the <hi>English,</hi> who have a small share in that Trade, as I have related in my <hi>Persian</hi> Voyages. But though they are severe enough to the Merchants, their Customs amount to nothing near so much as what the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> made of it. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are in the same condition at <hi>Malaca,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving handly sufficient to pay their Garrison which they keep there.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Government is that of <hi>Moscate,</hi> the revenue whereof was very great. For all Vessels that are bound from <hi>India,</hi> from the <hi>Persian Golf,</hi> from the Red Sea, and from the Coast of <hi>Melinda,</hi> must come under the Point of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106224:193"/>
                           <hi>Muscate,</hi> where they generally take in fresh Water. If there be any Ships that would not come to an Anchor there, the Governour sent for his Custom, which was four in the hundred; and if they refus'd, the Governour had his Galeasses ready to sink them.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Government was that of the Island of <hi>Ceyland,</hi> to which belong'd all those places which the <hi>Portugals</hi> had, as well upon the Coast of <hi>Malavar,</hi> the Golf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and other parts of <hi>India;</hi> the worst of which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was worth ten thousand Crowns <hi>per ann.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides these five great Governments, which were at the disposal of the Vice-Roy, he had abundance of other Offices in his Gift, as well in <hi>Goa,</hi> as in other parts of <hi>India.</hi> The very day that he makes hid Entry into <hi>Goa,</hi> the Captain of his Guards gets above four thousand Crowns. The three Offices of Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer Major, Visiter of the Forts, and chief Master of the Ordinance, yeilded every year twenty thousand <hi>Pardo</hi>'s; every <hi>Pardo</hi> being worth twenty-seven Sous of our Money. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> were then all very rich; the Nobility by reason of their Governments and Commands, the Merchants by their Trade, till the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> cut them short. When they had <hi>Ormus,</hi> they would not let any Merchant pass by Sea into <hi>India;</hi> so that they were forc'd to go by Land through <hi>Candahar.</hi> Then, when the <hi>Turky, Persian, Arabian, Muscovite, Polonian,</hi> and other Merchants arriv'd at <hi>Bander-Abassy,</hi> they join'd together, and deputed four of the most experienc'd persons among them, to view all the sorts of Commodities, and to understand their quality and price. After they have made their report, they agree upon their price, and fetch away their goods, which are distributed to every one proportionably according to the number of Merchants. It is also the custom of all <hi>Asia,</hi> that there is nothing sold, but a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker has a hand in the Bargain. They make good the Money to those that have sold, and receive it from them that buy; and there are some sorts of Commodities upon which there is due to them for Brokage, sometimes one in in the Hundred, sometime one and a half, and two.</p>
                        <p>At that time the <hi>Portugueses</hi> made great profit, without any loss. For the Vice-Roy took care to preserve them against the Pyrats. Who assoon as the Rains are over, and that it was seasonable to put to Sea, always sent a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient convoy to guard the Merchants twenty-five or thirty Leagues to Sea, the <hi>Malvares</hi> not daring to stir above fifteen or twenty. The Captains of the Galiots, and the Soldiers drive a small Trade also in their Voyages, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they pay no custom, they gain enough to maintain themselves handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the time they lye in Garrison, which is during the Rains. There was also care taken for the advancement of the Soldiery; for every Soldier that came from <hi>Portugal,</hi> after nine years service, had some Command either by Sea or Land bestow'd upon him; and if he would not accept of it, they gave him leave to Trade as a Merchant. So that if there happen'd to be any person of understanding among them, he could not fail to raise his fortune, having all the credit he could desire. For there were people enough that being glad to let out their Money, would venture with him at <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. If the Vessel be lost, they that lend their Money, lose either their Money or their goods; but if the Ship come safe home, of one they make three or four.</p>
                        <p>The Natives of the Country, call'd <hi>Canarins,</hi> are not permitted to bear any Offices among the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> but only in reference to the Law, that is to say, either as Advocates, or Sollicitors, or Scriveners; for they keep them very much under. If one of these <hi>Canarins</hi> or Blacks, happen to strike a White or <hi>European,</hi> there is no pardon for him, but he must have his hand cut off. As well the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as <hi>Portugueses,</hi> make use of them as Receivers, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their business. And in the <hi>Manilia's,</hi> or <hi>Philippin</hi> Islands, there are some of these Blacks so rich, that many of them have offer'd twenty thousand Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sats to the Vice-Roy, for liberty to wear Hose and Shoo's, which they are not permitted to wear. Some of these Blacks have thirty Slaves attending upon them, very richly habited; but only they go barefoot. And had the <hi>Portugals</hi> permitted them to set out Ships of their own, and to have chosen Captains and other Officers at their own pleasure, the <hi>Portugueses</hi> would not have made such
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106224:193"/>
large, at least not so easie Conquests in the <hi>Indies.</hi> These Blacks are very couragious and good Soldiers, and several of the Religious Orders have assur'd me, that they will learn more in six months in one of their Colledges, than the <hi>Portugal</hi> Children in a year, whatever Science you put them to; which is the reason that the <hi>Portugals</hi> keep them so low. The natural Inhabitants of the Country about <hi>Goa,</hi> are Idolaters, and worship several sorts of Idols, which they say are the Resemblance of several that have done good works, to whom they ought to give praise by adoring their Portraitures. There are many of these Idolaters who worship Apes. And therefore in the Island of <hi>Salsete,</hi> there was a Pagod, where the Idolaters kept in a Chest, like a Tomb, the Bones and Nails of an Ape, which they said had been mighty serviceable to their Ancestors, by bringing news and intelligence to them, when any hostile Princes prosecuted them; for which purpose they would sometimes swim through the very Sea it self. The <hi>Indians</hi> come from several parts in procession, and make Offerings to this Pagod. But the Clergy of <hi>Goa,</hi> especially the Inquisitors, caus'd the Tomb one day to be taken away, and brought it to <hi>Goa,</hi> where it remain'd a good while, by reason of the difference which it made between the Ecclesiasticks and the people. For the Idolaters offering a great sum of Money to have their Reliques again, the people were willing to have restor'd them; saying, that the Money would do well upon any occasion of War, or else to relieve the poor. But the Clergy were of a contrary opinion, and maintain'd that such a piece of Idolatry was not to be endur'd upon any account whatsoever. At length the Arch-Bishop and the Inquisitors, by their own Authority, took away the Tomb, and sending it in a Vessel twenty Leagues out to Sea, caus'd it to be thrown to the bottom of the Ocean. They thought to have burn'd it, but the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would have rak'd up the Ashes again, which would have been but a new food to their Superstition.</p>
                        <p>There are in <hi>Goa</hi> abundance of Clergy-men; for besides the Arch-Bishop and his Clergy, there are <hi>Dominicans, Austin-Fryars, Franciscans,</hi> Barefoot <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Jesuits,</hi> and <hi>Capuchins,</hi> with two Religious Houses, whereof the <hi>Austin-Fryars</hi> are Directors or Governours. The Religious <hi>Carmelites,</hi> that came last, are the best seated; for though they are somewhat at a distance from the heart of the City, yet they have the advantage of a fine Air, and the most healthy scituation in all <hi>Goa.</hi> It stands upon a rising ground, free to the refreshment of the Wind; and it is very well built, with two Galleries one over the other. The <hi>Austin-Fryars,</hi> who were the first that came to <hi>Goa,</hi> were indifferently well seated, at the foot of a little rising ground, their Church also standing upon a rising ground, with a fair <hi>Piazza</hi> before it; but when they had built their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, the <hi>Jesuits</hi> desir'd them to sell that rising ground, which was then a void place, under pretence of making a Garden in it for the recreation of their Scholars. But after they had purchas'd it, they built a most stately College upon the same ground, which quite stops and choaks up the <hi>Austin-Fryars</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, so that they have no Air at all. There happen'd several Contests about this business, but at length the <hi>Jesuits</hi> got the better. The <hi>Jesuites</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> are known by the name of <hi>Paulists;</hi> by reason that their great Church is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Nor do they wear Hats or Corner-Caps, as in <hi>Europe,</hi> but only a certain Bonnet, resembling the Skull of a Hat without the Brims; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the Bonnets which the Grand <hi>Segnors</hi> Slaves wear; of which I have given you a description in my relation of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> They have five Houses in <hi>Goa,</hi> the College of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Seminary,</hi> the Professors House, the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viciate,</hi> and the Good Jesus. The paintings in this House are admirable pieces of Workmanship. In the year 1663 the College was burnt by an accident which happen'd in the night, so that it cost them near sixty thousand Crowns to rebuild it.</p>
                        <p>The Hospital of <hi>Goa</hi> was formerly the most famous in all <hi>India.</hi> For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Revenues thereof were very great, the sick persons were very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look'd after. But since the change of the Governours, there is but very bad accommodation; and several of the <hi>Europeans</hi> that have been put in, have never come forth again, but in their Coffins. However, they have lately found out a way to save some by frequent Bloodletting. They let Blood sometimes,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106224:194"/>
as occasion requires, thirty or forty times, even as often as any ill-blood comes forth; as they did by me one time that I was at <hi>Surat.</hi> Butter and flesh is very dangerous to them that are sick, and many times costs them their lives. Formerly they made several sorts of well-tasted diet for those that recoverd: Now they serve the Patient only with young Beef-broth, and a dish of Rice. Usually the poorer sort that recover their health, complain of drowth, and call for water. But they that look after them, being only Blacks, or Mongrels, a sort of covetous and pittiless people, will not give them a drop, unless they put Money in their hands; and to colour their wickedness, they give it them by stealth, pretending what they do to be against the Physitian's order. As for Sweet-meats and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, there is no want of them; but they are not a diet which contributes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much to the restoring of decaid strength, especially in those hot Countreys, where the body requires rather cooling and refreshing nourishment.</p>
                        <p>I have forgot one thing in reference to their more frequent blood-lettings than among us <hi>Europeans.</hi> Which is, that to bring their colour again, and to restore them to perfect health, they order the Patient to drink for twelve days together three glasses of Cow's Urine; one in the morning, another at noon, and another at night. But in regard it is a very nauseous sort of drink, the Patient swallows as little as he can, how desirous soever he may be of his health. They learnt this remedy from the Idolaters of the Countrey; and whether the Patient will take it or no, they never let him stir out of the Hospital, till the twelve days are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd wherein he ought to drink it.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> What the Author did, during his stay at <hi>Goa,</hi> the last time he went thither in the year 1648.</head>
                        <p>TWO days before I departed from <hi>Mingrela</hi> for <hi>Goa,</hi> I wrote to <hi>Monsieur</hi> St. <hi>Amant,</hi> who was Engineer, to send me a Man of War, for fear of the <hi>Malvares</hi> which are upon the Coast, which he immediately did. I parted from <hi>Mingrela</hi> the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1648, and arriv'd at <hi>Goa</hi> the 25<hi>th.</hi> And in regard it was late, I staid till the next morning before I went to visit the <hi>Vice-Roy, Don Philip de Mascaregnas,</hi> who had formerly been Governor of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> He made me very welcome, and during the two months that I tarri'd at <hi>Goa,</hi> he sent to me a Gentleman five or six times, who brought me still to the Powder-House, which was without the City, where he often us'd to be. For he took great delight in levelling Guns, wherein he ask'd my advice, esteeming very much a Pistol very curiously and richly inlaid, which I presented him at my arrival. This Pistol the <hi>French-</hi>Consul at <hi>Aleppo</hi> gave me, the fellow of it being unhappily lost: for else the Bair had been presented by the <hi>French-</hi>Nation to the <hi>Basha,</hi> who might then have boasted himself the Master of the fairest and best-made pair of Pistols in all <hi>Asia.</hi> The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> admits no person whatever, no not his Children to sit at his Table. But there is a little partition in the Dining-room, where there is a Cloath laid for the Principal Officers, as is usual in the Courts of the <hi>German-</hi>Princes. The next day I went to wait upon the Arch-Bishop, and the next day after I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to have visited the Inquisition; but I understood by one of his Gentlemen that he was busy, writing into <hi>Portugal;</hi> there being two Ships ready to weigh Anchon, that only staid for his dispatches. After the Ships were set sail, he sent the same Gentleman to tell me that he expected me at the Inquisition-House, about two or three in the afternoon. I fail'd not to go thither at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd When I came, a Page brought me into a large Hall, where after I had walk'd a quarter of an hour, an Officer came and carri'd me into the Chamber where the Inquisitor was. After I had past through two Galleries, and some Chambers. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a little Chamber where the Inquisitor sat at the end of a great Table like a Billiard-Table, which, as well: as the Chairs and Stools in the Chamber, was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106224:194"/>
cover'd with green Cloath, such as is carri'd out of <hi>England.</hi> He told me I was welcome, and after a Complement or two, he ask'd me what Religion I was of? I answer'd him, of the Protestant Religion. He ask'd me then, if my Father and Mother were of the same Religion; and after I had satisfi'd him that they were so; He told me again I was welcome, calling out at the same time for some other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to enter. Thereupon, the Hangings being held up, there came in ten or twelve persons out of another room hard-by. The first of the Train were two <hi>Austin-</hi>Friars, follow'd by two Dominicans, two barefoot-Carmelites, and some other of the Clergy; whom the Inquisitor told who I was, and assur'd them I had brought no prohibited Books; for indeed, knowing their orders, I had left my Bible at <hi>Mingrela.</hi> We discours'd about two hours of several things, but particularly of my Travels; the whole Company testifying their desire to hear me make some repetitions. Three days after the Inquisitor sent for me to dine with him at a fair House, about half a league from the City, which belongs to the Barefoot-Carmelites. It is one of the loveliest Structures in all the <hi>Indies;</hi> and I will tell you in short how the Carmelites came by it. There was a Gentleman in <hi>Goa,</hi> whose Father and Grandfather had got great Estates by Merchandizing; and he it was that built this House, which might well have past for a most noble Palace. He had no mind to Marry, but being altogether addicted to his devotions, he very much frequented the <hi>Austin-</hi>Friars, to whom he shew'd himself so affectionate, that he made his Will, wherein he gave them all his Estate, provided they would bury him on the right-side of the High-Altar, where he intended a sumptuous Monument. Now according to the common report, this Gentleman was a Leaper, which some jealous persons endeavour'd to make the World believe, seeing he had given away all his Estate to the <hi>Austin-</hi>Friars. Thereupon they told him that the ground on the right-hand of the High-Altar was a place only fit for a <hi>Vice-Roy;</hi> and that a leaprous person was not to be laid there: which was the opinion of the generality of the people, and of a good part of the <hi>Austin-</hi>Friars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Thereupon some of the Fathers of the Covent coming to speak with the Gentleman, on purpose to perswade him to choose some other place in the Church, he was so offended at the proposal, that he never went more to the <hi>Austin-</hi>Friars, but always went to perform his devotions among the Carmelites, who receiv'd him with open arms, and accepted the conditions which the other had refus'd. Nor did he live long after he had interested himself with that Order; so that the Carmelites having magnificently buri'd him, enjoy'd all his Estate, with this same House, where we were splendidly entertain'd with Musick all the time of Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>I staid at <hi>Goa</hi> from the twenty-first of <hi>January</hi> till the eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting thence that very day in the evening, after I had taken leave of the <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi> I begg'd leave also of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> for a <hi>French-</hi>Gentleman, whose name was <hi>Belloy,</hi> to go along with me: which was granted me; but through the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that Gentleman, who did not tell me the reason of his coming to <hi>Goa,</hi> he had like to have been taken from me again, and it was an even-lay, that we had not been both carri'd to the Inquisition. This Gentleman had left the place of his Nativity to travel over <hi>Holland,</hi> where having run himself in debt, and finding no person that would lend him any Money, he resolv'd to go for <hi>India.</hi> Thereupon he listed himself as a private Souldier upon the accompt of the <hi>Holland-</hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and came to <hi>Batavia</hi> at the same time that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made War against the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> in <hi>Ceylan.</hi> Being arriv'd, they sent him away among the recruits which were sent into that Island; and the <hi>Holland-</hi>General seeing such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of stout men commanded by a <hi>French-</hi>Captain, whose name was St. <hi>Amant,</hi> a person of great courage and experience; he resolv'd to besiege <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gombe,</hi> a considerable Fort in the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> They made two assaults, wherein the <hi>French-</hi>men behav'd themselves valiantly, especially St. <hi>Amant,</hi> and <hi>John de Rose,</hi> who were both wounded. The General of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> seeing them to be two such men of courage, made a promise that if <hi>Negombe</hi> were taken, one of them two should be Governor. The place was taken, and the General kept his word with St. <hi>Amant:</hi> but the News being carri'd to <hi>Batavia,</hi> a young Gentleman of kin to the General, and but newly arriv'd out of <hi>Holland,</hi> obtain'd to be Governor of <hi>Negombe,</hi> to the prejudice of St. <hi>Amant,</hi> and came with an
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106224:195"/>
order from the Council at <hi>Batavia</hi> to displace him. St. <hi>Amant</hi> incens'd at such ill-usage, inveigles to his Party a matter of fifteen or twenty, most part <hi>French-</hi>Souldiers, among whom were <hi>Monsieur Belloy, Marests,</hi> and <hi>John de Rose,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts to the <hi>Portuguezes.</hi> The <hi>Portugals</hi> encourag'd by the reinforcement of such a stout, though small number of men, storm'd <hi>Negombe</hi> again, and took it at the second assault. At that time was <hi>Don Philip de Mascaregnas</hi> Governor of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> and all the places belonging to it, under the jurisdiction of the <hi>Portugals.</hi> He liv'd also at the City of <hi>Colombo;</hi> and then it was, that having receiv'd Letters from <hi>Goa</hi> that the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> was dead, and that the Council and all the Nobility desir'd him to come and succeed in his place, he resolv'd to see St. <hi>Amant</hi> and his Companions before his departure, to the end he might bestow upon them some proper reward. So soon as he saw them, he was resolv'd to take them along with him to <hi>Goa.</hi> Whether it were that he thought he might have better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to advance them there; or that he thought it convenient to have stout men about him, by reason of the <hi>Malavares</hi> who lay in wait for him with forty Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, whereas he had but twenty-two. But they were no sooner come to make <hi>Cape-Comorin,</hi> when the winds rose, and such a tempest follow'd, that the Vessels were disperced, and many of them unfortunately cast away. They that were in <hi>Don Philips's</hi> Vessel did all they could to get to the shoar, but seeing they could not, and that the Ship was ready to split, St. <hi>Amant</hi> and his six other Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons threw themselves into the Sea with cords and pieces of planks, and so bestirr'd themselves, that they made a shift not only to save themselves, but <hi>Don Philip</hi> also. Hereupon <hi>Don Philip</hi> coming to <hi>Goa,</hi> after he had made his entrance, gave to St. <hi>Amant</hi> the Command of Grand Master of the Artillery, and Superintendent-General over all the Forts which the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> had in <hi>India.</hi> He marri'd him also to a young Virgin, with whom he had twenty-thousand Crowns, whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was an <hi>English-man,</hi> who had quitted the Company, and marri'd a Natural Daughter of one of the <hi>Vice-Roy's</hi> of <hi>Goa.</hi> As for <hi>John de Rose,</hi> he desir'd leave of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> to return to <hi>Colombo,</hi> where, by his favour, he marri'd a young Widow, half Native, half <hi>Portugueze,</hi> by whom he had a fair fortune. <hi>Marests</hi> the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> made Captain of his Guards, the most considerable Command in all his Court, being oblig'd to <hi>Marests</hi> for his life, who was the person that bore him upon his shoulders to save him from drowning. <hi>Du Belloy</hi> desir'd leave that he might go to <hi>Macao,</hi> which was granted him. For he understood that the greatest part of the <hi>Portugal-</hi>Gentry retir'd to that place, after they had got Estates by Merchandizing; that they were very courteous to strangers, and withal extremely addicted to play, which was <hi>Du Belloy</hi>'s chief delight. He liv'd two years at <hi>Macao,</hi> very much to his content; for when he wanted Money, the Gentry lent it him freely. One day he had won above six-thousand Crowns; but going to play again, he was so unfortunate as to lose it all, besides a good sum of Money which his friends had lent him. Being thus at a loss, and finding that no-body would lend him any more Money, he began to swear against a Picture that hung in the room, which was the Portraiture of some Papistical Saint; saying in his passion, that it was an usual thing with them that plaid, that if they saw a Saints Picture hang in their sight, it made them lose; and that if that Picture had not been there, he had certainly won. Immediately the Inquisitor was inform'd of this, (for in every City in <hi>India</hi> under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> there is one. However his power is limited; having no other authority than to seize the person of him that says or acts any thing against their Religion, to hear the Witnesses, and to send the Offender with the examinations to <hi>Goa</hi> in the first Ship which is bound thither: where the Inquisitor-General has an absolute Power either to absolve him, or to put him to death. Thereupon <hi>Du Belloy</hi> was put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board a small Vessel of ten or twelve Guns loaded with Irons; with a strict charge to the Captain to keep him sase, and some threats that he should be answerable for him if he escap'd. But so soon as the Ship was out at Sea, the Captain, who was of a noble disposition, and knew <hi>Du Belloy</hi> to be of a good Family, took off his Irons, and made him sit at his own Table; giving him also Linnen, and other convenient Apparel necessary for the Voyage, which was to continue forty days. They put into <hi>Goa</hi> the nineteenth of <hi>February</hi> 1649; and the Ship was no sooner come into Harbour, but St. <hi>Amant</hi> came a-board by the Governor's order, as well
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106224:195"/>
to receive his Letters, as to hear what news in <hi>China.</hi> But his surprize was very great, to see <hi>Belloy</hi> in that condition, and that the Captain would not let him go, before he had surrender'd him up into the hands of the Inquisitor. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, in regard that St. <hi>Amant</hi> was a person of great credit, he obtain'd of the Captain, that <hi>Belloy</hi> should go along with him into the City. As for <hi>Belloy</hi> he immediately and for the nonce shifted himself into his old Cloaths, which were all to tatters and full of Vermin; and St. <hi>Amant,</hi> who knew there was no dallying with the Inquisition, took that season to present him to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor; who seeing a Gentleman in such a sad condition, had some compassion upon him, and allow'd him the whole City for his Prison; on condition he should surrender his body upon demand, when he understood what was inform'd against him. In the interim St. <hi>Amant</hi> brings <hi>Du Belloy</hi> to my Lodging just as I was going to visit the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Mira,</hi> whom I formerly knew at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> when he was Prior of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> at <hi>Galata.</hi> I desir'd them to stay a while and to dine with me, which they did; after which I proffer'd my House and Table to <hi>Du Belloy,</hi> who liv'd with me; and for whom I also bought two new Suits of Apparel, and Linnen convenient. However, all the while that I stay'd at <hi>Goa,</hi> which was ten or twelve days, I could not perswade the Sieur <hi>Du Belloy</hi> to put on those new Cloaths, not knowing the reason, though he promis'd me every day. But being upon my departure, I told him I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take leave of the Vice-Roy; whereupon he desir'd me to procure leave for him also; which I did. We departed toward evening in the same Vessel wherein I came, and about midnight the Sieur <hi>Belloy</hi> began to shift himself, and when he had done he threw his old raggs into the Sea, swearing against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition like a mad man; I understanding nothing all this while of the business. When I heard him swear in that manner, I told him we were not yet out of the <hi>Portugals</hi> hands; neither were he and I with five or six Servants, able to defend our selves against forty Sea-men that belong'd to the Ship. I ask'd him then, why he swore so heartily against the Inquisition; he reply'd, that he would tell me all the circumstances of the story; which he did when we came to <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grela,</hi> which was about eight a Clock in the morning. When we landed we met certain <hi>Hollanders</hi> with the Commander, who were eating Oysrers and drinking Sack upon the Shoar. Immediately they ask'd me who that person was with me. I told them it was a Gentleman who attending the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor into <hi>Portugal,</hi> had taken Shipping there for <hi>India,</hi> together with four or five more whom he had left at <hi>Goa;</hi> but that neither the scituation of the place, nor the humour of the <hi>Portugals</hi> pleasing him, he had desir'd my assistance in his return for <hi>Europe.</hi> Three or four days after, I bought him an Oxe to carry him to <hi>Surat;</hi> and I gave him a Servant to assist him, together with a Letter to Father <hi>Zenon,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> wherein I desir'd him to speak to my Broker to pay him ten Crowns a month for his subsistence, and to desire of the <hi>English</hi> President to embark him for <hi>Europe</hi> with the first opportunity. But it fell out contrary to my intentions; for Father <hi>Zenon</hi> carri'd him back again along with him to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he had some business to do for Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; of whom I shall speak in the next Chapter. Father <hi>Zenon</hi> without doubt believ'd, that <hi>Du Belloy</hi> making his appearance to the Inquisition, and desiring his pardon, might have easily obtain'd it. 'Tis very true he did obtain it, but it was after he had been two years in the Inquisition, from which he was not discharg'd but with a Sulphur'd Shirt with a St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Cross upon his Stomack. There was with him another Gentleman, call'd <hi>Lewis de Bar upon the Seine,</hi> who was us'd in the same manner; and they always put them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company those who were put to death. The Sieur <hi>Du Belloy</hi> did very ill to return to <hi>Goa,</hi> and worse to appear afterwards again at <hi>Mingela,</hi> where the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who understanding he had formerly revolted out of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by the intelligence they receiv'd from their Commander at <hi>Surat,</hi> seiz'd his person, and sent him away in a Ship that was going for <hi>Batavia.</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that they sent him to the General of the Company, to do with him as he should think fitting. But I am in part assur'd, that as soon as the Vessel was out at Sea, they put the poor Gentleman into a Sack, and threw him into the Sea. This was the end of the Sieur <hi>Du Belloy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106224:196"/>
As for <hi>Sieur des Marests,</hi> he was a Gentleman, born in the <hi>Dauphinate,</hi> near to <hi>Loriol,</hi> who having kill'd his Adversary in a Duel, fled into <hi>Poland,</hi> where he so far signaliz'd himself, that he won the esteem and affection of the General of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Army. At that time the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> kept in the Prison of the Seven Towers at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> two Noble <hi>Polonians;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> General observing the courage and address of this <hi>Des Marests,</hi> who was a daring Fellow, and a good Engineer besides, made a proposal to him, to go to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to endeavour, if he could by any means in the world, to set those Princes at liberty. <hi>Des Marests</hi> willingly accepted the employment, and without doubt he had succeeded in his design, had he not been discovered by some <hi>Turks,</hi> who accus'd him for having been too circumspect in viewing the seven Towers, seeing him with a Chalk Pencil in his hand, ready to take the draught thereof, which seem'd to tend to no good design. This had been enough to have ruin'd the Gentleman, had not Monsieur <hi>de Cesy</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour stifl'd the further examination of the business by some present; which in <hi>Turky</hi> is the most sovereign remedy upon all accidents of danger; telling the <hi>Visier,</hi> that he was only a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman that travel'd for his pleasure, and one that was going for <hi>Persia</hi> with the first opportunity. However it was not <hi>Marests</hi> design at that time to go very far, for he intended to have return'd into <hi>Poland,</hi> so soon as he had us'd his utmost endeavours to set the Princes at liberty; but for his own safety it behov'd him to give it out that he was gone to <hi>Persia;</hi> and at length he was constrain'd to go thither indeed. As for the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> he had resolv'd never to set the two Noblemen at liberty. But at length they were so fortunate as to gain the love of a young <hi>Turk,</hi> who was the Son of the Captain of the Seven Towers; with whom the Father usually trusted the Keys to open and shut the Gates of the Prison. The night appointed for their flight, he made as if he had shut some doors, the Padlocks whereof he left all open. But he durst not do so by the two first Gates, near one of which the Captain with a strong Guard lay, for fear of being discover'd. The young man, who had entirely devoted himself to serve the Princes, having foreseen this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty before, had bethought himself of Rope-Ladders to get over the two Walls; to which purpose it was necessary to have a correspondence within and without. Finding therefore that because the utmost of severity was not us'd toward those Princes, they had the liberty to receive several Dishes of Meat from the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors Kitchin, the Clerk of the Kitchin was made of the plot, who thereupon sent them in several Cords in Pasties, whereof they made Ladders. The business succeeded so well, that the escape was made, and the young <hi>Turk</hi> fled with the <hi>Polonian</hi> Lords into <hi>Poland,</hi> where he turn'd Christian, and receiv'd ample rewards both in Employments and Money. The same gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude proportionably was observ'd toward those who had contributed toward the liberty of the Princes, who amply acknowledg'd the services which they had receiv'd from every one of them.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Sieur <hi>Des Marests</hi> arrives at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and addressing himself to the <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryars, they brought him to my Lodging, where he had the freedom of my Table, and a Chamber. He staid some time at <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> during which he got acquainted with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who had a great esteem for him, finding him to be a person of merit. But it happen'd one day, that his curiosity putting him upon a bold attempt, had like to have been the ruine of him and all the <hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Near the Inn where we lodg'd there was a large Bath, where the men and women by turns take their times to come and bath themselves; and where the Queen of <hi>Visapour,</hi> during her stay at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> as she return'd home to <hi>Mecca,</hi> delighted to go and prattle with the <hi>French</hi> mens wives. The Sieur <hi>Des Marests</hi> having a passionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see what the women did, satisfi'd his curiosity, by means of a cranny in the Arch of the Vault, which he had observ'd when he went thither; for having found out a way without side to get up to that Arch, through a blind hole that was next to the Inn where we lay, the Arch being flat, as I have describ'd them in my relations of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he laid himself upon his belly, and saw through the cranny what he so much long'd to behold. He was at this sport some ten or twelve times; and not being able to contain himself, he told me
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106224:196"/>
one day what he had done. I bid him have a care of going there any more, for fear of ruining himself and all the <hi>French</hi> men in the City. But he contrary to my advice went thither two or three times after that, till at length he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by one of the women of the Bath that took care of the Linnen, and dry them without, upon Perches as high as the top of the Arch, to which they get up by a little Ladder. The woman seeing a man lying all long upon his belly, seiz'd upon his Hat, and began to cry out. But <hi>Marests,</hi> to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of the mire, and to hinder the woman from making more noise, put two <hi>Tomans</hi> into her hand. When he return'd to the Inn, I perceiv'd him to look as if he had been scar'd, and conjecturing that some ill accident had befall'n him, I press'd him to confess what was the matter. He was loath at first, but at length he confess'd how he had been discover'd by a woman, and how he had stop'd her mouth with money. Thereupon I told him, that there was a necessity for him to fly, for that the danger was far greater than he imagin'd. The <hi>Dutch</hi> President also, to whom I thought it convenient to tell what had pass'd, was of the same opinion; upon which we gave him a Mule, and as much money as was necessary for him, ordering him to go to <hi>Bander,</hi> and thence by Sea to <hi>Surat.</hi> I gave him a Letter of Recommendation to the <hi>English</hi> President, who was my Friend; whom I also desir'd to let him have two hundred Crowns, if he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for them. I wrote very much in his commendation; and mention'd the proffer which the <hi>Dutch</hi> President at <hi>Ispahan</hi> had made him, to send him with Letters to the General, who would not fail to employ him according to his merit. For indeed at that time that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had War with the <hi>Portugueses</hi> in <hi>Ceylan,</hi> any person of wit and courage, like the Sieur <hi>Des Marests,</hi> was very acceptable to them. Which made them very earnest with him, to take an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polyment among them; and to that end, they caress'd him, and presented him very nobly during his stay at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> But he told them, that not being of their Religion, he was unwilling to serve them against the <hi>Portugueses;</hi> which was the only reason that hinder'd him from accepting the offers which I had made him. These particulars I wrote in his behalf to the <hi>English</hi> President at <hi>Surat;</hi> so that the Sieur <hi>Des Marests</hi> being desirous to go to <hi>Goa</hi> to serve the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> the President wrote in his behalf to the Vice-Roy, by whom he was very much belov'd, relating to him, besides, what the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had proffer'd him, that his recommendation might be the more acceptable. Thereupon the Vice-Roy made him very welcome; and upon the Sieur <hi>Marests</hi> desire to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in <hi>Ceylan</hi> in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army, he sent him away with the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, with Letters of Recommendation to Don <hi>Philip de Mascaregnas,</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> and all those places that belong'd to it under the jurisdiction of the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> It happen'd three days after, that they lost <hi>Nagombe,</hi> and when they retook it, the Sieur <hi>Marests</hi> was one of those that receiv'd most wounds, and won most honour in the Assaults. He it was that afterwards was most instrumental in saving Don <hi>Philip</hi> from being drown'd; so that when Don <hi>Philip</hi> came to be Vice-Roy of <hi>Goa,</hi> he could not think he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd a less reward than the Command of his Guards; in which employment he dy'd within three or four months. He was very much lamented by the Vice-Roy, by whom he was entirely belov'd. But he left his Estate to a Priest, with whom had contracted a particular friendship; upon condition that he should only pay me two hundred and fifty Crowns that I had lent him; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I had much ado to get out of the Priest's Clutches.</p>
                        <p>While I stay'd at <hi>Goa,</hi> I was told a pretty story concerning a Caravel, or <hi>Portugal</hi> Vessel, which arriv'd there but a little before, and came from <hi>Lisbon.</hi> When she was about to make the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> there happen'd such a violent Tempest, as lasted five or six hours, and put the Marriners to such a <hi>nonplus,</hi> that they knew not where they were, At length they fell into a Bay, where they saw several Inhabitants; and as soon as they came to an Anchor, they beheld the shore cover'd with men, women, and children, that testifi'd a strange amazement to see white people, and such kind of building as the Caravel. The mischief was, that they could not understand one another, but by signs. But after the <hi>Portugals</hi> had giv'n those <hi>Casres</hi> Tobacco, Bisket, and Water, the next day the people brought them a great quantity of young Ostriches, and other
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106224:197"/>
Fowl that seem'd to resemble large Geese, but so fat, that they had very little lean. The Feathers of those Birds were very lovely, and those upon the belly proper for Beds. One of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Mariners sold me a large Cushion stufft with those Feathers, and related to me what had happen'd to them in that Bay, where they stay'd seven and twenty days. They gave those <hi>Cafres</hi> one thing or other every foot, as Knives, Axes, false Coral, and false Pearls, out of hopes to have discover'd some Trade, and particularly whether they had any Gold; for they observ'd that some of them wore pieces of Gold in their Ears; some beaten thin upon one side, and others like the Nails of a Lock. They brought two of the people to <hi>Goa;</hi> and I saw one of them that wore several of those pieces of Gold in several parts of each Ear. The Mariner told me, that there were some of their women that wore of those pieces of Gold under their Chins, and in their Nostrils. Eight or nine days after the <hi>Portugals</hi> arriv'd in that Bay, those <hi>Cafres</hi> brought them little pieces of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergreese, some Gold, but very little; some Elephants teeth, but very small; some Ostriches, and other Birds, some Venison; but for Fish, there was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The <hi>Portugals</hi> endeavour'd all they could by signs to know where they found the Ambergreese, for it was very good. The Vice-Roy shew'd me a a piece that weigh'd not above half an Ounce, but he assur'd me withall, that he had never seen so good. They also labour'd to discover where they had the Gold. After the Elephants teeth they made no great enquiry, seeing a great number of Elephants that came to drink at a River that threw it self into the Bay. At length after they had stay'd three weeks, the <hi>Portugals</hi> finding it impossible for them to discover any thing more, because they understood not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, resolv'd to set sail with the first wind. And because they had always some of these <hi>Cafres</hi> aboard, in regard they were very liberal of their Tobacco, Bisket, and strong Water, they thought good to bring two of them along in the Vessel; in hopes that they might learn the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Language, or that there might some Child be found out that might understand what they said. The Mariners told me, that when they set sail, after the <hi>Cafres</hi> saw that they had carri'd two of their people away, who perhaps were no inconsiderable persons, they tore their Hair, struck their Breasts as if they had been frantick, and set up a most horrible yelling and howling. When they were brought to <hi>Goa,</hi> they could never be brought to learn any thing of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Language. So that they could gettout of them nothing of that further discovery at which they aim'd, of a Country from whence they only brought away two pound of Gold, three pound of Ambergreese, and thirty-five or forty Elephants teeth. One of the <hi>Cafres</hi> liv'd but six months, the other fifteen; but both languish'd and pin'd to death for grief to be so trapann'd.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Goa</hi> I pass'd to <hi>Mingrela,</hi> where there fell out an accident not to be forgotten. An Idolater dying, and the Fire being ready prepar'd for the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body, his Wife who had no Children, by the permission of the Governour, came to the Fire, and stood among the Priests and her Kindred, to be burnt with the Body of her deceas'd Husband. As they were taking three turns, according to custom, about the place where the Fire was kindl'd, there fell of a sudden so violent a Shower, that the Priests willing to get out of the rain, thrust the Woman all along into the Fire. But the Shower was so vehement, and endur'd so long a while, that the Fire was quench'd, and the Woman was not burn'd. About midnight she rose, and went and knock'd at the door of one of her Kinsmens Houses, where Father <hi>Zenon</hi> and many <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> saw her, looking so ghastly and grimly, that it was enough to have scar'd them; however the pain that she endur'd did not so far terrifie her, but that three days after accompany'd by her Kindred, she went and was burn'd according to her first intention.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The Story of Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and how he was put into the Inquisition at <hi>Goa</hi> by a surprisal.</head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Chek,</hi> who had marri'd the Eldest of the Princesses of <hi>Golconda,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to perswade Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> to stay at <hi>Bagnabar,</hi> where he promis'd to build him an House and a Church, gave him an Ox and two Men to carry him to <hi>Maslipatan,</hi> where he staid to embark for <hi>Pegu,</hi> according to the order of his Superiors. But finding no Vessel ready to set sail, the <hi>English</hi> drew him to <hi>Madres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patan,</hi> where they have a Fort call'd St. <hi>George,</hi> and a general Factory for every thing that concerns the Countreys of <hi>Golconda, Pegu</hi> and <hi>Bengala.</hi> They over-perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that he might reap a fairer Harvest in this place, than in any other part of the <hi>Indies;</hi> to which end they presently built him a very neat House, and a Church. But in the conclusion, the <hi>English</hi> sought not so much the interest of Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as their own. For <hi>Madrespatan</hi> is but half a league from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a Sea-Town upon the Coast of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> indifferently well-built, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonging to the <hi>Portugals.</hi> In that place there was a very great Trade, especially for Calicuts, and a very great number of Merchants and Workmen liv'd there, the greatest part whereof desir'd to inhabit at <hi>Madrespatan</hi> with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> but that there was no place for them to exercise their Religion in that place. But when the <hi>English</hi> had built a Church, and perswaded Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> to stay, many of the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> quitted St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> by reason of the frequent Preaching of Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and his great care as well of the Natives, as of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</hi> Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> was born at <hi>Auxerre,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Monsieur Chateau de Boys,</hi> Counsellor of the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> who was very happy in learning Languages, so that in a little time he spoke <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Portuguez</hi> perfectly well. But now the Clergy of St. <hi>Thomas-</hi>Church seeing Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> in so high a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and that he drew the greatest part of their Congregation to <hi>Madrespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> were so enrag'd against him, that they resolv'd to ruine him. And thus they laid their plot. The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Portuguezes</hi> being neer-neighbours, could not choose but have several quarrels one among another, and still Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> was appli'd to for the composing their differences. Now one day it happen'd, that the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> quarrell'd on purpose with some <hi>English</hi> Mariners that were in St. <hi>Thomas-</hi>Road, and the <hi>English</hi> came by the worst. The <hi>English</hi> President re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to have satisfaction for the injury, a War broke out between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: which had ruin'd all the Trade of that Countrey, had not the Merchants on both sides been very diligent to bring things to an accommodation: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the wicked contrivance of particular persons against Father <hi>Ephraim.</hi> But all the interposition of the Merchants avail'd nothing: the Friar must be concern'd in the affair, he must be the Mediator to act between party and party, which he readily accepted. But he was no sooner enter'd into St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> but he was seiz'd by ten or twelve Officers of the Inquisition, who shipp'd him away in a Frigat that was bound at the same time for <hi>Goa.</hi> They fetter'd and manacl'd him, and kept him two and twenty days at Sea, before they would let him once put his foot a-shoar: though the best part of the Mariners lay a-shoar every night. When they came to <hi>Goa,</hi> they staid till night before they would land Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to carry him to the <hi>Inquisition-</hi>House. For they were afraid, left if they should land him in the day, the people should know of it, and rise in the rescue of a person, who was in an high veneration over all <hi>India.</hi> The news was presently spread abroad in all parts, that Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> was in the <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which very much amaz'd all the <hi>French-</hi>men. But he that was most sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and most troubl'd at it was Friar <hi>Zenon,</hi> the Capuchin, who had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Father <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Companion; who after he had consulted his friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to go to <hi>Goa,</hi> though he were put into the <hi>Inquisition</hi> himself. For when a man is once shut up there, if any one have the boldness to speak to the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or to any of his Councel in his behalf, he is presently put into the <hi>Inquisition</hi>
                           <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106224:198"/>
also, and accounted a greater Offender than the other. Neither the Arch Bishop nor the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> themselves dare interpose; though they are the only two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons over whom the <hi>Inquisition</hi> has no power. For if they do any thing to offend them, they presently write to the Inquisitor and his Council in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and as the King and the Inquisitor-General commands, they either proceed against, or send those two great persons into <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding all these considerations, Father <hi>Zenon,</hi> taking along with him the <hi>Sieur de la Boulay,,</hi> a decaid Gentleman, goes to <hi>Goa;</hi> where, when he arriv'd, he was visited by some friends, who advise him to have a care not to open his mouth in the behalf of Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> unless he intended to bear him company in the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> Father <hi>Zenon</hi> seeing he could do nothing at <hi>Goa,</hi> advis'd the <hi>Sieur de Boulay</hi> to return to <hi>Surat:</hi> and goes himself directly to <hi>Madrespatan,</hi> more particularly to inform himself concerning the reason of Father <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s being sent away. But when he understood how he had been betraid at St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> he resolv'd to have satisfaction, and without acquainting the <hi>English-</hi>President, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his design to the Captain that commanded in the Fort: Who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd, as were all the Souldiers, at the injury done Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> not only approv'd, but also promis'd Father <hi>Zenon</hi> to assist him in his design. Thereupon the Father sets his spies; and understanding by them, that the Governor of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> went every Saturday-morning, early, to a Chappel upon a Mountain half a league from the City, dedicated to the Virgin-<hi>Mary,</hi> he causes three Iron-Bars to be fix'd in the window of a little Chamber in the Covent, with two good locks to the door, and as many padlocks. And having so done, he goes to the Governor of the Fort, who was an <hi>Irish-</hi>man, and a very stout person; who with thirty Souldiers, and Father <hi>Zenon,</hi> issu'd out of the Fort about midnight, and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves till day near the Chappel, in a part of the Mountain, where they could not be discover'd. The Governor of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> came exactly, according to his custom, a little after Sun-rising; and as soon as ever he alighted from his <hi>Pallequin,</hi> was immediately surpriz'd by the Ambuscade, and carri'd to <hi>Maslipatan,</hi> into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Covent which the Friar had provided for him. The Governor thus surpriz'd, made great protestations against Father <hi>Zenon,</hi> and threaten'd him with what the King would do when he should come to hear what he had practis'd against the Governor of one of his Garrisons. To which Father <hi>Zenon</hi> said no more, but only that he believ'd that he was better us'd at <hi>Madrespatan,</hi> than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ephraim</hi> was us'd at the <hi>Inquisition</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> whither he had sent him: That if he would obtain liberty for Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> to return, he would leave him in the same place where they had seiz'd his person, with as much Justice, as he had to send Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> to <hi>Goa,.</hi> Many people came to the <hi>English</hi> President, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him to use his authority for the Governor's liberty. But his answer was, that the Governor was not in his jurisdiction, neither could he compel Father <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to release him, who had been one of the Authors of the injury which had been done his Companion. So that he contented himself only to desire of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Zenon</hi> that his Prisoner might dine at his Table in the Fort, promising him to return him when he should require his body; a request which he easily obtain'd, but could not so easily keep his word. For the Drummer of the Garrison being a <hi>French-</hi>man, with a Merchant of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> call'd <hi>Roboli,</hi> then in the Fort, two days after came to the Governor, and promis'd him, for a good reward, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his escape. The agreement being made, the Drummer in the morning beat the <hi>Reveillez</hi> sooner than he was wont to do, and lowder, while <hi>Roboli</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor let themselves down at a corner of a <hi>Bastion</hi> that was not very high; and were presently as nimbly follow'd by the Drummer; so that <hi>Madrespatan</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> being but half a league asunder, they were all three in the Town before their escape was known. The whole City greatly rejoyc'd at the return of their Governor, and immediately dispatch'd away a Barque to <hi>Goa</hi> to carry the news. The Drummer also and the Merchant set sail at the same time, and when they came to <hi>Goa</hi> with Letters of recommendation in their behalf, there was no House or Covent which did not make them Presents: The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> also himself caress'd them extremely, and took them into his own Ship to have carri'd them into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> along with him; but both he and the two <hi>French-</hi>men dy'd at Sea.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:106224:198"/>
Never did any Vice-Roy depart from <hi>Goa</hi> so rich as <hi>Don Philippo de Mascareg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas;</hi> for he had a great parcel of Diamonds, all large stones, from ten <hi>Carats</hi> to forty. He shew'd me two when I was at <hi>Goa,</hi> one whereof weigh'd 57 <hi>Carats,</hi> the other 67 and an half; clean Stones, of an excellent water, and cut after the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> manner. The report was that the Vice-Roy was poison'd in the Ship, and that it was a just punishment of Heaven, for that he had poison'd several others, especially when he was Governor of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> He had always most exquisite poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by him, to make use of when his revenge requir'd it: for which reason, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rais'd himself many enemies, one morning he was found hung in <hi>Effigie</hi> in <hi>Goa;</hi> when I was there in the year 1648.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, the Imprisonment of Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> made a great noise in <hi>Europe; Monsieur de Chasteau des Bois</hi> his Brother complain'd to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, who presently wrote to the King his Master to send a positive command by the first Ships, that Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> should be discharg'd. The Pope also wrote, declaring that he would excommunicate all the Clergy of <hi>Goa,</hi> if they did not set him at liberty. But all this signifi'd nothing. So that Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for his liberty to none but the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> who had a love for him, and would have had him have staid at <hi>Bagnagar.</hi> For the King was then at Wars with the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> and his Army lay round about St. <hi>Thomas's.</hi> Hearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what a base trick the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> had plaid with Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he sent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his General <hi>Mirgimola</hi> to lay siege to the Town, and put all to Fire and Sword, unless the Governor would make him a firm promise that Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> should be set at liberty in two months. A Copy of this Order was sent to the Governor, which so alarm'd the Town, that they dispatch'd away Barque after Barque, to press the Vice-Roy to use his endeavours for the release of Father <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Thereupon he was releas'd; but though the door were set open, he would not stir, till all the Religious Persons in <hi>Goa</hi> came in Procession to fetch him out. When he was at liberty he spent 15 days in the Convent of the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins. I have heard Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> say several times, that nothing troubl'd him so much all the while of his imprisonment, as to see the ignorance of the Inquisitor and his Councel, when they put him any question: and that he did not believe that any one of them had ever read the Scripture. They laid him in the same Chamber, with a <hi>Maltese,</hi> who never spoke two words without a desperate oath; and took Tobacco all day, and a good part of the night, which was very offensive to Father <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Inquisitors seize upon any person, they search him presently; and as for his Goods and wearing-Apparel, it is set down in an Inventory, to be return'd him again in case he be acquitted; but if he have any Gold, Silver, or Jewels, that is never set down; but is carri'd to the Inquisitor to defray the expences of the Process. They search'd the Reverend Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but found nothing in his Cloak-pockets, unless it were a Comb, an Inkhorn, and two or three Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs. But forgetting to search the little Pockets which the Capuchins carry in their sleeves toward their armpits, they left him four or five black-lead pens. These Pencils did him a great kindness. For the <hi>Maltese</hi> calling for such a deal of Tobacco, which is always cut and ti'd up in white-paper, for the profit of the seller, who weighs both Tobacco and Paper together: these Papers Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> kept very charily, and with his Pencil wrote therein whatever he had studi'd at any time: though he lost the sight of one of his eyes, through the darkness of the Chamber, which had but one window, half a foot square, and barr'd with iron. They would never so much as lend him a Book, or let him have an end of Candle; but us'd him as bad as a certain Miscreant that had been twice let out already with his Shirt sulphur'd, and a St. <hi>Andrews-Cross</hi> upon his stomach, in company with those that are lead to the Gallows, and was then come in again.</p>
                        <p>Father <hi>Ephraim</hi> having staid 15 days in the Convent of the Capuchins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his strength after 20 months imprisonment, return'd for <hi>Madrespatan,</hi> and passing through <hi>Golconda,</hi> went to return his humble thanks to the King of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colda</hi> and his Son-in-law, who had so highly interess'd themselves for his liberty. The King importun'd him again to stay at <hi>Bagnagar,</hi> but seeing him resolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Convent at <hi>Madrespatan,</hi> they gave him as before, an Oxe, two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Money for his journey.</p>

                        <p>The Army which was commanded out of <hi>Batavia</hi> for the Siege of <hi>Cochin,</hi> landed at a place call'd <hi>Belli-Porto;</hi> where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had a Fort made of Palm-Trees. It is near to <hi>Cranganor,</hi> a small City which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> took the year before; not being able to take <hi>Cochin</hi> then though they had made some attempts upon it. So soon as the Army landed, they murch'd within Cannon-shot of the City, there being a River between them and the City. That part where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> encamp'd, is call'd <hi>Belle-Epine,</hi> where after they had fortifi'd themselves, as well as the Nature of the place would permit, they rais'd some Batteries, which could not much annoy the City, by reason of the distance. They lay there till they had recruits of more men; for they had but three Ships full, though he that commanded them were one of the bravest Captains of his time. Some few days after, the Governour of <hi>Amboyna</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd with two Ships more, and afterwards a <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain brought a great number of <hi>Chinglas,</hi> who are the Natives of the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> For the Forces of the <hi>Hollander</hi> would not be so considerable as they are, did they not make use of the Natives of the Country to fill up the Companies which they bring out of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Natives of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> are good for digging Trenches, and raising Batteries, but for a Storm they signifie little. Those of <hi>Amboyna</hi> are good Soldiers, four hundred of which were left at <hi>Belle-Epine.</hi> The Body of the Army took Shipping again, and landed near to <hi>Cochin,</hi> not far from a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Andrew;</hi> where the <hi>Portugals,</hi> with certain <hi>Malavares,</hi> seem'd to have stay'd ashore for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> coming: But seeing the Enemy to land with so much resolution, they only gave them one Volly and retreated. In their March the <hi>Hollanders</hi> descry'd certain Companies of <hi>Portugueses</hi> near the Sea-shore, others somewhat farther up in the Land, in a Church call'd St. <hi>Johns.</hi> Thereupon they sent out some Horsemen to discover their number; but the <hi>Portugals</hi> still retreated, after they had set fire to the Church. Thereupon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made their approaches to the Town; and after they had besieg'd it for some time, a <hi>French</hi> Soldier, who was under their pay, seeing a Pannier ty'd at the end of a Cord, hanging over one of the Bastions, ventur'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Bullets that flew about his Ears, to see what was in it. But he was strangely surpriz'd, to find nothing but a languishing infant, which the Mother had hung there, that she might not see it perish for hunger. The Soldier mov'd to compassion, took the Infant and gave it such as he had to eat; at which the <hi>Dutch</hi> General was so incens'd, saying that the Soldier should have let the Infant perish, that he call'd a Council of War, where he would have had the Soldier run the Gauntlet, which was very cruel; but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, moderating the sentence, condemn'd him only to the Strappado.</p>
                        <p>The same day ten Soldiers out of every Company were commanded to go to one of the Houses of the King of <hi>Cochin;</hi> but they found no body there,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106224:199"/>
having plunder'd it the year before. At which time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> slew four Kings of the Country, and six hundred Blacks; nor did there escape but only one ancient Queen, who was taken alive by a common Soldier, call'd <hi>Van Rez,</hi> whom the Commander of the Army made a Captain immediately, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They left one Company in that House; but the Queen stay'd there but six days, for they gave her into the custody of <hi>Savarin,</hi> one of the most potent of the petty Kings upon that Coast, to whom the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had promis'd to give the City of <hi>Cranganor,</hi> if they took <hi>Cochim,</hi> provided he would be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them.</p>
                        <p>Six weeks pass'd ere any thing considerable was done; but then the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> storming the Town by night, were repuls'd, and lost abundance of men, slain and taken Prisoners, through the Governour of <hi>Cranganors</hi> fault, who commanded them, and was drunk when the assault was made. Two months after, the General of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> resolv'd to make another assault in the same place; and because he would not want men, he sent for those that lay upon the side of <hi>Belle-epine.</hi> But by misfortune the Frigat struck upon the Sands, and splitting, abundance of the Soldiers were drown'd. They that could swim, got to land near <hi>Cochin,</hi> not finding any other place convenient, and were all taken Prisoners by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> being not above ten in all, Soldiers and Mariners. The General however would not give over the assault, but causing the Sea-men to land, he arm'd some with half-Pikes, others with Swords, to others he gave hand-Granadoes, and about ten a Clock in the morning he began the assault, with four Companies, consisting each of a hundred and fifty men. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> lost abundance of men in this last assault, and so did the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> for they defended themselves stoutly, being seconded by two hundred Soldiers, who were all <hi>Dutch-</hi>men, tho they sided with the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> because their Countrymen had bated them six months and a half pay for the loss of <hi>Touan.</hi> Without the assistance of these Soldiers, the City had never held out two months, there being among them one of the best <hi>Dutch</hi> Engineers of his time, who had left his Countrymen by reason of their ill usage of him.</p>
                        <p>At length the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having enter'd the Town toward evening, on <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vete</hi> side, and being Masters of the chief Bulwark, the <hi>Portugals</hi> came to a Capitulation, and the City was surrender'd. The <hi>Portugals</hi> by their Articles march'd out of <hi>Cochin</hi> with their Arms and Baggage; but when they came out of the City where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were drawn up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> they were all forc'd to quit their Arms, and to lay them at the Generals feet; except the Officers, who kept their Swords. The General had promis'd the Soldiers the Pillage of the Town, but not being able to keep his word, for several plausible reasons which he told, he promis'd them six months pay, which in a few days after was reduc'd to eight Roupies a man. <hi>Samarin</hi> also demanded of him the City of <hi>Cranganor,</hi> according to his promise; which the General made good; but he caus'd all the Fortifications to be slighted first, and left <hi>Samarin</hi> nothing but the bare Walls. For being of a very mean Extraction, he was naturally as cruel and barbarous in his disposition. One time the Soldiers being so put to it for four days together, that they could get no food for money, two of them had somewhere taken a Cow and kill'd her; for which the General, when he came to know of it, caus'd one of them to be hang'd immediately, and had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the other to have run the Gauntlet, had not King <hi>Perca</hi> interceded for him.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Perca</hi> was a petty King of that Country, with whom the General was then in Treaty; and the Treaty being at length concluded, the General muster'd all his Land and Sea-men, to the number of about six thousand men. A few days after, he sent some Companies to besiege the City of <hi>Cananor,</hi> which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd without any resistance. When they return'd, the General caus'd a Crown to be made for the new King of <hi>Cochin,</hi> the other being expell'd his Country. And upon the day which he had appointed for this most solemn Coronation, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sat upon a kind of a Throne, at the foot whereof, a <hi>Malavare</hi> or Pirat, being led thither between three Captains of each side, fell upon his knees to receive the Crown from the Generals hand, and to do homage for a petty Kingdom, that is to say, the little City of <hi>Cochin</hi> and its Territories, which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106224:200"/>
were very small. The King and the King-maker were both alike. For no doubt it could not but be a pleasant sight, to see a <hi>Hollander,</hi> that had been only the Cook of a Ship, crowning a miserable Pirat with those hands that had oft'ner handled a Ladle than a Sword.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Ships that carried the Inhabitants of <hi>Cochin</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> return'd laden with the spoils of those distressed people; for contrary to the Articles of Capitulation, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were no sooner out at Sea, but they took from those poor Creatures whatever they had, rifling both men and women, without any regard to sex or modesty.</p>
                        <p>The General being return'd into <hi>Batavia,</hi> they sent a Governour to <hi>Cochin,</hi> who to make the place the stronger, demolish'd a great part of the City. But this Governour us'd the greatest rigor imaginable, even towards the Soldiers; he shut them up in the City as if they had been in a Prison; nor could they drink either Wine, or <hi>Sury,</hi> or Strong-water, by reason of the great Imposts which he laid upon them. <hi>(Sury</hi> is a drink which flows from the Palm-trees.) So that when the <hi>Portugueses</hi> kept <hi>Cochin,</hi> men might live better for five or six Sous, than under the <hi>Hollander</hi> for ten. This Governour was so severe, that he would banish a man for the smallest fault in the world, to the Island of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> to a place where they made Brick, sometimes for five or six years, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as along as the party liv'd. For it is oftentimes observ'd, that when any one is banish'd thither, though the sentence be only for a term of years, yet the Exile never obtains his freedom afterwards.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> The Passage by Sea from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Maslipatan.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>I departed from <hi>Gomron</hi> to <hi>Maslipatan</hi> the eleventh of <hi>May,</hi> 1652, and went aboard a great Vessel of the King of <hi>Golconda</hi>'s, which is bound every year from <hi>Persia,</hi> laden with fine Calicuts, Chites, or Calicuts painted with a Pencil, which makes them much more beautiful and dearer than those which are printed. The <hi>Holland</hi> Company are wont to allow to those Vessels which belong to any of the Kings or Princes of <hi>India,</hi> a Pilot, and two or three Gunners; neither the <hi>Indians</hi> nor <hi>Persians</hi> being expert in Navigation. In the Vessel where I was aboard, there were but six <hi>Dutch</hi> Mariners at most, but above a hundred Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. We sailed out of the <hi>Persian</hi> Golf with a pleasing and favourable Gale; but we had not sail'd very far before we found the Sea very rough, and the Winds at South-West, so violent, though full in our Stern, that we were not not able to carry out more than one small Sail. The next day, and for some days after, the Wind grew more violent, and the Sea more boist'rous; so that being in the sixteenth Degree, which is the elevation of <hi>Goa,</hi> the Rain, the Thunder, and Lightning, render'd the Tempest the more terrible; insomuch that we could not carry out any other than our top-sail, and that half furl'd. We pass'd by the <hi>Maldives</hi> Islands, but were not able to discern them, besides that the Ship had taken in very much water in the Hold. For the Ship had lain five months in the Road of <hi>Gomron,</hi> where if the Mariners are not very careful to wash the Planks that lye out of the water, they will be apt to gape, which causes the Ship to leak when she is loaden. For which reason the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> wash the outside of their Ships morning and evening. We had in our Vessel five and fifty Horses, which the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had sent as a Present to the King of <hi>Golconda;</hi> and about a hundred Merchants, <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> together, who were Traders to <hi>India.</hi> One whole day and night together there rose a cross Wind, so violent, that the Water rowl'd in from Stern to Stern, and the mischief was, that our Pumps were nought. By good fortune there was a Merchant that had two Bails of <hi>Russia</hi> Leather, besides four or five Sadlers that knew how to sow the Skins, who were very serviceable as well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106224:200"/>
to the whole Ship as to themselves. For they made great Buckets of the Skins, four Skins to a Bucket, which being let down from the Masts with Pullies, through certain great Holes which were cut in the Deck, drew up a vast quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water. The same day the violence of the Tempest continuing, there fell three Thunderbolts into the Ship. The first fell upon the Boltsprit, and split it quite in two; and running along upon the Deck kill'd three men. The second fell two hours after, and kill'd two men, shooting along as the other did from Head to Stern. The third follow'd presently after, the Master, the Masters Mate, and my self standing together near the main Mask. At what time the Cook coming to ask the Master whether he should take up the Victuals, the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt took him in the lower part of his Belly, made a little hole, and took off all the Hair as clean as they dress a Pig with hot water and Rosin, without doing him any more harm. Only when they came to anoint the little hole with Oil of <hi>Coco's,</hi> he roar'd out through the sharpness of the pain which he endur'd.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-fourth of <hi>June</hi> in the morning, we discover'd Land; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king toward it, we found our selves before <hi>Ponte de Galle,</hi> the first Town in the Island of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had taken from the <hi>Portugals.</hi> From thence to the Road of <hi>Maslipatan</hi> we had very good weather; where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd the second of <hi>July,</hi> an hour or two after Sun-set. There I went ashore, and was most civilly treated by the <hi>Dutch</hi> President, and Merchants, as also by the <hi>English.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The eighteenth and nineteenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Du Jardin</hi> and I, bought us two <hi>Palleki's,</hi> and six Oxen to carry our selves, our Servants, and our Luggage. Our design was to have gone directly to <hi>Golconda,</hi> there to have sold the King a parcel of long Pearls, the least whereof weigh'd thirty-four Carats, and the biggest thirty-five, with some other Jewels, the most part whereof were Emraulds. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> assuring us, that our journey would be to no purpose, in regard the King would buy nothing that was rare, or of a high price, till <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimola,</hi> his General and prime Minister of State, had view'd the Commodity understanding therefore, that he was then at the Siege of <hi>Gandicot,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> we resolv'd to go thither to him.</p>

With a discourse at large concerning Elephants.</head>
                        <p>WE set forth from <hi>Maslipatan</hi> the twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> about five of the Clock in the Evening.</p>
                        <p>The next day, being the one and twentieth, we travell'd three Leagues, and lay at a Village call'd <hi>Nilmol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The two and twentieth, we travel'd six Leagues, to <hi>Wouhir,</hi> another Village; crossing the River upon a floating Bridge, before we came thither.</p>
                        <p>The three and twentieth, after we had travel'd six hours, we came to <hi>Pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> a pitiful Village, where we were constrain'd to lye three days by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Rains.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-seventh, we came to a great Town, call'd <hi>Bezouart;</hi> not being able to travel above a League and a half, because the Road was all overflow'd. There we were forc'd to stay four days, for the Rains had so swell'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which we were to cross, that the Ferryman could not govern his Boat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the violence of the Stream. There we also left the Horses which the King of <hi>Persia</hi> sent to the King of <hi>Golconda;</hi> which by that time were reduc'd to fifty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:106224:201"/>
While we stay'd at <hi>Bezouart,</hi> we went to see several Pagods, of which the Country is full; there being more than in any other part of <hi>India;</hi> for unless it be the Governours of Towns; and some of their Domesticks, all the rest of the Inhabitants are Idolaters. The Pagod belonging to the Town of <hi>Bezouart,</hi> is a very large one, but not clos'd with Walls; it consists of fifty-two Pillars twenty foot high, that uphold a flat roof of Free-stone; they are adorn'd with several emboss'd Figures of ugly Devils, and several sorts of Creatures. Some of those Devils are made with four Horns, others with many Legs and many Tails, others lilling out their Tongues, and others in several other ridiculous postures. The same Figures are cut in the Stone of the Roof, and between the Pillars stand the Statues of their Gods upon Pedestals. The Pagod is built in the midst of a Court, of a greater length than breadth, encompass'd with Walls, which are adorn'd within and without, with the same Figures as the Pagod; and a Gallery upheld by sixty-six Pillars, runs round the Wall, after the manner of a Cloyster. You enter into this Court through a wide Portal, upon which are two Niches, one above another, the first upheld by twelve, the other by eight Pillars. At the bottom of the Pillars of the Pagod, are certain old <hi>Indian</hi> Characters, of which the Priests of those Idolaters themselves can hardlytell the meaning.</p>
                        <p>We went to see another Pagod, built upon a Hill, to which there is an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of a hundred and ninety-three steps, every one a foot high. The Pagod is four-square, with a Cupola at the top; and has the same emboss'd Figures, as the Pagod of <hi>Bezouart,</hi> round about the Walls. In the middle, there is an Idol sitting cross-leg'd, after the manner of the Country; and in that sitting posture it is about four foot high; upon the Head it has a Triple Crown, from which four Horns extend themselves; and it has the Face of a man, turn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the East. The Pilgrims that come out of devotion to these Pagods, when they enter, clasp their hands together, and rear them up to their foreheads; then they advance toward the Idol, tossing their two hands so claspt together, and crying out several times <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> that is to say, <hi>God, God.</hi> When they come near, they ring a little Bell that hangs upon the Idol it self; after they have besmear'd the Face, and several parts of the Body, with several sorts of Painting. Some there are that bring along with them Viols of Oil, with which they anoint the Idol; and besides, they make an Offering to it of Sugar, Oil, and other things proper to be eaten; the richer sort also adding pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There are sixty Priests that belong to this Idol, and maintain themselves, their Wives, and Children upon the Offerings brought to the Idol. But to the end the Pilgrims may believe the Idol takes them, the Priests let them lye two days, and the third day in the evening they take them away. When any Pilgrim goes to a pagod, to be cur'd of any distemper, he brings the Figure of the Member affected made either in Gold, Silver, or Copper, according to his quality, which he offers to his god; and then falls a singing, as all the rest do, after they have offer'd. Before the Gate of the Pagod, there is a flat Roof, upheld by sixteen Pillars, and right against it, is another upheld by eight; which serves for the Priests Kitchin. On the South-side there is a large Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form cut in the Mountain, where there is a pleasing shade of many fair Trees, and several Wells digg'd in the ground. Pilgrims come far and near to this Pagod; and if they be poor, the Priests relieve them with what they receive from the rich, that come there out of devotion. The great Feast of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god is in the month of <hi>October,</hi> at which time there is a great concourse of people from all parts. While we were there, there was a Woman that had not stirr'd out of the Pagod for three days together; and her prayer to the Idol was, since she had lost her Husband, to know what she should do to bring up her Children. Thereupon asking one of the Priests, wherefore she had no answer, or whether she was to have any answer or no; he told me, that she must wait the pleasure of their God, and that then he would give her an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to what she expected. Upon this I mistrusted some cheat, and to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, I resolv'd to go into the Pagod when all the Priests were absent at Dinner, there being only one that stood at the Gate, whom I sent to fetch me some water at a Fountain two or three Musket-shot from the place. During that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106224:201"/>
time I went in, and the Woman hearing me, redoubl'd her cries; for there being no light in the Pagod, but what comes in at the door, it is very dark. I felt my way to the Idol, and by the glimmering light observ'd an hole behind the Idol. I could not do this so quickly, but that the Priest return'd before I had done; He curst me for prophaning his Temple, as he call'd it. But we became suddenly very good friends by the mediation of two Roupies which I put into his hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he presently presented me with some of his <hi>Betlé.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The one and thirtieth, we departed from <hi>Bezouart,</hi> and past the River which runs to the Mine of <hi>Gani</hi> or <hi>Coulour.</hi> It was then neer half a league broad, by reason of the great rains which had fall'n continually for eight or nine days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. After we had travell'd three leagues on the other side of the River, we came to a great Pagod built upon a large Platform, with an ascent of 15 or 20 steps. Within it stood the Figure of a Cow, all of very black-Marble: and a number of deformed Idols four or five-foot-high; some having many heads, others many hands and legs: and the most ugly are most ador'd, and receive most Offerings.</p>
                        <p>A quarter of a league from this Pagod is a large Town; but we travell'd three leagues farther, and came to lie at another Town, call'd <hi>Kab-Kali,</hi> neer to which there is a small Pagod, wherein there stand five or six Idols of Marble very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made.</p>
                        <p>The first of <hi>August</hi> we came to a great City call'd <hi>Condevir,</hi> with a double-Moat, pav'd at the bottom with Free-stone. The way to this Town is clos'd on each side with strong Walls, and at such and such distances are built certain round Towers of little or no defence. This City toward the East stretches out to a Mountain about a league in compass, and surrounded with Walls. At the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of every 150 paces, there is as it were an half-Moon, and within the Walls are three Fortresses.</p>
                        <p>The second, we travell'd six leagues, and lay at a Village call'd <hi>Copenour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third day, after we had travell'd eight leagues, we came to <hi>Adanquige,</hi> a very fair Town, where there is a very large Pagod, with abundance of Chambers which were built for the Priests; but are now gone to ruine. There are also in the Pagod certain Idols, but very much maim'd, which the people however very superstitiously adore.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, we travell'd eight leagues, and came to lie at the Town of <hi>Nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drepar.</hi> Half a league on this side there is a great River; but at that time it had but little water in it; by reason of the drowth.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, after eight leagues journey we lay at <hi>Condecour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The sixth, we travell'd seven hours, and lay at a Village call'd <hi>Dakije.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The seventh, after three leagues journey we came to <hi>Nelour,</hi> where there are many Pagods, and having cross'd a great River, a quarter of a league farther, we travell'd six leagues, and came to <hi>Gandaron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The eighth, after a journey of eight hours we lay at <hi>Serepelé,</hi> a small Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
                        <p>The ninth, we travell'd nine leagues, and lay at a good Town call'd <hi>Ponter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The tenth, we travell'd eleven hours, and lay at <hi>Senepgond,</hi> another good Town.</p>
                        <p>The eleventh, we went no farther than <hi>Palicat,</hi> which is but four leagues from <hi>Senepgond;</hi> and of those four leagues we travell'd above one in the Sea, up to the Saddles of our Horses in water. There is another way, but it is the farther about by two or three leagues. <hi>Palicat</hi> is a Fort that belongs to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that live upon the Coast of <hi>Coromandel;</hi> and where they have their chief Factory, where lives also the chief Intendent over all the rest that are in the Territories of the King of <hi>Golconda.</hi> There are usually within the Fort 200 Souldiers, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, besides several Merchants that live there upon the account of Trade; and several others, who having serv'd the Company according to their agreement, retire to that place. There also dwell some of the Natives of the Countrey; so that <hi>Palicat</hi> is now as it were a little Town. Between the Town and the Castle there is a large distance of ground, lest the Fort should be annoid by shot from the Town. The Bastions are well-stor'd with good Guns: And the Sea comes up to the very Wall of it; but there is no Haven, only a Road. We staid in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106224:202"/>
Town till the next day in the evening, where we observ'd, that when the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants fetch their water to drink, they stay till the Sea is quite out, and then dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging holes in the Sand as neer the Sea as they can, they meet with fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.</p>
                        <p>The twelth, we departed from <hi>Calicat,</hi> and the next morning about ten of the clock we came to <hi>Madrespatan,</hi> otherwise call'd Fort St. <hi>George,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>English,</hi> having travell'd not above seven or eight leagues that day. We lay at the Covent of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> at what time Father <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and Father <hi>Zenon</hi> were both there.</p>
                        <p>The fifteenth, we went to St. <hi>Thomas's</hi> Town, to see the <hi>Austin-</hi>Friars, and the Jesuits Church, in the first whereof is an Iron-lance, wherewith they say that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was martyr'd.</p>
                        <p>The two and twentieth, in the morning we departed from <hi>Madrespatan,</hi> and after a journey of five leagues we arriv'd at a large Town call'd <hi>Serravaron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The three and twentieth, after 7 leagues travel, we came to <hi>Oudecot,</hi> the whole days journey being over a flat sandy Countrey. On each side there are only Copses of <hi>Bambou's</hi> that grow very high. Some of these Copses are so thick, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a man to get into them; but they are pester'd with prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Apes: Those that breed in the Copses upon one side of the way, are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to them that are bred on the other side; so that they dare not cross from one side to the other, but they are in danger of being immediately strangl'd. Here we had good sport in setting the Apes together by the ears; which is done after this manner. This part of the Countrey, at every leagues end, is clos'd up with Gates and Barricado's, where there is a good Guard kept, and where all Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers are examin'd whither they go, and whence they come; so that men may safely travel there with their Money in their hands. In several parts of this Road there is Rice to be sold; and they that would see the sport, cause five or six Baskets of Rice to be set in the Road, some forty or fifty paces one from the other, and close by every Basket they lay five or six Battoons about two-foot-long, and two inches about; then they retire and hide themselves: presently they shall see the Apes on both sides of the way descend from the tops of the <hi>Bambou's,</hi> and advance toward the Baskets which are full of Rice: They are about half an hour shewing their teeth one at the other before they come near the Baskets; sometimes they advance, then retreat again, being loath to encounter. At length the female-Baboons, who are more couragious than the males, especially those that have young ones, which they carry in their arms, as Women do their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, venture to approach the Basket, and as they are about to put in their heads to eat, the males on the other side advance to hinder them. Immediately the other party comes forward, and thus the seud being kindled on both sides, they take up the Battoons that lie by the Baskets, and thrash one another in good earnest. The weakest are constrain'd to flie into the wood with their pates bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and their limbs maim'd; while the Masters of the Field glut themselves with Rice. Though it may be, when their bellies are full, they will suffer some of the female-party to come and partake with them.</p>
                        <p>The four and twentieth, we travell'd nine leagues, all the way being like the Road the day before, as far as <hi>Naraveron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The five and twentieth, after a journey of eight hours, through a Countrey of the same nature, meeting at every two or three leagues end with Gates and Guards, we came in the evening to <hi>Gazel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The six and twentieth, we travell'd nine leagues, and came to lie at <hi>Courva,</hi> where there was nothing to be found neither for Man nor Beast, so that our Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te! were forc'd to be contented with a little Grass, which was cut on purpose for them. <hi>Courva</hi> is only a celebrated Pagod; by which, at our arrival, we saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bands of Souldiers pass by, some with Half-pikes, some with Muskets, and some with Clubs, who were going to joyn with one of the principal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Mirgimola's</hi> Army, who was encamp'd upon a rising-ground not far from <hi>Courva;</hi> the place being pleasant and cool, by reason of the great number of Trees and Fountains that grace it. When we understood the Captain was so neer, we went to wait upon him, and found him sitting in his Tent with many Lords of the Countrey, all Idolaters. After we had presented him with a pair of Pocket-Pistols
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106224:202"/>
inlaid with Silver, he demanded of us what had brought us into that Countrey; but when we told him that we came to attend <hi>Mirgimola, Generalis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo</hi> of the King of <hi>Golconda's</hi> Army, about business, he was infinitely kind to us: However, understanding that he took us for Hollanders, we told him we were not <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but <hi>French-</hi>men. Thereupon, not understanding what Nation we were, he fell into a long discourse with us about the Government of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the Grandeur of our King. Six or seven days before, they had taken five or six Elephants, three whereof had escap'd, having kill'd ten or twelve of the Natives who assisted in the Chace; in pursuit whereof the General was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and because we could not stay to see the sport, we were contented to inform our selves of the manner of hunting that vast Animal; which is thus. They cut out several Alleys or Walks in the Wood, which they dig full of great deep holes, and cover with Hurdles strow'd over with a little earth. Then the Hunters hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hollowing, and beating up Drums, with Pikes that have Wild-fire ti'd to the end of them, force the Elephant into those Walks, where he tumbles into the holes, not being able to rise again. Then they fetch Ropes and Chains: and some they bring under their bellies, others they wind about their legs and trunk, and when they think they have sufficiently hamper'd the Beast, they have certain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ready, wherewithal to draw him up. Nevertheless, of five, three escap'd, notwithstanding the cords and chains about their bodies and their legs. The people told us one thing which seem'd very wonderful; which was, that these Elephants having been once deceiv'd, and having escap'd the snare, are very mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ever after; and when they get into the Wood again, they break off a great bough from one of the Trees with their trunk, with which they examine every step they go, before they set down their feet, to try whether there be any hole or no in their way. So that the Hunters that told us the Story, seem'd to be out of hopes of ever taking those three Elephants which had escap'd. Had we been assur'd that we might have been eye-witnesses of this miraculous precaution of the Elephant, we would have staid three or four days, what-ever urgent business we had had. The Captain himself was a kind of a <hi>Brigadeer,</hi> that commanded three or four-thousand men, who were quarter'd half a league round the Countrey.</p>
                        <p>The seven and twentieth, after two hours travel, we came to a great Village, where we saw the two Elephants which had been so lately taken. Every one of the two wild Elephants was plac'd between two tame ones. Round about the wild Elephants stood six men, with every one an Half-pike in their hands, and a lighted-Torch fasten'd at the end of the Pike, who talk'd to the Beasts, giving them meat, and crying out in their language, <hi>Take it, eat it.</hi> The food which they gave them was a little bottle of Hey, some pieces of brown-Sucre, and Rice boil'd in water, with some few corns of Pepper. If the wild Elephants refus'd to do as they were bidden, the men made signs to the tame Elephants to beat them, which they did, banging the refractory Elephant upon the head and forehead with their trunks; and if he offer'd to make any resistance, the other Elephant thwackt him on the other side; so that the poor Elephant, not knowing what to do, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to learn obedience.</p>
                        <p>Being thus fall'n into the Story of Elephants, I will add some other observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I have made upon the nature of those Animals. Though the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant never meddles with the female, after he is once taken, yet he is sometimes seiz'd with a kind of lustful rage. One day that <hi>Sha-jehan</hi> was an Hunting upon one of his Elephants, with one of his Sons that sate by him to fan him, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant became so furious by reason of his lust, that the Governor who was by no means able to master him, declar'd to the King, that to allay the fury of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, who would else doubtless bruise him to pieces among the Trees, there was no way, but for one of the three to forfeit his life: and that he would willingly sacrifice his for the safety of the King and the Prince his Son. Only he desir'd his Majesty to take care of three small Children which he must leave behind him. Having so said, he threw himself under the Elephant's-feet, who had no sooner taken him in his trunk and squeez'd him to pieces with his feet, but he grew as quiet and peaceable as before. The King, as an acknowledgment for so famous a deliverance, gave to the poor two-hunder'd-thousand Roupies, and highly advanc'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106224:203"/>
every one of the Sons of him that had so generously laid down his life for the safety of his Sovereign.</p>
                        <p>I observ'd also, that though the Elephant's skin be very hard while he is alive; yet when he is dead, it is just like melted-glue.</p>
                        <p>Elephants are brought from several parts of <hi>India;</hi> as from the Island of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> where they are very small; but the most couragious of all: from the Isle of <hi>Sumatra;</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Cochin;</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Siam;</hi> and from the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <hi>Boutam</hi> neer the Great-<hi>Tartarie.</hi> They are brought also from the Coast of <hi>Melinda,</hi> Eastward of <hi>Affrica:</hi> where they are in very great numbers, according to the report of a <hi>Portugueze-</hi>Captain, made at <hi>Goa,</hi> who came from thence to make some complaint against the Governor of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambique.</hi> He told me that he had seen all along that Coast several Parks that were empal'd with nothing but Elephants-teeth, the least of which Parks is above a league about: He added farther, that the Blacks of the Countrey hunt their Elephants, and eat the flesh. But they are oblig'd to give the tusks of every one they kill to the Lord of the place. When they intend to take their Elephants in the Island of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> they make a long lane, clos'd in on both sides, so that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant can neither run to the right nor to the left: this lane is broad at the first, but grows narrower and narrower, till there is no more room left at the farther-end than for the female-Elephant to lie down, which must be one that is covetous of the male at the same time. Though she be tame, yet she is bound with good Ropes and Cords, and by her cries will call the male-Elephant, who presently runs through the lane towards her. Now when the Elephant comes where the lane grows narrow, they that lie hid for that purpose, immediately barricado up the lane behind, and when he comes neer the female, there is another barricado set up that stops him from going any farther. When he is thus between the Barricado's, they so intangle his legs and trunk with ropes and cords, that he is soon taken, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no way to help himself. The same way they use for the most part in the Kingdoms of <hi>Siam,</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> only that the Natives there mount the female-Elephant, and go to find out the male in the Forrests. And when they have met with his haunt, they tye the female to the most convenient place they can find, and then they fix their snares for the Elephant, who in a short time hastens toward the female, hot for generation, where her cries call him.</p>
                        <p>This is observable of the female-Elephant, that when she begins to be hot, she gathers together a great heap of herbs and weeds, and makes her self a kind of bed some four or five-foot-high from the ground, where contrary to the custom of all other creatures, she lies upon her back, in expectation of the male, whom she calls to her by a peculiar cry.</p>
                        <p>This is also particular to the Elephants in the Isle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> that only the first Elephant which the female produces, has any tusks. And it is also observable that the Ivory which comes from <hi>Achen</hi> when it is wrought, has this peculiar quality with it, that it never grows yellow, like that which comes out of the Continent, and from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> which makes it more esteem'd, and dearer than any other.</p>
                        <p>When the Merchants bring Elephants to any place to sell; 'tis a pleasant sight to see them go along. For in regard there are generally old and young together, when the old ones are gone by the children will be running after the little ones to play with them, and give them something or other to eat. While the young Elephants, which are very wanton, are busily taking what is offer'd them, the children leap upon their backs: but then the young Elephants, that lately stopt for the lucre of victuals, perceiving their Dams a great way before them, double their pace, and playing with their trunks, throvv the children off their backs to the ground, yet vvithout doing them any harm.</p>
                        <p>Notvvithstanding all the enquiry I have made, I could never find exactly hovv long an Elephant vvill live. Nor can all the governors and keepers of those creatures tell you more, then that such an Elephant has been in the possession of their Father, their Grandfather, and great Grandfather. And by that computation, I found that they had liv'd some of them six-score, or an hunder'd and thirty years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106224:203"/>
The greatest part of those that have made Relations of <hi>India,</hi> boldly affirm that the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> keeps three or four-thousand Elephants. But being my self at <hi>Jehanabad,</hi> where the King at present resides, he that was chief Master of the Elephants, assur'd me that the King had not above five-hunder'd Elephants, which were call'd Elephants of the House, made use of only to carry the Women, their Tents, and Luggage; but that for the Wars, he only kept fourscore, or four-score and ten at most. The noblest of the latter sort is always reserv'd for the King's Eldest Son, the allowance for his food and other necessaries being 500 Roupies a month, which comes to 750 Livres. There are some that are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd above 50, others 40, others 30, and some but 20 Roupies. But those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants that are allow'd an hunder'd, two-hunder'd, three-hunder'd or four-hunder'd Roupies a-month, have belonging to them certain Horse-men that live upon the same pay, and two or three young fellows to fan them during the heat of the weather. All these Elephants are not always kept in the City: the greatest part being led out every morning into the fields, or among the thickets, where they feed upon the branches of Trees, Sucre-canes, and Millet, to the great detriment of the poor Countrey man. But not a little to the profit of their Keepers; for the less they eat at home, the more they gain into their own purses.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-seventh of <hi>August,</hi> we travell'd six leagues, and lay at a great Town call'd <hi>Ragia-peta.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The twenty-eighth, after eight leagues journey we came to <hi>Ondecour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The twenty-ninth, after nine hours travel we arriv'd at <hi>Outemeda,</hi> where there is one of the greatest Pagods in all <hi>India.</hi> It is all built of large Free-stone, and it has three Towers, where there stand several deform'd figures of Emboss'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. It is encompast with many little Chambers for the Priests Lodgings: five-hunder'd paces beyond there is a wide Lake, upon the banks whereof are built several Pagods eight or ten-foot-square; and in every one an Idol representing the shape of some Devil, with a <hi>Brameré,</hi> who takes care that no stranger that is not of their superstition, shall come to wash, or take any water out of the Lake. If any stranger desires any water, they bring it in earthen-pots: and if by chance their pot touches the stranger's Vessel, they break it immediately. They told me also, that if any stranger, not of their superstition, should happen by accident to wash in that Lake, they must be forc'd to drain the Lake of all the water that was in at that time. As for their Alms, they are very charitable; for there passes by no person in necessity, or that begs of them but they give them to eat and drink of such as they have. There are several Women that sit upon the Road, whereof some of them always keep fire for Travellers to light their Tobacco by. Nay, they will give a Pipe to some that have none at all. Others boil Rice with <hi>Quicheri,</hi> which is a grain somewhat like our Hemp-seed. Others boil Beans with their Rice, because the water wherein they are boil'd never puts those that are over-hot into a Pleurify. There are Women that have vow'd to perform these acts of Charity to strangers for seven or eight years, some for more, some for less, according to their convenience. And to every Traveller they give some of their Beans, and Rice-water, and an handful of Rice to eat. There are other Women upon the high-way, and in the fields, looking behind their Horses, their Oxen, and their Cows, who have made vows never to eat but what they find indigested in the dung of those Beasts. Now in regard there is neither Barly nor Oats in that Countrey, they give their Cattel certain great crooked Pease, which they bruise before between two Mill-stones: and then lay them in steep for half an hour; for they are a very solid substance, and hard to be digested. They give their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel these Pease every evening; and in the morning they feed them with two-pound of dark-brown-Sugar, like Wax, kneaded together with as much Meal, and one-pound of Butter, whereof the Ostlers or Grooms make little round Balls which they thrust down their throats; for otherwise they would never eat them. Afterwards they wash their mouths, that are all over clamm'd, especially their teeth, which makes them have such an aversion against that sort of food. All the day long they pull up the grass and weeds by the roots, and give their Cattel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very careful of letting them eat any of the earth.</p>
                        <p>The thirty'th, we travell'd eight leagues, and lay at a place call'd <hi>Goulupalé.</hi>

The one and thirty'th, after we had travell'd nine hours, we stopt at <hi>Gogoron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first of <hi>September</hi> we travell'd but six leagues, and came to lie at <hi>Gandicot.</hi> It was but eight days before, that the <hi>Nahab</hi> had taken that City, after a Siege of three months. Nor had it been taken without the assistance of certain <hi>French-</hi>men, who had forsaken the service of the <hi>Dutch-</hi>Company, by reason of ill-usage. They had also several <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch-</hi>Cannoneers, with two or three <hi>Italians,</hi> which mainly forwarded the surrender of that place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gandicot</hi> is one of the strongest Cities in the Kingdom of <hi>Carnatica.</hi> It is situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the point of an high Mountain; there being but one ascent to it, not above twenty or five and twenty-foot-broad at most; in some places not above seven or eight-foot-wide. On the right-hand of the way, which is cut out of the Mountain, there is a most hideous precipice; at the bottom whereof runs a vast River. Upon the top of the Mountain there is a small plain, about a quarter of a league broad, and about half a league long. This is all sow'd with Rice and Millet, and water'd with many little Springs. The top of the plain on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, where the City is built, is encompast with precipices, two Rivers running at the bottom, which form the point. So that there is but one Gate to enter into the City from the plain-side; and that too fortifi'd with three good Walls of Free-stone, with Moats pav'd at the bottom with Free-stone; so that the besieged had but only one quarter of the City to defend, containing about five-hunder'd paces. They had but two Iron-Guns, the one carrying twelve-pound-Ball, the other eight. The one was planted upon the Gate, the other upon a point of a kind of a Bastion. So that until the <hi>Nahab</hi> had found the way to mount his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non upon a very high place neer the City, he lost a great number of men by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sallies which the Besieged made. The <hi>Raja</hi> that was within, was esteem'd one of the bravest and most experienc'd Captains that ever were amongst the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters: whereupon, the <hi>Nahab</hi> finding that the place was not to be taken, unless he could get up his Cannon to the top of that steep ascent, sent for all the <hi>French-</hi>men that were in the King's service, promising to every one four months extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pay, if they could find a way to mount his Cannon upon the top of such a place; wherein they had the good-hap to be very succesful. For they mounted four pieces of Cannon, and were so prosperous, as to hit the great Gun that was planted upon the Gate, and render it unserviceable. At length, when they had beaten down good part of the Wall of the City, the Besiege<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> came to capitulate, and march'd out of the Town upon very good Articles. The day we arriv'd, all the Army was encamp'd at the foot of the Mountain, in a plain, through which there ran a very fair River; where the <hi>Nahab</hi> muster'd his Cavalry, and found them in a very good condition. An <hi>English-</hi>Cannoneer and an <hi>Italian</hi> seeing Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Jardin</hi> and my self pass by, guess'd us to be <hi>Frangui's;</hi> and because it was late, accosted us very civilly, and oblig'd us to stay with them all night. By them we understood that there was in the City a <hi>French-</hi>Engineer, whose name was <hi>Claudius Maille</hi> of <hi>Bourges,</hi> and that he was employ'd by the <hi>Nahab</hi> to cast some pieces of Cannon which the <hi>Nahab</hi> intended to leave in the City.</p>
                        <p>The next day we went into the City, and found out <hi>Maille</hi>'s Lodging, having been acquainted with him at <hi>Batavia;</hi> who informing the <hi>Nahab</hi> of our arrival, he presently sent us Provision for our selves and our beasts.</p>
                        <p>The third day we went to wait upon the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who had pitch'd his Tents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that part of the plain neer the place where the way is cut out of the Rock. We inform'd him of the cause of our coming, telling him that we had some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that were rare, and worth the King's buying; but that we were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to shew them to the King till he had seen them; believing it our duty to render him that respect. The <hi>Nahab</hi> was very well-pleas'd with our Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and after he had caus'd us to be presented with <hi>Betlé,</hi> we took our leaves of him, and return'd to our Lodgings, whither he sent to us two Bottles of Wine, one of Sack, and the other of <hi>Sohiras,</hi> which is a rare thing in that Countrey.</p>
                        <p>The fourth day we waited upon him again, and carried along with us some Pearles of an extraordinary weight. beauty and bigness, the least whereof weighed twenty four Caratts. After he had vewd them and shew'd them to some of the Lords that were about him, he ask'd the price, which when we had set him, he return'd us our Jewels and told us he would consider of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106224:204"/>
The tenth day he sent for us in the morning, and after he had caus'd us to sit down by him, he sent for five small Bags full of Diamonds, every Bag con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a good handful. They were loose Stones, of a very black Water, and very small; none of them exceeding a Carat, or a Carat and a half; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very clean. There were some few that might weigh two Carats. After the <hi>Nahab</hi> had shew'n us all, he ask'd us whether they would sell in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. We made answer, that they might have been for sale in our Country, provided they had not been of a black Water; for that in <hi>Europe</hi> we never esteem'd any Diamonds, but such as were clean and white, having but a small esteem for any others. It seems, that when he first undertook the Conquest of this Kingdom for the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> they inform'd him that there were Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Mines in it. Whereupon he sent twelve thousand men to dig there; who in a whole years time could find no more than those five small Bags full. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Nahab</hi> perceiving that they could find none but brown Stones, of a Water enclining much more to black than white, thought it but loss of time, and so sent all the people back to their Husbandry.</p>
                        <p>The eleventh, the <hi>French</hi> Canoneers came all to the <hi>Nahabs</hi> Tent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that he had not paid them the four months pay which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them; threatning him, that if he did not discharge it, they would leave him; to which the <hi>Nahab</hi> promis'd to give them satisfaction the next day.</p>
                        <p>The twelfth, the Canoneers not failing to give him another visit, the <hi>Nahab</hi> paid them three months, and promis'd to pay them the fourth before the month were out; but so soon as they had receiv'd their Money, they fell a feasting one another, so that the Dancing Wenches carried away the greatest part of their Coin.</p>
                        <p>The thirteenth, the <hi>Nahab</hi> went to see the Guns which <hi>Maille</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to cast. For which purpose he had sent for Brass from all parts, and got together a great number of Idols which the Soldiers had pillag'd out of the Pagods as they march'd along. Now you must know, that in <hi>Gandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> there was one Pagod, said to be the fairest in all <hi>India,</hi> wherein there were several Idols, some of Gold, and others of Silver; among the rest there were six of Brass, three sitting upon their Heels, and three upon their Feet, ten foot high. These Idols' were made use of among the rest. But when <hi>Maille</hi> also had provided all things ready, he could not make those six Idols run, that were taken out of the great Pagod of <hi>Gandicot,</hi> though he melted all the rest. He try'd several ways, but it was impossible for him to do it, whatever expence the <hi>Nahab</hi> was at; nay though the <hi>Nahab</hi> threaten'd to hang the Priests for having inchanted those Idols. And thus <hi>Maille</hi> could never make any more than only one single piece, and that split upon trial; so that he was forc'd to leave the work unfinish'd, and soon after left the <hi>Nahabs</hi> service.</p>
                        <p>The fourteenth, we went to take our leaves of the <hi>Nahab,</hi> and to know what he had further to say to us, concerning the Commodities we had then shew'n him. But then he told us, he was busie at present about the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain Offenders which were brought before him. For it is the custom of that Country, never to put a man in Prison; but as soon as the Offender is taken, he is examin'd, and sentence is pronounc'd upon him, according to his crime, which is immediately executed; or if the party taken, be found innocent, he is as soon acquitted. And let the controversie be of what nature it will, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently decided.</p>
                        <p>The fifteenth in the morning, we went to wait upon him again, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately admitted into his Tent, where he sate with his two Secretaries by him. The <hi>Nahab</hi> was sitting according to the custom of the Country, bare-foot, like one of our Taylors, with a great number of Papers sticking between his Toes, and others between the Fingers of his left hand, which Papers he drew somtimes from between his Toes, sometimes from between his Fingers, and order'd what answers should be given to every one. After his Secretaries had wrote the answers, he caus'd them to read them, and then took the Letters and seal'd them himself; giving some to Foot Messengers, others to Horsemen. For you must know, that all those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are sent by Foot-Posts all over <hi>India,</hi> go with more speed than those which are carried by Horsemen. The reason is, because at the end of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106224:205"/>
every two Leagues there are little Huts, where there are men always ready, who are engag'd to run away immediately; so that when one of these men that carries the Letters, comes to one of these Huts, he throws the Letters into the Hut, and then he that is appointed, runs with them to the next Stage. They look upon it as an ill Omen, to give the Letters into the Messengers hands; but they must be thrown at his feet, and he must gather them up. It is to be observ'd also, that the Highways in most parts of <hi>India,</hi> are like Walks of Trees; and that where there are no Trees, at every five hundred paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance there are set up little Heaps of Stones, which the Inhabitants of the next Villages are bound to white-wash from time to time, to the end those Letter-Carriers may not miss their ways in dark and Rainy nights. While we stay'd with the <hi>Nahab,</hi> certain Officers came to tell him, that they had brought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Offenders to the door of his Tent. He was above half an hour before he return'd them any answer, writing on, and giving instructions to his Secretaries; but by and by, all of a sudden he commanded the Offenders to be brought in, and after he had examin'd them, and made them consess the crime of which they stood accus'd, he was above an hour before he said a word, still writing on, and employing his Secretaries. In the mean while several of the Officers of the Army came to tender their respects to him in a very submissive manner, all whom he answer'd only with a nod. There was one of the Offenders which were brought before him, had broken into a House, and had kill'd the Mother and three Children. He was condemned upon the spot to have his Hands and Feet cut off, and to be cast out into the high way, there to end his days in misery. Another had rob'd upon the Highway; for which the <hi>Nahab</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Belly to be ript up, and himself to be cast upon the Dunghill. I know not what crimes the other two had committed, but their Heads were both cut off. When we perceiv'd him at a little leisure, we ask'd him whether he had any other Commands to lay upon us, and whether he thought our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities fitting to be shew'n to the King. He answer'd, that we might go to <hi>Golconda,</hi> and that he would write to his Son in our behalf, and that his Letter would be there sooner than we. And in order to our journey, he order'd us sixteen Horsemen to convoy us, and to provide us necessaries upon the Road, till we came to a River thirteen Leagues from <hi>Gandicot,</hi> which no persons are to pass, unless they have the <hi>Nahabs</hi> Passport, to keep the Soldiers from running from their Colours.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> The Road from <hi>Gandicot</hi> to <hi>Golconda.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE sixteenth in the morning, we set out of <hi>Gandicot,</hi> accompanied with the greatest part of the Canoneers, who brought us the first days journey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our way; and that day having travel'd seven Leagues, we came to lye at <hi>Cotepali.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The seventeenth, the Canoneers took their leaves of us; and we kept on our journey with our Horsemen; and having travel'd six Leagues, we lay at a Village call'd <hi>Coteen,</hi> on the other side of the River, which is very broad. So soon as we had cross'd it, the Horsemen took their leaves of us; and though we made them a present of Roupies, to buy them Tobacco and Betlè, yet we could not perswade them to take it. Their Ferry-Boats wherewith they cross the River, are like broad bottom'd Wicker Flaskets, cover'd without with Oxe's Hides; at the bottom whereof they lay certain Faggots, over which they spread a piece of old Tapestry, to keep the Wares and Merchandise from the wet. As for their Coaches and Waggons, they fasten them between two Boats, by the Wheels and the Pole; the Horses swimming all the while, one man whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them on behind, while another in the Boat holds them up by the Head-Stall.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106224:205"/>
As for the Oxen that carry the Luggage, as soon as ever they come to the River side, and that they have unladed them, they only drive them into the River, and they will swim over of themselves. There are four men that stand upright at the four Corners of the Boat, and row it along with broad pieces of Wood, made like Shovels. If they do not all strike their stroakes together, but that any of the four misses, the Boat will turn round two or three times; and the stream carries it a great way lower than where they intended to land.</p>
                        <p>The eighteenth, after five hours travel we arriv'd at <hi>Morimal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The nineteenth, we travel'd nine Leagues, and lay at <hi>Santesela.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The twentieth, we travel'd nine Leagues more, and lay at <hi>Goremeda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The one and twentieth, after six hours travel, we spent the night at <hi>Kaman,</hi> a Frontier Town in the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> till the Conquest of <hi>Carnatica</hi> by <hi>Mirgimola.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The two and twentieth, we travel'd seven Leagues, and came to lye at <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipata.</hi> When we were about half the way, we met above four thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, men and women; and above twenty <hi>Palleki's,</hi> in every one whereof was an Idol. They were adorn'd with Coverings of Sattin, purfled with Gold, and Velvets with Gold and Silver Fringe. Some of these <hi>Palleki's</hi> were born by four men; others by eight, and some by twelve, according as the Idols were in bigness and weight. On each side of the <hi>Pallekie,</hi> walk'd a man, with a large Fan in his hand, five Foot in compass, made of Ostriches and Peacocks Feathers, of various colours. The Handle of the Fan was five or six foot long, laid all over with Gold and Silver, about the thickness of a <hi>French</hi> Crown. Every one was officious to carry one of those Fans, to keep the Flies from the Idols Face. There was another Fan which was carried close by the Idol, somewhat larger than the former, without a handle, and was born just like a Target. It was adorn'd with Feathers of several colours, and little Bells of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, round about the edges. He that carried it, went always near the Idol upon the same side, to shade the Idol; for to have shut the Curtains would have been too hot. Ever and anon, he that carried that sort of Fan, brandish'd it in the air, to make the Bells ring; which they presum'd to be a kind of Pastime to the Idol. All these people with their Idols came from <hi>Brampour,</hi> and the adjacent parts, and were going to visit their great <hi>Ram,</hi> that is to say, their chief God, who stands in a Pagod in the Territories of the King of <hi>Carnatica.</hi> They had been about thirty days upon the Road, and were to travel fourteen or fifteen more, before they came to this Pagod. One of my Servants, who was a Native of <hi>Brampour,</hi> and of the same Superstition, beg'd me to give him leave to bear his Gods company, telling me withall, that he had made a Vow long since to go this Pilgrimage. I was constrain'd to let him go. For had I not given him leave, I knew he would have taken it, by reason he had much acquaintance and kindred among the Rabble. About two months after, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd again to us to <hi>Surat,</hi> and because he had faithfully serv'd Monsieur <hi>Jardin</hi> and my self, we made no scruple to take him again. Asking him some questions about his Pilgrimage, he related to me this following passage: Six days after he left me, all the Pilgrims had made an account to go and lye at such a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, to which before they came they were to cross a River, that has but little Water in Summer, so that it is easily fordable. But when it rains in <hi>India,</hi> the Water falls with such a force, that it seems to be a perpendicular deluge; and in less than an hour or two, a small River shall swell three or four foot high. The Rains having overtaken those Pilgrims, the River was swell'd in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it was impossible to pass it that day. Now because it is not necessary for Travellers in <hi>India</hi> to carry provisions, especially for the Idolaters, who never eat any thing that ever had life; in regard that in the least Village you may meet with abundance of Rice, Meal, Butter, Milk Meats, Lentils, and other Pulse, besides Sugar, and Sweet-Meats, dry and moist. The people were very much surpriz'd, having no Victuals, when they came and saw the River swelPd. In short, they had nothing to give their Children to eat; which caus'd great lamentations among them. In this extremity the chiefest of their Priests fat himself down in the midst of them, and covering himself with a sheet, began to cry out that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106224:206"/>
they who would have any Victuals should come to him; when they came, he ask'd every one what they would have, whether Rice, or Meal, and for how many persons; and then lifting up the corner of the sheet, with a great Ladle he distributed to every one that which they asked for; so that the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of four thousand Souls was fully satisfi'd. My Servant did not only tell me this story, but going several times afterwards to <hi>Brampour,</hi> where I was known to the chief men in the City, I enquir'd of several, who swore to me by their <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> that it was truth. Though I am not bound to believe it.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-third, we arriv'd at <hi>Doupar,</hi> after we had travel'd eight leagues, and cross'd several Torrents.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-fourth, we travel'd four leagues, and came to <hi>Tripante;</hi> where there is a great Pagod upon a Hill, to which there is a circular ascent of Free-stone every way; the least Stone being ten foot long, and three broad: and there are several Figures of <hi>Damons</hi> in the Pagod. Among the rest, there is the Statue of <hi>Venus,</hi> standing upright, with several lascivious Figures about her; all which Figures are of one piece of Marble; but the Sculpture is very ordinary.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-fifth, we travel'd eight leagues, and came to <hi>Mamli.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The twenty-sixth, we travel'd eight leagues more, and came to lye at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The twenty-seventh, we travel'd not above three leagues, being to cross a wide River in Boats like Panniers; which usually takes up half the day; for when you come to the River side, there is neither Pannier nor any thing else to cross it. There was only one man, with whom we bargain'd for our passage; who to try whether our Money were good or no, made a great fire and threw it into the flame, as he does to all others that pass that way. If among the Roupies which he receives, he meets with any one that turns a little black, you must give him another, which he presently heats red hot; when he finds his Money to be good, he calls to his Companions to fetch the Manequin or Flasket-Boat, which lay hid before in some other part of the River. For these sort of people are so cunning, that if they descry any Passengers afar off, they will row their Mamequin to the other side, because they will not be constrain'd to carry any person over without Money. But the Money being paid, the man that receives it calls his Companions together, who take the Boat upon their Shoulders, and when they have launch'd it into the River, they fetch their Passengers and goods from the other side.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-eighth, having travel'd five leagues, they came to a place call'd <hi>Dabir-Pinta.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The twenty-ninth, after twelve hours travel, we came to lye at <hi>Holcora.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The thirtieth, we travel'd eight leagues, and came to spend our night at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridera.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first of <hi>October,</hi> after we had travel'd ten leagues, we came to lye at <hi>Atenara.</hi> This is a House of Pleasure, which the present King's Mother caus'd to be built. There are many Chambers in a great <hi>Piazza</hi> belonging to it, for the convenience of Travellers.</p>
                        <p>You must take notice, that in all the Countries where we travel'd, as well in the Kingdom of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> as the Kingdoms of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour,</hi> there are no Physicians, but such as attend Kings and Princes. As for the common people, after the Rains are fall'n, and that it is time to gather Herbs, you shall see every morning the good women of the Towns going into the Fields, to gather such Simples which they know to be proper for such Diseases as reign in the Family. Tis very true, that in great Cities there may be one or two men that have some common Receipts, who go every morning and sit in some known places, to give their Remedies to such as enquire for them, whether they be Potions or Plasters. First they feel their Pulses, and then giving them some remedy, for which they do not demand the value of six pence; they also at the same time mutter certain words between their teeth.</p>
                        <p>The second of <hi>October,</hi> we had but four leagues to travel before we came to <hi>Golconda.</hi> We went immediately to the Lodging of a young <hi>Dutch</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, belonging to the King, whom the Sieur <hi>Cheteur,</hi> Envoy from <hi>Batavia,</hi>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106224:206"/>
had left at <hi>Golconda</hi> upon the King's earnest entreaty. The King was always very much troubl'd with the head-ach: for which reason the Physitians had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that he should be let blood in four places under the tongue; but there was no person that would undertake to do it: for the Natives of the Countrey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand nothing of Chirurgery. Now before that <hi>Peter de Lan,</hi> for that was the <hi>Dutch-</hi>Chirurgion's name, was entertain'd in the King's service, he was ask'd whether he could let blood? To which he answer'd, that there was nothing so easy in Chirurgery. Some few days after the King sent for him, and gave him to understand that he was resolv'd to be let blood the next day in four parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tongue, as the Physitians had order'd, but he should take a care of not drawing away above eight ounces. <hi>De Lan</hi> returning the next day to Court, was lead into a Chamber by three Eunuchs, and four Old-women, who carri'd him to a Bath, and after they had undrest him, and wash'd him, especially his hands; they anointed him with Aromatick-drugs, and instead of his own <hi>European-</hi>Clothes, they brought him a Robe according to the fashion of the Countrey. After that, they brought him before the King; where he found four little Porringers of Gold, which the Physitians, who were present, had weigh'd. In short, he let the King blood under the tongue in four parts, and perform'd his business so well, that when the blood came to be weigh'd, it weigh'd but bare eight ounces. The King was so satisfi'd with the Operation, that he gave the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion three-hunder'd Pagods, which comes to almost seven-hunder'd Crowns. The Young-Queen and the Queen-Mother understanding what he had done, were resolv'd to be let-blood too. But I believe it was rather out of a curiosity to see the Chirurgion, than out of any necessity which they had to be let-blood. For he was a handsom young-man; and perhaps they had never seen a stranger neer at hand, for at a distance, it is no improbable thing, in regard the Women are shut up in such places where they may see, but not be seen. Upon this, <hi>de Lan</hi> was carri'd into a Chamber where the same Old-women that had waited on him before he let the King blood, stript up his arm, and wash'd it, but more especially his hands; which when they were dry, they rubb'd again with sweet-Oils as before. That being done, a Curtain was drawn, and the Queen stretching out her arm through a hole, was let-blood; as was the Queen-Mother afterwards in the same manner. The Queen gave him fifty Pagods, and the Queen-Mother thirty, with some pieces of Cloath of Gold.</p>
                        <p>Two days after we went to wait upon the <hi>Nahab</hi>'s Son, but were told we could not speak with him that day; the next day receiving the same answer, we were advertiz'd upon enquiry, that we might wait long enough in that manner; that he was a young Lord that never stirr'd from the King; or that if he did leave the Court, it was only to keep his Misses company in his own <hi>Haram.</hi> The young Chirurgion seeing us so delaid, offer'd to speak to the King's first Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, who was also of the King's Council, and who had testifi'd a great affection toward the <hi>Batavian-</hi>Envoy, and for <hi>de Lan</hi> himself; for which reason, he thought he might embrace an opportunity to do him a kindness. In short, <hi>de Lan</hi> had no sooner spoke to him, but he sent for us, and having, after much civility shewn us, inform'd himself of the cause of our coming, he desir'd us to shew him our Pearls, which we did the next day. After he had view'd them, he made us seal them up again in our own bags: for all that is presented to the King must be seal'd with the Merchants-Seal; and when the King has had a sight of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, it is seal'd up with his own Seal, to prevent any fraud, Thereupon we left the Pearls, so seal'd up, in his hands, who promis'd to shew them to the King, and to give us a good account of the trust we had put into his hands.</p>
                        <p>The next day about nine of the Clock before noon we went to the River to see how they wash the King's and the Great Noble-men's Elephants. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant goes up to the belly in the water, and lying down upon one side, with his trunk he throws the water several times upon that side which lies out of the water; and when he has soak'd himself sufficiently, the Master comes with a kind of a Pumice-stone, and rubbing the Elephant's-skin, cleanses it from all the filth that clings to it. Here some believe, that when this creature is once laid down, it cannot rise of its self; which is contrary to what I have seen. For
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106224:207"/>
when the Master has well-cleans'd the one side, he commands the Elephant to turn the other, which the beast immediately does; and when both sides are well-wash'd, he comes out of the River, and stays a-while upright upon the bank-side to dry himself. Then comes the Master with a pot full of some red or yellow colour, and streaks the beast in the forehead, about the eyes, upon the breast, and all behind, rubbing him afterwards with Oil of <hi>Coco's</hi> to strengthen the nerves; and some when all is done, he fastens a gilt-Plate upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</p>
                        <p>The fifteenth, the chief Physitian sent for us, and return'd us our bags again, seal'd with the King's Signet, wherewith his Majesty had seal'd them after he had look'd upon them. He demanded the price; which we told him: Whereupon, an Eunuch that stood by him, and wrote down every thing, wondring at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of the Pearls, told us that we took the King of <hi>Golconda</hi>'s Courtiers for persons that had neither knowledg nor judgment; and that he saw every day things of greater value brought to the King. I briskly retorted upon the Eunuch, that he vvas better skill'd in the price of a young Slave, than the value of a Jevvel; and so saying, vve put up our Pearls, and return'd to our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The next day vve set out from <hi>Golconda</hi> for <hi>Surat,</hi> in vvhich Road there is nothing considerable but vvhat I have already describ'd, only this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, that vve vvere not gone above five days journey from <hi>Golconda,</hi> but the King, vvho had not heard in tvvo days after vve vvere gone, vvhat I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted upon the Eunuch, sent four or five Horse-men after us vvith Orders, if they overtook us, to bring us back: but in regard vve vvere got one days journey into the Territories of the <hi>Mogul</hi> before one of the Horse-men over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us, (for the rest staid upon the Frontiers of the tvvo Kingdoms;) I, that knevv the humour of the Countrey very vvell, made ansvver for my self and Companion, that at that time our business vvould not permit us; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve begg'd in most humble manner his Majesty's pardon; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards I made my Companion allovv my reasons.</p>
                        <p>Being arriv'd at <hi>Surat, Monsieur de Jardin</hi> dy'd of an overflovving of choler: And I made a full account to have gone to <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Sha-jehan</hi> vvho then reign'd. But at the same instant the <hi>Nahab, Sha-Est-Kan,</hi> the King's Brother-in-Lavv, and Governor of the Province of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> sent one of the principal Officers of his House to me from <hi>Amadabat,</hi> to tell me he understood I had some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Jevvels to sell; for vvhich reason he vvould be glad to see me, and that he vvould pay me as much for them as the King should do. I receiv'd this Message vvhile <hi>Sieur de Jardin</hi> lay sick, and the ninth day after his death I got to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> and spake vvith the <hi>Nahab.</hi> Novv in regard he vvas a man that understood Jevvels perfectly vvell, vve presently came to an agreement: so that vve had no dispute together, but about the quality of the Coin to be paid. He allovv'd me tvvo sorts to choose, Roupies of Gold, or Roupies of Silver: but the Prince seeming to intimate to me that he should not be vvell-pleas'd to let such a Sum in Silver be seen to go out of his House, he vvish'd I vvould rather accept my payment in Roupies of Gold, that made not such a great heap. I consented to his desire; and he shew'd me very fair Gold, and many Roupies, that had not seen the Sun in a long time. But in regard the price currant of a Roupy of Gold, is not above fourteen Roupies of Silver, and for that he would have had me taken my Roupies at fourteen and a half, or at least for fourteen and a quarter, it had like to have spoil'd our bargain; for I gave him to understand, that in so large a sum, it would not quit cost to lose a fourth part in every Roupy of Gold. At length to please him, I was forc'd to take the Gold at fourteen Roupies of Silver and an eighth part. Thus a Prince otherwise magnificent and generous, yet in matter of buying and selling, would needs approve himself to be a good Husband. While I stay'd at <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabat,</hi> he sent me every day to my Lodging four Silver Plates of <hi>Pilaw,</hi> and other excellent Dyet; and one day that the King had sent him as many Apples as ten or twelve men could carry, he sent me as many as for their rarity at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> were worth three or four hundred Roupies. Besides all this, he gave me a compleat Habit of Honour, with a Sword and a Cangiar, worth a thousand Roupies; and resolving also to give me a Horse, he ask'd me what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106224:207"/>
kind of one I would have. I told him, since he was pleas'd to give me my choice, that I rather desir'd a young lively Horse, rather than an old one. Thereupon he sent me one that was so given to bounding and prancing, that he threw a young <hi>Hollander</hi> out of the Saddle; but upon my desire to have him chang'd, he sent me another, which I sold afterwards for four hundred Roupies.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Amadabat</hi> I return'd to <hi>Surat;</hi> from <hi>Surat</hi> I travel'd again to <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda,</hi> and thence to the Mine to buy Diamonds. From whence returning back for <hi>Surat,</hi> I resolv'd for <hi>Persia.</hi>

                        <p>BEing upon my return to <hi>Surat</hi> from the Diamond Mine, I understood that the War was proclaim'd between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the latter would send no more Ships into <hi>Persia.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> also gave out the same resolutions; for indeed they had sent four Ships into <hi>Persia,</hi> which they expected back every hour. While I was thus in fear of staying long in a place where I had no business, there arriv'd at <hi>Surat</hi> five great <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships from <hi>Batavia;</hi> three of which being rather Men of War, than Merchant-Men, were order'd to be unladen with all speed, with an intention to look out for the four <hi>English</hi> Vessels that were expected out of <hi>Persia.</hi> The other two were appointed to follow two or three days after, being in that time to take in provisions for the whole Fleet.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IHave written this History in such manner, as I knew things to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, during my stay in the Country; leaving it to the Reader to make his own reflections as he pleases; it being sufficient for me to make a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful description of the Potent Empire of the <hi>Moguls,</hi> according to the Observations I have taken upon the place.</p>
                        <p>This great and vast Empire, which contains the greatest part of <hi>Indolstan,</hi> and which extends from the Mountains on this side the River <hi>Indus,</hi> to the Mountains on the other side of <hi>Ganges;</hi> borders Eastward upon the Kingdoms of <hi>Aracan, Tipra,</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> Toward the West upon <hi>Persia,</hi> and the <hi>Usbeg Tartars.</hi> Southward upon the Kingdoms of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour.</hi> Northward it runs up as far as the Mountain <hi>Caucasus.</hi> North-Eastward the Kingdom of <hi>Bantam,</hi> whence comes our Musk, parts it. North-Westward it borders upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Chegathay,</hi> or the <hi>Usbegs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are call'd <hi>Moguls,</hi> that is, white of complexion; for the last Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Indies</hi> were Whites; the Natives being all Brown, or Olive-colour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aureng-zeg,</hi> the present Emperor, is the eleventh in a direct line, of the Descendants from the great <hi>Temur-Leng,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Tamerlane;</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and renown of whose Conquests, from <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Poland,</hi> has exceeded all the actions of the greatest Captains of the former Ages. His Successors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Conquest of all <hi>India</hi> between the two Rivers, with the destruction of several Kings. So that <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> has at this time under his Dominion, the Territories of <hi>Gouzerat, Decan-Dehly, Multan, Lahor, Kashemire, Bengala,</hi> and many other Territories; not to mention several <hi>Raja's,</hi> or petty Kings, who pay him Tribute, and are his Vassals. The Succession of the Kings of <hi>India</hi> is as follows:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Termur-Leng,</hi> that is to say, the Lame, because one of his Legs was shorter than the other, lyes buried at <hi>Samarchand,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Chegathay,</hi> or the <hi>Usbeg Tartars,</hi> being the place of his Nativity.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Sickness and suppos'd Death of <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> King of <hi>India,</hi> and the Rebellion of the Princes his Sons.</head>
                        <p>THis great King had reign'd above forty years, not so much as a King over his Subjects, but rather as a Father over his Family and Children. Insomuch, that during his Reign there was such a strictness in the Civil Government, and particularly for the security of the High-ways, that there was never any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to put any man to death for Robbery. In his declining years he fanci'd a young Lady of an extraordinary Beauty, that was not above thirteen years of age; and because the strength of nature would not permit him to satisfie his passion; he took certain provocative's, which were so hot, that he fell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon into a distemper that had almost kill'd him. This oblig'd him to shut himself up in his <hi>Haram,</hi> together with his Women, for two or three months; during which time he appear'd very rarely to the people, and that at a great distance too, which made them believe he was dead. For they are oblig'd by Custom to shew themselves to the people three times in a week, or in fifteen days at most.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cha-Jehan</hi> had six Children, four Sons and two Daughters. The Name of the eldest was <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> the second was call'd <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> the third <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> and the fourth <hi>Morad-Bakche.</hi> The eldest of his two Daughters was call'd <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> and the name of the second was <hi>Rauchenara Begum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> lov'd all his four Sons alike, and had made them Governours or Vice-Roys of four of his principal Provinces or Kingdoms. <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> who was the eldest, stay'd with his Father in <hi>Dehly,</hi> and had the Government of the Kingdom of <hi>Sandi,</hi> into which he put a Deputy. <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> had for his share the Government of <hi>Bengala. Aureng-zeb</hi> was Vice-Roy of the Kingdom of <hi>Decan;</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Guzerat.</hi> But though <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> endeavour'd to give equal content to his four Sons, their Ambition was not satisfi'd with this division, but ruin'd all the good designs which so kind a Father had lay'd to preserve peace among his Children.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> being thus sick, and retir'd into the Womens quarter, without shewing himself for many days; the report ran that he was dead, and that <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> conceal'd his death, to gain time to provide for himself, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Empire: True it is, that the King believing he should dye, commanded <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> to call together all the <hi>Omrahs</hi> or Lords, and to seat himself upon the Throne, which belong'd to him, as the eldest of his Brothers. He also testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd the desire he had to see him quietly setled in the peaceable possession of the Empire. And this intention of his was look'd upon as the more just, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the other three Brothers had been for some time observ'd to have less respect for their Father, than <hi>Dara-Cha. Dara-Cha,</hi> who honour'd and respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King with a real tenderness, made answer to the King, that he desir'd of Heaven nothing more than the preservation of his Majesties life, and that so long as Heaven should continue that preservation, he should take it to be a greater honour to continue himself a Subject, than to ascend the Throne. And indeed he was never absent from his Father, that he might be the better able to serve him in his sickness; and because he would be present upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106224:209"/>
he lay by his Fathers Bed-side, upon a Tapestry spread upon the ground.</p>
                        <p>During the false report of the death of <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> his three other Sons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rebell'd, every one laying claim to their Fathers Crown. <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> the youngest, who had the Government of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> sent away Forces immediately to besiege <hi>Surat,</hi> the most considerable Port, and most frequented of any other all over <hi>India.</hi> The City made no resistance, for the Walls are very weak, and broken down in several places. But they defended the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, where the Treasure was, very stoutly; though the young Ambitious Prince did all he could to make himself Master of it. <hi>Chabas-Kan,</hi> one of his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, who was General of his Army, an industrious and active person, and who carri'd on the Siege with all the experience of an old Captain; when he saw he could not carry the Castle by main force, caus'd it to be undermin'd in two places, by the assistance of an <hi>European</hi> Engineer, which took effect; so that upon the twenty-ninth of <hi>December,</hi> 1659, he threw down a good part of the Walls, and fill'd up the Moat; which very much terrifi'd the besieg'd. But they presently recover'd their courage, and though they were but a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they defended themselves for above forty days, to the great dammage and slaughter of <hi>Morat-Bakche's</hi> Army. <hi>Chabas-Kan,</hi> provok'd at such a vigorous resistance, sought for all the Wives and Children, Parents and Kindred of the Canoneers that were within the Castle, to place them at the head of his men, when they made their approaches. He also sent one of the Brothers of the Governor of the place, to offer him advantageous conditions. But the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, being a very loyal person, and uncertain of the Kings death, rejected all his offers. The Eunuch perceiving the Resolution of the Governour, threaten'd the besieged to kill all their Wives and Children, Parents and Kindred, if they did not surrender the place the next day. But neither did any of those consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations prevail, till at length the breach being made wider, and the number of defendants decreasing, the Governor surrender'd upon honourable conditions; which were punctually perform'd by <hi>Chabas-Kan,</hi> who seiz'd upon all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and carried it to <hi>Amadabat;</hi> where <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> was busily employ'd in squeezing the people to get Money.</p>
                        <p>The news of the taking <hi>Surat</hi> being brought to this Prince, he presently provided himself a Throne, and sitting upon it on the day which was appointed for the Ceremony, he caus'd himself to be declared King, not only of <hi>Guze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> but of all the Dominions of <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> his Father. At the same time he also coin'd Money, and sent new Governors into all the Cities. But his tottering Throne, not being well fix'd, fell soon to the Ground; and the youngest of all the Brothers, for having usurp'd a Scepter that no ways appertain'd to him, was confin'd to a severe imprisonment. Prince <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> fain would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd <hi>Surat;</hi> but it was impossible. For besides that he was busied in the assistance of his Father the King, his second Brother <hi>Sultan-Sujah,</hi> more powerful than <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> found him far more work to do. He was already advanc'd into the Kingdom of <hi>Lahor,</hi> having absolutely reduc'd the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala.</hi> All that <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> could do, was to send <hi>Soliman Checour</hi> his eldest Son, with an Army against <hi>Sultan Sujah.</hi> The young Prince having defeated his Uncle, and driven him back into <hi>Bengala,</hi> the Frontiers whereof he secur'd with good Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, return'd to <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> his Father. In the mean time <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd for King in the Kingdom of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> bends all his Force and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to make himself Emperor of the <hi>Indies,</hi> to destroy his Brothers, and to fix his Throne either in <hi>Agra</hi> or <hi>Jehanabat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whiles these things pass'd, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> as ambitious, but more crafty than his Brothers, lets them alone to kindle the first Fires; and conceals his own designs, which afterwards appear'd so much to the damage of the rest. At first he feign'd to lay no claim to the Empire, but liv'd a private life, like a <hi>Dervich,</hi> or Religious Hermit. And the better to act his part, he declar'd to his younger Brother <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> whom he saw to be so ambitious, how willing he should be to assist him in his designs; telling him, that because he merited the Empire by his Valour, he would aid him with his Money and his Forces to overthrow <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> who only stood in his way. The young Prince, blinded with the hopes of his good Fortune, easily believ'd <hi>Aureng-zeb.</hi> And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106224:210"/>
so joining Forces together, he advances towards <hi>Agra,</hi> to make himself Master of that City. <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> marches to meet them; but the Battel was as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently manag'd by him, as fortunately fought by his Brothers. For <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> confiding too much in the principal Officers of his Army, against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his General, who was his chief Minister of State, and faithful to him; thought himself sure of the Victory, by falling on before his Brothers had time to repose themselves. The first onset was very rude and bloody, where <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> full of fire and courage, fighting like a Lyon, was shot with five Arrows into the body. The Victory leaning to <hi>Dara-Cha, Aureng-zeb</hi> retreated; but soon turn'd head again, when he saw those Traytors advancing to his aid, who were in the Army of <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> and who had treacherously deserted him, after he had lost his best Officers and his General. With this assistance <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeb</hi> renews the fight against <hi>Dara-Cha;</hi> who seeing himself betray'd, and unable to maintain the fight with the small number of men which he had left, retreats to <hi>Agra,</hi> where the King his Father was, who began to mend. The King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd his Son to retire to the Fortress of <hi>Dehly,</hi> and to carry the Treasure that was in <hi>Agra</hi> with him; which he did without delay. Thus the Victory fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> and <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> who before the end of the Battel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weaken'd with the loss of blood, was forc'd to retire to his Tent, to have his wounds drest. Now it was an easie thing for <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> to gain those Traytors, as well by reason of the vast Treasures which he had, as also for that the <hi>Indians</hi> are very inconstant, and want generosity. Besides, the Commanders are generally Fugitive <hi>Persians,</hi> persons of little worth, who are altogether for them that give most. <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> who was Uncle to these four Princes, whose Mother was the King's Sister, went over to <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> with the greatest part of the principal Commanders that had adher'd to <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> and <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> and had forsaken their Masters. <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> then began to see his Error in having trusted <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> who seeing himself favour'd by Fortune, lost no time to accomplish his ends. Thereupon <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> sends to his Brother for the half of the Treasure that he had seiz'd, that he might retire to <hi>Guzerat.</hi> But <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> for answer assur'd him, that he had no other design than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the Throne, to which purpose he desir'd to confer with him by word of mouth. <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> in order to that, finding himself indifferently well recover'd of his wounds, goes to visit his Brother, who kindly welcom'd him, extoll'd his courage, and told him he deserv'd the best Empire of the world. The young Prince was charm'd by the melody of such sweet language, while his Eunuch, <hi>Shabas-Kan,</hi> did all he could to make him sensible of the snares that were laid for him. But when <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> should have taken the Eunuchs advice, it was too late; for <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> had already laid his plot to destroy him. He invites <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> to a Feast; and the more the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses himself, the more the other presses him to come. The young Prince perceiving he would take no denial, resolv'd to go, for fear of discovering the mistrust he had, although he verily believ'd that that day would be the last of his life, and that some deadly poyson was brew'd for him. However, he was deceiv'd in that particular, for <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> not aiming at his life then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himself only to deprive him of his liberty, and so instead of advancing him to the Throne, sent him away, to be safely kept in the Castle of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeor.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Imprisonment of <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> and how he was punish'd by <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> his third Son, for the injustice he had done Prince <hi>Boulaki</hi> his Nephew, the Grandchild of <hi>Gehan-guir,</hi> to whom, as to the Son of the Eldest Son, the Empire of the <hi>Moguls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>GEhan-guir,</hi> King of <hi>India,</hi> Son of <hi>Achbar,</hi> and Grandchild to <hi>Houmajon,</hi> reign'd very peaceably during the space of twenty-three years, equally belov'd both by his Subjects and Neighbours. But his life seem'd too long to his two Sons, who were both ambitious to reign. The eldest rais'd a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army near <hi>Lahor,</hi> with an intention to have surpriz'd his Father, and to have possess'd himself of the Throne by force. The King incens'd at the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his Son, resolv'd to chastise him; meets him with a considerable Army, defeats him, and takes him Prisoner, with many of the most considerable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that adher'd to him. After which, out of a natural affection to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he sav'd his life, but put out his Eyes. And when he was blind he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept him about his person, with an intention to have prefer'd his eldest Son <hi>Boulaki</hi> to the Crown, whose Father had already many Sons, but all very young. But <hi>Sultan Courom,</hi> his second Son, believing it his right to be prefer'd before a Nephew, resolv'd to leave no stone unturn'd to remove him from his hopes, and to settle himself in possession before the death of his Father. However he conceal'd his intentions from him, appearing outwardly very obedient to his Father, who always kept about him the Children of his eldest Son. By that submission he more easily brought about his designs; for having by that means gain'd the good will of his Father, he obtain'd leave to carry along with him the blind Prince, his eldest Brother, to his Government of the Kingdom <hi>Decan.</hi> He laid before his Father, that it would be far better to remove from his sight, an object that could not chuse but be so afflicting to him; and that the Prince himself, being blind, would spend the rest of his days more comfortably in <hi>Decan,</hi> where he might be more retir'd. The King not penetrating into his design, readily consented to his request. Who when he had that poor Prince in his Clutches, made him away with that secresie which was not to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; and under the most plausible pretence imaginable, to conceal him from the eyes of men.</p>
                        <p>After the death of the blind Prince, <hi>Sultan Courom</hi> took upon him the name of <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> that is, King of the World; and to uphold his Title, he rais'd an Army to finish what his Brother had begun, which was to dethrone his Father, and to take possession of the Empire. The King incens'd as well at the death of his Son, as at the attempt against his own person, sent a considerable Army to chastise <hi>Courom</hi> for so bold an Enterprize. But the rebellious Prince finding himself too weak to stand his Fathers force, quitted the Kingdom of <hi>Decan,</hi> and with certain Vagabonds that follow'd him, wander'd from place to place, till he came to <hi>Bengala,</hi> where he rais'd an Army with an intention to give the King Battel. To which purpose, passing the <hi>Ganges,</hi> he marches directly toward the Kingdom of <hi>Lahor;</hi> whom the King in person met, with an Army much more numerous and stronger than his. But <hi>Gehan-guir</hi> being old, and wearied with the troubles that his Sons had put him to, dy'd by the way, leaving <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> at liberty to pursue his own designs. However before he expir'd, the good King had time to recommend his Grandchild <hi>Boulaki</hi> to <hi>Asouf-Kan,</hi> his Generalissimo and prime Minister of State, who was Protector of the Empire. He commanded also all the Officers of the Army to acknowledg him for King, as being the lawful Heir; declaring <hi>Sultan Komrom</hi> a Rebel, and incapable of the Succession. Moreover he made <hi>Asouf-Kan</hi> to swear in particular, that he would never suffer <hi>Boulaki</hi> to be put to death, which way soever affairs went; which <hi>Asouf-Kan</hi> sware upon his Thigh; and as religiously observ'd as to the Article of not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106224:211"/>
putting him to death; but not as to that of helping him to the Crown, which he design'd for <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> who had married his eldest Daughter, the Mother of four Princes, and two Princesses.</p>
                        <p>The news of the Kings death being known at Court, caus'd a general la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. And presently all the Grandees of the Kingdom set themselves to execute the Kings Will and Testament, acknowledging <hi>Sultan Boulaki</hi> for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who was very young. That Prince had two Cousin-Germans, who were both of them by the Kings consent turn'd Christians, and made publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof. Those two young Princes, being very apprehensive, perceiv'd that <hi>Asouf-Kan,</hi> Father-in-Law to <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> and Father of <hi>Cha-Est-Kan,</hi> had no good intentions toward the young King, and gave him notice of it; which cost them their lives, and the King the loss of his Dominions. For the young King, having no more with than was agreeable to his age, openly declar'd to <hi>Asouf-Kan</hi> what his Cousins had reveal'd to him in private, and ask'd the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral whether it were true, that he had a design to set up his Uncle against him or no. <hi>Asuof-Kan</hi> immediately accus'd the Reporters of salsity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and protested his fidelity to his King, and vow'd to spend the last drop of his blood to preserve him in the possession of the Empire. However seeing his Conspiracy discover'd, he resolv'd to prevent the punishment; to which end having got the two Princes into his possession, he put them both to death. But before that, in regard of his power in the Army and in the Empire, he had already brought over to <hi>Cha-jehans</hi> party the greatest part of the Commanders and Lords of the Court; and the better to play his game, and deceive the young King, he rais'd a report that <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> was dead; and because he had desir'd to be buried near his Father <hi>Gehan-guir,</hi> the body was to be brought to <hi>Agra.</hi> This Stratagem being cunningly manag'd, <hi>Asouf-Kan</hi> himself gave advice of the feign'd death to the King; telling the King withall, that it would be but a common civility for him to go and meet the Corps when it came within a League or two of the City, being an Honour due to a Prince of the Blood of the <hi>Moguls.</hi> All this while <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> kept himself <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi> till coming within sight of the Army that lay about <hi>Agra,</hi> he caus'd himself to be put into a Coffin, wherein there was only a hole left for him to breath at. This Coffin being carri'd under a moving Tent, all the principal Officers who were of the plot with <hi>Asouf-Kan,</hi> came to perform the usual Ceremonies of State to the body of the deceas'd Prince, while the young King was upon the way to meet the body. But then <hi>Asouf-Kan</hi> finding it seasonable to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his design, caus'd the Coffin to be open'd, and <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> rising up, and shewing himself to the eyes of all the Army, was saluted Emperor by all the Generals and other principal Officers, who had their Cue ready; so that the name of <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> running in a moment from one mans mouth to another, the Acclamation became publick, and the Empire was setled upon him. The young King hearing the news by the way, was so surpriz'd, that he thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but how to save himself by flight, being upon a sudden forsaken by all his followers. And <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> not believing it any way necessary to pursue him, suffer'd him to wander a long time in <hi>India</hi> like a <hi>Fakir.</hi> At length he retir'd into <hi>Persia,</hi> where he was magnificently receiv'd by <hi>Cha-Sefi,</hi> who allow'd him a pension fit for so great a Prince, which he still enjoys.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> having thus usurp'd the Crown, the better to secure himself, and to stifle all Factions that might arise during the life of the lawful Prince, whom he had so unjustly despoiled of his right, by degrees put to death all those that had shew'n any kindness to his Nephew. So that the first part of his Reign was noted for many acts of cruelty, that blemish'd his reputation. No less unfortunate was the end of his Reign. For as he had unjustly depriv'd the lawful Heir, of the Empire which belong'd to him; he was himself, while he yet liv'd, depriv'd of his Crown by <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> his own Son, who kept him Prisoner in the Fortress of <hi>Agra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For after <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> had lost the Battel against his two Brothers, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> and <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Samonguir,</hi> and was treacherously abandoned by the principal Officers of the Army, he retir'd into the Kingdom of <hi>Lahor,</hi> with all the Treasure which the confusion of his affairs would suffer him to get together. In
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106224:211"/>
the King to resist the violence of his victorious Sons, shut himself up in the Castle of <hi>Agra,</hi> to the end he might not be surpriz'd, but have time and leisure to observe how far the insolence of his children would transport them. As for <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> who had <hi>Morat Bakche</hi> safe enough, he enters <hi>Agra,</hi> feigning to believe a report that <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> was dead, that he might have liberty to get into the Fortress, where he said one of the <hi>Omra's</hi> would make it out. The more he reported the death of <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> the more did the King endeavour to let the people know he was alive. But finding both Power and Fortune had taken <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s party; and being also in great necessity for want of water, he sent <hi>Fazel-Kan,</hi> grand Master of his Houshold, to assure his Son that he was alive; and withal to tell him that it was the King's command, that he should retire to his Vice-Roy-ship in <hi>Decan,</hi> without putting him to any more vexation, and that upon his obedience, he would forgive whatever had past. <hi>Aurengzeb,</hi> firm in his resolution, return'd for answer to <hi>Fazel-Kan,</hi> that he was certain that the King his Father was dead, and that upon that account he had only taken Arms to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Crown to himself, which he thought he deserv'd, as well as the rest of his Brothers. That if his Father were living, he had too great a respect for him to undertake the least enterprize that should displease him; and therefore that he might be certain he was not dead, he desir'd to see him, and to kiss his feet; and having so done, he would retire to his Government, and punctually obey his Commands. <hi>Fazel-Kan</hi> return'd this answer to the King, who declar'd that he should be glad to see his Son, and sent back <hi>Fazel-Kan,</hi> to tell him he should be welcome. But <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> more cunning than <hi>Cha-jehan;</hi> assur'd <hi>Fazel-Kan</hi> that he would not set his foot in the Castle, till the Garrison that was in it should be sent away to make room for his men. For the Prince was afraid, and not without reason, if he should adventure into a Fortress where he was not absolute Master himself, lest they should seize his person, of which the King being apprehensive, consented to his proposal, not being able to do better at that time. Thereupon the Garrison which belong'd to <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> was sent out of the Castle, and another of <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s enter'd, commanded by <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> the eldest of his Sons, to whom he gave order to secure his Father's person. When they were thus got in, and his Father safe, he delaid seeing his Father from day to day, waiting (as he gave ou t for excuse) a kind opportunity for the enterview; and pretending his Astrologers did not presently think it seasonable, he retir'd into the Countrey, to a House about two or three leagues from <hi>Agra,</hi> which very much displeased the people, who waited every day for the fortunate hour, from which they expected a conclusion of their miseries by the Father and Son's discourse together. But <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> who was in no great hast to see his Father, took up another resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to seize upon all his Fathers treasure, which <hi>Dara-Sha</hi> had not time to carry away. He also shut up in the same Fortress <hi>Begum-Saheb</hi> his Sister, to keep the King company, by whom she was entirely belov'd: and took into his own hands all the wealth she had got, by her Father's liberality.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> enrag'd to see himself us'd in that manner by his own Son, made an attempt to escape, and kill'd some of the Guards that oppos'd him; which caus'd <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> more strictly to confine him. In the mean time it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing to see that not one of the Servants of so great a King so much as offer'd to help him; that all his Subjects should forsake him, and turn their eyes upon the rising-Sun; acknowledging only <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> for King, while they seem'd to have forgotten <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> though still alive. Thus this great Monarch sadly ended his days in Prison, and dy'd in the Fortress of <hi>Agra</hi> in the year 1666 the last time that I was in <hi>India.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>During his Reign he had begun to build the City of <hi>Jehanabad,</hi> though he had not quite finish'd it, and therefore he desir'd to see it once more before he dy'd; but <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> would not give him leave, unless he would be content to go and come back by water, or else to be confin'd to the Castle of <hi>Jehanabad,</hi> as he was at <hi>Agra,</hi> which refusal of his Son did so torment him, that it hasten'd his end. Which as soon as <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> heard of, he came to <hi>Agra,</hi> and seiz'd upon all the Jewels, whick he had not taken from his Father while he liv'd. <hi>Begum-Saheb</hi> had also a quantity of Jewels, which he had not taken from her when he put her into the Castle. But now, because she had formerly taken her Father's part, he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106224:212"/>
found out a way to deprive her of them after a very plausible manner; making a shew of bestowing very great Honours and Caresses upon his Sister, and taking her along with him to <hi>Jehanabad.</hi> But in a short time after we heard the news of her death; which prov'd, and all people suspected her to have been poison'd.</p>

                           <hi>DAra-cha</hi> having carri'd along with him the best part of the Gold and Silver which was in the Fortress of <hi>Agra</hi> by his Father's advice, and being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of <hi>Lahor,</hi> was in good hopes to have rais'd an Army in a short time to have stopt the proceedings of his Brother. His most faithful Servants and Friends had always accompani'd him in his misfortune. And as for his Eldest Son, <hi>Soliman Shekour,</hi> he went, with the <hi>Raja Roup,</hi> into the Territories of that <hi>Raja</hi>'s own demeans, to levy men; carrying along with him five-millions of Roupies, which make of our Money seven-millions and 500000 Livres. But that great Sum opening the <hi>Raja Roup</hi>'s eyes, he most treacherously and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously seiz'd upon it; whereupon <hi>Soliman Chekour,</hi> fearing he should proceed farther, and make some attempt upon his person, fled in all hast into the Kingdom of <hi>Sireneguer,</hi> under the protection of the <hi>Raja Nakti-Rani,</hi> who more foully and basely deliver'd him up sometime after to <hi>Aureng-zeb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dara-cha</hi> having notice of the <hi>Raja Roup</hi>'s treason, and seeing all his friends had forsook him, and were revolted to <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> quitted <hi>Lahor,</hi> and retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of <hi>Scindi.</hi> Before he left the Fortress, he sent all the Gold, Silver, Jewels and Wealth that was in the Fort, away by water to <hi>Baker,</hi> a Fort in the midst of the River <hi>Indus.</hi> To guard all that Wealth, he lest an Eunuch, and six-thousand men, with all provisions necessary for a Siege; after that he went to <hi>Scindi,</hi> where he left several great pieces of Cannon. Then he march'd through the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Kachnagana,</hi> who made him mountainous promises to no effect; then he came into the Kingdom of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> where the people receiv'd him as their lawful King and Heir to <hi>Cha-jehan.</hi> He sent his Orders to all the Cities, and particularly to <hi>Surat,</hi> where he appointed a Governor; but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Fortress, who was left there by <hi>Morat-Bakche,</hi> refus'd to submit to <hi>Dara-cha,</hi> so that he was forc'd to let him alone.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Dara-cha</hi> receiv'd news at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> that <hi>Jessomseing,</hi> one of the most potent <hi>Raja</hi>'s in all <hi>India,</hi> was fall'n off from <hi>Aureng-zeb.</hi> The same <hi>Raja</hi> also solicits him to advance with his Army. <hi>Dara-cha</hi> confiding in his words, follow'd his counsel, and march'd to <hi>Emir,</hi> which was the place of Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz appointed. But <hi>Raja Jessomseing</hi> being regain'd by the perswasions of <hi>Raja Jesseing,</hi> more potent than himself, to favour <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> never met according to his promise; nor did he come till the last push; and then only with a design to betray the poor Prince. Thus the two Brothers meeting, they came to a Battel which lasted three days: but in the heat of all the Fight, <hi>Jessomseing</hi> shewing an apparent treachery, went over to <hi>Aureng-zeb;</hi> upon which <hi>Dara-cha</hi>'s Souldiers immediately fled. <hi>Dara-cha</hi> having thus lost all his hopes, and finding Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all his expectations, fled away likewise with his Wives, some of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his most faithful Servants, in an equipage that drew compassion. But coming to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> the Governor having declar'd for <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> deni'd him entrance. Thereupon he discamp'd in the middle of the night, and took the road for <hi>Scindi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He arriv'd at <hi>Scindi,</hi> with an intention to pass into <hi>Persia,</hi> where <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> the Second expected him with a magnificent Retinue, and a resolution to have assisted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106224:212"/>
him with Men and Money. But not daring to trust himself by Sea; as he pass'd through the Countrey of the <hi>Patanes,</hi> in the way to <hi>Candahar,</hi> he was unworthily betraid by one of the Lords of the Countrey, call'd <hi>Gion-Kan;</hi> who had been an Officer under the King his Father, and who having been condemn'd for his crimes by the mouth of his Father, and ready to be thrown under the Elephant's-feet, had been pardon'd at the intercession of <hi>Dara-cha.</hi> For an addition to his affliction, before he came to <hi>Gion-Kan</hi>'s House, he receiv'd the news of the death of that particular Wife which he lov'd most entirely, and which had always accompani'd him in his misfortunes. He understood that she dy'd through heat and drowth, not being able to get a drop of water in the Countrey to refresh her thirst. The Prince was so mov'd at the news, that he fell down, like one that had been struck quite dead; and when he came to himself, he tore his clothes in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his grief: an ancient custom still continu'd in the East. He had always shew'd himself insensible upon all other occasions of misfortune, but this fatal stroke so deeply pierc'd him, that he would receive no consolation from his friends. After this, he clad himself according to his misfortune; and instead of a Turbant, he only put about his head a piece of coarse Calicut. In this miserable equipage he enter'd into the House of the Traytor <hi>Gion-Kan,</hi> where being laid down to rest himself upon a Field-bed, a new subject of sorrow awak'd him. For <hi>Gion-Kan</hi> having a design to seize <hi>Sepper-Shekour, Dara-cha</hi>'s second Son, the young Prince, though but a Youth, made a bold resistance, and with his Bow and Arrows laid three men upon the ground; but not being able to resist a multitude, he was at length taken. <hi>Dara-cha</hi> waken'd with the noise, saw before his eyes his Son, whom they were leading toward him, with his hands ty'd behind him. Then the miserable Father of the young Prince, no longer misdoubting the horrid treason of <hi>Gion-Kan,</hi> could not refrain from letting fall in his passion these expressions. <hi>Finish,</hi> said he, <hi>ingrateful and infamous Villain as thou art, finish the work thou hast begun; we are become Victims to bad Fortune, and</hi> Aureng-zeb<hi>'s unjust Ambition. But remember that I only deserve death for having sav'd thy life: for never Prince of the Royal Blood had his hands ty'd behind him before. Gion-Kan</hi> in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure mov'd at these words, caus'd the little Prince to be unbound, and only set guards upon <hi>Dara-oha</hi> and his Son. At the same time he also sent expresses to <hi>Raja Jessomseing,</hi> and to <hi>Abdulla-Kan,</hi> to give them advice that he had selz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dara-cha</hi> and his Train. Thereupon they made hast to share in the spoils of that poor Prince. But they could not be so swift, but that <hi>Gion-Kan</hi> had seiz'd upon all that <hi>Dara-cha</hi> had of most precious in the World; using as inhumanly both his Wives and his Children. The <hi>Raja</hi> and <hi>Abdulla</hi> being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, provided Elephants for the Prince, his Son, and his Wives, and carri'd them away immedlately to <hi>Jehanabat;</hi> the people crowded to behold them, every one being desirous to see the Prince whom they so earnestly desir'd to have had for their King. <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> caused them to be shewn in all the Streets and Market-places of <hi>Jehanabat,</hi> that no man might question hereafter their being taken; and as if he had glori'd in his treachery toward his Brother, he presently condemn'd and sent him away to the Castle of <hi>Asser.</hi> But of all that crowded to behold, not one would stir to assist or succour their lawful Prince. Only some few generous Souldiers who had serv'd him, and had receiv'd some kindnesses from him, seeing themselves not able to deliver their Prince, yet desirous to shew him some proofs of their acknowledgment, fell with all their fury upon the Traitor <hi>Gion-Kan,</hi> who though he were rescu'd from them at that time, yet soon after met with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due to his crime; for he was kill'd as he was crossing a Wood in his return home.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> like a good Polititian, and an extraordinary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler, gave it out, that it was by no order of his that <hi>Dara-cha</hi> was seiz'd; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he desir'd him to retire out of the Kingdom, which he refusing to do, <hi>Gion-Kan,</hi> unknown to him, had unworthily seiz'd his person; and without respect to the Royal-Blood, had shamefully ty'd the hands of the young <hi>Sepper-Shekour</hi> behind him: which being a crime and an indignity done to his Majesty, had been punish'd, by the death of <hi>Gion-Kan</hi> and his accomplices. But this was only publish'd to abuse the people; for had it been true, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> would never have given order to have his Brother's head cut off.</p>

                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106224:213"/>
For <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> being sent from <hi>Jehanabat</hi> with a Guard to the place of his imprisonment; when he came to a fair place where he thought to repose him self, they dress'd up the Tent where he was to leave his Head. After he had eaten, <hi>Seif-Kan</hi> came and brought him the sentence of his Death. <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> seeing him enter, told him he was very welcome, and that he was glad to see one of his most faithful Servants. <hi>Seif-Kan</hi> made answer, that indeed he had formerly been one of his Servants, but that now he was the Slave of <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeb,</hi> who had commanded him to bring him his Head. Must I dye then? said <hi>Dara-Cha.</hi> 'Tis the Kings command, reply'd <hi>Seif-Kan,</hi> and I am entrusted to execute it. <hi>Sepper-Chekour,</hi> who lay in an anti-Chamber of the Tent, waking upon this contest, would have seiz'd upon certain weapons which had been taken from him, with an intention to have assisted his Father; but he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by those that accompany'd <hi>Seif-Kan. Dara-Cha</hi> would have made some resistance himself, but seeing it was in vain, he only desir'd time for his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was granted him. In the mean time <hi>Sepper-Chekour</hi> was taken from him; and while they held him a story, a Slave took off <hi>Dara-Cha</hi>'s. Head, which was carried to <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> by <hi>Seif-Kan.</hi> This bloody Tragedy being thus acted, <hi>Sepper-Chekour</hi> was sent to the Castle of <hi>Goualeor,</hi> to keep his Uncle <hi>Morat-Bakche</hi> company. As for the Wives and Daughters of <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> they were allotted an Apartment in <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s <hi>Haram.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> caus'd himself to be declar'd King; and of the Flight of <hi>Sultan Sujah.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>AS it is the custom at the performance of that Ceremony, for the new King to seat himself upon the Throne; there was not much time requir'd to prepare one, in regard that <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> before his imprisonment had finish'd that which the Great <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had begun; which was the richest and most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent that ever was seen. But as the Grand <hi>Cadi</hi> of the Empire, and Chief of the Law was to Proclaim the new King, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> found himself oppos'd by him. For the <hi>Cadi</hi> told him, that the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equally forbad him to declare him King, while his Father liv'd; besides, that he had put his elder Brother to death, to whom the Empire belong'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Cha-fehan</hi> their Father. This stout resistance of the <hi>Cadi</hi> did not a little perplex <hi>Aureng-zeb;</hi> and therefore that he might not seem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear irreligious, he call'd all the Doctors of the Law together, to whom he represented the incapacity of his Father to govern, through age and many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that troubled him; as for <hi>Dara-Cha</hi> his Brother, he had put him to death, because he was a slighter of the Law, drank Wine, and favour'd Infidels. Those reasons, intermix'd with threats, caus'd his Council of Conscience to conclude, that he deserv'd the Empire, and ought to be proclaim'd King; though the <hi>Cadi</hi> obstinately persisted in his first resolution. There was no other remedy therefore, but to remove him from his employment, as a disturber of the publick peace, and to chuse another for the Honour of the Law, and the Good of the Kingdom. The person who was elected by the Council was soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by <hi>Aureng-zeb;</hi> in acknowledgment whereof, he proclaim'd him King the twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> 1660. This Proclamation being made in the <hi>Mosquee, Aureng-zeb</hi> seated himself upon the Throne, and receiv'd the Homages of all the Grandees of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>However, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> did not think his Throne fast enough, nor himself se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the Empire, so long as <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> was raising a powerful Army in <hi>Bengala</hi> to release his Father. Thereupon he sent a considerable Force against him, under the Command of <hi>Sultan Mahomed</hi> his eldest Son; to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his Lieutenant the <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> one of the greatest Captains that ever came out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>India.</hi> His great Conduct and Courage had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him a person to be reverenc'd by all posterity, had he been faithful to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106224:213"/>
the Princes whom he serv'd. But first he betray'd the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he advanc'd his Fortune; and next to him <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> under whose protection he rose so high, that there was not a Nobleman in all <hi>India</hi> more powerful or richer than he. Otherwise he is both belov'd and fear'd by the Soldiers, and perfectly understands the Art of War, according to the custom of the Country. The two Armies engaging several times, the Victory was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the one side, and sometimes on the other; so that <hi>Sultan Mahomed</hi> finding it likely ro be a tedious War, assisted by the Counsels of his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, resolv'd to add policy to strength. Thereupon he treats underhand with the Officers of his Uncle's Army, makes them magnificent promises, and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sollicites them to come over to <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s party, whom he call'd the Pillar and Protector of <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Law, that he gain'd the principal, to whom he sent considerable Presents, to confirm them in their resolutions. This was a mortal blow to <hi>Sultan-Sujah,</hi> against which he could not provide. For they that adhear'd to him being a mercenary generation, that serves whoever gives most, finding they had little more to expect from a Prince whose Exchequer was empty, resolv'd to drive a Trade with <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> who was Master of all the Treasure in the Kingdom. And thus did <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> debauch the Army of his Brother, who in the last Battel, seeing himself abandon'd by all his Soldiers, was forc'd to save himself by flight, with his Wives and Children. The Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors asham'd of their treachery, did not so smartly pursue the unfortunate Prince as they might have done, but presently fell to plund'ring his Tents and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; which <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> suffer'd them to do, in recompence of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Sultan-Sujah</hi> in the mean time crossing the <hi>Ganges</hi> with his Retinue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd some time afterwards into the Kingdom of <hi>Arakan,</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Bengala,</hi> where we shall leave him for a time.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THough <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> were esteem'd a very great Politician, and were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet he fail'd in his Politicks, to trust his Son with such a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army, under the Conduct of a Captain who had already betray'd two Masters. However at length he began to be jealous, left Heaven should inspire his own Son to revenge the crimes which he had committed. And upon this, receiving intelligence, that <hi>Sultan Mahomed</hi> began to be very pensive and melancholy, he then absolutely believ'd that his Son was practising mischief against him; for the better discovery whereof, he wrote to <hi>Emir-Jemla.</hi> But the Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily miscarrying, was taken by <hi>Sultan Mahomed</hi>'s Guards, and giv'n to the young Prince; who being a person of a quick apprehension, conceal'd the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness from <hi>Emir-Jemla;</hi> and fearing left he should receive other Orders more precise to take away his life, he resolv'd to pass the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and throw himself upon his Uncle <hi>Sultan Sujah;</hi> from whom he expected more mercy than from his Father. With this resolution he feign'd to go a fishing, and passing the <hi>Ganges,</hi> with several Officers that adher'd to him, he went directly to <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi>'s Camp, which lay on the other side of the River; the <hi>Sultan</hi> having rais'd a considerable Force in the Kingdom of <hi>Arakan. Sultan Mahomed</hi> coming into his Uuncles presence, threw himself at his feet, begging his pardon for having taken Arms against him, as being forc'd thereto by his Father. Now though <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> had reason enough to believe, that <hi>Mahomed</hi>'s coming into his Camp, was only a trick of his Father, to send his Son as a Spy to discover his condition; yet being a vertuous and generous Prince, and seeing his Nephew prostrate at his feet, he could not but raise him up; after which, embracing him, he assur'd him of his protection against <hi>Aureng-zeb.</hi> Some days after, these

two Princes made an attempt, and passing <hi>Ganges,</hi> and fetching a compass thought to have surpriz'd the Enemies Army, who dreamt not of their coming. They made a vigorous onset, and kill'd a great number of men. But when they found the whole Army had taken the Alarum, they contented themselves with the mischief they had done, and repass'd the <hi>Ganges,</hi> for fear of being surrounded by number.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> had already given intelligence to <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> of the flight of his Son; which sensibly griev'd the Father, though he durst not shew his anger, for fear of incensing the <hi>Emir</hi> to betray him, as he had betray'd his Father. Thereupon he cunningly wrote to him, that he rely'd altogether upon his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and policy to retrieve his Son to his duty; that he was young, and that what he had done, was only out his heat of youth, and the inconstancy inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to his years. The confidence which <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> seem'd to put in <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> incited the General to use all his endeavours to get <hi>Mahomet</hi> out of <hi>Sultan Sujah's</hi> hands. Thereupon he gave the young Prince to understand his Fathers good intentions toward him, and that he was ready to receive him with open Arms, so that he would but make good use of his Residence with <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> which he might pretend was done for the advantage to his Father, and for which his Father would have rather cause to extol his prudence and affection than otherwise. The young Prince easily suffer'd himself to be perswaded, and the same way he went to his Uncle's, the same way he return'd to his Fathers Camp; where <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> receiv'd him honourably, and with all the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of joy. He advis'd him also, to tell his Father when he saw him, that he did not go over to <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> but only with a design to observe what Forces he had, and the Discipline of his Army; and that he intended to have speedily return'd, and to have given him an account of what he had done for his service. Presently Orders came from <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> that his Son should be sent to him; so that <hi>Mahomed,</hi> whether by constraint, or willingly, set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for <hi>Jehanabat,</hi> attended by the Guards which <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> had appointed. The King having notice of his arrival, his Majesty order'd him a Lodging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Palace, and would not permit him to kiss his hands; pretending he was not well.</p>
                        <p>All this while <hi>Soliman-Chekour,</hi> after he had been betray'd by the <hi>Raja Roup,</hi> had continu'd under the protection of <hi>Nacti-Rani</hi> in the Province of <hi>Serenaguer.</hi> This Prince, as stout as he was unfortunate, was constrain'd to lead a Savage life among the Mountains, for fear of falling into the hands of <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> nor could he with all his Forces do him any harm in that place. Beside <hi>Nacti-Rani</hi> had assur'd him with an Oath, accompany'd with all the Ceremonies that could make it solemn, and inviolable; that he would rather lose his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then that <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> should do the least violence to that protection which he afforded him. This was done upon the Banks of a River, which passes through his Country, where he wash'd his body, in token of the purity of his Soul; and being thus purify'd in the Water, he made his protestations to <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Chekour,</hi> never to forsake him, taking his Gods to Witness of the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his intentions. Upon this, <hi>Soliman-Chekour</hi> never took any farther care, but every day went to divertise himself with hunting. While he gives up himself to his pleasure, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> marches his Army toward the Mountains, thinking to force the <hi>Nacti-Rani</hi> to surrender <hi>Soliman-Chekour</hi> into his power. But the <hi>Raja</hi> with a thousand men being able to defend the Avenues of his Country against a hundred thousand, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> finding he could do no good that way, has recourse to policy. He undertakes at first to treat with the <hi>Raja,</hi> but in vain, for the <hi>Raja</hi> would not violate his Oath; and his Priests assur'd him besides, that <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> should e're long be depos'd, and that <hi>Soliman Chekour</hi> should Reign in his room.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> thus prevented, resolves to make another kind of War upon him. Thereupon he forbids all commerce between his and the <hi>Raja</hi>'s Subjects; which was very prejudicial to the latter. This caus'd the people to murmur at the protection which he had given to <hi>Soliman-Chekour;</hi> and at length they publickly cry'd out, that it was to the prejudice of the publick. Their Priests also, thus alarm'd, began to doubt the truth of their Oracles, and to think it convenient
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106224:214"/>
to put another interpretation upon them. But the main thing was, that the <hi>Raja Jessomseing</hi> who had betraid <hi>Dara-Cha,</hi> wrote privately to <hi>Nacti-Rani,</hi> that it was for the safety of his Person and Dominions, to submit to <hi>Aureng-zeb;</hi> and to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render his kinsman up into his hands. This advice of <hi>Jessomseing</hi> put him to a very great plunge; dreading on the one side the breach of his oath; on the other, the revolt of his people. Uncertain what course to take, he consults the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> who gave their opinions that it was his duty rather to preserve his People and his Laws, which would be both destroid, should they fall into the hands of <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> than to keep his Faith with a Prince from whom he could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any advantage. These consultations being kept private from <hi>Soliman Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kour,</hi> his ruine was concluded upon, while he thought himself most secure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Nacti-Rani,</hi> with a Salvo, as he thought, to his Honour and his Conscience, return'd for answer to <hi>Jessomseing,</hi> that he could not consent to betray the Prince; but that <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> might take his opportunity to seize his person, yet preserve his reputation too: in regard that <hi>Soliman Chekour</hi> was wont to go a Hunting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain Mountains in his Countrey with a small retinue, and that it would be an easy thing for him to send a number of Souldiers sufficient to apprehend him.</p>
                        <p>So soon as <hi>Jessomseing</hi> had receiv'd this answer, he gave order to his Son to see the business effected as the plot was laid. So that <hi>Soliman Chekour</hi> one day going a Hunting to the usual place, was snapt by a strong party that lay in Ambuscade. The Prince presently apprehended the treason, and defended himself with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of his Attendants, who were all slain; he himself slew nine, but at length over-number'd, was taken and carri'd to <hi>Jehanabat.</hi> When he came into <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s presence, the King ask'd him how he did? As well as a Prisoner of yours can do, said he, who expects no better usage from you, than his Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd before. The King bid him not be afraid, that he had no design to put him to death, but only to secure his person. <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> after that, demanding of him what was become of all the Treasure which he had carri'd away, the Prince made answer that he had spent a great part in raising Souldiers against him to have ruin'd him, if it had been his good fortune: That a good part was in the hands of <hi>Raja Roup,</hi> whose avarice and perfidiousness was sufficiently known. And that <hi>Nacti-Rani</hi> had got the remainder to deliver him to his enemies, to the prejudice of his word and honour. <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> was surpriz'd and touch'd at the boldness of his Nephew; but ambition shutting his eyes, and stifling all thoughts of justice, which the just remorse of Conscience might excite within him, he gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> his Son, and <hi>Soliman Chekour</hi> his Nephew should both be committed to the Fort of <hi>Goualeor</hi> to keep <hi>Morat-Bak-che</hi> company, which was done the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1661.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who was yet alive, but still liv'd miserably, was the last thorn in <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi>'s foot; and the person that drew it out for him, and rid him of his last pain, was the King of <hi>Arakan,</hi> whither the unfortunate Prince was at length forc'd to retire. Who finding all his hopes to be lost, began to think of a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> and from thence to go into <hi>Persia,</hi> and implore a Sanctuary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of that Prince. To this purpose he thought he might obtain a Vessel from the King of <hi>Arakan,</hi> or the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> to carry him to <hi>Mecca:</hi> but he was ignorant that neither of those Kings had any Vessels, that would live in the main Ocean. So that he was constrain'd to stay with the King of <hi>Arakan,</hi> an Idolater, whose Daughter he desir'd in Marriage, which the King granted, and by whom he had a Son. But that which ought to have been the greatest occasion of friendship between the Son-in-law and the Father-in-law, was the greatest reason of their hatred and falling-out. For some Lords of the Countrey, who began to be jealous of <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> buzz'd the King of <hi>Arakan</hi> in the ear, as if he had an intention by vertue of his Marriage, to dispossess him of his Throne, and to leave it to his own Son. The <hi>Pagan</hi> King easily believ'd what they said. Nor were these supitions ill-grounded; for <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> having good store of Gold and Jewels, easily corrupted several <hi>Mahumetans</hi> that liv'd in the Kingdom of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> and with those and about two-hunder'd men more that had follow'd him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rout of his Army, he undertook a most bold enterprize, which was yet a mark rather of despair than courage. He appointed a day to those of his party
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106224:215"/>
to force the Palace, and after they had put all the Royal Family to the Sword, to proclaim him King of <hi>Arakan.</hi> But this Plot being discover'd the day it should have been executed, <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Bangue,</hi> his Son, had no other way to save themselves, but by flight into the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu.</hi> But their way lying over Mountains almost impassable, and through thick Forrests full of Tigers and Lions, and being also closely pursu'd, their flight avail'd them little or nothing. <hi>Sultan Bangue</hi> however being behind, to keep the Pursuers in play while his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Family gain'd ground, stoutly defended himself against the first As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants, but at length being overpower'd by number, he was taken together with his two little Brothers, his Mother and his Sisters; who were all put in Prison, where they were very ill-us'd. But some time after, the King having a desire to marry the eldest Sister of <hi>Sultan Bangue,</hi> they had a little more liberty allow'd them. However they enjoy'd it not long, for the young Prince being of a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and ambitious spirit, plotted new treasons against the King, which being discover'd, the King immediately caus'd the whole Family to be put to death, not sparing the young Princess his Wife, though she were big with Child.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who was formost among those that fled, it is most generally thought that either he was slain by the Souldiers who were sent to apprehend him, or that he was torn in pieces by the Tigers and Lions; of which those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests are full.</p>

                        <p>SOme days before he ascended the Throne, he sent to his Father to send him some of his Jewels, to the end he might appear before his people with the same magnificence as his Predecessors had done. <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> taking this request of his Sons for an affront put upon him in Prison, fell into such a rage that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd mad for some days, and had like to have dy'd upon it. In the excess of his vexation he call'd several times for a Morter and a Pestle, threatning to beat all his Jewels to powder, before his Son should have them. But <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> his eldest Daughter, never forsook him, throwing her self at his feet, and by vertue of that criminal power which she had over him, as being both his Daughter and his Wife, kept him from using that extremity; more out of a design to preserve the Jewels for her self, than for her Brother, to whom she had always been a mortal enemy. For this reason, when <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> ascended the Throne, he had no more than one Jewel upon his Bonnet: This Bonnet cannot be call'd a Crown; and by consequence neither can the Ceremony be call'd a Coronation.</p>
                        <p>At the time that <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> took possession of the Throne, he would not eat any wheaten-bread, nor meat, nor fish, but fed upon barly-bread, herbs and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, which was a kind of Penance that he impos'd upon himself for so many crimes.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> was settl'd in the Empire, several Embassadors came to <hi>Jeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabat</hi> to congratulate him, on the behalf of the Kings their Masters, as from the King of the <hi>Usbeck Tartars,</hi> the Sheriff of <hi>Mecca,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Balsara,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> also sent <hi>Menheir Adrican,</hi> chief of their Factory in <hi>Surat,</hi> who was kindly receiv'd, and first dispatch'd. For 'tis a piece of State, to keep the Embassadors a good while at Court before they have Audience. All these Embassadors presented <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> with the rarities of their Countrey; who to get himself a good name in <hi>Asia,</hi> sent them away very well satisfi'd.</p>
                        <p>Some months before the death of <hi>Cha-jehan, Aureng-zeb</hi> sent an Embassador into <hi>Persia,</hi> who was magnificently receiv'd. For a month together he was nothing but feasted and caress'd with all manner of divertisements. The day that he was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106224:215"/>
to make his Present from the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi> sate upon his Throne in a most magnificent habit; and having receiv'd the Embassador's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, he presently divided it in contempt among the Officers of his House; only keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himself a Diamond that weigh'd sixty Carats. Some few days after he call'd for the Embassador, and after some discourse, he ask'd him if he were of the Sect of the <hi>Turks?</hi> To which the Embassador returning an answer, and leting some words fall against <hi>Haly,</hi> the King ask'd him what his name was.? He reply'd that <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> had given him the Name of <hi>Baubec-kan,</hi> that is, <hi>Lord of a free heart;</hi> and had honour'd him with one of the chief employments at Court. Then th'art a Villain, reply'd the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with an angry countenance, to desert thy Sovereign in his necessity, having receiv'd so many favours from him, and to serve a Tyrant, that keeps his Father in Prison, and has massacr'd all his Brothers. How dares he, pursu'd the King, take upon him the arrogant Title of <hi>Alem-guir Aureng-sha,</hi> or King of all the World, who never conquer'd any thing, but possesses all he has by treachery and parricide? Hast thou been one of those that counsell'd him to shed so much blood, to be the Executioner of his Brothers, and to keep his Father in Prison? Thou art not worthy to wear a Beard; and with that immediately caus'd it to be shav'd off; which is the greatest indignity that can be put upon a man in that Countrey. Shortly after he commanded the Embassador to return home, sending along with him for a Present to <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> an hunder'd and fifty beautiful Horses, with a great quantity of Gold and Silver-Carpets, Cloath of Gold, rich Shashes, and other Stuffs, to a vast value. When <hi>Baubec-kan</hi> was come back to <hi>Agra,</hi> where the King then was, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> incens'd at the affront which the <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> had giv'n him in the person of his Embassador, he took the Horses and sent some of them into the great <hi>Piazza,</hi> others to the corners of the Streets, causing it to be proclaim'd that the followers of <hi>Haly</hi> could not ride those Horses without being <hi>Nigss,</hi> that is to say, unclean, as coming from a King that did not obey the true Law. After that he caus'd the Horses to be kill'd, and all the rest of the Present to be burnt; uttering many reproachful words against the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with whom he was mortally offended.</p>
                        <p>At length <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> happ'ning to dye toward the end of the year 1666. <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> found himself rid of an object that every hour reproach'd his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and began to enjoy himself with more delight. Soon after he receiv'd his Sister <hi>Begum-Saheb</hi> into favour, restoring to her all her Governments, and giving her the Name of <hi>Cha-Begum,</hi> that is to say, Princess Queen. The truth is, she is a Woman of prodigious parts, and able to govern the whole Empire. And had her Father and Brothers taken her counsel at the beginning of the War, <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeb</hi> had never been King. As for <hi>Rauchenara Begum</hi> his Sister, she had always taken his side, and when she heard he had taken Arms, she sent him all the Gold and Silver she could procure. In recompence whereof he promis'd her, when he came to be King, to give her the Title of <hi>Cha-Begum,</hi> and that she should sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Throne: in all which he was as good as his word; and they continu'd very loving together till I was last at <hi>Genanabat:</hi> but then they were not so good friends, upon this occasion. The Princess having cunningly stoll'n into her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a handsom young fellow, could not so privately let him out again after she had quite tir'd him; but the King was advertiz'd thereof. Thereupon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, to prevent the shame and reproach, ran to the King in a great pretended fright, and told him that there was a man got into the <hi>Haram,</hi> even to her very Chamber, and that his intention was certainly either to have kill'd or robb'd her: that such a thing was never seen; that it concern'd the safety of his Royal Person, and that he would do well to punish severely the Eunuchs that kept guard that night. Presently the King ran in person with a great number of Eunuchs, so that the poor young man had no way to escape but by leaping out of a window into the River that runs by the Palace-walls; whereupon a world of people ran out to seize him; the King commanding them to do him no harm, but to carry him to the Officer of Justice: However he has been not heard of ever since that time.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Preparations against the Feast of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> when he is weigh'd solemnly every year. Of the richness of his Thrones, and the Magnificence of his Court.</head>
                        <p>THis great Feast begins the fourth of <hi>November,</hi> and lasts five days. They usually weigh the King at the time of his Birth; and if he weighs more than he did the year before, there is great rejoicing. When he is weigh'd he seats himself upon the richest of his Thrones; and then all the Grandees of the Kingdom come to congratulate and present him. The Ladies of the Court send him their Presents also, as likewise do the Governours of Provinces, and others in great Employments. The Presents consist of Jewels, Tissues, Carpetts and other Stuffs; besides Camels, Elephants, Horses, and indeed any thing that is rare and of value. 'Tis said he receives that day thirty Millions of Livres.</p>
                        <p>They begin to prepare for this Feast the seventh of <hi>September,</hi> about two Months before it begins. The first thing they do, is to cover the two great Courts overhead, from the middle of each Court to the Hall, which is open upon three sides. The Pavilions that cover these two void places, are of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Velvet, Embroider'd with Gold, and so weighty, that the Posts which sustain them are as big as the Mast of a Ship; some thirty, some forty foot high. There are thirty-eight of these Posts to uphold the Tent in the first Court; and those next the Hall, are plated with Gold as thick as a Ducket. The rest are plated with Silver of the same thickness. The Cords are of Cotton of divers colours; some of them as big as a good Cable.</p>
                        <p>The first Court is surrounded with Portico's and little Chambers, where the <hi>Omrahs</hi> keep Guard. For every eight days the <hi>Omrahs</hi> relieve the Guard; and during those eight days, the <hi>Omrah</hi> who is upon the Guard, has a Dish of Meat out of the Kings Kitchin. When he sees it coming afar off, he makes three obeysances, laying his hand three times upon the Ground, and three times upon his Head, crying out at the same time, God preserve the Kings health, give him long Life and Victory over his Enemies. They take it for a great Honour to Guard the King; and when they go upon the Guard, they put on all their most sumptuous Apparel; and their Horses, Camels, and Elephants are all richly adorn'd. Some of the Camels carry a small Piece of Ordinance, with a man behind to shoot it off. The meanest of these <hi>Omrahs</hi> commands a thousand Horse; but if he be a Prince of the Blood, he commands six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
                        <p>The Great <hi>Mogul</hi> has seven Thrones, some set all over with Diamonds; others with Rubies, Emraulds, and Pearls.</p>
                        <p>The largest Throne, which is set up in the Hall of the first Court, is in form like one of our Field-Beds, six foot long, and four broad. The Cushion at the back is round like a Bolster; the Cushions on the sides are flat.</p>
                        <p>I counted about a hundred and eight pale Rubies in Collets, about this Throne, the least whereof weigh'd a hundred Carats; but there are some that weigh two hundred. Emraulds I counted about a hundred and sixty, that weigh'd some threescore, some thirty Carats.</p>
                        <p>The under-part of the Canopy is all embroider'd with Pearls and Diamonds, with a Fringe of Pearls round about. Upon the top of the Canopy, which is made like an Arch with four Panes, stands a Peacock, with his Tail spread, consisting all of Saphirs, and other proper colour'd Stones; the Body is of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Gold, enchas'd with several Jewels; and a great Ruby upon his breast, at which hangs a Pearl, that weighs fifty Carats. On each side of the Peacock stand two Nose-gays, as high as the Bird, consisting of several sorts of Flowers, all of beaten Gold enamel'd. When the King seats himself upon the Throne, there is a transparent Jewel, with a Diamond Appendant, of eighty or ninety Carats, encompass'd with Rubies and Emraulds, so hung that it is always in his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106224:216"/>
Eye. The twelve Pillars also that uphold the Canopy, are set with rows of fair Pearl, round, and of an excellent Water, that weigh from six to ten Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats apiece. At the distance of four feet, upon each side of the Throne, are plac'd two Parasols, or Umbrello's, the handles whereof are about eight foot high, cover'd with Diamonds; the Parasols themselves are of crimson Velvet, embroider'd and fring'd with Pearls.</p>
                        <p>This is the famous Throne which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> began, and <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> finish'd; which is really reported to have cost a hundred and sixty Millions, and five hundred-thousand Livres of our Money.</p>
                        <p>Behind this stately and magnificent Throne there is another less, in the form of a Tub, where the King bathes himself; it is an Oval, seven foot long, and five broad. The outside whereof shines all over with Diamonds and Pearls; but there is no Canopy over it.</p>
                        <p>Coming into the first Court, on the right hand, you see a particular Tent, where during all the Feast, the Morice-Dancers are appointed to make sport, while the King sits upon his Throne. On the left hand is another Tent, appointed for the principal Officers of the Army and Houshold.</p>
                        <p>In the same Court, while the King sits upon his Throne, are to be seen thirty Horses, fifteen upon one side, and fifteen upon the other, lead by two men. Their Bridles are very short, but for the most part enrich'd with Diamonds, Rubies, Emraulds, and Pearls, the Bits whereof are of pure Gold. Every Horse wears between his Ears a rich Plume of Feathers, with a little Cushion upon his Back, ty'd on with a Surcingle; both being embroider'd with Gold; and about his Neck hung some fair Jewel, which was either a Diamond, a Ruby, or an Emrauld. The worst of those Horses cost three thousand, some five thousand Crowns; and some there were, that were never bought under ten thousand. The young Prince, who was between seven and eight years old, rode upon a Horse no higher than a good big Greyhound, but very well shap'd.</p>
                        <p>About an hour after the King has bin sitting upon his Throne, seven stout Elephants bred up for War, are brought out. One of those Elephants has his Seat fix'd upon his back, if the King should have a mind to ride out. The others are cover'd with Cloaths richly embroider'd, with Chains of Gold and Silver about their Necks; and there are four that carry the Kings Standard upon their Crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, fasten'd to a Half-Pike, which a man seated on purpose close by, holds upright with his hand. These Elephants are brought within fifty paces of the Throne, and when they come before the King, they make their obeysances to him, laying their Trunks to the ground, and then lifting them up above their Heads three times; every time he makes a great cry, and then turning his back to the King, one of the Leaders turns up the Cloath, that the King may see he is in good case. There belongs also to every one a Cord, which is put round his body, to shew how much he is grown since the last year. The first of these Elephants, which the King most esteems, is a great furious Creature, that has five hundred Roupies allow'd him every month. He is fed with good Victuals, and a great quantity of Sucre, and they give him <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> to drink. When the King rides forth upon his Elephant, the <hi>Omrahs</hi> follow on Horseback. And when he rides on Horseback, the <hi>Omrahs</hi> follow him on foot.</p>
                        <p>After the King has seen his Elephants, he rises up, and goes into his <hi>Haram</hi> through a little oval door behind the Throne.</p>
                        <p>The five other Thrones are set up in another magnificent Hall in another Court, all cover'd over with Diamonds, without any colour'd Stone.</p>
                        <p>When the King has staid about half an hour, he comes out again, attended by three or four Eunuchs, and seats himself in the other Hall, upon the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of the five Thrones, where the <hi>Omrahs</hi> come, as long as the five days of the Festival last, and make their Presents to him.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Some other Observations upon the Court of the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>AFter <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> had setled himself in the Empire, which he usurp'd from his Father and his Brothers, he impos'd upon himself a very severe penance, eating nothing but Pulse and Sweet-meats, which has made him very meagre and lean. All the time the Comet lasted in the year 1665, which appear'd very great in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where I then was, <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> drank nothing but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and eat nothing but Bread made of Millet; which so impair'd his health, that it had like to have cost him his life. Besides, he always lay upon the ground, only with a Tigers Skin under him; since which time he has never been perfectly well.</p>
                        <p>I saw him drink three several times, while he sate upon his throne; to which purpose he had brought him a large Cup of Christal of the Rock, round and all of a piece, with a Gold Cover, enrich'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and Emraulds, the foot thereof being of the same. But no person sees the King eat, only his Wives and his Eunuchs. And it is but very rarely that he goes to Dine or Sup with any of his Subjects. When I was last in <hi>India, Giafer-Kan,</hi> who was his Grand <hi>Visier,</hi> and his Uncle by marriage of his wife, invited the King to see a new Palace which he was building, who went accordingly, and it was the greatest Honour his Majesty could do him; in retaliation whereof, <hi>Giafer-Kan</hi> and his Wife presented him with Jewels, Elephants, Camels, Horses, and other things, to the value of a Million and fifty thousand Livres of our Money. For <hi>Giafer-Kan</hi>'s Wife is the most magnificent and liberal Woman in all <hi>India,</hi> and spends more her self than all the Kings Wives and Daughters, which makes her Husband in debt, though he be almost Lord of all the Empire.</p>
                        <p>When the King is carried in his <hi>Palleki</hi> to the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> one of his Sons follows him a Horseback, and all his <hi>Omrahs</hi> and Officers of his Houshold come behind him a foot. Those that are <hi>Mahumetans</hi> stay for him at the top of the ascent to the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> and when he is ready to come out, they march before him to the Gate of his Palace. Eight Elephants always go before the King, to every one of which belong two men; one to lead the Elephant, and the other, who sits upon his back, carries a Standard fix'd to a Half-Pike. The other four carry Seats or Thrones upon their backs, the one square, the other round; one cover'd, the other inclos'd with Glass of several fashions. When the King goes abroad, he has usually five or six hundred men to attend him for his Guard, arm'd every one with a kind of an Half-Pike. To the heads of their Pikes they tye two Squibs cross-wife, about a foot long, and as big as a mans Arm, which will carry the Half-Pike five hundred paces. The King is also attended by three or four hundred Musquateers; but they are very Cowards, and hardly know how to shoot off their pieces. He has also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Cavalry, which are Soldiers much alike. A hundred <hi>Europeans</hi> might well beat a thousand <hi>Indians;</hi> but they would hardly accustom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to live such sober lives. For as well the Horse as the Infantry will live upon Meal kneaded with Water and brown Sugar; but in the evening, when they have convenience, they make <hi>Quichery,</hi> which is Rice boil'd in Water and Salt, with a Grain so call'd. When they eat it, they stir it with the ends of their Fingers in melted Butter, which is the usual food of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and poor people. Beside, the heat would kill our Souldiers, who would never be able to endure the Sun all the day long, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do. By the way, give me leave to tell you, that the Country people have no other cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than a piece of Linnen to hide their secret parts, being miserably poor; for if their Governours know they have any thing about them, they seize it either as their right, or by force. There are some Provinces in <hi>India</hi> that lye waste, the Natives being forc'd to fly, by reason of the cruelty of their Governours. Under the pretence of being <hi>Mahumetans</hi> they persecute the poor
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106224:217"/>
Idolaters beyond all measure; and if any of them embrace <hi>Mahumetism,</hi> 'tis only because they would not work any longer. For then they turn Souldiers or <hi>Faquirs,</hi> who are a sort of people that profess a renunciation of the World, and live upon Alms, but are indeed very Rascals. They reckon that there are in <hi>India</hi> 800000 of these <hi>Mahumetan Faquirs,</hi> and twelve hunder'd thousand Idolaters.</p>
                        <p>Once in fifteen days the King goes a Hunting, mounted upon his Elephant, and so continues during the chase. All the Game he takes is brought within Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot of his Elephants. Which consists generally of Lions, Tigers, Harts, and wild-Goats. For they will not meddle with Boars, as being <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> When he returns home he puts himself into his <hi>Palleki,</hi> and goes in the same order, and with the same Guard, as when he returns from the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> saving that when he goes a Hunting, he is attended with three or four-hunder'd Horsemen, that ride without any discipline in the World.</p>
                        <p>As for the Princesses, as well the Wives, Daughters and Sisters of the King, they never stir out of the Palace, unless it be to spend a few days in the Countrey for their pleasure. Some of them go abroad, but very rarely, to visit some great Noble-mens Wives, as the Wife of <hi>Giafer-Kan,</hi> who is the King's Aunt. But that is only by particular leave of the King. And then it is not the custom as in <hi>Persia,</hi> where the Ladies make their visits only by night, and with a great number of Eunuchs, who clear the Streets of all people they meet. For in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court, they usually go out about nine in the morning, with only three or four Eunuchs, and ten or twelve Slaves, which are instead of Maids of Honour.</p>
                        <p>The Princesses are carri'd in <hi>Palleki's</hi> cover'd over with Embroider'd Tapestry, and a little Coach to hold one single person that follows the <hi>Palleki,</hi> drawn by two men, the wheels not being above a foot in diameter. The reason why they carry that Coach along with them, is, because that when the Princesses arrive at the House where they intend to alight, the men that carry the <hi>Palleki,</hi> not being permitted to go any farther than the first Gate, they then take their Coaches, and are drawn by their female-Slaves to the Womens Apartment. I have also observ'd, that in all the Houses of great Noble-men, the Womens Apartment is at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-end of all. So that you must cross two or three great Courts, and a Garden or two, before you can come as it.</p>
                        <p>When the Princesses are married to any of the Court-Grandees, they become absolute Mistresses of their Husbands; so that if they study not to please them, and do not as they would have them, in regard of their free access to the King, they over-rule the King many times to their prejudice, even to the turning them out of their employments.</p>
                        <p>As it is a custom that the first-born always is Heir to the Throne, though he be the Son of a Slave, so soon as the Princesses of the King's <hi>Haram</hi> perceive that there is any one among them big with Child, they use all the artifices imaginable to make them miscarry. Insomuch that being at <hi>Patna</hi> in the year 1666, <hi>Cha-Est-Kan</hi>'s Chirurgeon assur'd me, that the Wife of <hi>Cha-Est-Kan</hi> had procur'd the miscarrying of eight Women, because she would suffer no other Womens Children but her own.</p>

                              <hi>KAsembasar,</hi> a Village in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala,</hi> sends abroad every year two and twenty-thousand Bales of Silk; every Bale weighing a hunder'd pound. The two and twenty Bales make two millions and two-hunder'd-thousand pound, at sixteen ounces to the pound. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> usually carry away six or seven-thousand Bales, and would carry away more, did not the Merchants of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Empire oppose them: for they buy up as much as the <hi>Hollander;</hi> the rest the Natives keep to make their Stuffs. This Silk is all brought into the Kingdom of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> the greatest part whereof comes to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> and to <hi>Surat,</hi> where it is wrought up.</p>
                           <p>In the first place they make Carpets of Silk and Gold, others of Silk and Silver, others all of Silk: For the Worsted Carpets are made at <hi>Vettapour,</hi> some twelve leagues from <hi>Agra.</hi>

                           <p>In the second place they make Satins with streaks of Gold and Silver; others plain: with Taffata's after the same fashion.</p>
                           <p>In the third place they make <hi>Patoles,</hi> which are a fort of Silk-stuff very thin, but painted with all sorts of Flowers, the manufacture whereof is at <hi>Amadabat.</hi> They cost from eight Roupies to forty the piece. This is a Commodity wherein the <hi>Dutch</hi> will not suffer any one of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to trade in particular: for they transport it to the <hi>Philippine-Islands,</hi> to the Islands of <hi>Borneo, Java, Sumatra,</hi> and other neighbouring Islands.</p>
                           <p>The raw-Silk of <hi>Kasembasar</hi> is yellowish, as are all the raw-Silks that come from <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> but the Natives of <hi>Kasembasar</hi> have a way to whiten it, with a Lye made of the ashes of a Tree which they call <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fig-tree; which makes it as white as the <hi>Palestine-</hi>Silk. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> send away all their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize which they fetch out of <hi>Bengala,</hi> by water, through a great Canal that runs from <hi>Kasembasar</hi> into <hi>Ganges,</hi> for fifteen leagues together; from whence it is as far by water down the <hi>Ganges</hi> to <hi>Ouguely,</hi> where they lade their Ships.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>Chites</hi> which are made in the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> are all Printed; and nothing so beautiful, neither for the figures nor the fineness of the Linnen. Those which are made at <hi>Lahor,</hi> are the coarsest, and consequently the cheapest of all. They are sold by <hi>Corges,</hi> every <hi>Corge</hi> consisting of twenty pieces, which cost from 16 to 30 Roupies.</p>

The <hi>Chites</hi> which are made at <hi>Seronge,</hi> are sold from 20 to 50 Roupies the <hi>Corge,</hi> or thereabouts.</p>
                           <p>These <hi>Chites</hi> serve for Coverlets for Beds, for Sofra's or Table-cloaths after the Countrey-fashion, Pillowbears, Handkerchiefs, but more especially for Wastcoats as well for the men as women in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The fine Calicut-<hi>Chites</hi> are made at <hi>Brampour;</hi> and are us'd for handkerchiefs by those that snuff Tobacco.</p>
                           <p>The women also, over all <hi>Asia,</hi> make Veils of these Calicuts, to wear over their heads, and about their shoulders, which Veils are call'd <hi>Ormis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Basta's</hi> or Calicuts painted red, blue, and black, are carri'd white to <hi>Agra,</hi> and <hi>Amadabat,</hi> in regard those Cities are nearest to the places where the <hi>Indigo</hi> is made that is us'd in colouring. They cost from two Roupies to 30 or 40 a-piece, according to the fineness and the quantity of Gold at the ends, and sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sides. The <hi>Indians</hi> have a way to dip some of these Calicuts in a certain water that makes them look like Water'd-Chamlets, which adds also to the price.</p>
                           <p>That sort which is sold for two Roupies, and so onward till ye come to twelve, is transported to the Coast of <hi>Melinda,</hi> and it is the greatest Trade the Governour of <hi>Mozambique</hi> drives, who sells them to the <hi>Cafres,</hi> that vend them again among the <hi>Abyssins,</hi> and into the Kingdom of <hi>Saba:</hi> for those people not understanding the use of Soap, need no more but only to wash these Calicuts in water. That sort which is valu'd from 12 Roupies upward, is transported to the <hi>Philippine-</hi>Islands, the Islands of <hi>Borneo, Java, Sumatra,</hi> and other adjacent places. Where the women wear no other clothes, than a single piece of this Calicut. One part whereof, without cutting it, serves for a Petticoat; the other they wind about their stomachs and their heads.</p>

                           <p>VVHite Calicuts come partly from <hi>Agra,</hi> and about <hi>Lahor,</hi> part from <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala:</hi> some from <hi>Brouda, Baroche, Renonsari,</hi> and other places. They are brought out of the Loom to <hi>Renonsari,</hi> and <hi>Baroche,</hi> where they are whiten'd by reason of the convenience of their Meadows, and the great store of Limons that grow thereabouts. For the Calicuts are never so white as they should be, till they are dipt in Limon-water.</p>
                           <p>The Calicuts that come from <hi>Agra, Lahor,</hi> and <hi>Bengala,</hi> are sold by the <hi>Corge,</hi> and they are of several prices, from seventeen Roupies to three or four-hunder'd, as the Merchant will have them wov'n.</p>
                           <p>The Calicuts that come from <hi>Renonsari,</hi> and <hi>Baroche,</hi> are one and twenty cubits long, new out of the Loom; but in the whitening they shrink to twenty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
                           <p>Those of <hi>Brouda</hi> twenty cubits from the Loom, and shrink in the whitening to nineteen and a half.</p>
                           <p>All the Calicuts or <hi>Basta's</hi> that come from these three Cities, are of two sorts: for some are broad, some are narrow. The narrow are those I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, the prices whereof are various, from two <hi>Mamoudi's</hi> to six.</p>
                           <p>The broad <hi>Basta's</hi> are a cubit, and one third part wide; the whole piece twenty cubits long. The usual price of them is from five <hi>Mamoudi's</hi> to twelve: but a Merchant being upon the place, may cause them to be made much more large and fine, till they are worth five-hunder'd <hi>Mamoudi's</hi> a-piece. I saw two pieces sold for a thousand <hi>Mamoudi's.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>English</hi> bought one, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> another, each piece containing eight and twenty cubits.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>INdigo</hi> comes from several parts of the Great <hi>Mogul's</hi> Empire; and according to the diversity of the places it differs in quality, and consequently in price.</p>
                           <p>In the first place, it comes from the Territories of <hi>Biana, Indoua,</hi> and <hi>Corsa,</hi> a day or two's journey from <hi>Agra:</hi> which is esteem'd the best of all. It is made also eight days journey from <hi>Surat,</hi> in a Village call'd <hi>Sarquess,</hi> two leagues distance from <hi>Amadabat.</hi> Here the flat <hi>Indigo</hi> is made. There is also <hi>Indigo</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferior in goodness and price, which comes from the King of <hi>Golconda</hi>'s Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. The <hi>Mein</hi> of <hi>Surat,</hi> which contains 42 <hi>Serre's,</hi> or 34 and a half of our pounds, is valu'd from 15 to 20 Roupies. They make as good as this at <hi>Baroche.</hi> That which is made up about <hi>Agra</hi> is made up in half Balls, and is the most sought for in all <hi>India.</hi> It is sold by the <hi>Mein,</hi> which is those places contains 60 <hi>Serres,</hi> or 51 and three quarters of our pounds. The usual price is from 36 to 40 Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. There grows also <hi>Indico</hi> some 36 leagues from <hi>Brampour,</hi> about a great Village call'd <hi>Raout,</hi> and round about the neighbouring Towns in the road to <hi>Surat:</hi> Of which the Natives usually make above a hunder'd-thousand Roupies.</p>
                           <p>There comes <hi>Indigo</hi> also from <hi>Bengala,</hi> which the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company transports for <hi>Maslipatan.</hi> But they buy this <hi>Indigo,</hi> and that of <hi>Brampour</hi> and <hi>Amadabat,</hi> cheaper by 24 in the hunder'd, than that of <hi>Agra.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Indigo</hi> is made of an Herb which they sow every year after the rains are over: which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it three times a year; first when it is about two or three foot high; and they cut it within half a foot of the ground; the first cutting far exceeds the two latter. The second cutting is worse than the first by ten or twelve in the hunder'd, and the third worse than the second by twelve in the hunder'd. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Paste, and observing the colour. The colour of that <hi>Indigo</hi> which is made of the first cutting, is a Violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others: and that which is made of the second is more lively than the third.</p>
                           <p>When they have cut the Herb, they throw it into Pits which they make with Lime, which becomes so hard, that you would judg it to be one intire piece of Marble. They are generally fourscore or a hunder'd paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quite up with the Herb. Then they bruise and jumble it in the water till the leaf, for the stalk is worth nothing, become like a kind of thick mud. This being done, they let it settle for some days; and when the setling is all at the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When the water is all drain'd out, they fill several baskets with this slime, and in a plain Field you shall see several men at work, every one at his own bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, making up little pieces of <hi>Indigo</hi> flat at the bottom, at the top sharp like an egg. Though at <hi>Amadabat</hi> they make their pieces quite flat like a small cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Merchants, because they would not pay custom for an unnecessary weight, before they transport their <hi>Indigo</hi> out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> are very careful to cause it to be sifted, to separate the dust from it; which they sell afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They that sift this <hi>Indigo</hi> must be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces, and that their nostrils be well-stopt, leaving only two little holes for their eyes. Besides, they must every half hour be sure to drink milk, which is a great preservative against the piercing quality of the dust. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106224:219"/>
all this caution, they that have sifted <hi>Indigo</hi> for nine or ten days, shall spit nothing but blew for a good while together. Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the sisters, and when I came to break it in the evening it was all blew within.</p>
                           <p>As they take the Paste out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes they lay them in the Sun to dry. Which is the reason that when the Merchants buy <hi>Indigo,</hi> they burn some pieces of it, to try whether there be any dust among it. For the Natives who take the Paste out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps, lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Paste, and fouls it. But when the Merchants burn it, the <hi>Indigo</hi> turns to Ashes, and the Sand remains. The Governours do what they can to make the Natives leave their Knavery; but notwithstanding all their care, there will be some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>

                           <p>CArdamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves and Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are all the different sorts of Spices known to us. I put Cardamom and Ginger in the first place, because that Cardamom grows in the Territories of <hi>Visapour,</hi> and Ginger in the Dominions of the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> And as for other Spices, they are brought from other Foreign parts to <hi>Surat,</hi> which is the grand Mart.</p>
                           <p>Cardamom is the most excellent of all other Spices, but it is very scarce; and in regard there is no great store in the place where it grows, it is only made use of in <hi>Asia,</hi> at the Tables of great Princes. Five hundred pound of Cardamoms, are priz'd from a hundred to a hundred and ten Reals.</p>
                           <p>Ginger is brought in great quantities from <hi>Amadabat,</hi> where there grows more than in any other part of <hi>Asia;</hi> and it is hardly to be imagin'd how much there is transported candited into Foreign parts.</p>
                           <p>Pepper is of two sorts. There is a sort which is very small, another sort much bigger; both which sorts are distinguish'd into small and great Pepper. The larger sort comes from the Coast of <hi>Malavare;</hi> and <hi>Tuticorin</hi> and <hi>Calicut</hi> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of <hi>Visapour,</hi> being vended at <hi>Rejapour,</hi> a little City in that Kingdom. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> that purchase it of the <hi>Malavares,</hi> do not give Money for it, but several sorts of Commodities in Exchange; as Cotton, Opium, Vermillion, and Quicksilver; and this is the Pepper which is brought into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> As for the little Pepper that comes from <hi>Bantam, Afchen,</hi> and some other parts toward the East, there is none of it carried out of <hi>Asia,</hi> where it is spent in vast quantities, especially among the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> For there are double the Grains of small Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper; besides that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth.</p>
                           <p>The little Pepper that comes to <hi>Surat,</hi> has been sold some years for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen Mamoudi's the Mein; and so much I have seen the <hi>English</hi> give for it, to transport it to <hi>Ormus, Balsara,</hi> and the Red Sea. As for the great Pepper which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fetch from the Coast of <hi>Malavare,</hi> five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty-eight Reals; but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they gain <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow'r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the only Spices which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have in their own hands. The three first come from the <hi>Molucca</hi> Islands; the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106224:220"/>
'Tis observable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never planted, which has been confirm'd to me by several persons that have liv'd several years in the Country. They related to me, that the Nutmeg being ripe, several Birds come from the Islands toward the South, and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be digested. The Nutmeg then besmear'd with a viscous matter, falling to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one observation upon the Birds of Paradise. These Birds being very greedy after Nutmegs, come in flights to gorge themselves with the pleasing Spice; at the season, like Felfares in Vintage time; but the strength of the Nutmeg so intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the Emets in a short time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds of Paradise are said to have no Feet; which is not true however, for I have seen three or four that had Feet; and a <hi>French</hi> Merchant sent one from <hi>Aleppo</hi> as a Present to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth that had Feet; of which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl.</p>
                           <p>But notwithstanding all the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Projects, you may buy Cloves at <hi>Macassar</hi> without purchasing them of the <hi>Hollander;</hi> in regard the Islanders buy them of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains and Soldiers, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have in those place where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange Rice, and other necessaries for the support of life, without which they would starve, being very sadly provided for.</p>
                           <p>When the Natives of <hi>Macassar</hi> are thus furnish'd of Cloves, they barter them in Exchange for such Commodies as are brought them; sometimes they give Tortoise-Shells in exchange, and Gold Dust; by which the Merchant gains six or seven in the hundred, being better than the Money of the Island, though it be Gold, by reason the King ofttimes enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are <hi>Amboyna, Ellias, Seram,</hi> and <hi>Bouro.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Islands of <hi>Banda</hi> also, in number six, <hi>viz. Nero, Lontour, Poulcay, Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin,</hi> and <hi>Grenapuis,</hi> bear Nutmegs in great abundance. The Island of <hi>Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puis</hi> is about six Leagues in compass, and ends in a sharp point, where there is a continual fire burning out of the Earth. The Island <hi>Damme,</hi> where there grows great store of Nutmegs, and very big, was discover'd in the year 1647, by <hi>Abel Tasman,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Commander.</p>
                           <p>The price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them sold to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> at <hi>Surat,</hi> was as follows.</p>
                           <p>The Mein of <hi>Surat</hi> contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of our Pounds, at sixteen Ounces to the Pound.</p>
                           <p>A Mein of Cloves was sold for a hundred and three Mamoudi's and a half.</p>
                           <p>A Mein of Mace was sold for a hundred and fifty-seven Mamoudi's and a half.</p>
                           <p>Nutmegs for fifty-six Mamoudi's and a half.</p>
                           <p>Cinnamon comes at present from the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> The Tree that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They never take off but the first and second, which is accounted the best. They never meddle with the third, for should the Knife enter that, the Tree would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they learn from their youth. The Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Spice is much dearer to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> than people think; for the King of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> otherwise call'd King of <hi>Candy,</hi> from the name of his principal City, being a sworn Enemy to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> sends his Forces with an intention to surprize them, when they gather their Cinnamon; so that they are forc'd to bring seven or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the <hi>Portugals</hi> were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water was all consum'd. When it was cold, the upper part became a Paste like white Wax; of which they made Tapers to set up in their Churches, for no sooner were the Tapers lighted, but all the Church was perfum'd. Formerly the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the <hi>Raja's</hi> about

                              <hi>Cochin.</hi> But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have destroyd all those places, so that the Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is now in their hands. When the <hi>Portugals</hi> had that Coast, the <hi>English</hi> bought their Cinnamon of them, and usually paid for it by the Mein fifty Mamoudi's.</p>

Loaf-Sugar
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106224:221"/>
is also made at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> where they are perfectly skill'd in refining it; for which reason it is call'd Sugar Royal. These Sugar-Loaves usually weigh from eight to ten pound.</p>

                           <p>Plain Silk Wares may be alter'd in length, breadth, and quality. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity shews it self when they are of an even thread, when the weight is equal, and when there is no Cotton thread in the West.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> not having the art of guilding silver, put into their strip'd Wares threads of pure Gold, so that you must count the quantity of Gold threads to see whether the Silk have its due number. And this also you must observe in your Silks wov'n with Silver. As for Taffata's, you are only to mind whether the pieces be all of a fineness, and to see by unfolding some of them, that there be nothing within to augment the weight, and then weighing all the pieces by themselves, to see that they all agree.</p>
                           <p>The colours of those Carpetts which are made in <hi>India,</hi> do not last so long as the colour of those which are made in <hi>Persia;</hi> but for the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it is very lovely. The eye of the Broaker is to judg of the largeness, beauty, and fineness of those Carpetts which are wrought with Gold and Silver, and whether they be fine and rich. But whether they be Carpetts, or other Stuffs mix'd with Gold and Silver, it behoves the Buyer to pull out some of the Gold and Silver, Threads, to see whether they be of the right value or no.</p>

                           <head>Deceits in the White Calicuts.</head>
                           <p>The deceits usually put upon Calicuts, are in fineness length, and breadth. Every Bale may contain two hundred pieces; among which they will juggle in five or six or ten, less fine, or less white, shorter or narrower than accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the scantling of the Bale, which cannot be found out but by examining them piece by piece. The fineness is discern'd by the eye, the length and breadth by the measure. But the <hi>Indians</hi> practise a more cunning way, which is to count the number of threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the fineness of the scantling. When the number fails, it is either more trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, more narrow, or more course. The difference is sometimes so difficult to be perceiv'd, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great deal. For it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to cousen a Crown or two Crowns, in a piece that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Those that whiten these Calicuts, to save charges of a few Limons, will knock the Calicuts excessively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury, and loars the price.</p>
                           <p>As for their Calicuts dy'd blew or black, you must take care that the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not knock them after they are folded, to make them look sleek; for many times when they come to be unfolded, you shall find holes in the creases.</p>
                           <p>As for your painted and printed Calicuts, which are painted and printed as they come out of the Loom, the Merchant must take care that what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks be finish'd before the end of the Rains, for the thicker the Water is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106224:221"/>
where they are wash'd, the more lively will the printed and painted colours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. It is easy to distinguish between the printed and the painted Calicuts; and between the neatness of the work: but for the fineness and other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, they are not so easily discern'd; and therefore the Broaker must be more careful.</p>

                           <p>THE cheat in the weight is twofold. The first, by laying them in a moist place; and thrusting in the middle of every Skain something to add to the weight.

                           <p>There is but one cheat in the quality, that is by putting three or four Skains, of a coarser Commodity than that which is uppermost, into one <hi>Mein.</hi> Which in a great quantity mounts high; for there are some Cottons that are worth an hunder'd Crowns the <hi>Mein.</hi> These two cheats being often us'd by the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company, there is no way but to weigh your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in the presence of the <hi>Dutch-</hi>Commander, and his Councel, and to examine every <hi>Mein,</hi> Skain by Skain.

Now those that have a design to cheat the Merchants, dry them in the sand, to the end that the sand sticking to the Indigo, should encrease the weight. Sometimes they lay up their Paste in moist places, which makes it give, and consequently renders it more heavy. But if the Governour of the place discovers the cheat, he makes them severely pay for it: and the best way of discovery is to burn some pieces of Indigo, for the sand will remain.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of Diamonds, and the Mines and Rivers where they are found; and first of the Author's journey to the Mine of <hi>Raolconda.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Diamond is the most precious of all Stones, and it was in that sort of Commodity wherein I most dealt. And therefore to acquire a perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I went to all the Mines; and to one of the Rivers where they are found. To which purpose I travell'd to four Mines; of which I will give you a description; and of one of the Rivers where I have also been.</p>
                        <p>The first of these Mines, where I was, is in the Territories of the King of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sapour,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Carnatica;</hi> and the place is call'd <hi>Raolconda,</hi> five days journey from <hi>Golconda,</hi> and eight or nine from <hi>Visapour.</hi> This Mine was discover'd not above two-hunder'd years ago, as I was inform'd by those of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                        <p>Round about the place where the Diamonds are found, the ground is sandy, full of Rocks, much resembling the parts near <hi>Fountain-Bleau.</hi> There are in the Rocks several veins, some half a finger, some a whole finger-wide: And the Miners make use of Irons with hooks at the end, with which thep pick out the earth or sand, which they put into tubs, and among that earth they find the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. But because these veins do not run always streight, but sometimes down, sometimes upward, the Miners are constrain'd to break the Rock, following always the trace of the veins: When they have open'd all the veins, and taken out all the sand, then they wash it two or three times over to look for the Diamonds. In this Mine it is that they find the cleanest Stones, and of the whitest water. But the mischief is, that to setch the sand out of the Rock, they are forc'd to strike such terrible blows with a great Iron-leaver, that they flaw the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and make it look like Crystal. Which is the reason there are found so many soft Stones in this Diamond-Mine, though they make a great shew. If the Stone be clean, they only give it a turn or two upon the wheel, not caring to shape it, for fear of losing the weight. If there be any flaws, or any points, or any black or red specks in it, they cut all the Stone into Fossets; or if there be only a little flaw, they work it under the ridg of one of the Fossets, to hide the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now because a Merchant desires rather to have a black speck than a red one; 'tis but burning the Stone, and the speck becomes black. This trick at length I understood so well, that when I saw any Stones in them that came from the Mine made into Fossets, especially very small ones, I was certain there was either some speck or some flaw in the Stone.</p>
                        <p>There are several Diamond-Cutters at this Mine, but none of them have above one Mill, which is of Steel. They never cut but one Stone at a time upon each Mill, casting water continually upon the Mill, to find out the grain of the Stone; which being found, they pour on Oil, (not sparing for powder of Diamonds, though it be very dear,) to make the Stone slide the faster; and they lay on more weight than we do. I have seen them lay upon one Stone an hunder'd and fifty pound of Lead. I must confess it was a great Stone, which weigh'd an hunder'd and three Carats, after it was cut; and the Mill was like ours, only the great Wheel was turn'd by four <hi>Negro's.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> are not of the same opinion that we are; for they do not believe that the weight gives any luster to the Stones. If theirs be not subject to take their luster, 'tis because there is always a Boy that stands with a thin woodden-slice in his hand, and waters the Wheel continually with Oil and Powder of Diamonds. Besides, their Wheel does not go so fast as ours, because the Woodden-wheel that turns the Steel-wheel, is not above three foot in Diameter.</p>
                        <p>They cannot give that lively polishment to Stones, as we give to ours in <hi>Europe;</hi> and I believe the reason to be, because their Wheel does not run so flat as ours. For in regard it is of Steel, to rub it upon the Emeril, as must be done every four and twenty hours, the Tree must be taken off, which can never be put on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106224:222"/>
again so as to run so flat as it did. Had they the invention of Iron-mills, upon which they never use Emeril, but only the File, because there is no necessity to take off the Tree to file the Mill, they might polish their Stones better than they do. I have told you they must either rub the Mill with Emeril, or file it every four and twenty hours. For when the Stone has run for some time, that part of the Mill becomes as smooth and bright as glass: so that if you do not rough it again either with Emeril or the File, the powder will not stay; whereas if the powder stay, there is more work done in an hour than otherwise in two.</p>
                        <p>Though a Diamond be naturally very hard, having a kind of a knot, as you see in wood, the <hi>Indian</hi> Lapidaries will cut the Stone, which our <hi>European</hi> Lapidaries find great difficulty to do, and usually will not undertake to perform; which makes the <hi>Indians</hi> require something more for the fashion.</p>
                        <p>As for the Government of the Mines, they trade very freely, and very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. They pay two <hi>per cent.</hi> to the King for all that they buy: besides that, he has also a duty from the Merchants for leave to dig. The Merchant after he has made search with the Miners, who know all the places where the Diamonds grow, chooses out a place about two-hunder'd paces in compass, where they set at work sometimes fifty, sometimes an hunder'd Miners, as they are in hast of work. And from the day that they begin to work, to the day that they end, the Merchants pay to the King two Pagods a-day; and four when they employ an hunder'd men.</p>
                        <p>These poor people never get above three Pagods all the year long, though they understand their business extremely well; so that their wages being so small, they make no scruple, when they can handsomely, to hide a Stone for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: and in regard they are quite naked, only for a rag about their privities, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are so dextrous as to swallow the Stone. The chief of the Merchants who employ these Miners shew'd me one of them, that had cozen'd him of a Stone, and had put it into the corner of his eye, but he took it from the fellow so soon as he had discover'd the cheat. To prevent this cozenage, there are twelve or fifteen in fifty, who are engag'd to the Merchant, that he shall have no injury done him, nor any thefts committed. If by accident they meet with a Stone that weighs 14 or 16 Carats, they presently carry it to the Master of the work, who gives him in recompence the <hi>Sarpo,</hi> which is a piece of Calicut to make him a Bonnet, to the value of 25 Sous, together with half a Pagod in Silver, or else a whole Pagod, when he gives him neither Rice nor Sugar.</p>
                        <p>The Merchants that come to trade at the Mines keep their Lodgings; and every morning about ten or eleven a clock, after they have din'd, the Masters of the Miners bring their Diamonds to shew them. If the Stones are large, or that there be so many as amount from two-thousand to sixteen-thousand Crowns, they will leave them with the strange Merchant seven or eight days, for the Merchants to consider. When the Merchant has seen the Stones, it becomes him to agree upon the price in a short time. Otherwise the party that owes the Stones, takes them away again, and you shall never see the same Stones again, unless mix'd with others, When the bargain is concluded, the Purchaser gives a Bill of Exchange upon the Banker. If you have agreed to pay him in four days, and make him stay longer, you must pay him down one and an half in the hunder'd for a months in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. Most commonly when they know the Merchant to be sufficient, they will choose to take a Bill of Exchange for <hi>Agra,</hi> for <hi>Golconda,</hi> or <hi>Visapour,</hi> but more especially for <hi>Surat,</hi> as being the most frequented Port in all <hi>India,</hi> where they may furnish themselves with all Commodities which they want.</p>
                        <p>'Tis very pleasant to see the young children of the Merchants and other people of the Countrey, from the age of ten to fifteen or sixteen years, who seat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon a Tree that lies in the void place of the Town: Every one of them has his Diamond-weights in a little Bag hanging at one side, on the other his Purse with five or six-hunder'd Pagods in Gold in it. There they sit expecting when any person will come to sell them some Diamonds. If any person brings them a Stone, they put it into the hands of the eldest Boy among them, who is as it were their chief; who looks upon it, and after that gives it to him that is next him; by which means it goes from hand to hand, till it return to him again, none of the rest speaking one word. After that he demands the price, to buy it if possible;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106224:223"/>
but if he buy it too dear, 'tis upon his own account. In the evening the children compute what they have laid out, then they look upon their Stones, and separate them according to their water, their weight, and clearness. Then they bring them to the great Merchants, who have generally great parcels to match: and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is divided among the children equally; only the chief among them has a fourth in the hunder'd more than the rest. As young as they are, they so well understand the price of Stones, that if one of them have bought any purchase, and is willing to lose one half in the hunder'd, the other shall give him his Money. They shall hardly bring you a parcel of Stones, above a dozen, wherein there is not some flaw or other defect.</p>
                        <p>When I came to the Mine, I went to wait upon the Governour, who told me I was welcome; and because he made no question but that I had brought Gold with me, (for they talk of nothing under Gold at the Mines,) he bid me only lay it in my Chamber, and he would undertake it should be safe. Thereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented me with four servants to watch my Gold day and night, and to follow my orders, bidding me withal fear nothing, but eat, drink, and sleep, and take care of my health; but withal he told me I must be careful of not cheating the King. Thereupon I fell to buying, and found profit enough, above twenty in the hunder'd cheaper than at <hi>Golconda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have one thing to observe which is more than ordinarily curious, concerning the manner how the <hi>Indians,</hi> as well <hi>Mahumetans</hi> as Idolaters, drive their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains. Every thing is done with great silence, and without any talking on either side. The buyer and the seller sit one before another like two Taylors, and the one of the two opening his Girdle, the seller takes the right-hand of the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and covers his own hand and that with his Girdle: under which, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of many Merchants that meet together in the same Hall, the bargain is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly driven without the knowledg of any person. For then the purchaser nor seller speak neither with their mouths nor eyes, but only with the hand, as thus. When the seller takes the purchaser by the whole hand, that signifies a thousand, and as often as he squeezes it, he means so many thousand Pagods or Roupies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Money in question. If he takes but half to the knuckle of the middle-finger, that's as much as to say fifty: The small end of the finger to the first knuckle signifies ten. When he grasps five fingers, it signifies five-hunder'd; if but one finger, one-hunder'd. This is the mystery which the <hi>Indians</hi> use in driving their bargains. And many times it happens, that in the same place, where there are several people, one and the same parcel shall be sold seven or eight times over, and no person know that it was sold in that manner every time.</p>
                        <p>As for the weight of the Stones, no person can be deceiv'd in them, unless he purchase them in hugger-mugger. For if they are publickly bought, there is a person on purpose paid by the King, without any benefit from particular persons, whose place it is to weigh the Diamonds; and when he has spoken the weight, the buyer and seller are satisfi'd in his words, as not being a person any way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to favour any person.</p>
                        <p>Having dispatch'd all my business at the Mine, the Governour appointed me six Horse-men to convoy me through the Territories under his Government, which extends to a River that separates the Kingdom of <hi>Visapour</hi> from that of <hi>Golconda.</hi> 'Tis a very difficult thing to cross that River, it being deep, broad and rapid; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, there are no Boats. But they ferry over Men, Carriages, Oxen and Coaches upon a round Vessel, ten or twelve foot in Diameter, made of Osier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs, like our Flaskets, and cover'd without with Ox-hides; as I have already related. They might easily use Boats, or make a Bridg; but the King of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> will not suffer either, because the River parts the two Kingdoms. Every evening the Ferry-men on both sides are bound to carry to two Governours on each side the River, an exact account of the Persons, Carriages and Merchandizes which they ferri'd over that day.</p>
                        <p>Coming to <hi>Golconda,</hi> I found that the person whom I had left in trust with my Chamber, was dead: but that which I observ'd most remarkable, was, that I found the door sealed with two Seals, one being the <hi>Cadi's</hi> or chief Justice's, the other the <hi>Sha-Bander's,</hi> or Provost of the Merchants. An Officer of Justice, together with the Servants I had left behind, watch'd the Chamber night and day. This
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106224:223"/>
Officer hearing of my arrival, went and gave notice to the <hi>Cadi</hi> and <hi>Sha-Bander,</hi> who sent for me. The <hi>Cadi</hi> presently ask'd me, if the Money I had left in the Chamber where the person dy'd were mine, and how I could prove it. I told him I had no better proofs than the Letters of Exchange which I had brought to the Banker that paid it by my order to the person deceas'd; to whom I had also giv'n farther order, that if the Banker paid me in Silver, he should change the sum into Gold. Thereupon the Bankers were sent for, who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the payments accordingly, the <hi>Cadi</hi> sent his Deputy to op'n the Chamber door; nor would he leave me, till I had counted over my Money, and had assur'd him it was right. After that I return'd to the <hi>Cadi</hi> and the <hi>Sha-Bander,</hi> and signifi'd as much to them; and having paid them some Fees which they demanded, to the value of four Crowns and a half of our Money, I return'd them my thanks for their care. This I relate to shew the justice of the Country.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Authors Journey to the other Mines; and how they find the Diamonds there.</head>
                        <p>SEven days journey from <hi>Golconda</hi> Eastward there is another Diamond Mine, call'd in the language of the Country <hi>Gani,</hi> in the <hi>Persian</hi> tongue <hi>Coulour.</hi> It is near a great Town, by which the same River runs, which I cross'd coming from the other Mine; and a League and a half from the Town is a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the form of a Half-Moon; the space between the Town and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is a Plain where they dig and find Diamonds. The nearer they dig to the Mountain, the larger Stones they find; but at the top they find nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>It is not above a hundred years since this Mine was found out by a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who digging in a piece of ground to sow Millet, found therein a pointed Stone that weigh'd above twenty-five Carats; he not knowing what the Stone was, but seeing it glister, carry'd it to <hi>Golconda,</hi> where as it happen'd well for him, he met with one that traded in Diamonds. The Merchant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself of the place where the Stone was found, admir'd to see a Jewel of that bigness, not having seen any one before that weigh'd above ten or twelve Carats. However his report made a great noise in the Country; insomuch that the Mony'd men in the Town set themselves to work, and causing the ground to be search'd, they found, and still do find bigger Stones, and in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity than in any other Mine. For they found a great number of Stones from ten to forty Carats, and sometimes bigger; among the rest that large Stone that weigh'd nine hundred Carats, which <hi>Mirgimola</hi> presented to <hi>Aureng-zeb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But though this Mine of <hi>Coulour</hi> be so considerable for the quantity of great Stones which are there found, yet the mischief is, the Stones are not clean; the Waters having something of the quality of the Earth where they are found. If the Ground be mershy, the Water enclines to black; if it be red, there is a redness in the Water; in other places the Stones appear somewhat greenish, in others yellowish; such a diversity of Soils there is between the Town and the Mountain. Upon the most part of these Stones after they are cut, there appears a kind of greasie moisture, which must be as often wip'd off.</p>
                        <p>As for the Water of the Stones, it is remarkable, that whereas in <hi>Europe</hi> we make use of day-light to examine the rough Stones, and to judg of their Water, and the specks that are found therein, the <hi>Indians</hi> do all that in the night-time, setting up a Lamp with a large Wiek, in a hole which they make in the Wall, about a soot square; by the light whereof they judg of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and clearness of the Stone, which they hold between their Fingers. The Water which they call celestial is the worst of all, and it is impossible to discern it so long as the Stone is rough. The most infallible way to find out that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106224:224"/>
is to carry the Stone under a Tree thick of Boughs, for by the verdure of that shade you may easily discern whether the Water be blewish or no.</p>
                        <p>The first time I was at the Mine, there were above sixty thousand persons at work, men, women, and children; the men being employ'd to dig, the women, and children to carry the Earth.</p>
                        <p>After the Miners have pitch'd upon the place where they intend to work, they level another place close by, of the same extent, or else a little bigger, which they enclose with a Wall about two foot high. In the bottom of that little Wall, at the distance of every two foot, they make small holes to let in the water; which they stop up afterwards, till they come to drain out the water again. The place being thus prepar'd, the people that are to work meet all together, men, women, and children, with the Workmaster in the Company of his Friends and Relations. Then he brings along with him some little Image of the God that they adore; which being plac'd upright upon the ground, they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselves three times before it, while their Priest says a certain prayer. The prayer being ended, he marks the forehead of every one with a kind of Glue, made of Saffron and Gum, to such a compass as will hold seven or eight Grains of Rice, which he sticks upon it; then having wash'd their bodies with water, which every one brings in his pot, they rank themselves in order to eat what the Workmaster presents them, before they go to work, to encourage them both to labour and be faithful. This Feast consists of nothing else but every one his Plate of Rice, distributed by the <hi>Bramin;</hi> for an Idolater may eat any thing from the hands of one of their Priests. The Plates are made of the Leaves of a certain Tree, not much unlike our Walnut-tree Leaves. Besides this, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one has a quarter of a pound of Butter, melted in a small Copper pot with some Sugar.</p>
                        <p>When their Feast is over, the men fall to digging, the women and children to carry Earth to the place prepar'd in that manner as I have already describ'd, They dig ten, twelve, and sometimes fourteen foot deep; but when they come to any water they leave off. All the Earth being carry'd into the place before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, the men, women, and children with Pitchers throw the water which is in the drains upon the Earth, letting it soak for two or three days, according to the hardness of it, till it come to be a kind of Batter; then they open the holes in the Wall to let out the water, and throw on more water still, till all the mud be wash'd away, and nothing left but the Sand. After that they dry it in the Sun; and then they winnow the Sand in little Winnows, as we winnow our Corn. The small dust flies away, the great remains, which they pour out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon the ground.</p>
                        <p>The Earth being thus winnow'd, they spread it with a kind of Rake, as thin as they possibly can; then with a wooden Instrument, like a Paviers Rammer, about half a foot wide at the bottom, they pound the Earth from one end to the other, two or three times over. After that they winnow it again then; and spreading it at one end of the Van, for fear of losing any of they Earth, the look for the Diamond.</p>
                        <p>Formerly they were wont to pound the Earth with great Flint-stones, instead of wooden Rammers; which made great flaws in the Diamonds, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now left off.</p>
                        <p>Heretofore they made no scruple to buy those Diamonds that had a green outside; for being cut, they prov'd very white, and of an excellent water.</p>
                        <p>Since they have been more nice; for there was a Mine discover'd between <hi>Coulour</hi> and <hi>Raolconda,</hi> which the King caus'd to be shut up again, by reason of some cheats that were us'd there; for they found therein that sort of Stones which had this green outside, fair and transparent, and which appear'd more fair than the others; but when they came to the Mill they crumbl'd to pieces.</p>

                        <p>I come to the third Mine, which is the most ancient of all, in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala.</hi> You may give it the name of <hi>Soumelpour,</hi> which is the name of the Town next to the place where the Diamonds are found; or rather <hi>Gonel,</hi> which is the name of the River in the Sand whereof they seek for the Stones. The Territories through which this River runs, belong to a <hi>Raja,</hi> who was anciently tributary to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> but revolted in the time of the Wars between <hi>Sha-jehan</hi> and <hi>Gehan-guir</hi> his Father. So soon as <hi>Sha-jehan</hi> came to the Empire, he sent to demand his Tribute of this <hi>Raja,</hi> as well for the time past, as to come; who finding that his Revenues were not sufficient to pay him, quitted his Country, and retir'd into the Mountains with his Subjects. Upon his refusal, <hi>Sha-jehan</hi> believing he would stand it out, sent a great Army against him, perswading himself that he should find great store of Diamonds in his Country. But he found neither Diamonds, nor People, nor Victuals, the <hi>Raja</hi> having burnt all the Corn which his Subjects could not carry away; so that the greatest part of <hi>Sha-jehans</hi> Army perish'd for hunger. At length the <hi>Raja</hi> return'd into his Country, upon condition to pay the <hi>Mogul</hi> some slight Tribute.</p>

                           <p>From <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Saferon</hi> you travel Eastward; but from <hi>Saferon</hi> to the Mine you must wind to the South, coming first to a great Town, costes 21</p>
                           <p>This Town belongs to the <hi>Raja</hi> I have spoke of. From thence you go to a Fortress call'd <hi>Rodas,</hi> costes 4</p>
                           <p>This is one of the strongest places in all <hi>Asia,</hi> seated upon a Mountain, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd with six Bastions, and twenty-seven pieces of Cannon, with three Moats full of Water, wherein there are good Fish. There is but one way to come to the top of the Mountain, where there is a Plain half a League in compass, wherein they sow Corn and Rice. There is above twenty Springs that water that Plain; but all the rest of that Mountain from top to bottom is nothing but a steep Precipice cover'd with over-grown Woods. The <hi>Raja's</hi> formerly us'd to live in this Fort with a Garrison of seven or eight hundred men. But the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> has it now; having taken that Fort by the policy of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Mirgimola,</hi> which all the Kings of <hi>India</hi> could never take before. The <hi>Raja</hi> left three Sons, who betray'd one another; the eldest was poison'd, the second went and serv'd the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> who gave him the command of four thousand Horse; the third possesses his Fathers Territories, paying the <hi>Mogul</hi> a small Tribute.</p>
                           <p>From the Fortress of <hi>Rodas</hi> to <hi>Soumelpour,</hi> costes 30</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Soumelpour</hi> is a great Town, the Houses whereof are built of Earth, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd only with Branches of Coco-trees. All these thirty Leagues you travel through Woods, which is a very dangerous passage, as being very much pester'd with Robbers. The <hi>Raja</hi> lives half a League from the Town, in Tents set upon a fair rising ground, at the foot whereof runs the <hi>Gouel,</hi> descending from the Southern Mountains, and falling into <hi>Ganges.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In this River they find the Diamonds. For after the great Rains are over, which is usually in <hi>December,</hi> they stay all <hi>January</hi> till the River be clear; by reason that by that time in some places it is not above two foot deep, and in several places the Sand lies above the water. About the end of <hi>January,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> there flock together out of the great Town,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106224:225"/>
and some others adjoining, above eight thousand persons, men, women and children, that are able to work. They that are skilful know by the sand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Diamonds or no, when they find among the sand little Stones like to those which we call Thunder-Stones. They begin to make search in the River from the Town of <hi>Soumelpour</hi> to the very Mountains from whence the River falls, for fifty Leagues together.</p>
                           <p>Where they believe there are Diamonds, they encompass the place with Stakes, Faggots, and Earth, as when they go about to make the Arch of a Bridg to drain all the water out of that place. Then they dig out all the Sand for two foot deep, which is all carried and spread upon a great place for that purpose prepar'd upon the side of the River; encompass'd with a little Wall about a foot and half high. When they have fill'd this place with as much Sand as they think convenient, they throw water upon it, wash it, and sift it; doing in other things as they do at the Mines which I have already describ'd.</p>
                           <p>From this River come all those fair Points which are call'd natural Points, but a great Stone is seldom found here. The reason why none of these Stones have been seen in <hi>Europe,</hi> is because of the Wars, that have hinder'd the people from working.</p>
                           <p>Besides the Diamond Mine which I have spoken of in the Province of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> which <hi>Mirgimola</hi> caus'd to be shut up, by reason of the yellowness of the Diamonds, and the foulness of the Stones; there is in the Island of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> the largest Island in the World, another River call'd <hi>Succadan,</hi> in the Sand whereof they find Diamonds as hard as any in the other Mines. The principal reason that disswaded me from going to the Island of <hi>Borneo</hi> was, because I understood that the Queen of the Island would not permit any Strangers to carry away any of those Diamonds out of the Island. Those few that are exported, being carry'd out by stealth, and privately sold at <hi>Batavia.</hi> I say the Queen, and not the King, because in that Island the Women have the Soveraign Command, and not the Men. For the people are so curious to have a lawful Heir upon the Throne, that the Husband not being certain that the Children which he has by his Wife are his own; but the Wife being always certain that the Children which she bears are hers, they rather choose to be govern'd by a Woman, to whom they give the Title of Queen; her Husband being only her Subject, and having no power but what she permits him.</p>

                        <p>AT the Mine of <hi>Raolconda</hi> they weigh by Mangelins, a Mangelin being one Carat and three quarters, that is seven Grains.</p>
                        <p>At the Mine of <hi>Gani</hi> or <hi>Coulour</hi> they use the same Weights.</p>
                        <p>At the Mine of <hi>Soumelpour</hi> in <hi>Bengala,</hi> they weigh by Rati's, and the Rati is seven eighths of a Carat, or three Grains and a half. They use the same Weights over all the Empire of the <hi>Mogul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Kingdoms of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour,</hi> they make use of Mangelins: but a Mangelin in those parts is not above one Carat and three eighths. The <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Goa</hi> make use of the same Weights in <hi>Goa;</hi> but a Mangelin there is not above five Grains.</p>
                        <p>As for the Money in use: First, in <hi>Bengala,</hi> in the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> before mention'd, in regard they lye enclos'd within the Dominions of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> they make their payments in Roupies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:106224:225"/>
At the two Mines about <hi>Raolconda</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Visapour,</hi> the payments are made in new Pagods, which the King coins in his own Name, as being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent from the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> The new Pagod is not always at the same value; for it is sometimes worth three Roupies and a half, sometimes more, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times less; being advanc'd and brought down according to the course of Trade, and the correspondence of the Bankers with the Princes and Governors.</p>
                        <p>At the Mine of <hi>Colour</hi> or <hi>Gani,</hi> which belongs to the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> they make their payments in new Pagods, which are equal in value to the King of <hi>Visapour</hi>'s. But sometimes you are forc'd to give four in the hunder'd more, by reason they are better Gold, and besides, they will take no others at the Mine. These Pagods are coin'd by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who, whether willingly or by force, are priviledg'd by the King to coin them in their Forts: And those of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> cost one or two <hi>per cent.</hi> more than the <hi>English,</hi> by reason they are better Gold, and for that the Miners choose them before the other. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Merchants are prepossess'd that the Miners are a rude and savage sort of people, and that the ways are dangerous, they stay at <hi>Golconda,</hi> where the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters keep correspondence with them, and send them their Jewels. There they pay in old Pagods coin'd many ages ago by several Princes that Reign'd in <hi>India</hi> before the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> got footing therein. Those old Pagods are worth four Roupies and a half, that is to say, a Roupy more than the new: not that there is any more Gold in them, or that they weigh any more. Only the Bankers, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the King, not to bring down the price, pay him annually a very great Sum, by reason they get very much by it. For the Merchants receive none of those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods without a Changer to examin them, some being all defac'd, others low-metal, others wanting weight: so that if one of these Bankers were not present at the receipt, the Merchant would be a greater loser, sometimes one, sometimes five, sometimes six i'th hunder'd: for which they also pay them one quarter in the hunder'd for their pains. When the Miners are paid, they also receive their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the presence of Bankers, who tells them which is good, and which is bad; and has for that also one quarter i'th hunder'd. In the payment of a thousand or two-thousand Pagods, the Banker, for his fee, puts them into a bag, and seals it with his Seal; and when the Merchant pays for his Diamonds, he brings the Seller to the Banker, who finding his bag entire, assures the party that all is right and good within; and so there is no more trouble.</p>
                        <p>As for the Roupies, they take indifferently, as well the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s as the King of <hi>Golconda</hi>'s: by reason that those which that King coins, are to be coin'd, by Articles, with the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s stamp.</p>
                        <p>'Tis an idle thing to believe that vulgar error, that it is enough to carry Spices, Tobacco, Looking-glasses, and such trifles to truck for Diamonds at the <hi>Indian-</hi>Mines: For I can assure ye, these people will not only have Gold, but Gold of the best sort too.</p>
                        <p>As for the roads to the Mines, some fabulous modern relations have render'd them very dangerous, and fill'd them full of Lions, Tigers, and cruel People; but I found them not only free from those wild creatures, but also the People very loving and courteous.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Raolconda,</hi> which is the principal Mine, the road is as follows: the road being measur'd by <hi>Gos,</hi> which is four <hi>French-</hi>leagues.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Canapour,</hi> one Gos.</p>

                        <p>That River is the bound between the Kingdoms of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour.</hi>

                        <p>Thus from <hi>Golconda</hi> to the Mine, they reckon it seventeen Gos, or 68 <hi>French-</hi>Leagues.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Golconda</hi> to the Mine of <hi>Coulour</hi> or <hi>Gani,</hi> is reckon'd thirteen Gos and three quarters, or 55 <hi>French-</hi>leagues.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The Rule to know the just price and value of a Diamond of what weight soever, from three to a hunder'd, and upwards: a secret known to very few people in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>I Make no mention of Diamonds of three Carats, the price thereof being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known.</p>
                        <p>First then, as to others above that weight, you must know how much the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond weighs, and see if it be perfect; if it be a thick Stone, well-squar'd, and have all its corners, if the water be white and lively, without specks and flaws. If it be a Stone cut in Facets, which we call a Rose-Diamond, you must take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice whether the form be round or oval, whether it be of a fair breadth, and not of Stones clapt together; whether it be of a good water, and without specks or flaws.</p>
                        <p>Such a Stone weighing one Carat, is worth 150 Livres or more. Now to know how much a Stone of the same perfection, weighing 12 Carats, is worth.</p>
                        <p>Multiply 12 by 12, it makes 144. Then multiply 144 by 150, which is the price of a Stone of one Carat, it comes to 21600 Livres.</p>
                        <p>As for Example. <gap reason="math">
                              <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </p>
                        <p>To know the price of imperfect Diamonds, you must observe the same rule, grounded upon the price of a Stone of one Carat.</p>
                        <p>You have a Diamond of fifteen Carats shewn ye, neither of a good water, nor good form, and full of specks and flaws besides: such a Diamond cannot be worth above 60, or 80, or 100 Livres at most, according to the goodness of the Stone. Multiply therefore the weight of the Diamond of 15 Carats by 15: then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the product, which is 125, by the value of the Stone of one Carat, which we will grant to be 80 Livres, the product whereof is 10000 Livres, the price of a Diamond of 15 Carats.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="143" facs="tcp:106224:226"/>
The Example. <gap reason="math">
                              <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </p>
                        <p>By that it is easy to discover the difference between a perfect and an imperfect Stone. For if that Stone of 15 Carats were perfect, the second multiplication should be wrought by 150, which is the price of a perfect Stone of one Carat: and then the Diamond would come not to 10000 Livres, but to 33750 Livres, that is 23750 Livres more than an imperfect Diamond of the same weight.</p>
                        <p>By this rule observe the price of two the greatest Diamonds of the World for Cut-stones, the one in <hi>Asia,</hi> belonging to the Great <hi>Mogul;</hi> the other in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the possession of the Duke of <hi>Tuscany.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Diamond weighs 279 and 9 16<hi>th</hi> Carats. It is of a perfect good water, of a good shape, with only a little flaw in the edg of the cutting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which goes round about the Stone. Without that flaw, the first Carat were worth 160 Livres, but for that reason I reckon it not at above 150; and so by the rule it comes to 11723278 Livres, 14 Sous, and 3 Liards. Did the Diamond weigh no more than 279 Carats, it would not be worth above 11676150 Livres, so that the nine 16<hi>ths</hi> comes to 47128 Livres, 14 Sous, and 3 Liards.</p>
                        <p>The Great Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi>'s Diamond weighs 139 Carats, clean and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shap'd, cut in facets every way: but in regard the water enclines somewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the colour of Citron, I do not value the first Carat above 135 Livres; so that by the rule the Diamond ought to be worth 2608335 Livres.</p>
                        <p>A Diamond by the Miners is call'd <hi>Iri,</hi> which the <hi>Turks, Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Almas.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of Colour'd Stones, and the Places where they are found.</head>
                        <p>THere are but two places in all the East where Colour'd-Stones are found, within the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> The first is a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain twelve days journey, or there-abouts, from <hi>Siren,</hi> toward the North-east; the name whereof is <hi>Capelan.</hi> In this Mine are found great quantities of Rubies, and Espinels, or Mothers of Rubies, yellow Topazes, blew and white Saphirs, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths, Amethysts, and other Stones of different colours. Among these Stones which are hard, they find other Stones of various colours, that are very soft, which they call <hi>Bacan</hi> in the language of the Countrey, but are of little or no esteem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Siren</hi> is the name of the City where the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> resides; and <hi>Ava</hi> is the Port of his Kingdom. From <hi>Ava</hi> to <hi>Siren</hi> you go by water in great flat-bottom'd-Barks, which is a voyage of sixty days. There is no going by land, by reason the Woods are full of Lions, Tigers, and Elephants. It is one of the poorest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys in the World, where there is no Commodity but Rubies; the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue whereof amounts not to above a hunder'd-thousand Crowns. Among all the Stones that are there found, you shall hardly see one of three or four Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106224:227"/>
that is absolutely clean, by reason that the King strictly enjoyns his Subjects not to export them out of his Dominions; besides that, he keeps to himself all the clean Stones that are found. So that I have got very considerably in my Travels, by carrying Rubies out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Asia.</hi> Which makes me very much suspect the relation of <hi>Vincent le Blanc,</hi> who reports that he saw in the King's Palace Rubies as big as eggs.</p>
                        <p>All Rubies are sold by weights, which are call'd <hi>Ratis;</hi> that is, three grains and a half, or seven 8<hi>ths</hi> of a Carat: and the payments are made in old Pagods.</p>
                        <p>A Ruby weighing one Ratis, has been sold for Pagods 20</p>
                        <p>A Ruby of 2 Ratis and one 8<hi>th,</hi> Pagods 85</p>
                        <p>A Ruby of 3 Ratis and one 4<hi>th,</hi> Pagods 185</p>
                        <p>A Ruby of 4 Ratis and five 8<hi>ths,</hi> Pagods 450</p>
                        <p>A Ruby of 5 Ratis, Pagods 525</p>
                        <p>A Ruby of 6 Ratis and a half, Pagods 920</p>
                        <p>If a Ruby exceed six Ratis, and be a perfect Stone, there is no value to be set upon it.</p>
                        <p>The Natives of the Countrey call all Colour'd-Stones Rubies, distinguishing them only by the colour. Saphirs they call Blue-Rubies, Amethysts they call Violet-Rubies, Topazes Yellow-Rubies; and so of other Stones.</p>
                        <p>The other place where Rubies are found, is a River in the Island of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> which descends from certain high Mountains in the middle of the Island; which swells very high when the rains fall; but when the waters are low, the people make it their business to search among the Sands for Rubies, Saphirs and Topazes. All the Stones that are found in this River, are generally fairer and clearer than those of <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I forgot to tell you that there are some Rubies, but more Balleis-Rubies, and an abundance of Bastard-Rubies, Saphirs and Topazes found in the Mountains that run along from <hi>Pegu</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Camboya.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Colour'd-Stones are also found in some parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi> In <hi>Hungary</hi> there is a Mine where they find certain Flints of different big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, some as big as eggs, some as big as a man's fist, which being broken, contain a Ruby within as hard and as clean as those of <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In <hi>Hungary</hi> there is a Mine of Opals, which Stone is no-where else to be found in the World but there.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Turquoise</hi> is no-where to be found but in <hi>Persia.</hi> Where there are two Mines. The one is called the <hi>Old-Rock,</hi> three days journey from <hi>Meched,</hi> toward the North-west, near a great Town which goes by the name of <hi>Michabourg.</hi> The other which is call'd the <hi>New-Rock</hi> is five days journey off. Those of the <hi>New-Rock</hi> are of a paler blue enclining to white, and less esteem'd, so that you may have a great many for a little Money. Some years since the King of <hi>Persia</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that no <hi>Turquoises</hi> should be digg'd out of the <hi>Old-Rock,</hi> but only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; making use of those <hi>Turquoises</hi> instead of enamelling, to adorn Hilts of Swords, Knives and Daggers; of which the <hi>Persians</hi> are altogether ignorant.</p>
                        <p>As for Emraulds, it is a vulgar error to say they come originally from the East. And therefore when Jewellers and Gold-smiths, to prefer a deep-colour'd Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld enclining to black, tell ye, it is an Oriental Emrauld, they speak that which is not true. I confess I could never discover in what part of our Continent those Stones are found. But sure I am, that the Eastern-part of the World never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd any of those Stones, neither in the Continent, nor in the Islands. True it is, that since the discovery of <hi>America</hi> some of those Stones have been often brought rough from <hi>Peru</hi> to the <hi>Philippine-</hi>Islands, whence they have been transported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe;</hi> but this is not enough to make them Oriental. Besides that, at this time they send them into <hi>Spain</hi> through the North-Sea.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of Pearls, and the Places where they Fish for them.</head>
                        <p>IN the first place, there is a Fishery for Pearls in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, round about the Island of <hi>Bakren.</hi> It belongs to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and there is a strong Fort in it, Garrison'd with three hundred men. The Water which the people drink in that Island, and all along the Coast of <hi>Persia,</hi> is brackish and ill-tasted, so that only the Natives of the Country can drink it. Fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter costs Strangers very dear; for the people fetch it sometimes one League, sometimes two Leagues from the Island, from the bottom of the Sea, being let down by a Rope, with a Bottle or two ty'd about their wastes, which they fill, and stop it well; and then giving the Rope a twitch, are hall'd up again by their Companions.</p>
                        <p>Every one that fishes pays to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> five <hi>Abassi's,</hi> whether he get any thing or no. The Merchant also pays the King some small matter for every thousand Oysters.</p>
                        <p>The second Fishery for Pearls is right against <hi>Bakren</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> the happy, near the City of <hi>Catifa,</hi> which together with all the Country about it, is under the Jurisdiction of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince. The Pearls that are fish'd in these places are sold to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who are not so nice as we; for they give a good price for all, as well the uneven as the round ones. Over all <hi>Asia</hi> they chuse the yellow Water enclining to white; for they say those Pearls that encline somewhat to a Gold colour, are more brisk, and never change colour; but that the white ones will change in thirty-years time, throughthe very heat of the weather and the sweat of the person that wears them, turning the scandalously yellow.</p>
                        <p>There is a wondrous Pearl in the possession of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, that took <hi>Mascate</hi> from the <hi>Portugals.</hi> He then call'd himself <hi>Imenhect</hi> Prince of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caté;</hi> being known before only by the name of <hi>Aceph Ben-Ali</hi> Prince of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennaé.</hi> It is but a small Province, but it is the best of all in the Happy <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</hi> Therein grow all things necessary for the life of man; particularly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate fruits, but more especially most excellent Grapes, which would make most incomparable Wine. This Prince has the most wonderful Pearl in the world, not so much for its bigness, for it weighs not above twelve Carats and one sixteenth, nor for its perfect roundness, but because it is so clear and so transparent that you may almost see through it. The Great <hi>Mogul</hi> offer'd him by a <hi>Banian</hi> forty thousand Crowns for his Pearl, but he would not accept it. By which you see, that it is more profitable to carry Jewels that are rare out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> than to bring them out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe;</hi> unless it be to <hi>Japan</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> where Jewels are little esteem'd.</p>
                        <p>There is another Fishery for Pearls in the Sea that beats against the Walls of a great Town call'd <hi>Manar,</hi> in the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> For their roundness and their Water, they are the fairest that are found in any other Fishery; but they rarely weigh above three or four Carats.</p>
                        <p>There are excellent Pearls, and of a very good water, and large, which are found upon the Coast of <hi>Japan;</hi> but there are few fish'd for, in regard Jewels are of no esteem among the Natives.</p>
                        <p>There are other Fisheries in the West <hi>Indies;</hi> in the first place all along the Island of <hi>Cubagna,</hi> three Leagues in compass, lying ten Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude, a hundred and sixty Leagues from <hi>Santo Domingo.</hi> The Pearls are small, seldom weighing above five Carats.</p>
                        <p>The second Fishery is in the Island of <hi>Manguerita,</hi> or the Island of Pearls, a League from <hi>Cubagna,</hi> but much bigger. This Fishery is not the most plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, but it is the most esteem'd of all those in the West <hi>Indies,</hi> by reason the Pearls are of most excellent water, and very large. I sold one Pear-fashion'd to <hi>Sha-Est-Kan,</hi> the Great <hi>Moguls</hi> Uncle, that weigh'd fifty-five Carats.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106224:228"/>
The third Fishery is at <hi>Camogete,</hi> near the Continent.</p>
                        <p>The fourth at <hi>Rio de la Hacha,</hi> all along the same Coast.</p>
                        <p>The fifth and last, at St. <hi>Martha's,</hi> sixty Leagues from <hi>Rio de la Hacha.</hi> All these three Fisheries produce very weighty Pearls; but they are generally ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shap'd, and of a water enclining to the colour of Lead.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Scotch</hi> Pearl, and those that are found in the Rivers of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> tho a Neck-lace of them may be worth a thousand Crowns, yet they are not to be compar'd with the Eastern and West <hi>Indian</hi> Pearls.</p>
                        <p>Some years since there was a Fishery discover'd in a certain place upon the the Coast of <hi>Japan,</hi> and I have seen some which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have brought thence. They are of a very good water, and large, but very uneven.</p>
                        <p>Take this observation along with you, touching the difference of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; some being very white, others inclining to yellow, others to black, others to a leaden colour. As for the last, there are no such but only in <hi>America,</hi> which proceeds from the nature of the Earth at the bottom of the Water, which is generally more ouzy than in the East. I once met with six Pearls in the return of a Cargo from the West <hi>Indies</hi> that were perfectly round, but black like jet, which weigh'd one with another twelve Carats. I carried them into the East <hi>Indies</hi> to put them off, but could meet with no Chapman to buy them. As for those that incline to yellow, it proceeds from hence, that the Fishermen selling the Oysters to the Merchants in heaps, while they stay fourteen or fifteen days till the Oysters lose their water, the Oysters wast and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to smell, for which reason the Pearl grows yellow by injection, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a truth, in regard that where the Oysters preserve their Jiquor the Pearls are white. Now the reason why they stay till the Oysters open of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is because that if they should force them open, they might perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and cut the Pearl. In short, the Eastern people are much of our humour in matter of whiteness, for they love the whitest Pearls and the blackest Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; the whitest bread, and the fairest women.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> How the Pearls are bred in the Oysters; how they Fish for them, and at what time.</head>
                        <p>SOme ancient Writers have vulgarly reported, that Pearls are produc'd by the Dew of Heaven, and that there is but one in an Oyster; but experience teaches the contrary. For the Oyster never stirs from the bottom of the Sea, where the Dew can never come, which is many times twelve fathoms deep; besides, that it is as often observ'd, that there are six or seven Pearls in one Oyster; and I have had in my hands an Oyster, wherein there were above ten beginning to breed. Tis very true, that they are not always of the same bigness; for they grow in an Oyster after the same manner as Eggs in the Belly of a Pullet. But I cannot say there are Pearls in all, for you may open many Oysters and find none.</p>
                        <p>'Tis no advantage to them that fish for Pearls; for if the poor people could find any other employment, they would never stick to such a one as meerly keeps them alive. But the Land is so barren, that you may travel twenty Leagues before you meet with one blade of Grass; and the people are so miserably poor, that they feed upon nothing but Dates and Salt-fish.</p>
                        <p>They fish in the Eastern Seas twice a year; the first time in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> the second time in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September;</hi> and they keep their Fairs in <hi>June'</hi> and <hi>November.</hi> However they do not fish every year; for they that fish, will know beforehand whether it will turn to account or no. Now to the end they may not be deceiv'd, they send to the places where they are wont to fish, seven or eight Barks, who bring back each of them about a thousand Oyste<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:106224:228"/>
which they open, and if they find not in every thousand Oysters to the value of five Fano's of Pearl, which amounts to half a Crown of our Money, 'tis a sign that the Fishing will not turn to account, in regard the poor people would not be able to defray their charge. For partly for a stock to set out, and partly for victuals while they are abroad, they are forc'd to borrow Money at three and four in the hundred a month. So that unless a thousand Oysters yeild them five Fano's of Pearls, they do not fish that year. As for the Merchants, they must buy their Oysters at hap-hazard, and be content with what they find in them. If they meet with great Pearls, they account themselves happy; which they seldom do at the Fishery of <hi>Manar,</hi> those Pearls being fit for little else but to be sold by the Ounce, to powder. Sometimes a thousand Oysters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to seven Fano's, and the whole Fishery to a hundred thousand Piasters. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> take of every Diver eight Piasters, in regard they always attend the Fishery with two or three small Men of War, to defend them from the <hi>Malavares</hi> Pyrats.</p>
                        <p>The more Rain falls in the year, the more profitable the Fishery happens to be. They fish in twelve fathom water, five or six Leagues off at Sea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two hundred and fifty Barks together, among which there is not above one or two Divers at most.</p>
                        <p>There is a Cord ty'd under the Arms of them that dive, one end whereof is held by them that are in the Bark. There is also a great stone of eighteen or twenty pound ty'd to the great Toe of him that dives; the end of the Rope that fastens it being also held by them in the Vessel. The Diver has beside a Sack made like a Net, the mouth whereof is kept open with a Hoop. Thus provided, he plunges into the Sea, the weight of the stone presently sinking him; when he is at the bottom, he slips off the stone, and the Bark puts off. Then the Diver goes to filling his Sack, as long as he can keep his breath; which when he can do no longer, he gives the Rope a twitch, and is presently hall'd up again. Those of <hi>Manar</hi> are better Fishers, and stay longer in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than those of <hi>Bakren</hi> and <hi>Catifa;</hi> for they neither put Pincers upon their Noses, nor Cotton in their Ears, as they do in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf.</p>
                        <p>After the Diver is draw'n up, he stays half a quarter of an hour to take breath, and then dives again, for ten or twelve hours together. As for the Oysters themselves, they throw 'em away, as being ill-tasted and unsavoury.</p>
                        <p>To conclude the discourse of Pearls, you are to take notice, that in <hi>Europe</hi> they sell them by the Carat weight, which is four Grains. In <hi>Persia</hi> they sell them by the Abas, and one Abas is an eighteenth less than our Carat. In the Dominions of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Visapour</hi> and <hi>Golconda</hi> weigh them by the Ratis, and one Ratis is also an eighteenth less than our Carat.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Goa</hi> was formerly the greatest place of the world for the trade of Jewels and Pearls. You must know therefore, that in <hi>Goa,</hi> and in all other places which the <hi>Portugals</hi> had in the <hi>Indies,</hi> they us'd a particular weight to sell their Pearls by, which they call Chego's; the proportion whereof to Carats appears in the following Table.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of Coral, and Yellow Amber, and the places where it is found.</head>
                        <p>COral, but little valu'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> is highly esteem'd in all the three other parts of the World; and there are three places where they fish for it upon the Coast of <hi>Sardigna.</hi> That of <hi>Arguerrel</hi> is the fairest of all. The second place is call'd <hi>Boza;</hi> and the third is neer the Island of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> There are two other places upon the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> the one neer the Bastion of <hi>France;</hi> the other at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque.</hi> There is also another Fishery upon the Coast of <hi>Sicily,</hi> neer <hi>Trepano,</hi> but the Coral is small, and ill-colour'd. There is another upon the Coast of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> neer <hi>Cape de Quiers;</hi> where the Coral is large, and of an excellent colour, but the branches are short. There is a ninth Fishery in the Island of <hi>Majorque,</hi> much like that neer the Island of <hi>Corsica.</hi> And these are all the places in the <hi>Medster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean-Sea,</hi> where they fish for Coral; for there is none at all in the Ocean.</p>
                        <p>Because that Coral grows under the hollow Rocks where the Sea is deep, the Fishers fix two spars of wood a-cross, fastening a great piece of Lead in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to make it sink: after that they wind carelesly about the spar good store of tufted Hemp, and fasten the wood to two Cords, one end whereof hangs at the Poop, the other at the Prow of the Vessel. Then letting go the wood with the stream or current by the sides of the Rock, the Hemp twists it self among the Coral, so that sometimes they stand in need of five or six Boats to pull up the wood again: and if one of the Cables should chance to break with the stress, all the Rowers are in danger to be lost. While they tear up the Coral thus by force, there tumbles as much into the Sea as they fetch up: and the bottom of the Sea being generally very ouzy, the Coral will be eaten as our fruits are eaten by the worms; so that the sooner they get it out of the mud, the less it will be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</p>
                        <p>This puts me in mind of one thing that I saw at <hi>Marseilles</hi> in a Shop where they dealt in Coral. It was a great piece of Coral, as big about as a man's fist, which because it was a little worm-eaten, was cut in two pieces. When it was so cut, there was a worm that stirr'd, and had life, and liv'd for some months after, being again put into the hole. For among some branches of Coral there engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a kind of spongy-matter, like our honey-combs, where these worms lye like bees.</p>
                        <p>Some think that Coral is soft in the Sea, though in truth it be hard. But this indeed is as true, that in certain months of the year you may squeze out of the end of a branch a kind of milky-substance; and this perhaps may be a kind of seed, which falling upon any thing that it first meets with in the Sea (as if it light upon a dead Skull, the blade of a Sword, or a Pomgranate) produces another branch of Coral. And I have seen a Pomgranate, and had it in my hand, that had fallen into the Sea, about which the Coral had twin'd at least half a foot high.</p>
                        <p>They fish for Coral from the beginning of <hi>April</hi> to the end of <hi>July;</hi> to which purpose there are employ'd above 200 Vessels, some years more, and some years less. They are built all along the River of <hi>Genoa,</hi> being very swift. Their sails are very large for more swiftness, so that there are no Gallies can reach them. There are seven men and a boy to every Barque. They never fish above forty miles from the Land, where they think there are Rocks, for fear of the Pyrats, from which they make all the Sail they can when they see them, and easily scape them through the nimbleness of their Vessels.</p>
                        <p>I have one observation to make concerning Coral, in respect of the Eastern-people. The <hi>Japonners</hi> make little account of Jewels or Pearls; valuing nothing so much as a good grain of Coral, wherewith they pull the string that shuts their Purses, such as we had formerly in <hi>England.</hi> So that they strive who shall have the fairest grain of Coral hanging at the end of the Silk-string that draws their Purses. For this reason a piece of Coral as big as an egg, fair and clean without any flaw, will produce what any man will ask in reason for it. The <hi>Portugueses</hi>
                           <pb n="152" facs="tcp:106224:235"/>
have assur'd me they would sometimes give 20000 Crowns for such a piece. And no wonder they will give so much Money for a piece of Coral, who despising all other Jewels and Pearls, care for nothing but that which is in no esteem any where else. They set a great value upon the Skin of a certain Fish which is rougher than a Seal-skin. Upon the back of the Fish there are six little holes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eight, somewhat elevated, with another in the middle; in the form of a Rose. They make Scabberds for Swords of the Skin; and the more those holes grow in the form of a Rose, the higher value they put upon them; having giv'n ten-thousand Crowns for a Skin. To conclude the discourse of Coral, you must know that the meaner sort of people use it for Bracelets and Neck-laces all over <hi>Asia,</hi> especially toward the Northern Territories of the Great <hi>Mogul;</hi> and all along the Mountains as you go to the Kingdom of <hi>Asen</hi> and <hi>Boutan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yellow-Amber is only found upon the Coast of <hi>Prussia</hi> in the <hi>Baltick-Sea,</hi> where the Sea throws it upon the Sand when such and such winds blow. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who is Sovereign of that Coast, farms it out for 20000 Crowns a year, and sometimes 22000. And the Farmers keep guards on both sides of the shoar, in regard the Sea casts it up sometimes upon one side, and sometimes upon the other, to prevent the stealing of it.</p>
                        <p>Amber is nothing but a certain congelation made in the Sea, like a certain Gum; for you shall find in several pieces, Flies, Gnats, and other insects congeal'd therein. I saw seven or eight Flies so congeal'd in one peice.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>China,</hi> when any great Lord makes a Feast, it is for his Grandeur and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence to cause three or four several sorts of Perfuming-pots to be set upon the Table, and to throw into every one of them a vast quantity of Amber; for the more it burns, and the bigger the pieces are, the more magnificent is the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment accounted. The reason of this custom is, because they adore the fire; and besides, that the Amber casts forth a scent pleasing to the <hi>Chineses,</hi> there is a kind of Oil in it, that flames after a more unusual manner than other materials of fire. This wast of Amber makes it the best Commodity that could be imported into <hi>China,</hi> if the Trade were free for Strangers. At present the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have engross'd all this Trade to themselves, and the <hi>Chineses</hi> come all to <hi>Batavia</hi> to buy it.</p>
                        <p>As for Amber-grise; there is no person in the World that knows either what it is, or where, or how it is produc'd. But the fairest probability is, that it must be only in the Eastern-Sea: though some parcels have been found upon the Coast of <hi>England,</hi> and in some other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> The greatest quantity is found upon the Coast of <hi>Melinda,</hi> but more especially int he mouth of a River call'd <hi>Rio de Sena.</hi> The Governor of <hi>Mozambique</hi> gets in the three years of his Government above 300000 Pardo's of Amber-grise, every Pardo containing 27 Sous of our Money. Sometimes they meet with very large and very considerable pieces. In the year 1627 a <hi>Portugal</hi> setting Sail from <hi>Goa</hi> to the <hi>Manilles,</hi> after he had past the Streight of <hi>Malacca,</hi> was by tempest driv'n near an unknown Island, where they came to an Anchor. Several of the Ship's-Company ventring a-shore, met with a River; and going to bath themselves in it, one of them found a great piece of Amber-grise that weigh'd thirty-three pounds; but falling together by the ears about their shares, the Captain, to reconcile them, told them 'twas pitty to deface it, in regard it was a Present fit for the King; and therefore advis'd them to present it to the Vice-Roy, who would no doubt reward them for their pains. By that means the Captain got the parcel out of their clutches, and presenting it to the Vice-Roy, got a reward for himself; and the Party that found it: but the rest had nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1646 or 1647, a <hi>Middleburgher</hi> of good quality found a piece of forty-two pounds upon the Coast of the Island of St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company, East of the Island of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and sent it to <hi>Batavia:</hi> but there being a mark, as if some piece of it were broken off, the <hi>Zelander</hi> was accus'd to have taken half, and turn'd out of his Command, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he could say to justify himself.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of Musk and Bezoar; and some other Medicinal Stones.</head>
                        <p>THE best sort, and the greatest quantity of Musk, comes from the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan,</hi> from whence they bring it to <hi>Patna,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Bengala,</hi> to truck it away for other Commodities. All the Musk that is sold in <hi>Persia</hi> comes from thence. And the Musk-Merchants had rather deal with you for Coral and Yellow-Amber, than for Gold or Silver; in regard the other is more in esteem among the Natives where they live. I was so curious as to bring the Skin of one to <hi>Paris,</hi> of which I caus'd the figure to be cut.</p>
                        <p>After they have kill'd the creature, they cut off the bladder that grows under the belly as big as an egg, neerer to the genital parts than to the navil. Then they take out the Musk that is in the bladder, which at that time looks like clotted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood. When the Natives would adulterate their Musk, they stuff the bladder with the liver and blood of the Animal slic'd together, after they have taken out as much of the right Musk as they think convenient. This mixture in two or three years time produces certain Animals in the bladder that eat the good Musk; so that when you come to open it, there is a great wast. Others, so soon as they have cut off the bladder, and taken out as much of the Musk, as that the deceit may not be too palpable, fill up the Vessel with little stones to make it weight. The Merchants are less displeas'd at this deceit than the former, by reason that they do not find the Musk to be eaten. But the deceit is harder to be discover'd, when they make little Purses of the skin of the belly of the Beast, which they sow up with strings of the same skin, which are like the true bladders; and then fill those Purses with what they have taken out of the right bladders, and the other fraudulent mixture which they design to put among it. True it is, that should they tye up the bladder so soon as they cut it off, without giving it air or time to lose its force, the strength of the perfume would cause the blood to gush out of the nose, so that it must be qualifi'd to render it acceptable, or rather less hurtful to the brain. The scent of the Beast which I carri'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> was so strong, that I could not keep it in my Chamber; for it made all peoples heads ake that came neer it. At length my Servants laid it in a Garret, and cut: off the bladder, and yet the scent remain'd very strong. This creature is not to be found in 65 degrees, but in 60 there are vast numbers, the Countrey being all over co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Forrests. True it is, that in the months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> after these creatures have endur'd a sharp hunger, by reason of the great Snows that fall where they breed, ten or twelve foot deep, they will come to 44 or 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to fill them themselves with Corn and new Rice. And then it is that the Natives lay gins and snares for them to catch them as they go back: shooting some with Bows, and knocking others o'the heads. Some have assur'd me that they are so lean and faint with hunger at that time, that you may almost take them running. There must be surely a prodigious number of these creatures, none of them having above one bladder no bigger than a Hen's-egg, which will not yield above half an ounce of Musk: and sometimes three or four will not afford an ounce; and yet what a world of Musk is bought up?</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Boutan</hi> fearing that the cheats and adulterations of Musk would spoil the Musk-Trade, order'd that none of the Bladders should be fow'd up, but that they should be all brought to <hi>Boutan,</hi> and there, after due inspection, be seal'd up with his Seal. Yet notwithstanding all the wariness and care of the King, they will sometimes cunningly open them, and put in little pieces of Lead to augment the weight. In one Voyage to <hi>Patna</hi> I bought 7673 bladders, that weigh'd 2557 ounces and an half; and 452 ounces out of the bladder.</p>
                        <p>Bezoar comes from a Province of the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda</hi> toward the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east. It is found among the ordure in the paunch of a wild-Goat, that browzes upon a certain Tree, the name whereof I have forgot. This shrub bears little buds, round about which, and the tops of the boughs, the Bezoar engenders in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106224:237"/>
the maw of the Goat. It is shap'd according to the form of the buds or tops of the branches which the Goats eat: which is the reason there are so many shapes of Bezoar-Stones. The Natives, by feeling the belly of the Goat, know how many Stones she has within, and sell the Goat according to the quantity. This they will find out by sliding their hands under their bellies, and then shaking both sides of the paunch; for the Stones will fall into the middle, where they may easily count them all by their feeling.</p>
                        <p>The rarity of Bezoar is in the bigness; though the small Bezoar has the same vertue as that which is larger. But there is more deceit in the large Bezoar; for the Natives have got a trick to add to the bigness of the Stone, with a certain Paste compos'd of Gum, and something else of the colour of Bezoar. And they are so cunning too, to shape it just like natural Bezoar. The cheat is found out two ways; the first is by weighing the Bezoar, and then steeping it in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if neither the water change colour, nor the Bezoar lose any thing of its weight, the Stone is right. The other way is to thrust a red-hot Bodkin of Iron into the Stone; if the Bodkin enters, and causes it to fry, there is a mixture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar is dearer according to the bigness of the Stones, advancing in price like Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. For if five or six Bezoars weigh an ounce, an ounce will be worth fifteen or eighteen Franks; but if it be a Stone of one ounce, that very ounce is well worth 100 Franks. I have sold one of four ounces and a half for 2000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres.</p>
                        <p>I have been very curious to inform my self of all things that concern'd the nature of Bezoar; but could never learn in what part of the body of the Goat it was to be found. One time among the rest, having oblig'd several Native Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants by putting off for them a great quantity of Bezoar; upon my request, though it be death without mercy to transport any of these Goats out of the Countrey, they brought me six Goats by stealth to my lodging. When I ask'd the price of them, I was surpriz'd, when they told me one was worth but three Roupies; that the two other were worth four Roupies; and the three others four and three quarters a piece. I ask'd them why some were more worth than others; but I found afterwards that the first had but one Bezoar, that the rest had two, or three, or four. The six Goats had in all seventeen Bezoars in them, and a half one, as big as the half of a Hazel-nut. The inside was like the soft ordure of the Goat, the Bezoar lying among the dung, which is in the belly of the Goat. Some averr'd that they grew right against the liver, others right against the heart, but I could never find out the truth.</p>
                        <p>As well in the East, as West, there are a great quantity of Bezoars that breed in the same manner in Cows; of which there have been some that have weigh'd seventeen or eighteen ounces; For there was such a one that was giv'n to the Great Duke of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> But those Bezoars are little esteem'd, six grains of the other Bezoar working more powerfully than thirty of this.</p>
                        <p>As for the Bezoar which breeds in Apes, as some believe, it is so strong, that two grains work as effectually as six of Goat's-Bezoar: but it is very scarce, as being only sound in those Apes that breed in the Island of <hi>Macassar.</hi> This sort of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar is round, whereas the other is of several fashions, as I said before. As the Apes Bezoar is stronger, and scarcer than the Goats, so it is dearer, and more sought after; a piece as big as a nut, being sometimes worth a hunder'd Crowns. The <hi>Portugals</hi> make great account of this Bezoar, standing always upon their guard for fear of being poison'd.</p>
                        <p>There is another Stone in great esteem, that is call'd the Porcupine's-Stone, which that creature is said to carry in its head, and is more precious than Bezoar against poison. If it be steep'd in water a quarter of an hour, the water becomes so bitter, that nothing can be more bitter. There is also a Stone sometimes found in the belly of that creature of the same nature; and as good as that which comes from the head; nevertheless with this difference, that being steep'd in water, it loses nothing of its weight nor bulk, as the other does. I have bought in my time three of those Stones. One of them cost me 500 Crowns, and I exchang'd it to advantage. I paid four-hunder'd Crowns for the other, which I keep: the other was sold me for 200 Crowns, which I presented to a friend.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:106224:237"/>
There is the Serpent-Stone not to be forgot, about the bigness of a <hi>double;</hi> and some are almost oval, thick in the middle, and thin about the sides. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> report that it is bred in the head of certain Serpents. But I rather take it to be a Story of the Idolater's Priests, and that the Stone is rather a composition of certain drugs. Whatever it be, it is of excellent vertue to drive any venom out of those that are bit by venomous creatures. If the person bit be not much wounded, the place must be incis'd; and the Stone being appli'd thereto, will not fall off till it has drawn all the poison to it. To cleanse it, you must steep it in Womans-milk, or for want of that, in Cows-milk; after the Stone has lain ten or twelve hours, the milk will turn to the colour of an Apostemated matter. The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Goa</hi> carrying me to his Cabinet of Rarities, shew'd me one of these Stones: and after he had assur'd me of the rare qualities it had, he gave it me. Once as he cross'd a Mersh in the Island of <hi>Salseté</hi> where <hi>Goa</hi> stands, one of the men that carri'd his <hi>Pallequis,</hi> béing half naked, was bit by a Serpent, and heal'd at the same time. I bought several; but there are none but the <hi>Bramines</hi> that sell them, which makes me believe that they compound them. There are two ways to try whether the Serpent-Stone be true or false. The first is, by putting the Stone in your mouth, for then it will give a leap, and fix to the palate. The other is, by putting it in a glass full of water; for if the Stone be true, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will fall a boyling, and rise in little bubbles up to the top of the Glass.</p>
                        <p>There is another Stone, which is call'd the Serpent's-Stone with the hood. This is a kind of Serpent that has a kind of a hood hanging down behind the head, as it is represented in the Figure. And it is behind this hood that the Stone is found, many times as big as a Pullet's-egg. There are some Serpents both in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America</hi> of a monstrous bigness, 25 foot long; as was that, the skin whereof is kept in <hi>Batavia,</hi> which had swallow'd a Maid of 18 years of age. These Stones are not found in any of those Serpents that are not at least two foot long. This Stone being rubb'd against another Stone, yields a certain slime, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drank in water by the person that has the poison in his body, powerfully drives it out. These Serpents are no-where to be found but upon the Coasts of <hi>Mclinde;</hi> but for the Stones you may buy them of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Mariners and Souldiers that come from <hi>Mozambique.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>JApon,</hi> which consists of several Islands Eastward of <hi>China,</hi> bending to the North, some people believing that <hi>Niphon,</hi> which is the biggest, is in a manner join'd to the firm Land, is that Region of all <hi>Asia</hi> that yields the greatest quantity of Gold: Though others believe it is found in the Island of <hi>Formosa,</hi> and carri'd thence to <hi>Japon.</hi> For as long as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have had the Island, they could never yet tell what is the Trade of that Coast, whence they believe the Gold comes.</p>
                        <p>There comes also Gold from <hi>China,</hi> which the <hi>Chineses</hi> exchange for the Silver which is brought them. For price for price, they love Silver better than Gold; because they have no Silver-Mines. Yet it is the coarsest metal of all the <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tsck</hi> Gold.</p>
                        <p>The Island of <hi>Celebes</hi> or <hi>Macassar</hi> produces Gold also, which is drawn out of the Rivers, where it rowls among the Sand.</p>
                        <p>In the Island of <hi>Achen</hi> or <hi>Sumatra,</hi> after the rainy season, when the Torrents are wasted, they find veins of Gold in the Flints, which the waters wash down from the Mountains that lye toward the North-east. Upon the West-side of the Island, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> come to lade their Pepper, the Natives bring them great store of Gold, but very coarse metal, if not worse than that of <hi>China.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Toward the <hi>Thibet,</hi> which is the ancient <hi>Caucasus,</hi> in the Territories of a <hi>Raja,</hi> beyond the Kingdom of <hi>Cachemir,</hi> there are three Mountains close one by another, one of which produces excellent Gold, the other Granats, and the third <hi>Lapis-Lazuli.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is Gold also comes from the Kingdom of <hi>Tipra,</hi> but it is coarse, almost as bad as that of <hi>China;</hi> and these are all the places in <hi>Asia</hi> that produce Gold. I shall now say something of the Gold of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the places where it is found in greatest quantities.</p>
                        <p>Observe by the way, that the Vice-Roy of <hi>Mozambique</hi> has under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Governors of <hi>Sofala</hi> and <hi>Chepon-Goura.</hi> The first of these two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments lies upon the River <hi>Sene,</hi> sixty leagues from the Mouth of the River; and the other ten leagues higher. From the Mouth of the River to those very places on each side of the River, great numbers of Negro's inhabit, which are all commanded by one <hi>Portugueze.</hi> The <hi>Portuguezes</hi> have been Masters of this Countrey for many years, where they take upon them like Lords, and make War one upon another for the slightest occasions in the World; some of them having under them five-thousand <hi>Cafres,</hi> which are their Slaves. The Governor of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambique</hi> furnishes them with Calicuts, and all other necessary Commodities which they want, which he sells them at his own rates. When he enters upon his Government he carries with him great quantities of all sorts of Commodities, especially Calicuts dy'd black. His Correspondents also in <hi>Goa</hi> send him every year two Vessels, which he sends to <hi>Sofala, Chepon-Goura,</hi> and even as far as the City of <hi>Monomotopa,</hi> the chief City of a Kingdom of the same name, otherwise call'd <hi>Vouvebaran,</hi> distant from <hi>Chepon-Goura</hi> fifty leagues, or there-abouts. He that commands all that Countrey, assumes the name of Emperor of <hi>Monomotopa,</hi> extending his Dominions as far as the Confines of <hi>Prestor John</hi>'s Countrey. From this Countrey of <hi>Monomotopa</hi> it is, that the most pure and finest Gold of all <hi>Africa</hi> comes: where they dig it with ease out of the earth, not being put to labour above two or three foot deep. In some places of that Countrey which are not inhabited by reason of the scarcity of water, the people find great pieces of Gold, of several forms and weights, upon the surface of the earth, some of which weigh an ounce. One I have by me that weighs an ounce and a half, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. Being at <hi>Surat,</hi> I went to visit the Embassador of the King of the <hi>Abyssins.</hi> He shew'd us the Present which his Master had sent to the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul,</hi> consisting of fourteen stately Horses, the remainder of 30, the rest dying by the way; and a great number of Slaves of both Sexes. But what was most
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106224:238"/>
remarkable, was a natural Tree, all of Gold, two foot and four inches high, and six inches about in the stock. It had ten or twelve branches, some whereof shot out half a foot in length, and an inch about; others much smaller. In some parts of the great branches appear'd certain bunches that resembl'd buds. The roots of the Tree, which were also natural, were thick and short; the longest not exceeding four or five inches.</p>
                        <p>The Natives of <hi>Monomotopa</hi> knowing the time of the year that the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities arrive, come to <hi>Sofala</hi> and <hi>Chepon-Goura</hi> to furnish themselves. Thither also come the <hi>Cafres</hi> of other Provinces and Kingdoms for the same purpose. Whereupon the Governors of those places sell them what they want, trusting them till the next year, when they oblige themselves to bring their Gold, which they are very punctual to do, for else there could be no Trade between them. The Natives of <hi>Monomotopa</hi> never live long, by reason of the badness of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Countrey: For at the age of five and twenty years they begin to be dropsical; so that it is a great wonder if any among them live above forty years. The Province where the River <hi>Sene</hi> has its head, is call'd <hi>Monkaran,</hi> and is under the Jurisdiction of a certain King, beginning a hunder'd leagues, or there-abouts, above <hi>Chepon-Goura.</hi> The people of that Countrey find great store of dust-Gold in the Rivers that fall into the <hi>Sene;</hi> but it is much coarser than the other, though they bring it to <hi>Chepon-Goura</hi> and <hi>Sofala.</hi> The Countrey is very healthy, and the people live as long as they do in <hi>Europe.</hi> Some years there are <hi>Cafres</hi> that come from beyond the Province of <hi>Monkaran,</hi> even as far as the <hi>Cape of good Hope.</hi> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> have enquir'd after their Countrey, and the name; but they can tell no more, only that it is call'd <hi>Sabia,</hi> commanded by a King; and that they are four months generally travelling to <hi>Sofala.</hi> The Gold which they bring is very fine, and in pieces like that of <hi>Monomotopa,</hi> which they say they find in the high Mountains, digging only ten or twelve foot in the ground. They also bring great quantities of Elephants-teeth; wherewith, by their report, the Countrey does so abound, that you may see them in herds in the fields; and that all the Palisado's of their Fortresses, and the Pales of their Parks, are made of Elephants<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth. Their usual Diet is Elephants-flesh; which four <hi>Cafres</hi> will kill with their <hi>Ageagayes,</hi> or a sort of Half-pikes. The water of their Countrey is very bad, which is the reason that their thighes are swell'd, and it is a wonder to see any one of them free.</p>
                        <p>Beyond <hi>Sofala</hi> there is a Countrey commanded by a King who is call'd the King of <hi>Beroé.</hi> In some parts of his Countrey there grows a Root about an inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick, and of a yellow colour. It heals all sorts of Fevers, causing the Patient to vomit. But because it grows very scarce, the King strictly forbids his Subjects to export it. The tast of it is very bitter upon the tongue.</p>
                        <p>As for Silver-Mines, there are none in all <hi>Asia</hi> but only in <hi>Japon;</hi> but some years since, at <hi>Delegora, Sangora, Bordelon</hi> and <hi>Bata,</hi> have been discover'd plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mines of Tin, to the great damage of the <hi>English,</hi> there being now enough in <hi>Asia</hi> of their own besides.</p>

                        <p>IN the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1665, being ready to depart from <hi>Gomrom</hi> for <hi>Surat,</hi> in a Vessel that belong'd to a <hi>Holland-</hi>Broaker, commanded by a <hi>Holland-</hi>Captain, the <hi>English</hi> Agent gave me a Packet of Letters to deliver to the President at <hi>Surat.</hi> The Packet was large, containing not only the Companies-Letters, but several private Letters to particular persons at <hi>Surat</hi> and other parts of <hi>India.</hi> This Packet I receiv'd in the presence of one <hi>Casembrot,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> who inform'd another <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> whose name was <hi>Wauwuck,</hi> of it.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106224:239"/>
contriv'd a design to seize this Packet, upon the report that ran of the rupture between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland. Casembrot</hi> having seen the bigness of the Packet, gives <hi>Wauwuck</hi> a description of it, and so both together they contrive another of the same form and bigness as neer as they could. When I came a-board, I took the <hi>English</hi> Packet, and lock'd it up in my <hi>Bouccha,</hi> which is the sort of Cloak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag that is us'd in that Countrey, and laid it behind my <hi>Bolster.</hi> There were two Shallops sent a-board us, wherein there were sixty bags of Silver, containing some fifty, some a hunder'd <hi>Tomans</hi> a piece.

But when they saw that I did not go to rest, the <hi>Dutch</hi> consulted together, and agreed to let fall a bag of <hi>Tomans</hi> into the Sea; and so came all a-board, sending away a Shallop to <hi>Gomron</hi> for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. When I found that the Vessel would not set Sail till two or three hours after day-light, I went to rest, my <hi>Bouccha</hi> lying in the same place, half out, and half with in-side of my Bolster: But when my Servants were gone, and I alone and a-sleep in the Cabin, they cunningly stole my <hi>Bouccha,</hi> took out the <hi>English</hi> Packet, and left the other which they had counterfeited, in the place; being only so many Letters of blank-paper. Coming to <hi>Surat</hi> the sixt of <hi>May</hi> following, I gave the Packet, as I thought, which I had receiv'd from the <hi>English</hi> Agent at <hi>Gomron,</hi> to two Capuchin-Erlers to deliver to the President at <hi>Surat.</hi> But when the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent came to open the Packet before several of the Company, there was nothing but white-paper made up in the form of Letters; which when I heard, too much to my sorrow, I understood the villanous trick that <hi>Van-Wuck</hi> had put upon me. I wrote a smart Letter of complaint to the <hi>Dutch-</hi>General in <hi>Batavia,</hi> but finding no redress, I was forc'd to undergo the hard censure of the <hi>English,</hi> who would not permit me to justify my self. However, as it is rare to see treachery go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd, the Complotters all dy'd miserably. <hi>Van-Wuck</hi> fell into a violent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and being charg'd with the theft; thinking to defend himself with an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, that if he took the Cloak-bag, he wish'd he might dye without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, in three days ended his life just in the same manner, and at the same time that he had imprecated upon himself. <hi>Bozan</hi> his Lieutenant, after a great debauch, going to sleep upon the Terrass of the Cabin, where he lay for coolness, (there being no Balisters,) rolling and tumbling in his sleep, fell down, and the next day was found dead in the Sea.</p>
                        <p>The Captain, four or five days after his arrival at <hi>Surat,</hi> being met in the Street by a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> who was jealous of his Wife, and being mistak'n by him for one among several Franks, that had parted him, and kept him from correcting his Wife some few days before, was stabb'd by him in three or four places with a Dagger, and kill'd him out-right. And this was the end of those treacherous people.</p>

                        <p>THE diversity of Opinions among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> does not consist in the different Expositions which they put upon the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but in the contrariety of Belief which they receiv'd by Tradition from the first Successors of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> From thence there sprung two Sects, directly opposite: The one, which is call'd the Sect of the <hi>Sounnis,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the other of the <hi>Chiais,</hi> which is adher'd to by the <hi>Persians.</hi> I will not enlarge my self upon these two Sects, that divide all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetism;</hi> it being my design, only to tell you how the condition of that false Religion stands in the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and in the Kingdoms of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> and <hi>Visapour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When <hi>Mahumetism</hi> was first brought into the <hi>Indies,</hi> there was an excess of pride, but no devotion among the Christians; and the Idolaters were an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate people, able to make little resistance; so that it was easie for the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetns</hi> to subdue both the one and the other by force of Arms, which they did so advantageously, that many, as well Christians as Idolaters, embrac'd the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion.</p>
                        <p>The Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> with all his Court, follows the Sect of the <hi>Sounnis;</hi> the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> that of the <hi>Chiais.</hi> In the King of <hi>Visapour</hi>'s Territories the <hi>Sounnis</hi> and <hi>Chiais</hi> are mingl'd together; which may be said also of the Court of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> in regard of the great numbers of <hi>Persians</hi> that flock thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to serve in his Armies. True it is, that though they abhor the <hi>Sounnis,</hi> yet they adhere to the Religion of the Prince; holding it lawful for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their Estates to conceal their belief. As for what concerns the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Golconda, Koutoub-Cha,</hi> the present King, very zealously maintains the Law of the <hi>Chiais;</hi> in regard the Grandees of his Court are almost all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>

                           <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> testifies above all things an extraordinary devotion for the Sect of the <hi>Sounnis;</hi> of which he is so zealous an observer, that he surpasses all his Predecessors in outward profession; which was the Cloak under which he usurp'd the Crown. When he took possession of his Throne, he gave it out that he did it only out of a design to cause the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be more strictly observ'd, which had been very much neglected in the Reign of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jehan</hi> his Father, and <hi>Gehan-guir</hi> his Grandfather; and to shew himself more zealous to the Law, he turn'd <hi>Faquir</hi> or <hi>Dervich,</hi> that is, poor Volunteer; and

under that false pretence of Piety he cunningly made way to the Empire. And indeed though he has a great many <hi>Persians</hi> under his pay, yet he will not permit them to keep holy the day consecrated to the memory of <hi>Hosen</hi> and <hi>Heussin,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Ali,</hi> who were put to death by the <hi>Sounnis;</hi> besides that they, to please him, are willing enough to conform.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THey reckon that there are in the <hi>Indies</hi> eight hundred thousand <hi>Faquirs,</hi> and twelve hundred thousand Idolaters; which is a prodigious Number. They are all of them Vagabonds, and lazy Drones, that dazle the eyes of the people with a false zeal, and make them believe that whatever comes out of their mouths is an Oracle.</p>
                        <p>There are several sorts of <hi>Mahometan Faquirs.</hi> The one sort go almost naked, like the Idolatrous <hi>Faquirs,</hi> having no certain abode in the world, but giving themselves up to all manner of uncleanness. There are others whose Garments are of so many different pieces and colours, that a man can hardly tell of what they are made. These Garments reach down to the half Leg, and hide the rags that are underneath. They go generally in Troops; and have their Superiour of the Gang, who is known by his Garment, which is generally poorer, and consists of more patches than the other. Besides, that he draws after him a great Iron Chain, which is ty'd to his Leg, and is about two Ells long, and proportionably thick. When he says his prayers, he does it with a loud voice, and ratling his Chain all the while, which is accompany'd with an affected gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that draws the Veneration of the people. In the mean time the people prepare Dinner for him and his company, in the place where he takes up his stand, which is usually in some street or publick place. There he causes his Disciples to spread certain Carpets, where he sets himself down to give audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the people. On the other side, the Disciples go about publishing through the Country the vertues of their Master, and the favours he receives from God, who reveals his most important secrets to him, and gives him power to relieve persons in affliction by his counsel. The people, who give credit to him, and believe him to be a holy man, approach him with a great devotion, and when they come near him, they pull off their Shoes, and prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to kiss his feet. Then the <hi>Faquir,</hi> to shew his humility reaches out his hand to kiss; that done, he causes them that come to consult him, to sit down by him, and hears every one apart. They boast themselves to have a prophetick Spirit; and above all to teach barren women a way how to have Children, and to be belov'd by whom they please.</p>
                        <p>There are some of these <hi>Faquirs</hi> who have above two hundred Disciples, or more, which they assemble together by the sound of a Horn, or the Beat of a Drum. When they travel, they have their Standard, Lances, and other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which they pitch in the ground, near to their Master, when he reposes in any place.</p>
                        <p>The third sort of East <hi>Indian Faquirs,</hi> are those that being born of poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and desirous to understand the Law, to the end they may become <hi>Moulla's</hi> or Doctors, retire to the <hi>Mosquees,</hi> where they live upon the Alms which is given them. They employ all their time in reading the <hi>Alooran,</hi> which they get by heart; and if they can but add to that study the knowledg of some natural things, and an exemplary life withall, they come to be chief of the <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quees,</hi> and to the dignity of <hi>Moullahs,</hi> and Judges of the Law. Those <hi>Faquirs</hi> have their Wives; and some, out of their great zeal to imitate <hi>Mahomet,</hi> have three or four; thinking they do God great service in begetting many Children to be followers of their Laws.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Religion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or Idolatrous <hi>Indians.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe Idolaters among the <hi>Indians</hi> are so numerous, that they are reckon'd to be five or six for one <hi>Mahometan.</hi> It seems a wonderful thing, that such a prodigious multitude of men should be cow'd by a handful, and bow so easily under the yoak of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes. But that wonder well may cease, when we consider that those Idolaters are not in union among themselves; for Superstition has introduc'd such a diversity of Opinions and Customs, that they can never agree one with another. An Idolater will not eat Bread nor drink Water in the House of any one that is not of his <hi>Caste;</hi> though it be more noble, and much more superior to his own. Yet they all eat and drink in the <hi>Bramins</hi> Houses, which are open to all the world. A <hi>Caste</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Idolaters, is very near the same thing which was anciently call'd a Tribe among the Jews. And though it be vulgarly believ'd, that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-two <hi>Castes,</hi> yet I have been inform'd by some of their most ingenuous Priests, that they may be all reduc'd into four principal ones, from whence all the rest drew their Original.</p>
                        <p>The first <hi>Caste</hi> is that of the <hi>Brammins,</hi> who are the Successors of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Brachmans,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Philosophers, that study'd Astrology. You may also meet with some of their ancient Books, in reading whereof the <hi>Brammins</hi> spend all their time; and are so vers'd in their observations, that they never fail a minute in the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon. And to preserve this knowledg among themselves, they have a kind of University, in a City which is call'd <hi>Benarez,</hi> where they make all their Exercises in Astrology, and where they have Doctors that expound their Law, which they very strictly observe. But in regard they are so great a number, and cannot all come to study at that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, they are all very ignorant, and consequently very superstitious; those that go for the most refin'd Wits, being the greatest Sorcerers.</p>
                        <p>The second <hi>Caste</hi> is that of the <hi>Raspoutes</hi> or <hi>Ketris,</hi> that is to say, Warriors and warlike people. These are the only Idolatrous <hi>Indians</hi> that have any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to signalize themselves in War. All the <hi>Raja's</hi> that I have so oft'n men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, are of this <hi>Caste.</hi> These are so many petty Kings, whom their disunion has render'd Tributary to the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> But in regard that the greatest part of them are in his service, they are highly recompenc'd by the large Salaries they receive for the small Tribute which they pay. These <hi>Raja's,</hi> and the <hi>Raspoutes</hi> their Subjects, are the chiefest support of the Dominions of the Great <hi>Mogul;</hi> for indeed the <hi>Raja's Jesseing</hi> and <hi>Jessomseing</hi> were those that lifted up <hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeb</hi> to the Throne. But you must take notice, that all of this second <hi>Caste</hi> are not Warriors; for they are the <hi>Raspoutes</hi> only that go to War, and are all Horsemen. But for the <hi>Ketris,</hi> they are degenerated from their Ancestors, and of Soldiers are become Merchants.</p>
                        <p>The third Caste is that of the <hi>Bannians,</hi> who are altogether addicted to Trade; of whom some are <hi>Sheraffs</hi> or Bankers, others broakers, employ'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Merchant and Merchant for buying and selling. Those of this <hi>Caste</hi> are so subtil and nimble in Trade, that as I have said before, the <hi>Jews</hi> may be their Prentices. They accustom their Children betimes to fly idleness. And instead of suffering them to lose their time in playing in the streets, as we generally do, they teach them Arithmetick; which they are so perfect at, that without making use either of Pen and Ink, or Counters, but only of their memories, they will in a moment cast up the most difficult account that can be imagin'd. They always live with their Fathers, who instruct them in Trade, and do nothing but what they shew them. If any man in the heat of passion chafe at 'em, they hear him patiently without making any reply, and parting coldly from him, will not see him again in three or four days, when they think his passion may be over. They never eat any thing that has life; nay they would rather dye,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106224:241"/>
than kill the smallest Animal or Vermin that crawls; being in that point above all things the most zealous Observers of the Law. They never fight, nor go to War; neither will they eat or drink in the House of a <hi>Raspoute,</hi> because they kill the Victuals they eat, all but Cows, which they never touch.</p>
                        <p>The fourth <hi>Caste</hi> is that of the <hi>Charados</hi> or <hi>Soudras;</hi> who go to War as well as the <hi>Raspoutes,</hi> but with this difference, that the <hi>Raspoutes</hi> serve on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and the <hi>Charados</hi> on Foot. Both of them take it for an Honour to dye in Battel; and let him be Horse or Foot, that Soldier is accounted infamous that retreats in Fight; 'tis an eternal blot in his Family. Upon which subject I will tell you a story. A Soldier who was passionately in love with his Wife, and reciprocally belov'd by her, had fled from the fight, not so much out of any fear of death, as out of a consideration of the grief which it would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to his Wife, should he leave her a Widow. When she knew the reason of his flight, as soon as he came to the door, she shut it against him, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be told, that she could never acknowledge that man for a Husband, who had preferr'd the Love of a Woman before his Honour; that she did not desire to see him any more, as being a stain to the Reputation of her Family; and that she would endeavour to teach her Children to have more courage than their Father. The Wife continuing firm to her resolution, the Husband to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain his Honour and her affection, return'd to the Army, where he so behav'd himself, that he became famous; and having highly made amends for his Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise, the door of his House was again set open, and his Wife receiv'd him with her former kindness.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the Natives, that are not reckon'd in the number of these <hi>Castes,</hi> are call'd <hi>Pauzecour.</hi> These are such as employ themselves in Handicraft Trades; among which there is no other distinction, but according to the Trades which they follow from Father to Son. So that a Taylor cannot prefer his Son, but only in his own Calling, though he be never so rich; nor marry either Son or Daughter, but to one of his own Craft. By the same rule, when a Taylor dies, all those of his own Trade accompany the Corps to the place where it is burnt: and the same practise is observ'd in all other Trades.</p>
                        <p>Among the particular <hi>Castes,</hi> there is one that goes by the name of <hi>Alecors,</hi> whose employment is only to clean Houses; for which every Family pays him something once a month, according to their proportion and quality. If a person of quality in the <hi>Indies</hi> keeps fifty Servants, let him be <hi>Mahometan</hi> or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is not one of them will take a Besome in his hand to sweep the House; for he would think himself affronted, it being one of the greatest scorns you can put upon an <hi>Indian,</hi> to call him <hi>Alacor.</hi> Besides, every one of those Servants knows his business; whether it be to carry the pot of Water to drink by the way, or to give his Master his Pipe of Tobacco when he calls for it; so that if the Master should bid one to do that which the other was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to do, that Servant would stand like a Statue, and never make him any answer. But for the Slaves, they are oblig'd to do what ever the Master commands them. These <hi>Alacors</hi> having no other business but only to make clean the Houses, eat the scraps of all the other <hi>Castes;</hi> and so without scruple feed upon any thing. There are none but those of this Tribe make use of Asses, to carry away the filth of the Houses into the Feilds; for which reason none of the rest of the <hi>Indians</hi> will so much as touch that Animal; which is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in <hi>Persia,</hi> as well for carriage, as to ride upon. Moreover, there are none of the other <hi>Indians,</hi> except the <hi>Alacors</hi> that will eat Pig.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE chiefest of the Idolatrous Kings of <hi>Asia,</hi> are the King of <hi>Aracan,</hi> the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> the King of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> and the King of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin.</hi> As for the King of <hi>China,</hi> we know that he was an Idolater before the <hi>Tartars</hi> invaded his Dominions. But since that, we know not what to report of certainty, in regard that the <hi>Tartars</hi> who are now Masters of the Country, are neither Idolaters nor <hi>Mahometans,</hi> but rather both together. In the Islands, the King of <hi>Japon,</hi> the King of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> and some petty Kings of the <hi>Molucoa</hi> Islands are Idolaters; as are all the <hi>Raja's</hi> as well in the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> as in the neighbouring Kingdoms of <hi>Visapour</hi> and <hi>Golconda.</hi> In a word, all the meaner sort of people, as well in the Territories of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> Kings of <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Visapour,</hi> as in the Isles of <hi>Achan, Java,</hi> and <hi>Macassar,</hi> though their Kings are <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> are all themselves Idolaters.</p>
                        <p>Some fifty years ago, one of the Kings of <hi>Ceylan</hi> became a Christian, and was baptiz'd by the name of <hi>John,</hi> being call'd before the Emperor <hi>Priapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> But as soon as he had embrac'd the Christian Faith, the Princes and Priests of the Country set up another King in his room. He endeavour'd all he could to bring his people to follow his example; to which purpose he assign'd to the Father <hi>Jesuits,</hi> twelve large Villages about <hi>Colombo,</hi> for the bringing up the youth of the Country in their Colledges; to the end that they being well instructed, might instruct others. For the King made it plain to the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> that it was impossible for them so well to understand the Language of the Country, as to be able to preach to the Natives. Besides, that they found the ingenuities of the Youth of <hi>Ceylan</hi> so quick and apprehensive, that they learnt more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, Philosophy, and other Sciences in six months, than the <hi>Europeans</hi> learnt in a year; and that they put such subtle Questions to their Masters, as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond imagination.</p>
                        <p>Some years after the King had profess'd Christianity, a witty man of the Island of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> and a good natural Philosopher, whose name was <hi>Alegamma Motiar,</hi> or the Master of the Philosophers, after he had convers'd with the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and other Religious persons, was inspir'd to turn Christian. Thereupon he went to the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and told them, that he desir'd to be a Christian; but withall he was very earnest to know what Jesus Christ had done, and lest in writing. They gave him the New Testament, which he set himself to read with that heed and study, that in less than six months there was hardly a passage which he could not repeat. After that he again testifi'd to the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religious persons, that he had a great desire to turn Christian, in regard he found their Religion to be such as Jesus Christ had taught; but only he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that they themselves did not follow his example. For that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find by his reading, that Jesus Christ ever took any money of any body; but that they took all they could get, and never baptiz'd nor buri'd unless they were well paid. But though he started the Question, he was baptiz'd, and afterwards became a sedulous converter of others.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> What the Idolaters believe touching a Divinity.</head>
                        <p>THough the Idolatrous <hi>Indians</hi> attribute to the Creature, as to Cows, Apes, and several Monsters, those Divine Honours which are only due to the true Deity; yet they acknowledg one only Infinite God, Almighty, and only Wise, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, who fills all places with his presence. They call him in some places <hi>Permesser,</hi> in others <hi>Peremael,</hi> and <hi>Westnon</hi> among the <hi>Bramins</hi> that inhabit the Coast of <hi>Cormandel.</hi> It may be, because they have heard that the Circle is the most perfect of all Figures, therefore it is that they say God is of an Oval Figure; for they have in all their Pagods an Oval Flintstone, which they fetch from <hi>Ganges,</hi> and worship as a God. They are so obstinately wedded to this foolish imagination, that the wisest among the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> will not so much as hear any argument to the contrary. So that it is no wonder that a people led by such blind Guides, should fall into such Abysses of Idolatry. There is one Tribe so superstitious, in reference to that Article, that they carry those Oval Flints about their Necks, and thump them against their Breasts, when they are at their devotions. In this dark and lamentable mist of Ignorance, these Idolaters make their Gods to be born like men, and assign them Wives, imagining that theirs are the pleasures of men. Thus they take their <hi>Ram</hi> for a great Deity, in regard of the Miracles which they believe he wrought while he liv'd upon Earth. <hi>Ram</hi> was the Son of a potent <hi>Raja,</hi> who was call'd by the name of <hi>Deseret,</hi> and the most vertuous of all his Children, which he had by two lawful Wives. He was particularly belov'd by his Father, who design'd him to be his Successor. But the Mother of <hi>Ram</hi> being dead, the <hi>Raja's</hi> other Wife, who had her Husband entirely at her beck, prevail'd with him to exterminate <hi>Ram</hi> and his Brother <hi>Lokeman</hi> from his House, and all his Territories; upon whose exclusion the Son of that Wife was declar'd the <hi>Raja's</hi> Successor. As the two Brothers were about to be gone, <hi>Ram</hi>'s Wife <hi>Sita,</hi> of whom he went to take his leave, and whom the Idolaters worship as a Goddess, beg'd of him that she might not leave him, having made a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution never to forsake him; whereupon they all three went together to seek their fortunes. They were not very successful at first; for as they pass'd through a Wood, <hi>Ram</hi> being in pursuit of a Bird, stray'd from the Company, and was missing a long time; insomuch that <hi>Sita</hi> fearing that some disaster was befall'n him; besought <hi>Lokeman</hi> to look after him. He excus'd himself at first, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that <hi>Ram</hi> had oblig'd him never to leave <hi>Sita</hi> alone, foreseeing by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit what would befall her, should she be left to her self. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <hi>Lokeman</hi> being over perswaded by the prayers of his fair Sister, went to seek for <hi>Ram</hi> his Brother; but in the mean time <hi>Rhevan</hi> another of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters Gods, appear'd to <hi>Sita</hi> in the shape of a <hi>Faquir,</hi> and beg'd an Alms of her. Now <hi>Ram</hi> had order'd <hi>Sita,</hi> that she should not stir out of the place where he left her; which <hi>Rhevan</hi> well knowing, would not receive the Alms which <hi>Sita</hi> presented him, unless she would remove to another place; which when <hi>Sita</hi> had done, either out of negligence or forgetfulness, <hi>Rhevan</hi> seiz'd upon her, and carry'd her into the thick of the Wood, where his Train stay'd for him. <hi>Ram</hi> at his return missing <hi>Sita,</hi> fell into a swoon for greif, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought again to himself by his Brother <hi>Lokeman,</hi> they two immediately went together in search of <hi>Sita,</hi> who was so dearly belov'd by her Husband.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Bramins</hi> repeat this Rape of their Goddess, they do it with tears in their eyes, and great demonstrations of sorrow; adding upon this subject, an infinite company of Fables more ridiculous, to shew the great courage of <hi>Ram</hi> in pursuit of the Ravisher. They employ'd all Creatures living upon the discovery; but none of them had the luck to succeed, only the Monkey call'd <hi>Harman.</hi> He cross'd over the Sea at one Leap, and coming into <hi>Rhevans</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, found <hi>Sita</hi> in the extremity of affliction; and very much surpriz'd to hear
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106224:242"/>
an Ape speak to her in her Husbands behalf. At first she would not give any credit to such an Embassador; but the Ape, to shew that his Commission was authentick, presents her with a Ring which her Husband had giv'n her, and that she had left behind her among her Furniture. She could hardly however believe so great a Miracle, as that <hi>Ram</hi> her Husband should make a Beast speak, to bring her the news of his health, and to testifie, as he did, the marks of his affection. But the Ape <hi>Harman</hi> wrought Miracles himself, for being taken for a Spy by some of <hi>Rhevans</hi> Servants, who therefore would have burnt him, he made use of the fire which they had prepar'd to burn him, to set <hi>Rhevans</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace on fire, which he almost consum'd to the ground, with all the tatters and rags which were ty'd to his tail and his body. When the Ape had thus done, the better to escape out of <hi>Rhevans</hi> hands, he took the same way he came, and repassing the Sea again at one jump, he came and gave <hi>Ram</hi> an account of his adventures; and told him in what a sorrowful condition he had found <hi>Sita,</hi> who did nothing but mourn by reason of her absence from her Husband. <hi>Ram</hi> touch'd with his Wives affection, resolv'd to deliver her out of <hi>Rhevans</hi> hands, whatever it cost him; whereupon he rais'd Forces, and being guided by the Ape, at length he came to <hi>Rhevans</hi> Palace, that still smoak'd, the fire had been so great; and by reason that <hi>Rhevans</hi> Servants were dispers'd, <hi>Ram</hi> had an easie opportunity to see his belov'd <hi>Sita</hi> again; whom <hi>Rhevan</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd wholly to him, flying for fear to the Mountains. <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>Sita</hi> were infinitely overjoy'd at their coming together again, and return'd very great Honours to <hi>Harman,</hi> who had done him so eminent service.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Rhevan,</hi> he spent all the rest of his days like a poor <hi>Faquir,</hi> seeing his Country ruin'd by <hi>Ram</hi>'s Troops, who was resolv'd to be reveng'd for the injury which he had receiv'd; and from this <hi>Rhevan</hi> it was, from whence that infinite multitude of <hi>Faquirs,</hi> that swarm all over <hi>India,</hi> first took their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>

                        <p>THE Original of the <hi>Faquirs,</hi> as I said before, came from that <hi>Rhevan,</hi> whom <hi>Ram</hi> dispoil'd of his Kingdom; at which he conceiv'd such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable sorrow, that he resolv'd to lead a Vagabond life, and to wander about the world, poor, stript of all, and in a manner quite naked. He found a now to follow him in a course of life that gives them so much liberty. For being worship'd as Saints, they have in their hands all opportunities of doing evil.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>Faquirs</hi> wander generally in Troops, every one of which has a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. And in regard they are quite naked, Winter and Summer lying upon the hard ground, when it is cold, the young <hi>Faquirs,</hi> and others that are most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, go in the afternoon to seek for the dung of Cows and other Creatures, of which they make their fires. They rarely burn Wood, for fear of killing any living Animal which is wont to breed in it; and therefore the Wood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they burn their dead, is only such as has floated long in the Water, which never breeds any sort of living Creature. The young <hi>Faquirs</hi> having got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a good quantity of dung, mix'd with dry turf, make several fires, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bigness of the Company; round about every one of which the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirs</hi> seat themselves. When they grow sleepy, they lay themselves upon the ground, spreading the Ashes abroad, which serve them for a Mattress; without any other Canopy than that of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Faquirs</hi> that do Pennance, when they are laid down in the same posture as you see them in the day time, they kindle a good fire on each side of them, for otherwise they would not be able to endure the cold. The rich
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106224:243"/>
Idolaters account themselves happy, and their Houses to be fill'd with the benedictions of Heaven, when they have any of these <hi>Faquirs</hi> for their Guests, which the more austere they are, the more they honour: and it is the glory of the Troop to have one among them that does some considerable act of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                        <p>These Crews of <hi>Faquirs</hi> many time joyn together to go in Pilgrimage to the Principal Pagods, and publick Washings, which they use upon certain days in the year in the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> whereof they make the chiefest account; as also in that which separates the Territories of the <hi>Portugals</hi> of <hi>Goa</hi> from the Dominions of the King of <hi>Vssapour.</hi> Some of the most austere <hi>Faquirs</hi> live in little pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Huts neer their Pagods, where they have once in four and twenty hours some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat bestow'd upon them for God's sake. The Tree whereof I have giv'n the description, is of, the same sort as that which grows neer <hi>Gomron,</hi> which I have describ'd in my <hi>Persian</hi> Relations. The <hi>Franks</hi> call it the <hi>Bannians-</hi>Tree, because in those places where those Trees grow, the Idolaters always take up their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and dress their victuals under them. They have those Trees in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and oft-times build their Pagods either under or very neer them. That which the Reader sees here describ'd, grows at <hi>Surat;</hi> in the trunk whereof, which is hollow, is the figure of a Monster, representing the face of a deform'd Woman, which they say was the first Woman, whose name was <hi>Mamaniva;</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great numbers of Idolaters every day resort: neer to which there is some <hi>Bramin</hi> or other always appointed to be ready to say Prayers, and receive the Alms of Rice, Millet, and other Grains which the charitable bestow upon them. The <hi>Bramin</hi> marks the forhead of all, both Men and Women, that come to pray in the Pagod, with a kind of Vermillion, wherewith he also besmears the Idol; for being thus mark'd, they believe the evil Spirit cannot hurt them, as being then under the protection of their God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Number</hi> I, is that part where the <hi>Bramins</hi> paint their Idols; such as <hi>Mama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niva, Sita, Madedina,</hi> and others; whereof they have a great number.</p>

He stays there according to the height of his devotion, sometimes nine or ten days together, without either eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or drinking; a thing which I could not have believ'd, had I not seen it. My curiosity carri'd me to see one of those Penitents, with the President of the <hi>Dutch-</hi>Company, who set a Spy to watch night and day whether any body brought him any victuals. But he could not discover any relief the <hi>Faquir</hi> had, all the while fitting upon his Bum like our Taylors, never changing his posture above seven days together, not being able to hold out any longer, by reason that the heat and stench of the Lamp was ready to stifle him. Their other sorts of Penance out-doing this, might be thought incredible, were there not so many thousand witnesses thereof.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7, is the figure of another Penitentiary, over whose head several years have past; and yet he never slept day nor night. When he finds himself sleepy, he hangs the weight of the upper part of his body upon a double-rope that is fasten'd to one of the boughs of the Tree; and by the continuance of this posture, which is very strange and painful, there falls a humour into their legs that swells them very much.</p>

Their hair grows down to their wasts, and their nails are as long as their fingers. Night and Day, Winter and Summer they go always stark naked in the same posture, expos'd to the heat and rain, and the stinging of the Flies; from which they have not the use of their hands to rid themselves.

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12, is the posture wherein the Penitents sleep, without ever resting their arms; which is certainly one of the greatest torments the body of man can suffer.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 13, is the posture of a Penitent, whose arms, through weakness, hang flagging down upon his shoulders, being dry'd up for want of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>There are an infinite number of other Penitents; some who in a posture quite contrary to the motion and frame of nature, keep their eys always turn'd toward the Sun. Others who fix their eyes perpetually upon the ground, never so much as speaking one word, or looking any person in the face. And indeed there is such an infinite variety of them, that would render the farther discourse of them more then tedious.</p>
                        <p>True it is, that I have hid those parts which modesty will not suffer to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to view. But they both in City and Countrey go all as naked as they came out of their Mothers wombs; and though the Women approach them to take them by the fingers-ends, and to kiss those parts which modesty forbids to name; yet shall you not observe in them any motion of sensuality; rather quite contrary, seeing them never to look upon any person, but rowling their eyes in a most fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, you would believe them in an extasie.</p>

                        <p>'TIS an Article of the Idolaters Faith, that the Souls of Men departing out of the body, are presented to God; who according to the lives which they lead, orders them another body to inhabit. So that one and the same person is born several times into the World. And that as for the Souls of wicked and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious persons, God disposes them into the bodies of contempt'ble Beasts, such as Asses, Dogs, Cats, and the like; to do Penance for their crimes in those infamous Prisons. But they believe that those Souls that enter into Cows are happy; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming that there is a kind of divinity in those creatures. For if a man dye with a Cows-tail in his hand, they say it is enough to render him happy in the other World.</p>
                        <p>The Idolaters believing thus the transmigration of the Souls of men into the bodies of other creatures, they abhor to kill any creature whatever, for fear they should be guilty of the death of some of their kindred or friends doing Penance in those bodies.</p>
                        <p>If the Men in their life-time are famous for their vertuous deeds, they hold that their Souls pass into the bodies of some Potent <hi>Raja's:</hi> where they enjoy the pleasures of this life in those bodies, as the reward of those good works which they did.</p>
                        <p>This is the reason why the <hi>Faquirs</hi> put themselves to such horrible Penances. But because that all are not able to endure so much torment in this World, they labour to supply the defect of that cruel Penance by good works. And besides, they charge their Heirs in their Wills to give Alms to the <hi>Bramins,</hi> to the end that by the powerful effect of their Prayers, their God may assign them the body of some Noble Personage.</p>

In <hi>January</hi> 1661, the Broaker belonging to the <hi>Holland-</hi>Company, whose name was <hi>Mondas-Parek,</hi> dy'd at <hi>Surat.</hi> He was a rich Man, and very charitable, giving his Alms very liberally as well to the Christians as to the Idolaters; the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins at <hi>Surat</hi> living one part of the year upon the Rice, Butter and Pulse which he sent them. This <hi>Banian</hi> was not sick above four or five days; during all which time, and for eight days more after he was dead, his Brothers distributed nine or ten-thousand Roupies; and in the burning of his body they mix'd Sandal-wood, and <hi>Lignum-Aloes,</hi> with the ordinary wood, believing that by that means the Soul of their Brother transmigrating into another body, he would come to be some great Lord in another Countrey. There are some that are such fools that they bury their treasure in their life-time, as it is the usual custom of all the rich Men in the Kingdom of <hi>Asen;</hi> to the end that if they should be condemn'd to the body of some poor miserable person, they might have wherewithal to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their necessities. I remember one day that I bought in <hi>India</hi> an Agate-Cup half a foot high; he that sold it me, assur'd me that it had been buried under ground above 40 years, and that he kept it to serve his occasions after death; but that it was to him a thing indifferent whether he buried his Cup or his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. In my last Voyage I bought of one of these Idolaters sixty-two Diamonds, of about six grains a-piece; and while I was wondring to see so fair a parcel, he told me I needed not to wonder; for he had been fifty years getting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to serve him after his death, but that having occasion for Money, he was forc'd to part with them. This buried treasure stood the <hi>Raja Seva-Gi</hi> in great stead, when he took Arms against the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the King of <hi>Visapour.</hi> For that <hi>Raja</hi> having taken <hi>Callian Biondi,</hi> a small City in the Kingdom of <hi>Visa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> by the advice of the <hi>Bramins,</hi> who assur'd him he should find great store of treasure buri'd, caus'd the greatest part thereof to be demolish'd; and found so much wealth, as to maintain his Army, which was above thirty-thousand Men. It is impossible to convince these poor Idolaters of their errors; in regard they will hear no reason, but submit themselves altogether to their old forms and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Custom among the Idolaters to burn the Bodies of their Dead.</head>
                        <p>THE custom of burning the Bodies of the dead is very ancient among the Gentiles; which Ceremony they most commonly perform by the banks of Rivers, where they wash the dead; which is the last purgation of them from their sins. Nay, their superstition is so great sometimes, that they will carry the sick person, death approaching, to the bank of some River or Pond, and put his feet in the water. As nature fails, they dip him deeper and deeper, till at length they hold him expiring up to the chin in the River: to the end that at the same time that the Soul departs out of the Body, both Body and Soul may be cleans'd from all defilement; and then plunging the newly dead Body over head and ears, they bring it out, and burn it in the place appointed; which is generally neer some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god. There are some persons that make it their business to fetch Wood, and agree what they shall have for their pains. An Idolater being dead, all those of his <hi>Caste</hi> or Tribe assemble together at the House of the deceas'd, and laying the Body upon a Beer cover'd with clean fine Linnen according to his Quality and Estate, they follow the Beer, which is carri'd by such as are appointed for that purpose to the place where the Body is to be burn'd. As they go along they sing certain Prayers to their God, pronouncing several times the words <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> while another going before the Beer, sounds a little Bell, to advertize the living to pray for the dead. The Body being set down by the bank of the River or Pond, they first plunge it into the water, and then they burn it. According to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the deceas'd they also mingle with the ordinary wood Sandal-wood, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106224:245"/>
other Sweet-woods. But the Idolaters do not only burn the Bodies of the dead, but the Bodies of the living. They scruple to kill a serpent, or a louse, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a meritorious thing to burn a living Wife with the Body of the deceas'd Husband.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> How the Wives are burnt in <hi>India</hi> with the Bodies of their deceas'd Husbands.</head>
                        <p>IT is also an ancient custom among the <hi>Indians,</hi> that the Husband happening to dye, the Wife can never marry again. So that as soon as the Man is dead, the Wife retires to bewail her Husband; some days after that, they shave off her hair; she lays aside all the ornaments of her apparel; she takes off from her arms and legs the Bracelets which her Husband put on when he espous'd her, in token of her submission, and her being chain'd to him: and all the rest of her life she lives slighted and despis'd, and in a worse condition than a Slave in the very House where she was Mistress before. This unfortunate condition causes them to hate life, so that they rather choose to be buri'd alive with the body of their deceas'd Husbands, then to live the scorn and contempt of all the World. Besides that, the <hi>Bramins</hi> make them believe, that in dying after that manner, they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive again with him in another World, with more honour and more advantages than they enjoy'd before. These are the motives that perswade the Women to burn with their Husbands; besides that, the Priests flatter them with a hope, that while they are in the midst of the flames, before they expire, <hi>Ram</hi> will appear, and reveal wonderful visions to them; and that after their Souls have transmigrated into various Bodies, they shall at length obtain a high degree of Honour to eternity.</p>
                        <p>However, there is no Woman that can burn with her Husband's body, till she has the leave of the Governor of the place where she inhabits, who being a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan,</hi> and abhorring that execrable custom of Self-murder, is very shy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. Besides, there are none but Widows that have no children, that lye under the reproach that forces them to violent death. For as for the Widows that have children, they are by no means permitted to burn themselves; but quite the contrary, they are commanded to live for the education of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Those Women whom the Governour will not permit to burn themselves, spend the rest of their lives in doing Penance, and performing works of Charity. Some make it their business to sit upon the Road to boyl certain Pulse in water, and to give the liquor to Travellers to drink. Others sit with fire always ready for them to light their Tobacco. Others make vows to eat nothing but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested grains which they find in Cow-dung.</p>
                        <p>The Governour finding no perswasions will alter the Woman's resolution, but more especially perceiving by the sign which his Secretary makes him, that he has receiv'd the Coin, in a surly manner gives the Woman leave, bidding the Devil take her and all her kindred.</p>
                        <p>When they have got this leave, their Musick begins to strike up, and away they ding to the House of the deceas'd, with Drums beating, and Flutes playing before them; and in that manner they accompany the person that is to be burnt, to the place appointed. All the kindred and friends of the Widow that is to dye, come to her, and congratulate her for the happiness she is to enjoy in the other World: and for the honour which the <hi>Caste</hi> she is of receives by her generous resolution, she dresses her self as she were going to be marri'd, and she is conducted in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the place of execution. For the noise is loud of Musical Instruments, and Womens Voices, that follow her singing Songs in honour of the miserable creature that is going to dye. The <hi>Bramins</hi> that accompany her, exhort her to give publick testimonies of her constancy and courage: and many of our <hi>Europeans</hi>
                           <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106224:246"/>
are of opinion, that to take away the fears of death, which naturally terrifies hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, the Priests do give her a certain Beverage to stupify and disorder the senses, which takes from her all apprehension of her preparations for death. 'Tis for the <hi>Bramins</hi> interest that the poor miserable creatures should continue in their resolutions; for all their Bracelets as well about their legs as their arms, the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in their ears; their Rings sometimes of Gold, sometimes of Silver; (for the poor wear only Copper and Tin,) all these belong to the <hi>Bramins,</hi> who rake for them among the ashes when the party is burn'd.</p>
                        <p>I have seen Women burnt after three several manners, according to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Countrey. In the Kingdom of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> as far as <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dehli,</hi> they set up a little Hut about twelve foot square upon the bank of a Pond or River. 'Tis made of Reeds, and all sorts of small Wood, with which they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle certain pots of Oil and other Drugs to make it burn more vehemently. The Woman is plac'd in the middle of the Hut, in a half-lying-down posture, leaning her head upon a kind of a wooden Bolster and resting her back against a Pillar, to which the <hi>Bramin</hi> tyes her about the middle, for fear she should run away when she feels the fire. In this posture she holds the body of her deceas'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band upon her knees, chewing <hi>Betlé</hi> all the while: and when she has continu'd in this posture about half an hour, the <hi>Bramin</hi> goes out, and the Woman bids them set fire to the Hut; which is immediately done by the <hi>Bramins,</hi> and the kindred and friends of the Woman; who also cast several pots of Oil into the fire, to put the Woman the sooner out of her pain. After the Woman is burnt, the <hi>Bramins</hi> search the ashes for all her Bracelets, Pendants and Rings, whether Gold, Silver, Copper or Tin, which is all free booty to themselves.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Bengala</hi> they burn the Women after another fashion. In that Countrey a Woman must be very poor that does not accompany the Body of her deceas'd Husband to the <hi>Ganges</hi> to wash his Body, and to be wash'd her self before she is burnt. I have seen dead Carkasses brought to the <hi>Ganges</hi> above twenty days journey off from the place, and smelt 'em to boot; for the scent of them has been intollerably noysom. There was one that came from the Northern Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains neer the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan,</hi> with the body of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band carri'd in a Waggon; she travell'd twenty days a-foot, and neither eat nor drank for 15 or 16 days together till she came to the <hi>Ganges,</hi> where after she had wash'd the body that stank abominably, and had afterwards wash'd her self, she was burnt with him with an admirable constancy. Before the Woman that is to be burnt, goes the Musick, consisting of Drums, Flutes and Hautboys, whom the Woman in her best Accoutrements follows, dancing up to the very Funeral-pile, upon which she gets up, and places her self as if she were sitting up in her Bed; and then they lay a-cross her the body of her Husband. When that is done, her kindred and friends, some bring her a Letter, some a piece of Callcut, another pieces of Silver or Copper, and desire her to deliver them to their Mother, or Brother, or some other Kinsman or Friend. When the Woman sees they have all done, she asks the Standers-by three times, if they have nothing more of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to command her; if they make no answer, she ties up all she has got in a piece of Taffata, which she puts between her own belly, and the body of her Husband, bidding them to set fire to the Pile; which is presently done by the <hi>Bramins</hi> and her Kindred. I have observ'd, because there is scarcity of Wood in <hi>Bengala,</hi> that when these poor Creatures are half griddl'd, they cast their bodies into the <hi>Ganges,</hi> where the remains are devour'd by the Crocodiles.</p>
                        <p>I must not forget a wicked custom practis'd by the Idolaters of <hi>Bengala.</hi> When a Woman is brought to bed, and the Child will not take to the Teat, they carry it out of the Village, and putting it into a Linnen Cloth, which they fast'n by the four Corners to the Boughs of a Tree, they there leave it from morning till evening. By this means the poor Infant is expos'd to be tormented by the Crows, insomuch that there are some who have their eyes pickt out of their heads: which is the reason that in <hi>Bengala</hi> you shall see many of these Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters that have but one eye, and some that have lost both. In the evening they fetch the child away, to try whether he will suck the next night; and if he still refuse the teat, they carry him again to the same place next morning; which they do for three days together; after which, if the Infant after that refuses to suck, they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106224:246"/>
believe him to be a Devil, and throw him into <hi>Ganges,</hi> or any the next Pond or River. In the places where the Apes breed, these poor Infants are not so expos'd to the Crows; for where the Ape discovers a Nest of those Birds, he climbs the Tree, and throws the Nest one way, and the Eggs another. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times some charitable people among the <hi>English, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionating the misfortune of those Children, will take them away from the Tree, and give them good education.</p>
                        <p>All along the Coast of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> when the Women are to be burnt with their Husbands, they make a great hole in the ground nine or ten foot deep, and twenty-five or thirty foot square, into which they throw a great quantity of Wood and Drugs to make the fire burn more fiercely. When the fire is kindled, they set the body of the man upon the brink; and then presently up comes the Woman dancing and chewing <hi>Betlé;</hi> accompany'd by her Friends and Kindred, with Drums beating, and Flutes sounding. Then the Woman takes three turns round the hole, and every time she has gone the round, she kisses her Friends and Kindred. After the third time the <hi>Bramins</hi> cast the Carcass of her Husband into the flame; and the Woman standing with her back to the fire, is pusht in by the <hi>Bramins</hi> also, and tumbles backward. Then her Kindred and Friends cast Oil and other combustible Drugs upon the fire, to make it burn more vehemently, that the Bodies may be the sooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd.</p>
                        <p>In most places upon the Coast of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> the Women are not burnt with their deceas'd Husbands, but they are buried alive with them in holes which the <hi>Bramins</hi> make a foot deeper than the tallness of the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Usually they chuse a Sandy place; so that when the man and woman are both let down together, all the Company with Baskets of Sand fill up the hole above half a foot higher than the surface of the ground, after which they jump and dance upon it, till they believe the woman to be stifl'd.</p>
                        <p>When some of the Idolaters upon the Coast of <hi>Coromandel</hi> are upon the point of death, their Friends do not carry them to the side of a River or Lake to cleanse their Souls, but they carry them to the fattest Cow they can find; and laying the sick party just behind the Cow, they lift up her Tail, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke her to piss. If she piss, so that it falls upon the face of the sick party, all the Company are overjoy'd, saying, that his Soul is happy. But if the Cow do not piss, to wash the sick parties face, they burn him with a great deal of sadness. If a Cow be sick, the owner must be careful to lead her to a Pond or River; for should she dye at his House, the <hi>Bramins</hi> would fine him.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Remarkable Stories of Women that have been burnt after their Husbands decease.</head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Vilou</hi> having lost his City and his life, through the loss of a Battel gain'd against him by the King of <hi>Visapour</hi>'s General, he was extreamly lamented at Court. Eleven of his Wives also were no less concern'd for his death, and resolv'd to be burnt when his Body was burn'd. The General of <hi>Visapour</hi>'s Army understanding their resolution, thought at first to divert them, by promising them all kind usage. But finding perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions would not prevail, he order'd them to be shut up in a Room. He who had the order, going to put it in execution, the Women in a rage told him, that 'twas to no purpose to keep them Prisoners, for if they might not have leave to do what they had resolv'd, in three hours there would not one of them be alive. The person entrusted, laugh'd at their threats; but the Keeper of those women opening the door at the end of the three hours, found them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106224:247"/>
all stretch'd out dead upon the place, without any mark in the world to be seen that they had any way hasten'd their own deaths.</p>
                        <p>Two of the most potent <hi>Raja's</hi> of <hi>India</hi> came to <hi>Agra</hi> in the year 1642, to do homage to <hi>Sha-jehan,</hi> who then reign'd; who not having acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they ought to have done, in the judgment of the Grand Master of the Kings Houshold, he told one of the <hi>Raja's</hi> one day, in the presence of the King, that they had not done well, to behave themselves in that manner toward so great a Monarch, as was the King his Master. The <hi>Raja</hi> looking upon himself to be a great King, and a great Prince, he and his Brother having brought along with them a Train of 15 or 16000 thousand Horse, was netl'd at the bold reproof which the Grand Master gave him, and drawing out his Dagger, slew him upon the place, in the presence of the King. The Grand Master falling at the feet of his own Brother, who stood close by him, he was going about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his death, but was prevented by the <hi>Raja's</hi> Brother, who stab'd him, and laid him athwart his Brothers Body. The King, who beheld these two murthers one upon the neck of the other, retir'd into his <hi>Haram</hi> for fear. But presently the <hi>Omrahs</hi> and other people fell upon the <hi>Raja's,</hi> and cut 'em to pieces. The King incens'd at such an attempt committed in his House and in his presence, commanded the <hi>Raja's</hi> bodies to be thrown into the River; which their Troops that they had left about <hi>Agra</hi> understanding, threaten'd to enter the City and pillage it. But rather than hazard the City, the King was advis'd to deliver them the Bodies of their Princes. When they were to be burn'd, thirteen Women belonging to the two <hi>Raja's</hi> Houses, came dancing and leaping, and presently got upon the Funeral pile, holding one another by hands, and being presently after stifl'd with the smoak, fell together into the fire. Presently the <hi>Bramins</hi> threw great heaps of Wood, pots of Oil, and other combustible matter upon them, to dispatch them the sooner.</p>
                        <p>I observ'd a strange passage at <hi>Patna,</hi> being then with the Governour, a young Gentleman of about twenty-four years of age, in his own House. While I was with him, in came a young woman, very handsome, and not above two and and twenty years old, who desir'd leave of the Governour to be burnt with the Body of her deceas'd Husband. The Governour compassionating her youth and beauty, endeavour'd to divert her from her resolution; but finding he could not prevail, with a surly countenance, he ask'd her whether she understood what the torment of fire was, and whether she had ever burnt her fingers? No, no, answer'd she more stoutly than before, I do not fear fire, and to let you know as much, send for a lighted Torch hither. The Governour abominating her answer, in great passion bid her go to the Devil. Some young Lords that were with the Governour, desir'd him to try the woman, and to call for a Torch; which with much ado he did, and a lighted Torch was brought. So soon as the woman saw the lighted Torch coming, she ran to meet it, and held her hand in the flame, not altering her countenance in the least; still searing her arm along up to the very elbow, till her flesh look'd as if it had been broil'd; whereupon the Governour commanded her out of his sight.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Bramin</hi> coming to <hi>Patna,</hi> and assembling all his Tribe together, told them, that they must give him two thousand Roupies, and twenty-seven Ells of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut. To which the chief among them made him answer, that they were poor, and could not possibly raise such a sum. However he persisted in his demand, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively affirming to them, that he would stay there without eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till they brought him the Money and the Cloath. With this resolution he climb'd a Tree, and setting in the fork between the boughs, remain'd there without eating or drinking for several days. The noise of this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance coming to the ears of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> where we lay, we set Sentinels to watch whether it were true, that a man could set so long without victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which he did for thirty days together. The one and thirtieth day of such an extraordinary Fast, the Idolaters fearing to kill one of their Priests for want of granting him his demand, club'd together, and brought him his twenty-seven Ells of Calicut, and two thousand Roupies. So soon as the <hi>Bramin</hi> saw the Money and the Cloath, he came down from the Tree; and after he had upbraided those of his Tribe for want of Charity, he distributed all the Roupies
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106224:247"/>
among the poor, reserving only five or six for himself. The Cloth he cut into little pieces, and gave away, keeping only to himself enough to cover his own nakedness; and having made this distribution, he disappear'd of a sudden, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body knew what became of him, though diligent search was made after him.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Chinese</hi> lies at the point of death, all his Kindred and Friends gather about him, and ask him whether he intends to go; they tell him also, that if he want any thing, he need but only ask and have, let it be Gold, Silver, or a Woman. When they are dead they perform many Ceremonies at their Funerals, which consists chiefly in artificial fires, wherein the <hi>Chineses</hi> are the most expert in the world; so that he must be a very poor man that has no fire-works at his Funeral. Besides that, they put Money in a little Box, and bury it by the deceas'd; and leave good store of victuals upon the Grave, out of an opinion that they rise and eat. Which the Souldiers of <hi>Batavia</hi> observing, us'd to fill their Bellies at these Graves every time they walk'd their rounds. But when the <hi>Chineses</hi> perceiv'd it, they poyson'd the victuals to spoil the <hi>Dutchmens</hi> feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Townsmen of <hi>Batavia</hi> taking the Souldiers part, accus'd the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> for poysoning several of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> But the <hi>Chineses</hi> pleaded, that if the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had over-eat themselves, or surfeted themselves upon what was left for the dead to eat, 'twas none of their fault; for that they did not leave their victuals for the Souldiers; and besides that, among all the multitudes which they had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they never had heard the least complaint before of any one that ever came by any harm by eating their food. Thus the business was hush'd over; nor did the Souldiers dare to pilfer any more.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the most celebrated <hi>Pagods</hi> of the Idolaters in <hi>India.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters have a great number of Temples, small and great, which they call <hi>Pagods,</hi> where they pray to their Gods, and make their Offerings. But the poor people that live in the Woods and Mountains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Towns, are contented only with some stone, whereon they make a rude kind of Nose, and paint it with some Vermilion colour, which serves all the whole neighbourhood to worship.</p>
                        <p>The four most celebrated Pagods, are <hi>Jagrenate, Banarous, Matura,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jagrenate</hi> is one of the mouths of <hi>Ganges,</hi> whereupon is built the Great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god, where the <hi>Arch Bramin,</hi> or chief Priest among the Idolaters keeps his residence. The great Idol that stands upon the Altar in the innermost part of the Pagod, has two Diamonds for his Eyes, and another that hangs about his neck, the least of those Diamonds weighing about forty Carats. About his Arms he wears Bracelets sometimes of Pearls, and sometimes of Rubies; and this magnificent Idol is call'd <hi>Resora.</hi> The Revenues of this Pagod are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to feed fifteen or twenty thousand Pilgrims every day; which is a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber often seen there, that Pagod being the greatest place of devotion in all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi> But you must take notice, that no Goldsmith is suffer'd to enter this Pagod, because that one of them being lock'd in all night long, stole a Diamond out of one of the Idols eyes. As he was about to go out, when the Pagod was open'd in the morning, he dy'd at the door; their God, as they affirm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging his own sacriledg. That which renders this Pagod, which is a large build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the most considerable in all <hi>India,</hi> is, because it is situated upon the <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> the Idolaters believing that the waters of that River have a particular quality to cleanse them from their sins. That which makes it so rich (for it maintains above twenty thousand Cows) is the vast Alms that are continually bestow'd by so incredible a multitude as comes from all parts. Which Alms are not so much at the discretion of the Donor, as at the will of the chief
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106224:248"/>
Priest, who before he gives them leave to shave and wash in <hi>Ganges,</hi> taxes them according to their quality, of which he has information. Thus he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects vast sums, of which he makes little or no profit himself; all going to feed the poor, and the repair of the Pagod. The chief <hi>Bramin</hi> causes Victuals to be distributed to the Pilgrims every day; as Milk, Rice, Butter, and Wheat; but to the poor, who want wherewithall to cook it, they distribute their food ready dresst. In the morning they boil a quantity of Rice in Earth'n pots of different bigness; and at the hour when the Pilgrims come for their meat, the chief <hi>Bramin</hi> orders another <hi>Bramin</hi> to take a pot of boil'd Rice; this pot he lets fall; and if there be five, the pot breaks into five equal parts, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one takes his own share. And in the same manner he breaks it into more pieces, if there be more persons, to whom he is to distribute the food. Which is a thing very strange and worthy observation. They never boil twice in an Earthen pot; but in a Copper pot; nor have they any other Dishes, than only certain Leaves, which they fasten together, and a certain kind of a Bason, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a foot in compass, wherein they melt their Butter, and stir the Rice with the ends of their fingers when they eat. They have also a kind of a Shell, wherein they pour their melted Butter, which they will swallow down, as we do Sack.</p>
                        <p>Now for the description of a particular Idol which stands upon the Altar in the Pagod of <hi>Jagrenate:</hi> It is cover'd from the Shoulders downward with a great Mantle that hangs down upon the Altar. This Mantle is of Tissue of Gold or Silver, according to the Solemnities. At first it had neither feet nor hands; but after one of their Prophets was taken up into Heaven, while they were lamenting what to do for another, God sent them an Angel in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Prophet, to the end they might continue their Veneration toward him. Now while this Angel was busie in making this Idol, the people grew so impatient, that they took him out of the Angels hands, and put him into the Pagod without hands or feet; but finding that the Idol appear'd in that manner too deformed, they made him hands and arms of those small Pearls which we call Ounce-Pearls. As for his feet, they are never seen, being hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Cloak. There is no part op'n but his hands and feet; the head and body being of Sandel-wood; round about the <hi>Duomo,</hi> under which this Idol stands, being very high, from the bottom to the top, are only Niches fill'd with other Idols; the greatest part whereof represent most hideous Monsters, being all of different colours. On each side of this Pagod, there stands ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much less, where the Pilgrims make their lesser Offerings. And some that have in sickness, or upon business made any Vows to any Deity, bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the resemblance thereof in remembrance of the good which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. They rub this Idol every day with sweet Oils, that make it of a black colour. And at the right hand of this Idol sits his Sister, who stands upon her feet, and is well clad, being call'd by the name of <hi>Sotora;</hi> upon his left, stands his Brother, cloath'd all over also; whom they call <hi>Balhader.</hi> Before the Idol, somewhat toward his left hand, stands the Idols Wife upon her feet, all of massy Gold, by the name of <hi>Remin;</hi> whereas the other three are only of Sandal-wood.</p>
                        <p>The two other Pagods are appointed for the residence of the chief <hi>Bramin,</hi> and other <hi>Bramins</hi> that officiate in the great Pagod. All these <hi>Bramins</hi> go with their heads bare, and for the most part shav'd; having no other Cloathes but only one piece of Calicut, with one half whereof they cover their bodies; the other part serves them instead of a Scarf. Near the Pagod stands the Tomb of one of their Prophets, whose name was <hi>Cabir,</hi> to whom they give great honour. You are to take notice also, that their Idols stand upon a kind of Altar, encompass'd with Iron Bars. For no persons are to touch them, but only certain <hi>Bramins,</hi> appointed for that service by the chief <hi>Bramin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next to that of <hi>Jagrenate,</hi> the most famous Pagod is that of <hi>Banarous,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also seated upon the <hi>Ganges,</hi> in a City that bears the same name. That which is most remarkable is, that from the Gate of the Pagod to the River there is a descent all of Stone; near to which are certain Platforms, and small blind Chambers, some for the <hi>Bramins</hi> lodging, others where they dress their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106224:248"/>
victuals; for so soon as the Idolaters have said their Prayers, and made their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, they dress their food, not suffering any person to touch it but themselves, for fear lest any unclean person should come neer it. But above all things, they passionately desire to drink of <hi>Ganges</hi> water; for as often as they drink it, they are wash'd, as they believe, from all their sins. Great numbers of these <hi>Bramins</hi> go every day to the cleanest part of the River, where they fill their little round earthen-pots full of water, the mouths whereof are very small, and contain every one of them a Bucket-full. Being thus fill'd, they bring them before the great Priest, who covers them with a fine piece of flame-colour'd Calicut, three or four times doubl'd, to which he sets his Seal. The <hi>Bramins</hi> carry these pots, some six of them ty'd together with six little cords fasten'd to the end of a stick as broad as a lath, shifting their shoulders often; travelling sometimes three or four hunder'd leagues with those precious burthens up into the Countrey. Where they sell it, ro present it; but that is only to the rich, from whence they expect great rewards. There are some of these Idolaters, who when they make any great Feast, especially when they marry their children, will drink four or five-hunder'd Crowns in this water. They never drink of it till the end of their meals; and then a glass or two according to the liberality of the Master of the Feast. The chief reason why they esteem the water of <hi>Ganges</hi> so highly, is, because it never putrifies, nor engenders any vermin; though I know not whether they may be believ'd, considering the great quantity of dead bodies which they fling into the <hi>Ganges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The body of the Pagod of <hi>Banarous</hi> is made like a Cross, as are all the rest of the Pagods, the four parts whereof are equal. In the midst there is a <hi>Cupola</hi> rais'd very high, the top whereof is pyramidal; at the end also of every four parts of the Cross there is a Tower, to which there is an ascent on the out-side. Before you come to the top, there are several Balconies and Niches wherein to take the fresh air: and round about are figures of all sorts of creatures, but very Leud work. Under the <hi>Duomo,</hi> in the middle of the Pagod there is an Altar, like a Table, eight foot long, and six foot broad, with two steps before, that serve for a footstool, which is cover'd sometimes with a rich Tapestry, sometimes with Silk, sometimes with Cloath of Gold or Silver, according to the solemnity of their Festival. Their Altars are cover'd with Cloath of Gold or Silver, or else with some painted Calicuts. Approaching the entry of the Pagod, you see the Altar right before ye, together with the Idols which are upon it. For the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Virgins worship without, not being permitted to enter the Pagod, no more than is a certain Tribe which is among them. Among the Idols that stand upon the great Altar, there is one plac'd upright some five or six foot high; but you can see neither arms, nor legs, nor body: nothing appears but the head and neck, all the rest being cover'd down to the Altar with a Robe that spreads it self below. Sometimes you shall see the neck set out with some rich Chain either of Gold, Rubies, Pearls, or Emraulds. This Idol was made in honour and likeness of <hi>Bainma-dou,</hi> who was heretofore a very great and holy Personage among them, whose name they oft'n have in their mouths. Upon the right-side of the Altar stands the figure of a <hi>Chimera,</hi> part Elephant, part Horse, part Mule. It is of massive Gold, and they call it <hi>Garou,</hi> not suffering any person to approach it but the <hi>Bramins.</hi> They say it is the resemblance of the Beast which carri'd that holy person when he liv'd upon earth. And that he travell'd long journeys upon his back, to see if the people remain'd in their duty, and whether they did no wrong one to another. Between the great Gate and the great Altar upon the left-hand, there is a little Altar, upon which there stands an Idol of black Marble sitting cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd, about two foot high. While I was there, a little Boy who was the Son of the High-Priest stood upon the left-side of the Altar, and all the people threw him certain pieces of Taffata, or embroider'd Calicut, like Handkerchiefs, all which he return'd to the people again after he had wip'd them upon the Idol. Others threw him Bracelets of Coral, others of yellow Amber, others threw him fruits and flowers; whatever they threw him, he rubb'd it upon the Idol, put it to his lips, and then restor'd it to the people. This Idol is call'd <hi>Morli-Ram,</hi> that is to say <hi>God-Morli,</hi> and was the Brother of him that stands upon the great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
                        <p>

Under the Portal of the Pagod sits one of the principal <hi>Bramins</hi> with a great Bason by him, full of a yellow colour mix'd with water. All these poor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters come and present themselves before him, who gives them a mark from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eyes to the top of the nose, then upon the arms, and upon the stomach; by which marks they know who have wash'd themselves in <hi>Ganges,</hi> and who not. Those that never wash'd themselves but in the waters of their own Wells, or have only sent for it from the River, they do not believe to be perfectly purifi'd, and by consequence they are not to be mark'd with that colour. By the way take notice, that these Idolaters are mark'd with different colours, according to the Tribe they are of. But in the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> they who are painted with yellow compose the biggest Tribe, and are the least defil'd. For when they are necessitated to the deeds of nature, some think it not enough to wash the part defil'd; but they first rub the part with a handful of sand, and then scour it with water. After so doing, they affirm their bodies to be clean, and that they can eat their food without fear.</p>
                        <p>Neer to this great Pagod upon the Summer-west, stands a kind of a Colledg, which the <hi>Raja Jesseing,</hi> the most Potent of all the Idolaters in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, built for the education of the youth of the better sort. I saw two of the children of that Prince there at School, who had for their Masters several <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> who taught them to write and read in a language peculiar to the Idolaters Priests, and far different from the speech of the common people. Entring into the Court of that Colledg, and casting my eyes up, I discover'd two Galleries that went round the Court, where I saw the two Princes sitting, attended by several petty Lords and <hi>Bramins,</hi> who made several Mathematical Figures upon the ground with chalk. The two Princes seeing me, sent to know who I was; and understanding that I was a <hi>Frank,</hi> they sent for me up, and ask'd me several questions touching <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly touching <hi>France.</hi> Whereupon there being two Globes in the room which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had giv'n the <hi>Bramins,</hi> I shew'd the Princes where <hi>France</hi> lay upon one of them. After I had taken leave, I ask'd one of the <hi>Bramins</hi> when I might see the Pagod open: he answer'd me, the next morning before Sun-rising. When I came there, I observ'd before the door, a Gallery supported with Pillars, where there was already a great crowd of men, women and children expecting when the Pagod would be open'd. By and by, the Gallery, and a great part of the Court being full, there came eight <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> four of each side of the Gate, with every one a Censer in his hand, follow'd by a rabble of other <hi>Bramins</hi> that made a hideous noise with Drums and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. The two eldest of the <hi>Bramins</hi> sing a Song; and then all the people, falling into the tune, fall a singing and playing, with every one a Peacock's-tall, or some other kind of flabel, to drive away the flies, that the Idol may not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annoid when they op'n the Pagod. This fanning, and the Musick, lasted a good half hour. Then the two principal <hi>Bramins</hi> made a great noise three times with two little Bells, and with a kind of a Mallet knockt at the Pagod-door. Which was presently open'd by six <hi>Bramins</hi> within, discovering, some six or seven paces from the entrance, an Altar with an Idol upon it, which they call <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Morli-Ram.</hi> Upon her right-hand she has a child made like a great <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> which they call the God <hi>La-kemin,</hi> and in her left-arm a little Girl, which they call the Goddess <hi>Sita.</hi> So soon as the Pagod was open, and that a great Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was drawn, the people, who perceiv'd the Idol, fell upon the ground, laying their hands upon their heads, and prostrating themselves three times. Then rising up, they threw great quantities of Nosegays and Garlands to the preists; with which the <hi>Bramins</hi> touch'd the Idol, and then restor'd them again. Before the Altar stood a <hi>Bramin,</hi> who held in his hand a lamp of nine weeks lighted, upon which he cast Incense every foot, and then held it to the Idol. All these ceremonies lasted above an hour; after which the people departed, and the Pagod was shut. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Idol with great store of Rice, Meal, Butter, Oil, and Milk-meats, of which the <hi>Bramins</hi> lose nothing. Now in regard this Idol is the representation of a Woman, the Women all invoke it, and call her their Patroness: which is the reason that the place is generally crowded with Women and Maids. The <hi>Raja,</hi> to have this Idol in the Pagod of his own house, and for taking it out of the great Pagod, has expended as well upon the <hi>Bramins,</hi> as in alms to the poor, above five Lacres of Roupies, or 750000 Livres of our Money.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:106224:249"/>
On the other side of the Street where the Colledg is built, there stands another Pagod, call'd <hi>Richourdas,</hi> from the name of the Idol, which is within upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: and somewhat lower upon another small Altar stands another Idol, which they call <hi>Goupaldas,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Richourdas.</hi> You see nothing but the face of all these Idols, which is either of wood or jet; unless it be the Idol of <hi>Morly-Ram,</hi> which stands in the great Pagod stark naked. As for the Idol <hi>Ram-Kam,</hi> which stands in the Raja's Pagod, it has two Diamonds instead of eyes, which the Prince caus'd to be set there, with a Coller of Pearl, and Canopy over his head, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with four Silver-Pillars.</p>
                        <p>Some eight days journey from <hi>Banarous,</hi> bending Northward, you enter into a Mountainous Countrey; but which sometimes op'ns it self into very large plains, sometimes three or four leagues in length. They are very fertil in Corn, Rice, Wheat and Pulse. But that which is the plague and ruine of the people of that Countrey, is the vast number of Elephants that breed there, and devour their Harvest. If a Caravan pass through any part of that Countrey where there are no Inns, in regard the people are forc'd to lye in the op'n Fields, they have much ado to defend themselves from the Elephants that will come to take away their provisions. To skare them, the people make great fires, shoot off their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, hooping and hollowing ever and anon. In this place there is another Pagod, well-built, and very ancient, adorn'd with many figures both within and without, which are only the representations of Maids and Women; so that Men are seldom known to repair thither for devotion's-sake; and therefore it is call'd the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Pagod. There is an Altar in the middle, as in other Pagods; and upon the Altar an Idol of massy Gold, four foot high, representing a Maid standing upright, which they call <hi>Ram-Marion.</hi> At her right-hand stands a Child of massy Silver, about two foot high; and they say that the Maid liv'd a very holy life, that that Child was brought to her by the <hi>Bramins</hi> to be instructed in her belief, and in the knowledg of well-living: but that after two or three years that the Child had liv'd with her, the Infant grew so knowing and ready-witted, that all the <hi>Raja's</hi> of the Countrey long'd for her company; so that being stoll'n from her one night, she was never seen afterwards. Upon the left-hand of this Idol stands another Idol, representing an old Man; who, as they say, was the servant of <hi>Ram-Marion</hi> and the Infant: for which reason the <hi>Bramins</hi> do very much reverence this Idol. They never come but once a year in devotion, but they must be there upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd day, which is the first of <hi>November,</hi> though they never op'n the Pagod till the full of the Moon. During those fifteen days, the Pilgrims, as well Men as Women, fast from time to time, and wash themselves three times a-day, not leaving a hair in any part of their bodies, which they take off with a certain earth.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> A Continuation of the description of the principal Pagods of the <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters.</head>
                        <p>NExt to the Pagods of <hi>Jngrenate</hi> and <hi>Banarous,</hi> the most considerable is that of <hi>Matura,</hi> about eighteen leagues from <hi>Agra,</hi> upon the way to <hi>Dehly.</hi> It is one of the most sumptuous Edifices in all <hi>India,</hi> and the place to which the greatest number of Pilgrims was wont to resort: But now there are very few or none; the Idolaters having insensibly lost the reverence which they had for that Pagod, since the River of <hi>Gemena,</hi> that formerly ran by that Pagod, has chang'd its course, above half a league from it. For it requires so much time to return to the Pagod, after they have wash'd in the River, that they were many times defil'd again before they could reach it. Though this Pagod stand in a bottom, yet you may discover it five or six leagues before you come at it, the building being very lofty and magnificent. The Stones are of a red colour,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106224:250"/>
which they fetch from a Quarry neer <hi>Agra.</hi> They cleave like our Slates, some of them being fifteen foot long, and nine or ten foot broad, yet not above six fingers thick, especially when you cleave them as you would have them for use: They also make very fair Pillars. The Fortress of <hi>Agra,</hi> the Walls of <hi>Jeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabat,</hi> the King's House, the two <hi>Mosquees,</hi> and several Noblemens Houses are all built of this Stone.</p>
                        <p>The Pagod is built upon a great Platform of an <hi>Octogonal</hi> Figure, pav'd with Free-stone; being adorn'd round about with the figures of all sorts of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, especially Apes. There is an ascent to it two ways of fifteen or sixteen steps a-piece, every step being two foot broad, for two persons to go a-brest. One of the ascents leads up to the great Portal of the Pagod, the other behind up to the Chancel. The Pagod does not take up above half the Platform, the other half serving for a <hi>Piazza</hi> before it. The Structure is in the form of a Cross, like the rest of the Pagods, in the midst whereof a great <hi>Duomo,</hi> with two others of each side somewhat less, advance themselves above the rest of the building. The out-side of the building from top to bottom is adorn'd with the figures of Rams, Apes and Elephants, and several sorts of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. From one foot below every one of these <hi>Duomo's,</hi> to the Roof, at such and such spaces, are Windows, some five, some six feet high, and to every Window belongs a Balcone, where four persons may stand. Every Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone is cover'd with a little Arch, supported by four Pillars, others by eight, every two touching one another. Round about the <hi>Duomo's</hi> are Niches fill'd with the figures of <hi>Daemons.</hi> Some with four arms, some with four legs. Some with mens heads upon the bodies of Beasts, and long tails that hang down to their thighes: There are abundance of Apes; and indeed it is an ugly sight to behold so many deform'd spectacles. There is but one great door to the Pagod, upon each side whereof there are Pillars and Figures of Men and Monsters. The hinder-part is clos'd with a close Balister of Stone-Pillars five or six inches in Diameter, into which, as into a kind of <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> none but the <hi>Bramins</hi> are permitted to enter: but for Money, I got in, and saw a square Altar some fifteen or sixteen foot from the door, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with an old Tissue of Gold and Silver, upon which stood the great Idol, which they call <hi>Ram, Ram.</hi> You see nothing but his head, which is of a very black Marble, with two Rubies instead of eyes. All the body, from the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the feet, is cover'd with a Robe of Purple-Velvet, with some small embroidery. There are two other Idols on each side of him two foot high, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell'd in the same manner; only their faces are white, which they call <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor.</hi> There I also saw a Machine sixteen foot square, and between twelve and fifteen foot high; cover'd with painted Calicuts, representing the shapes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. This Machine running upon four Wheels, they told me, was a moving Altar, upon which they carri'd their great God in Procession to visit the other Gods, as also to the River, whither all the people went upon their great Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Pagod is that of <hi>Tripeti,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> toward the Coast of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and <hi>Cape Comorin.</hi> I saw it as I went to <hi>Maslipatan.</hi> It is a Pagod to which there belong a great number of little lodgings for the <hi>Bramins:</hi> so that altogether it seems to be a great Town. There are several Ponds round about it; but their superstition is so great, that no Passenger dare take any water out of them, but what the <hi>Bramin</hi> gives him.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Pilgrimages of the Idolaters to their Pagods.</head>
                        <p>ALL the Idolaters under the Dominion of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and other Princes, both on this side and beyond <hi>Ganges,</hi> at least once in their lives go in Pilgrimage to one of these Pagods that I have nam'd; but most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to that of <hi>Jugrenate,</hi> as being the first and most considerable above all the rest. The <hi>Bramins</hi> and rich people go oftner. For some go every four years, some every six, or eight; and putting the Idols of their Pagods upon Pallekies cover'd with Tissues, they travell with their <hi>Bramins,</hi> as it were in procession to the Pagod which they most esteem.</p>
                        <p>They go not in Pilgrimage one by one, or two and two, but whole Towns, and many times several Towns together. The poor that go a great way, are supply'd by the rich; who spend very freely in such acts of Charity. The rich travel in Pallekies or Chariots, the poor on foot, or upon Oxen; the Wife carrying the Child, and the man the Kitchin Implements.</p>
                        <p>The Idol which they carry in procession, by way of visit, and out of respect to the great <hi>Ram-Ram,</hi> lies at length in a rich Palleky, cover'd with Tissue of Gold and Silver, fring'd as richly; the Mattress and Bolster being of the same stuff under the head, feet, and elbows. The <hi>Bramins</hi> also distribute Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to the most considerable of the Company, the handles whereof being eight foot long, are plated with Gold and Silver. The Flabel being three foot in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, of the same Tissue as the Pallekies; round about, it is adorn'd with Peacocks Feathers to gather more wind, and sometimes with Bells to make a kind of tingling. There are six of these Flabels usually employ'd to keep off the Flies from their God; the better sort taking it by turns, that the honour of waiting upon their God may be more equally shar'd.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of divers Customs of the <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters.</head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Bramins</hi> are well skill'd in Astrology; and will exactly foretell to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon. The second of <hi>July</hi> 1666, about one a Clock in the afternoon, at <hi>Patna</hi> in <hi>Bengala,</hi> there was an Eclipse of the Sun; at which time it was a prodigious thing to see the multitudes of people, men, women, and children, that ran to the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> to wash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But it behoves them to begin to wash three days before the Eclipse; all which time they labour day and night in providing all sorts of Rice, Milk, Meats, and Sweatmeats, to throw to the Fish and Crocodiles, as soon as the <hi>Bramins</hi> give the word. Whatever Eclipse it be whether of the Sun or Moon, the Idolaters as soon as it appears, break all their Earthen Pots and Dishes in the house, which makes a hideous noise altogether.</p>
                        <p>Every <hi>Bramin</hi> has his Magick Book, wherein are abundance of Circles and Semicircles, Squares, Triangles, and several sorts of Cifers. They also make several Figures upon the ground, and when they find that the good hour is come, they cry aloud to the people to feed the fish. Then there ensues a most horrible din of Drums, Bells, and great noise of sounding Mettal, which they twang one against another. And as soon as the victuals are thrown into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the people are to go in and wash and rub themselves till the Eclipse be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So that in regard the waters were at that time very high, for more than three Leagues above and below the City, and all the breadth of the River, there
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106224:251"/>
was nothing to be seen but the heads of the people. As for the <hi>Bramins,</hi> they stay ashore to receive the richer sort, and those that give most; to dry their bodies, and to give them dry Linnen to their bellies. Afterwards they cause them to sit down in a Chair, where the most liberal of the Idolaters have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Rice, Pulse, Milk, Butter, Sugar, Meal, and Wood. Before the Chair the <hi>Bramin</hi> makes a place very clean about five foot square; then with Cow-dung steep'd in a kind of yellow Bason, he rubs all the place, for fear any Emet should come there to be burnt. For indeed they would never make use of Wood if they could help it; and when they do, they are very careful that there be no Worms or Insects in it. In the place which they have thus cleans'd, they draw several Figures, as Triangles, Ovals, Half-Ovals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then upon every Figure they lay a little Cows-dung, with two or three small sticks of Wood, upon every one of which they lay a several sort of Grain; after that pouring Butter, and setting fire to each; by the smoak which rises, they judg of the plenty of every sort of Grain that year.</p>
                        <p>When the Moon is at the full in <hi>March,</hi> they keep a solemn Festival for their Idol, which is in form of a Serpent. This Festival continues nine days; and when it comes, they do nothing but make Holiday all the while, as well men as beasts, which they beautifie by making Circles about their eyes with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million, with which they also colour the Horns; and if they have a particular kindness for the beast, they hang them with Leaves of guilded Tin. Every morning they worship the Idol, and the Maids dance about it for an hour, to the noise of Fluits and Drums; after which they eat and drink and are merry till the evening, and then they worship and dance about their Idol again.</p>
                        <p>Though the Idolaters never drink any strong drink at other times, yet at this Festival they drink Palm-wine, and strong water, which is made of the same in remote Villages; for else their <hi>Mahometan</hi> Governour would not suffer them to make Wine, nor to sell any which might be brought out of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their strong Water is thus made: They take a great Earthen pot, well glaz'd within, which they call <hi>Martavane;</hi> into one of these Vessels, that holds three hundred <hi>Paris</hi> pints of <hi>Palma-</hi>wine, they put in fifty or sixty pound of brown Sugar unrefin'd, which looks like yellow Wax; with about twenty pound of a great thick bark of a Thorn, not much unlike that which our Leather-dressers use. This bark sets the <hi>Palma-</hi>wine a bubling and working just like our new wines, for five or six days together, till it becomes of a sweet Liquor, as sowre as our Crabs. Then they distill it, and according to the taste they would give, they either put into a Cauldron full, a little Bag of Mace, or three or four handfuls of Annise-seed. They can make it also as strong as they please.</p>
                        <p>Being at <hi>Agra</hi> in the year 1642, an Idolater, whose name was <hi>Woldas,</hi> Broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> about seventy years of age, receiving news that the chief <hi>Bramin</hi> of the Pagod of <hi>Matura</hi> was dead, went to the <hi>Hollander</hi> and desir'd him to even all accounts; for said he, the chief Priest being dead, it behoves me to dye, that I may serve him in the other world. Thereupon having ended his accounts, he took his Coach, with some of his Kindred; but having neither eaten nor drank from the time he receiv'd the news, he dy'd by the way; having famish'd himself for grief.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters have a custom, that when any person gives a thing, they snap their fingers, crying out, <hi>Gi-Narami,</hi> remember <hi>Narami,</hi> who was a great Saint among them, for fear the Evil Spirit should enter into the body of him that gives.</p>
                        <p>Being at <hi>Surat</hi> in the year 1653, a <hi>Raspoute</hi> being demanded Custom for three or four pieces of Calicut, boldly ask'd the Governour, whether a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that had serv'd the King all his life-time, ought to pay Custom for two or three pitiful pieces of Calicut, not worth four or five Roupies; telling him it was only to cloath his Wife and Children. The Governour netl'd at his sawciness, call'd him <hi>Bethico,</hi> or Son of a Whore; adding, that if he were Prince he would make him pay his Customs. Whereupon the Souldier incens'd at the affront, making as if he felt for Money to pay his dues, bearing up to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, stab'd him in the belly, so that he dy'd immediately.

Though the Idolaters are in utter darkness as to the knowledg of the true God, however the Law of Nature teaches them Morality in many things. When they are married they are seldom false to their Wives. Adultery is very rare among them. And as for <hi>Sodomy</hi> I never heard it mention'd. They marry their Children between seven and eight years old, for fear they should fall into that vice; the Ceremonies whereof are these: The day before the Nuptials, the Bridegroom, accompany'd by all his Kindred, goes to the House where the Bride lives, with a great pair of Bracelets, two fingers thick, hollow within, and in two pieces, with a hinge in the middle to open them. According to the quality of the Bride those Bracelets are of more or less value, sometimes of Gold, sometimes of Silver, Tin, or Latten, the poorest sort of all making use of Lead. The next day there is a great Feast at the Bridegrooms House, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Kindred on both sides are invited, and about three a Clock in the afternoon the Bride is brought thither. Then the chief of the <hi>Bramins</hi> that are there, of which there are always several, laying the head of the Bride to the Bridegrooms, pronounces several words, sprinkling their heads and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies all the while with water. Then they bring him upon Plates or Fig-leaves several sorts of Meats, Calicuts, and Stuffs; and then the <hi>Bramin</hi> asks the Bridegroom, whether so long as God shall make him able, he will let his Wife share with him, and whether he will endeavour to maintain her by his labour. If he says yes, they all set themselves down to the Feast prepar'd for them, where every one eats by himself. If the Bride be rich, and be acquainted among the Nobility, their Weddings are very pompous and expensive. The Bridegroom is mounted upon an Elephant, and the Bride rides in a Chariot; the whole Company carrying Torches in their hands. They also borrow of the Governour and the Nobility of the place, as many Elephants and prancing Horses as they can get. And they walk some part of the night with Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, which they throw about the Streets and Piazza's. But the greatest expence to those that live three or four hundred Leagues from it, is to get the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ganges;</hi> for in regard they account that water sacred, and drink it out of devotion, it must be brought them by the <hi>Bramins,</hi> and in Earthen Vessels, glaz'd within side, which the chief <hi>Bramin</hi> of <hi>Ingrenate</hi> fills himself with the purest Water of the River, and then seals up with his own Seal. They never drink this water till the end of the Feast, and then they give their guests three or more glasses apiece. This water coming so far, and the chief <hi>Bramin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a Tribute for every pot, which contains a Pail-full, sometimes a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comes to two or three thousand Roupies.</p>
                        <p>The eighth of <hi>April,</hi> being in a City of <hi>Bengala</hi> call'd <hi>Malde,</hi> the Idolaters made a great Feast, according to the particular Custom of that place; they all go out of the City, and fasten Iron hooks to the boughs of several Trees, then come a great number of poor people and hang themselves, some by the sides, some by the brawn of their backs, upon those hooks, till the weight of their body tearing away the flesh, they fall of themselves. 'Tis a wonderful thing to see that not so much as one drop of blood should issue from the wounded flesh, nor that any of the flesh should be left upon the hook; besides, that in two days they are perfectly cur'd by such Plaisters as their <hi>Bramins</hi> give them. There are others who at that Feast will lye upon a bed of nails, with the points upward, the nails entring a good way into the flesh; however while these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are under this Pennance, their Friends come and present them with Money and Linnen. When they have undergone their Penance, they take the presents and distribute them to the poor, without making any farther advantage of them. I ask'd one, why they made that Feast, and suffer'd those severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; who answer'd me, that it was in remembrance of the first man, whom they call'd <hi>Adam,</hi> as we do.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1666, I saw another sort of Penance, as I cross'd the <hi>Ganges;</hi> upon the Bank of which River they had prepar'd a clean place, where one of the poor Idolaters was condemn'd to rest upon the ground, touching it only with his hands and feet; which he was to do several times a day, and every time to kiss the earth three times before he rose up again. He was to rise up upon his left foot, never touching the ground with his right all the while. And
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106224:252"/>
every day for a month together before he either eat or drank he was oblig'd to this posture for fifty times together, and consequently to kiss the ground a hundred and fifty times. He told me, that the <hi>Bramins</hi> had enjoin'd him that Penance because he had suffer'd a Cow to dye in his House, and had not lead her to the water to be wash'd before she dy'd.</p>
                        <p>When an Idolater has lost any piece of Gold or Silver, or summ of Money either by negligence, or as being stoln from him, he is oblig'd to carry as much as he lost to the great <hi>Bramin;</hi> for if he does not, and that the other should come to know of it, he is ignominiously cast out of his Tribe, to make him more careful another time.</p>
                        <p>On the other side the <hi>Ganges</hi> Northward, toward the Mountains of <hi>Naugro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,</hi> there are two or three <hi>Raja's,</hi> who neither believe God nor the Devil. Their <hi>Bramins</hi> have a book containing their Belief, full of ridiculous absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereof the Author whose name is <hi>Baudou</hi> gives no reason. These <hi>Raja</hi>'s are the Great <hi>Moguls</hi> Vassals, and pay him Tribute.</p>
                        <p>To conclude the <hi>Malavares</hi> carefully preserve the nails of their left hands, and let their hair grow like women's. These nails, which are half a finger long, serve them instead of Combs; and it is with their left hand that they do all their drudgery, never touching their faces, nor what they eat, but with their right hands.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan,</hi> whence comes the Musk, the good Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, and some Furs.</head>
                        <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Boutan</hi> is of a large extent; but I could never yet come to a perfect knowledg thereof. I have set down all that I could learn at <hi>Patna,</hi> whither the Merchants of <hi>Boutan</hi> come to sell their Musk. The most excellent <hi>Rhubarb</hi> comes also from the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan.</hi> From hence is brought also that Seed which is good against the worms, therefore call'd Wormseed; and good store of Furs. As for the Rhubarb, the Merchants run a great hazard which way soever they bring it; for if they take the Northern Road, toward <hi>Caboul,</hi> the wet spoils it; if the Southern Road, in regard the journey is long, if the Rains happen to fall, there is as much danger that way; so that there is no Commodity requires more care then that.</p>
                        <p>As for the Musk, during the heats the Merchant loses by it, because it dries and loses its weight. Now in regard this Commodity pays twenty-five in the hundred Custom at <hi>Gorrochepour,</hi> the last Town belonging to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> next to the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan,</hi> when the <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants come to that City, they go to the Officer of the Custom-House, and tell him that they are going to <hi>Boutan</hi> to buy Musk or Rhubarb, and how much they intend to lay out; all which the Officer Registers, with the name of the Merchant. Then the Merchants instead of twenty-five, agree with him for seven or eight in the hundred, and take a Certificate from the Officer or Cadi, that he may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any more at their return. If the Officer refuses a handsom composition, then they go another way, over Desarts and Mountains cover'd with Snow, tedious and troublesome, till they come to <hi>Caboul,</hi> where the Caravans part, some for great <hi>Tartary,</hi> others for <hi>Balch.</hi> Here it is that the Merchants coming from <hi>Boutan</hi> barter their Commodities for Horses, Mules, and Camels; for there is little Money in that Country. Then those <hi>Tartars</hi> transport their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities into <hi>Persia,</hi> as far as <hi>Ardevile</hi> and <hi>Tauris;</hi> which is the reason that some <hi>Europeans</hi> have thought that Rhubarb and Wormseed came out of <hi>Tartary.</hi> True it is, that some Rhubarb comes from thence; but not so good as that of <hi>Boutan,</hi> being sooner corrupted; for Rhubarb will eat out its own heart. The <hi>Tartars</hi> carry back out of <hi>Persia</hi> Silks of small value, which are made in <hi>Tauris</hi>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:106224:252"/>
and <hi>Ardevile,</hi> and some <hi>English</hi> Cloth brought by the <hi>Armenians</hi> from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> and <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Some of the Merchants that come from <hi>Caboul</hi> and <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> go to <hi>Candahar,</hi> and thence to <hi>Ispahan;</hi> whether they carry Coral in Beads, yellow Amber, and <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> Beads, if they can meet with it. The other Merchants that come from the Coast of <hi>Multan, Lahor,</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> bring only Linnons, Indigo, and store of <hi>Cornelian</hi> and Christal Beads. Those that return through <hi>Gorrochepour,</hi> and are agreed with the Officer of the Custom-House, carry from <hi>Patna</hi> and <hi>Daca,</hi> Coral, yellow Amber, Bracelets of Tortois-shells, and other Shells, with great store of round and square thick pieces of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois. When I was at <hi>Patna,</hi> four <hi>Armenians</hi> who had been before at <hi>Boutan,</hi> return'd from <hi>Dantzick,</hi> where they had made certain Figures of yellow Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, representing the shapes of several Creatures and Monsters, which they were carrying to the King of <hi>Boutan,</hi> who is an Idolater, as are all his people, to set up in his Pagods. For the <hi>Armenians</hi> for Money will sell any thing of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and they told me besides, that if they could but have made the Idol which the King of <hi>Boutan</hi> bespoke of them, they should have done their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Which was to have been a Monsters head, with six horns, four ears, four arms, and six fingers upon every hand, all of yellow Amber; but they could not find pieces big enough.</p>
                        <p>The Caravan is three months travelling from <hi>Patna</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> It sets out from <hi>Patna</hi> about the end of <hi>December,</hi> and eight days after arrives at <hi>Gorrochepour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From <hi>Gorrochepour</hi> to the foot of the high Mountains, is eight or nine days journey more, during which the Caravan suffers very much hardship, for the Country is nothing but wide Forrests, full of wild Elephants. So that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, instead of taking their rests, are forc'd to watch, keep fires, and shoot off their Muskets all the night long. For the Elephant making no noise in tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would else be upon the Caravan before they were aware; not that he comes to do any mischief to the men, but to get what victuals he can find. You may travel from <hi>Patna</hi> to the foot of those Mountains in Palleki's. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they ride upon Oxen, Camels, or Horses, bred in the Country. Those Horses are generally so little, that when a man is upon the back of them, his feet touch the ground; but they will travel twenty Leagues an end, and never bait, or else with a very small one. Some of those Horses cost two hundred Crowns; for indeed when you come to cross the Mountains, you can make use of no other sort of carriage but them, in regard of the narrowness and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedness of the Passes; which many times put the Horses very much to it, as strong and as low as they are.</p>
                        <p>Five or six Leagues beyond <hi>Gorrochepour</hi> you enter into the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Nupal,</hi> which extend to the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan.</hi> This <hi>Raja</hi> is a Tributary to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and pays him every year an Elephant for his Homage. He resides in the City of <hi>Nupal,</hi> from whence he derives his Title; but there is little either Trade or Money in his Country, which is all Woods and Forrests.</p>
                        <p>The Caravan being arriv'd at the foot of these Mountains, which are call'd at this day by the name of <hi>Naugrocot,</hi> abundance of people come from all parts of the Mountain, the greatest part whereof are women and maids, who agree with the Merchants to carry them, their goods and provisions cross the Mountains, which is eight days journey more.</p>
                        <p>The women carry upon each shoulder a woollen Roll, to which is fasten'd a large Cushion, that hangs down upon their backs, upon which the man sits. There are three women to carry one man, relieving one another by turns. And for their luggage and provisions, they lade them upon Goats, that will carry a hundred and fifty pound weight apiece. Those that will ride, are in many places forc'd to have their Horses hoisted up with Cords. They never feed them but morning and evening, mixing a pound of meal, half a pound of brown Sugar, and half a pound of Butter together, with water sufficient. In the evening they must be contented only with a few flat Peason, bruis'd, and steep'd half an hour in water. The women that carry the men, get for their ten days travel two Roupies apiece, and as much for every burthen which the Goats carry, and for every Horse which they lead.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:106224:253"/>
After you have pass'd the Mountains, you may travel to <hi>Boutan</hi> upon Oxen, Camels, Horses, or Palleki's, which you please. The Country is good, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Rice, Corn, Pulse, and store of wine. All the people both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are clad in the Summer with a large piece of Fustian, or Hempen-Cloath; in the Winter with a thick Cloth, almost like Felt. Both men and women wear upon their heads a kind of Bonnet, much like our drinking Cans, which they adorn with Boars teeth, and with round and square pieces of Tortois-Shells. The richer sort intermix Coral and Amber Beads, of which their women make them Neck-Laces. The men as well as the women wear Bracelets upon their left hands only, from the wrist to the elbow. The women wear them strait, the men loose. About their necks they wear a silken twist, at the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hangs a Bead of yellow Amber or Coral, or a Boars Tooth, which dangles upon their breasts. On their left sides, their Girdles are button'd with Beads of the same. Though they be Idolaters, yet they feed upon all sort of food, except the flesh of Cows, which they adore as the common Nurses of all men; they are besides great lovers of strong water. They observe also some Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> burning Amber at the end of their Feasts, though they do not worship fire like the <hi>Chineses.</hi> For which reason the Merchants of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> will give at <hi>Patna</hi> for a <hi>Serre</hi> of large pieces of yellow Amber, as big as a Nut, bright and clean, thirty-five and forty Roupies. The <hi>Serre</hi> of yellow Amber, Musk, Coral, Ambergrise, Rhubarb, and other Drugs, containing nine Ounces to the pound. Saltpeter, Sugar, Rice, Corn, and other Commodities, are also sold by the <hi>Serre</hi> in <hi>Bengala;</hi> but the <hi>Serre</hi> contains seventy-two of our Pounds, at sixteen Ounces to the Pound; and forty <hi>Serres</hi> make a <hi>Mein,</hi> or 2824 Pounds of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To return to yellow Amber, a piece of nine ounces is worth in <hi>Boutan</hi> from 250 to 300 Roupies, according to its colour and beauty. Coral rough, or wrought into Beads, yields profit enough; but they had rather have it rough, to shape it as they please themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Women and Maids are generally the Artists among them, as to those toys. They also make Beads of Crystal and <hi>Agat.</hi> As for the Men, they make Bracelets of Tortoise-shell, and Sea-shells, and polish those little pieces of Shells which the Northern people wear in their ears, and in their hair. In <hi>Patna</hi> and <hi>Daca</hi> there are above two thousand persons that thus employ themselves, furnishing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Boutan, Asem, Siam,</hi> and other Northern and Eastern parts of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi>'s Dominions.</p>
                        <p>As for Wormseed, the Herb grows in the Fields, and must dye before the Seed can be gather'd: but the mischief is, that before the Seed is ripe, the wind scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the greatest part, which makes it so scarce. When they gather the Seed, they take two little Hampers, and as they go along the Fields, they move their Hampers from the right to the left, and from the left to the right, as if they were mowing the Herb, bowing it at the top, and so all the Seed falls into the Hampers.</p>
                        <p>Rhubarb is a Root which they cut in pieces, and stringing them by ten or twelve together, hang them up a drying.</p>
                        <p>Had the Natives of <hi>Boutan</hi> as much art in killing the Martin as the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> they might vend great store of those rich Furs, considering what a number of those Beasts there are in that Countrey. No sooner does that creature peep out of his hole, but the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who lye upon the watch, have e'm presently, either in the nose or in the eyes; for should they hit e'm in the body, the blood would quite spoyl the skin.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Boutan</hi> has constantly seven or eight thousand Men for his Guard. Their Weapons are for the most part Bows and Arrows. Some of them carry Battel-axes, and Bucklers. 'Tis a long time ago since they had the first use of Muskets and Cannons: their Gun-powder being long, but of an extraordinary force. They assur'd me that some of their Cannons had Letters and Figures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that were above five-hunder'd years old. They dare not stir out of the Kingdom without the Governor's particular leave; nor dare they carry a Musket along with them, unless their next Kindred will undertake for them that they shall bring it back. Otherwise I had brought one along with me; for by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106224:253"/>
upon the Barrel, it appear'd to have been made above 180 years. It was very thick, the mouth of the bore being like a Tulip, polish'd within as bright as a Looking-glass. Two thirds of the Barrel were garnish'd with emboss'd Wires, with certain Flowers of Gold and Silver inlaid between; and it carri'd a Bullet that weigh'd an ounce. But I could not prevail with the Merchant to sell it me, nor to give me any of his powder.</p>
                        <p>There are always fifty Elephants kept about the King's House, and twenty five Camels, with each a Piece of Artillery mounted upon his back, that carries half a pound Ball. Behind the Gun sits a Cannoneer that manages and levels the Guns as he pleases.</p>
                        <p>There is no King in the World more fear'd and more respected by his Subjects then the King of <hi>Boutan;</hi> being in a manner ador'd by them. When he sits to do Justice, or give Audience, all that appear in his presence hold their hands close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether above their forheads: and at a distance from the Throne prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the ground, not daring to lift up their heads. In this humble posture they make their Petitions to the King; and when they retire, they go backwards till they are quite out of his sight. One thing they told me for truth, that when the King has done the deeds of nature, they diligently preserve the ordore, dry it and powder it, like sneezing-powder: and then putting it into Boxes, they go every Market-day, and present it to the chief Merchants, and rich Farmers, who recompence them for their kindness: that those people also carry it home, as a great rarity, and when they feast their Friends, strew it upon their meat. Two <hi>Boutan</hi> Merchants shew'd me their Boxes, and the Powder that was in them.</p>
                        <p>The Natives of <hi>Boutan</hi> are strong and well proportion'd; but their noses and faces are somewhat flat. Their women are said to be bigger and more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the men; but that they are much more troubled with swellings in the throat then the men, few escaping that disease. They know not what war is, having no enemy to fear but the <hi>Mogul.</hi> But from him they are fenc'd with high, steep, craggy, and snowey Mountains. Northward there are nothing but vast Forrests and Snow. East and West nothing but bitter water. And as for the <hi>Raja's</hi> near them, they are Princes of little force.</p>
                        <p>There is certainly some Silver Mine in the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan,</hi> for the King coins much Silver, in pieces that are of the value of a Roupy. The pieces are already describ'd. However the <hi>Boutan</hi> Merchants could not tell me where the Mine lay. And as for their Gold, that little they have is brought them from the East, by the Merchants of those Countries.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1659, the Duke of <hi>Muscovy's</hi> Embassadors pass'd through this Country to the King of <hi>China.</hi> They were three of the greatest Noblemen in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and were at first very well receiv'd; but when they were brought to kiss the Kings hands, the custom being to prostrate themselves three times to the ground, they refus'd to do it, saying that they would complement the King after their manner, and as they approach'd their own Emperor, who was as great and as potent as the Emperor of <hi>China.</hi> Thereupon, and for that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in their resolution, they were dismiss'd with their presents, not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to see the King. But had those Embassadors conform'd to the custom of <hi>China,</hi> without doubt we might have had a beaten rode through <hi>Muscovy</hi> and the North part of Great <hi>Tartary,</hi> and much more commerce and knowledge of the Country than now we have.</p>
                        <p>This mentioning the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> puts me in mind of a story that several <hi>Muscovy</hi> Merchants averr'd to be true, upon the rode between <hi>Tauris</hi> and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan,</hi> where I overtook them, of a woman of fourscore and two years of age, who at those years was brought to bed in one of the Cities of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> of a Male Child, which was carry'd to the Duke, and by him brought up at the Court.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the Kingdom of</hi> Tipra.</head>
                        <p>MOst people have been of opinion till now, that the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> lies upon the Frontiers of <hi>China;</hi> and I thought so my self, till the Merchants of <hi>Tipra</hi> undeceiv'd me. I met with three, one at <hi>Daca,</hi> and two others at <hi>Patna.</hi> They were men of very few words; whether it were their own particular disposition, or the general habit of the Country. They cast up their accounts with small Stones likes Agats, as big as a mans nail, upon every one of which was a Cypher. They had every one their weights, like a Stelleer; though the Beam were not of Iron, but of a certain Wood as hard as Brazile; nor was the Ring that holds the weight, and is put thorough the Beam to mark the weight, of Iron, but a strong Silk Rope. And thus they weigh'd from a Dram to ten of our Pounds. If all the Natives of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Tipra</hi> were like the two Merchants which I met at <hi>Patna,</hi> I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them to be notable topers; for they never refus'd whatever strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor I gave them, and never left till all was out; and when I told them by my Interpreter that all my Wine was gone, they clapt their hands upon their stomachs and sigh'd. These Merchants travell'd all three through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Arakan,</hi> which lies to the South and West of <hi>Tipra,</hi> having some part of <hi>Pegu</hi> upon the Winter West. They told me also, that it was about fifteen days journey to cross through their Country; from whence there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conjecture of the extent to be made, by reason of the inequality of the stages. They ride upon Oxen and Horses, which are low. but very hardy. As for the King and the Nobility, they ride in their Pallekies, or upon their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants of War. They are no less subject to Wens under their throats, than those of <hi>Boutan;</hi> insomuch that the women have those Wens hanging down to their Nipples; which proceeds from the badness of the waters.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing in <hi>Tipra</hi> which is fit for strangers. There is a Mine of Gold, but the Gold is very course. And there is a sort of very course Silk, which is all the Revenue the King has. He exacts no Subsidies from his Subjects; but only that they, who are not of the prime Nobility, should work six days in a year in his Mine, or in his Silk-works. He sends his Gold and his Silk into <hi>China,</hi> for which they bring him back Silver, which he coins into pieces to the value of ten Sous. He also makes thin pieces of Gold, like the <hi>Aspers</hi> of <hi>Turky;</hi> of which he has two sorts, four of the one sort making a Crown, and twelve of the other.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the Kingdom of</hi> Asem.</head>
                        <p>IT was never known what the Kingdom of <hi>Asem</hi> was, till <hi>Mirgimola</hi> had setl'd <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> in the Empire. For he considering that he should be no longer valu'd at Court, after the war was at an end, being then General of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-zeb</hi>'s Army, and powerful in the Kingdom, where he had great store of Creatures, to preserve the Authority he had, resolv'd to undertake the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Kingdom of <hi>Asem;</hi> where he knew he should find little or no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, that Kingdom having been at peace above 500 years before. 'Tis thought these were the people that formerly invented Guns and Powder; which spead it self from <hi>Asem</hi> to <hi>Pegu,</hi> and from <hi>Pegu</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> from whence the invention has been attributed to the <hi>Chineses.</hi> However certain it is, that <hi>Mirgimola</hi> brought from thence several pieces of Canon, which were all Iron Guns, and store of excellent Powder, both made in that Countrey. The Powder is round and small, like ours, and very strong.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mirgimola</hi> embark'd his Army in one of the mouths of <hi>Ganges,</hi> and sailing up one of the Rivers that comes from the Lake <hi>Chiamay,</hi> to the twenty-ninth or thirtieth Degree, he landed his Army, and came into a Country abounding in all humane necessaries, still finding the less resistance because the people were surpriz'd. Being a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> he spar'd not the very Pagods, but burn'd and sack'd all where-ever he came to the thirty-fifth Degree. There he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the King of <hi>Asem</hi> was in the field with a more powerful Army than he expected, and that he had several pieces of Canon, and great store of fire-works withall. Thereupon <hi>Mirgimola</hi> thought it not convenient to march any farther; though the chief reason of his return was the drawing on of Winter; which the <hi>Indians</hi> are so sensible of, that it is impossible to make them stir beyond the thirti'th or thirty-fifth Degree, especially to hazard their lives.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mirgimola</hi> therefore turns to the South-west, and besieges a City call'd <hi>Azoo,</hi> which he took in a small time, and found good plunder therein. In this City of <hi>Azoo,</hi> are the Tombs of the Kings of <hi>Asem,</hi> and of all the Royal Family. For though they are Idolaters, they never burn their dead bodies, but bury them. They believe that the dead go into another world, where they that have liv'd well in this, have plenty of all things; but that they who have been ill livers, suffer the want of all things, being in a more especial manner afflicted with hunger and drowth; and that therefore it is good to bury something with them to serve them in their necessities. This was the reason that <hi>Mirgimola</hi> found so much wealth in the City of <hi>Azoo.</hi> For many ages together, several Kings had built them Chappels in the great Pagod to be buried in, and in their life times had stor'd up in the Vaults of their particular Chappels, great sums of Gold and Silver, and other moveables of value. Besides, that when they bury the deceas'd King, they bury with him likewise whatever he esteem'd most pretious in his life-time, whether it were an Idol of Gold or Silver, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else, that being needful in this, might be necessary for him in the world to come. But that which favours most of Barbarism is, that when he dies, all his best beloved Wives, and the principal Officers of his House poyson them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to be buri'd with him, and to wait upon him in the other world. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, they bury one Elephant, twelve Camels, six Horses, and a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Hounds, believing that all those Creatures rise again to serve their King.</p>
                        <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Asem</hi> is one of the best Countries of all <hi>Asia,</hi> for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces all things necessary for humane subsistence, without any need of foreign supply. There are in it Mines of Gold, Silver, Steel, Lead, Iron, and great store of Silk, but course. There is a sort of Silk that is found under the the Trees, which is spun by a Creature like to our Silk-worms, but rounder,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106224:255"/>
and which lives all the year long under the trees. The Silks which are made of this Silk glist'n very much, but they fret presently. The Country produces also great store of Gum-Lake; of which there is two sorts, one grows under the trees of a red colour, wherewith they paint their Linnen and Stuffs; and when they have drawn out the red juice, the remaining substance serves to var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Cabinets, and to make Wax; being the best Lake in <hi>Asia</hi> for those uses. As for their Gold they never suffer it to be transported out of the Kingdom, nor do they make any Money of it; but they preserve it all in Ingots, which pass in trade among the Inhabitants; but as for the Silver, the King coins it into Money, as is already describ'd.</p>
                        <p>Though the Country be very plentiful of all things, yet there is no flesh which they esteem so much as Dogs flesh; which is the greatest delicacy at all Feasts; and is sold every month in every City of the Kingdom upon their Market-days. There are also great store of Vines, and very good Grapes, but they never make any Wine; only they dry the Grapes to make <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> As for Salt they have none but what is artificial, which they make two ways. First they raise great heaps of that green Stuff that swims at the top of standing waters, which the Ducks and Frogs eat. This they dry and burn; and the ashes thereof being boil'd in a Cloth in water, become very good Salt. The other way most in use is to take the leaves of <hi>Adams</hi> Fig-tree, which they dry and burn; the ashes whereof make a Salt so tart, that it is impossible to eat it until the tartness be tak'n away; which they do by putting the ashes in water, where they stir them ten or twelve hours together; then they strain the substance through a Linnen Cloth and boil it; as the water boils away, the bottom thick'ns; and when the water is all boil'd away, they find at the bottom very good and white Salt.</p>
                        <p>Of the ashes of these Fig-leaves they make a Lye, wherewith they wash their Silk, which makes it as white as Snow; but they have not enough to whiten half the Silk that grows in the Country.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Kenneroof</hi> is the name of the City where the King of <hi>Asem</hi> keeps his Court; twenty-five or thirty days journey from that which was formerly the Capital City, and bore the same name. The King requires no Subsidies of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but all the Mines in his Kingdom are his own; where for the ease of his Subjects, he has none but slaves that work; so that all the Natives of <hi>Asem</hi> live at their ease, and every one has his house by himself, and in the middle of his ground a fountain encompass'd with trees; and most commonly every one an Elephant to carry their Wives; for they have four Wives, and when they marry, they say to one, I take thee to serve me in such a thing; to the other, I appoint thee to do such business; so that every one of the Wives knows what she has to do in the House. The men and women are generally well complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; only those that live more Southerly are more swarthy, and not so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Wens in their throats; neither are they so well featur'd, besides that the women are somewhat flat Nos'd. In the Southern parts the people go stark naked, only covering their private parts, with a Bonnet like a blew Cap upon their heads, hung about with Swines teeth. They pierce holes in their ears, that you may thrust your thumb in, whete they hang pieces of Gold and Silver. Bracelets also of Tortoise-shells, and Sea-shells as long as an egg, which they saw into Circles, are in great esteem among the meaner sort; as Bracelets of Coral and yellow Amber among those that are rich. When they bury a man, all his Friends and Relations must come to the burial; and when they lay the body in the ground, they all take off their Bracelets from their Armsand Legs, and bury them with the Corps.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE greatest part of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> lies between the Golf of <hi>Siam</hi> and the Golf of <hi>Bengala;</hi> bordering upon <hi>Pegu</hi> toward the North, and the <hi>Peninsula</hi> of <hi>Malacca</hi> toward the South. The shortest and nearest way for the <hi>Europaeans</hi> to go to this Kingdom, is to go to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to <hi>Ormus,</hi> from <hi>Ormus</hi> to <hi>Surat,</hi> from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Golconda,</hi> from <hi>Golconda</hi> to <hi>Maslipatan,</hi> there to embark for <hi>Denouserin,</hi> which is one of the Ports belonging to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Siam.</hi> From <hi>Denouserin</hi> to the Capital City, which is also call'd <hi>Siam,</hi> is thirty-five days journey, part by Water, part by Land, by Waggon, or upon Elephants. The way, whether by Land or Water, is very troublesome; for by Land you must be always upon your guard, for fear of Tigers and Lions; by Water, by reason of the many falls of the River, they are forc'd to hoise up their Boats with Engines.</p>
                        <p>All the Countrey of <hi>Siam</hi> is very plentiful in Rice and Fruits; the chiefest whereof are <hi>Mangos, Durions,</hi> and <hi>Mangustans.</hi> The Forests are full of Harts, Elephants, Tigers, Rhinocero's, and Apes; where there grow also large Bambou's in great abundance. Under the knots of these Bambou's are Emets nests as big as a mans head, where every Emet has his apartiment by himself; but there is but one hole to enter into the nest. They make their nests in these Canes to preserve themselves from the rains which continue four or five months together.</p>
                        <p>In the night time the Serpents are very busie. There are some two foot long, with two heads; but one of them has no motion.</p>
                        <p>There is also another creature in <hi>Siam,</hi> like our <hi>Salamander,</hi> with a forked tail, and very venomous.</p>
                        <p>The Rivers in this Kingdom are very large; and that which runs by <hi>Siam</hi> is equally as large as the rest. The water is very wholesome; but it is very full of Crocodiles of a monstrous bigness, that devour men if they be not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of themselves. These Rivers overflow their banks while the Sun is in the Southern Tropick; which makes the fields to be very fertile as far as they flow; and it is observ'd, that the Rice grows higher or lower, as the floods do more or less increase.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Siam,</hi> the Capital City of the Kingdom, where the King keeps his Court, is wall'd about, being about three of our Leagues in circuit; it is situated in an Island, the River running quite round it, and might be easily brought into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry street in the Town, if the King would but lay out as much Money upon that design, as he spends in Temples and Idols.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Siamers</hi> have thirty-three Letters in their Alphabet. But they write from the left to the right, as we do, contrary to the custom of <hi>Japon, China, Cochinchina,</hi> and <hi>Tunquin,</hi> who write from the right to the left.</p>
                        <p>All the Natives of this Kingdom are slaves, either to the King or the great Lords. The women as well as the men cut their hair; neither are they very rich in their habits. Among their complements, the chiefest is, never to go before a person that they respect, unless they first ask leave, which they do by holding up both their hands. Those that are rich have several Wives.</p>
                        <p>The Money of the Country is already describ'd.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> is one of the richest Monarchs in the East, and stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self King of Heaven and Earth; though he be Tributary to the Kings of <hi>China.</hi> He seldom shews himself to his Subjects; and never gives Audience, but to the principal Favourites of his Court. He trusts to his Ministers of State, for the management of his affairs, who sometimes make very bad use of their authority. He never shews himself in publick above twice a year; but then it is with an extraordinary magnificence. The first is, when he goes to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pagod within the City, which is guilded round both within and without. There are three Idols between six and seven foot high, which are all of massie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106224:256"/>
Gold; which he believes he renders propitious to him, by the great store of Alms that he distributes among the poor, and the presents which he makes to the Priests. Then he goes attended by all his Court, and puts to open view the richest Ornaments he has. One part of his magnificence consists in his train of two hundred Elephants; among which there is one that is white, which the King so highly esteems, that he stiles himself King of the <hi>White Elephant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second time the King appears in publick, is when he goes to another Pagod five or six Leagues above the Town, up the River. But no person must enter into this Pagod, unless it be the King and his Priests. As for the people, so soon as they see the Door op'n, they must presently fall upon their faces to the Earth. Then the King appears upon the River with two hundred Gallies of a prodigious length; four hundred Rowers belonging to every one of the Gallies; most of them being guilded and carv'd very richly. Now in regard this second appearance of the King is in the month of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> when the waters begin to abate, the Priests make the people believe that none but the King can stop the course of the waters, by his Prayers and by his Offerings to this Pagod. And they are so vain as to think that the King cuts the waters with his <hi>Sabra,</hi> or Skain; thereby commanding it to retire back into the Sea.</p>
                        <p>The King also goes, but <hi>incognito,</hi> to a Pagod in an Island where the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> have a Factory. There is at the entry thereof an Idol sitting cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd, with one hand upon his knee, and the other arm akimbo. It is above sixty foot high; and round about this Idol are about three hundred others, of several sorts and sizes. All these Idols are guilt. And indeed there are a prodigious number of Pagods in this Countrey; for every rich <hi>Siamer</hi> causes one to be built in memory of himself. Those Pagods have Steeples and Bells, and the Walls within are painted and guilded; but the Windows are so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that they give but a very dim light. The two Pagods to which the King goes publickly, are adorn'd with several tall Pyramids, well guilded. And to that in the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Island there belongs a Cloyster, which is a very neat Structure. In the middle of the Pagod is a fair Chappel, all guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within side; where they find a Lamb, and three Wax Candles continually burning before the Altar, which is all over cover'd with Idols, some of massie Gold, others of Copper guilt. In the Pagod in the midst of the Town, and one in of those to which the King goes once a year, there are above four thousand Idols; and for that which is six Leagues from <hi>Siam,</hi> it is surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Pyramids, whose beauty makes the industry of that Nation to be admir'd.</p>
                        <p>When the King appears, all the Doors and Windows of the Houses must be shut; and all the people prostrate themselves upon the ground, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to lift up their eyes. And because no person is to be in a higher place than the King, they that are within doors, are bound to keep their lowest Rooms. When he cuts his hair, one of his Wives performs that office, for he will not suffer a Barber to come near him.</p>
                        <p>This Prince has a passionate kindness for his Elephants; which he looks upon as his Favourites, and the Ornaments of his Kingdom. If there be any of them that fall sick, the Lords of the Court are mighty careful to please their Soveraign; and if they happ'n to dye, they are buried with the same Funeral Pomp as the Nobles of the Kingdom; which are thus performed: They set up a kind of <hi>Mausoleum,</hi> or Tomb of Reeds, cover'd with Paper; in the midst whereof they lay as much sweet wood as the body weighs, and after the Priests have mumbl'd certain Orisons, they set it a-fire, and burn it to ashes; which the rich preserve in Gold or Silver Urns, but the poor scatter in the wind. As for offenders, they never burn, but bury them.</p>
                        <p>'Tis thought that in this Kingdom there are above two hundred Priests, which they call <hi>Bonzes,</hi> which are highly reverenc'd as well at Court as among the people. The King himself has such a value for some of them, as to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself before them. This extraordinary respect makes them so proud, that some of them have aspir'd to the Throne. But when the King discovers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106224:256"/>
any such design, he puts them to death. And one of them had his head lately struck off for his Ambition.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>Bonzes</hi> wear yellow, with a little red Cloth about their Wasts, like a Girdle. Outwardly they are very modest, and are never seen to be angry. About four in the morning, upon the tolling of their Bells, they rise to their prayers, which they repeat again toward evening. There are some days in the year when they retire from all converse with men. Some of them live by Alms; others have Houses with good Revenues. While they wear the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of <hi>Bonzes,</hi> they must not marry; for if they do, they must lay their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit aside. They are generally very ignorant, not knowing what they believe. Yet they hold the transmigration of Souls into several Bodies. They are forbidd to kill any Creature; yet they will make no scruple to eat what others kill, or that which dies of it self. They say that the God of the Christians and theirs were Brothers; but that theirs was the eldest. If you ask them where their God is, they say, he vanish'd away, and they know not where he is.</p>
                        <p>The chief strength of the Kingdom is their Infantry, which is indifferent good; the Soldiers are us'd to hardship, going all quite naked, except their private parts; all the rest of their body, looking as if it had been cupt, is carv'd into several shapes of beasts and flowers. When they have cut their skins, and stanch'd the blood, they rub the cut-work with such colours as they think most proper. So that afar off you would think they were clad in some kind of flower'd Satin or other; for the colours never rub out. Their weapons are Bows and Arrows, Pike and Musket, and an <hi>Azagaya,</hi> or Staff between five and six foot long with a long Iron Spike at the end, which they very dextrously dart at the Enemy.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1665, there was at <hi>Siam</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan Jesuite,</hi> who was call'd Father <hi>Thomas;</hi> he caus'd the Town and the Kings Palace to be fortifi'd with very good Bulwarks, according to Art; for which reason the King gave him leave to live in the City, where he has a House and a little Church.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Kingdom of <hi>Macassar;</hi> and the Embassadors which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> sent into <hi>China.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Macassar,</hi> otherwise call'd the <hi>Isle of Celebes,</hi> begins at the fifteenth Degree of Southern Latitude. The heats are excessive all the day; but the nights are temperate enough. And for the Soil, it is very fertile; but the people have not the art of building. The Capital City bears the name of the Kingdom, and is situated upon the Sea. The Port is free; for the Vessels that bring great quantities of goods from the adjacent Islands, pay no Customs. The Islanders have a custom to poyson their Arrows; and the most dangerous poyson which they use, is the juice of certain Trees in the Island of <hi>Borneo;</hi> which they will temper so as to work swift or slow, as they please. They hold that the King has only the secret Receit to take away the force of it; who boasts that he has the most effectual poyson in the world, which there is no remedy can prevent.</p>
                        <p>One day an <hi>English</hi> man in heat of blood had kill'd one of the Kings of <hi>Macassars</hi> Subjects; and though the King had pardon'd him, yet both <hi>English, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> fearing if the <hi>English</hi> man should go unpunish'd, lest the Islanders should revenge themselves upon some of them, besought the King to put him to death; which with much ado being consented to, the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to put him to a lingring death, and desirous to shew the effect of his poyson, resolv'd to shoot the Criminal himself; whereupon he took a long Trunk, and shot him exactly into the great Toe of the right foot, the place particularly aim'd at. Two Chirurgeons, one an <hi>English</hi> man, and the other a <hi>Hollander,</hi>
                           <pb n="192" facs="tcp:106224:257"/>
provided on purpose, immediately cut off the member; but for all that, the poyson had dispers'd it self so speedily, that the <hi>English</hi> man dy'd at the same time. All the Kings and Princes of the East are very diligent in their enquiry after strong poysons. And I remember that the chief of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Factory and I try'd several poyson'd Arrows, with which the King of <hi>Achen</hi> had presented him, by shooting at Squirrels, who fell down dead, as soon as ever they were touch'd.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Macassar</hi> is a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and will not suffer his Subjects to embrace Christianity. Yet in the year 1656, the Christians found a way to get leave to build a fair Church in <hi>Macassar.</hi> But the next year the King caus'd it to be pull'd down, as also that of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Friars, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> made use of. The Parish Church, which was under the Government of the secular Priests, stood still, till the <hi>Hollanders</hi> attack'd <hi>Macassar,</hi> and compell'd him to turn all the <hi>Portugals</hi> out of his Dominions. The ill conduct of that Prince was in part the occasion of that war; to which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were mov'd, to revenge themselves upon the <hi>Portugal Jesuites,</hi> who had cross'd their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy to <hi>China.</hi> Besides, that they offer'd great affronts to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at <hi>Macassar,</hi> especially when they trod under foot the Hat of one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Envoys, who was sent to treat with the King in behalf of the Company. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> resolv'd to unite their forces with the <hi>Bouquises,</hi> that were in rebellion against their Soveraign, and to revenge themselves at any rate.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the business of <hi>China,</hi> it happen'd thus: Toward the end of the year 1658, the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> and his Council, sent one of the chief of the <hi>Holland</hi> Company with Presents to the King of <hi>China;</hi> who arriving at Court, labour'd to gain the friendship of the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> who are the Nobility of the Kingdom. But the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> who by reason of their long abode in the Country, understood the language, and were acquainted with the Lords of the the Court, lest the <hi>Holland</hi> Company should get footing to the prejudice of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> represented several things to the Kings Council to the prejudice of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> more especially charging them with breach of Faith in all the places where they came. Upon this the <hi>Holland</hi> Agent was dismiss'd, and departed out of <hi>China</hi> without doing any feats. Afterwards coming to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what a trick the <hi>Portugal Jesuites</hi> had put upon him, he made report thereof to the General and his Council at <hi>Batavia;</hi> which so incens'd them, that they resolv'd to be reveng'd. For by the Deputies accounts, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy had cost them above fifty thousand Crowns; for which they consulted how to make the <hi>Portugals</hi> pay double. Understanding therefore the trade which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> drove in the Island of <hi>Macao,</hi> and to the Kingdom of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassar,</hi> whither upon their own account they sent seven Vessels, laden with all sorts of Commodities, as well of <hi>India</hi> as <hi>China;</hi> they took their opportunity, and the seventh of <hi>June</hi> 1660, appear'd with a Fleet of thirty Sail before the Port of <hi>Macassar.</hi> The King thinking himself oblig'd to make defence against so potent an Enemy, endeavour'd to sustain the brunt of the <hi>Hollander</hi> with the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ships in the Road; but the <hi>Hollander</hi> dividing their Fleet, part of them fought the <hi>Portugal,</hi> the other half batter'd the Royal Fortress so furiously, that they carry'd it in a short time. Which so terrifi'd the King, that he commanded the <hi>Portugals</hi> not to fire any more for fear of farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking his Enemies. The Prince <hi>Patinsaloa</hi> was slain in the fight, which was a great loss to the King of <hi>Macassar,</hi> who was become formidable to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by the good Conduct of that Minister. As for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they took, burnt, and sunk all the <hi>Portugal</hi> Vessels, and sufficiently re-imburs'd themselves for their <hi>China</hi> Expences.</p>
                        <p>The thirteenth of <hi>June</hi> the King of <hi>Macassar,</hi> whose name was <hi>Sumbaco,</hi> hung out a white Flag from another Tower, whence he beheld the fight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd by his Wives. During the truce, he sent one of the Grandees of his Court to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral, to desire peace, which was granted, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he should send an Embassador to <hi>Batavia,</hi> expel the <hi>Portugals</hi> out of the Island, and not permit his Subjects to have any more to do with them.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon the King of <hi>Macassar</hi> sent eleven of the greatest Lords of his Court, with a train of seven hundred men; the Chief of the Embassy being
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106224:257"/>
the Prince of <hi>Patinsaloa.</hi> The first thing they did, was to pay two hundred Loaves of Gold to redeem the Royal Fortress again; and then submitting to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral had propos'd, the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> sign'd the Articles, which were punctually observ'd. For the <hi>Portugals</hi> immediately quitted the Country, some departing for <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Cambòya,</hi> others for <hi>Macoa</hi> and <hi>Goa. Macao,</hi> formerly one of the most famous and richest Cities of the Orient, was the principal motive that enclin'd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to send an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour into <hi>China;</hi> for being the best station which the <hi>Portugals</hi> had in all those parts, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had a design to win it wholly. Now, this City, lying in twenty-two Degrees of Northern Latitude, in a small Island next to the Province of <hi>Kanton,</hi> which is a part of <hi>China,</hi> has very much lost its former luster.</p>
                        <p>But this was not all which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and the <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants suffer'd. The Chief of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Factory at <hi>Mingrela,</hi> which is but eight Leagues from this City, understanding the bad success of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> had a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance by himself to be reveng'd. He knew that the <hi>Jesuites</hi> of <hi>Goa</hi> and other places, drove a great trade in rough Diamonds, which they sent into <hi>Europe,</hi> or else carry'd along with them when they return'd; and that for the more private carrying on of their trade, they were wont to send one or two of their Order, that knew the language, in the habit of a <hi>Faquir,</hi> which consists of a Tygers Skin to cover their back-parts, and a Goats Skin to cover the breast, reaching down to the knees. Thereupon the Chief of the Factory of <hi>Mingrela</hi> taking his opportunity, and having notice that two of the suppos'd <hi>Faquirs</hi> were gone to the Mines, to lay out 400000 Pardo's in Diamonds, gave order to two men, which he had fee'd for the purpose, that as soon as the Fathers had made their purchase, he should give notice to the Officer of the Custom-House at <hi>Bicholi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bicholi</hi> is a great Town upon the Frontiers of those Lands that part the Kingdom of <hi>Visapour</hi> from the Territories of the <hi>Portugals;</hi> there being no other way to pass the River, which encompasses the Island where the City of <hi>Goa</hi> is built.</p>
                        <p>The Fathers believing that the Customer knew nothing of their purchase, went into the Boat to go over the River; but as soon as they were in, they were strictly search'd, and all their Diamonds confiscated.</p>
                        <p>To return to the King of <hi>Macassar;</hi> you must know, that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> once endeavour'd to convert him; and perhaps they might have brought it to pass, had they not neglected one proposal which he made them. For at the same time that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> labour'd to bring him to Christianity, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> us'd all their endeavours to oblige him to stick to their Law. The King willing to leave his Idolatry, yet not knowing which part to take, commanded the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to send for two or three of their most able <hi>Moulla's,</hi> or Doctors from <hi>Mecca;</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits</hi> he order'd to send him as many of the most learned among them, that he might be instructed in both Religions; which they both promis'd to do. But the <hi>Mahometans</hi> were more diligent then the Christians, for in eight months they fetch'd from <hi>Mecca</hi> two learned <hi>Moulla's;</hi> whereupon the King seeing that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> sent no body to him, embrac'd the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law. True it is, that three years after there came two <hi>Portugal Jesuits,</hi> but then it was too late.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Macassar</hi> being thus become a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> the Prince his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was so mad at it, that when the <hi>Mosquee,</hi> which the King had caus'd to be built, was finish'd, he got into it one night, and causing the throats of two Pigs to be cut, he all besmear'd the walls of the new <hi>Mosquee,</hi> and the place which was appointed for the <hi>Moulia</hi> to perform Divine Service with the blood; so that the King was forc'd to pull down that, and build another. After which the Prince with some Idolatrous Lords stole out of the Island, and never since appear'd at Court.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> The Author pursues his Travels into the East, and embarks at <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grela</hi> for <hi>Batavia.</hi> The danger he was in upon the Sea; and his arrival in the Island of <hi>Ceylan.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>I Departed from <hi>Mingrela,</hi> a great Town in the Kingdom of <hi>Visapour,</hi> eight Leagues from <hi>Goa,</hi> the fourteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1648, and embark'd in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Vessel bound for <hi>Batavia.</hi> The Ship had orders to touch at <hi>Bokanour,</hi> to take in Rice. Whereupon I went ashore with the Captain, to obtain leave of the King to buy Rice. We found him upon the shore, where he had about a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Huts set up, which were cover'd with Palm-leaves. In his own Hut there was a piece of <hi>Persian</hi> Tapestry spread under him, and there we saw five or six women, some fanning him with Peacocks Feathers, others giving him <hi>Betlé,</hi> others filling him his Pipe of Tobacco. The most considerable persons of the Country were in the other Huts; and we counted about two hundred men that were upon the Guard, arm'd only with Bows and Arrows. They had also two Elephants among 'em. 'Tis very probable, that his Palace was not far off, and that he only came thither to take the fresh air. There we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with <hi>Tari</hi> or Palm-wine; but being new, and not boil'd, it caus'd the head-ach in all that drank it, insomuch that we were two days before we could recover it. I ask'd the reason, how the Wine came to do us so much prejudice; to which they answer'd me, that it was the Planting of Pepper about the Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, that gave such a strength to the Wine.</p>
                        <p>We were no sooner got aboard, but a mighty tempest arose, wherein the Ship, men, and goods had all like to have been cast away, being near the shore; but at length, the wind changing, we found our selves by break of day three or four Leagues at Sea, having lost all our Anchors; and at length came safe to Port in the Haven of <hi>Ponté de Galle,</hi> the twelfth of <hi>May.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I found nothing remarkable in that City; there being nothing but the ruins made by the underminings and Canon-shot, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> besieg'd it, and chas'd the <hi>Portugals</hi> from thence. The Company allow'd ground to build upon, to them that would inhabit there, and land to till; and had then rais'd two Bulwarks which commanded the Port. If they have finish'd the design which they undertook, the place cannot but be very considerable.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> before they took all the places which the <hi>Portugals</hi> had in the Island of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> did believe that the trade of this Island would have brought them in vast sums, could they but be sole Masters of it; and perhaps their conjectures might have been true, had they not broken their words with the King of <hi>Candy,</hi> who is the King of the Country; but breaking faith with him, they lost themselves in all other places thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> had made an agreement with the King of <hi>Candy,</hi> that he should be always ready with twenty thousand men, to keep the passages that hinder the <hi>Portugals</hi> from bringing any succours from <hi>Colombo, Negombe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> or any other places which they possessed upon the Coast. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> when they had taken <hi>Ponte Galle,</hi> were to restore it to the King of <hi>Candy;</hi> which they not performing, the King sent to know why they did not give him possession of the Town; to which they return'd answer, that they were ready to do it, provided he would defray the expences of the war, But they knew, that if he had had three Kingdoms more, such as his own, he could never have payd so great a sum. I must confess indeed the Country is very poor, for I do not believe that the King ever saw fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns together in his life; his trade being all in Cinnamon and Elephants. As for his Cinnamon, he has no profit of it since the <hi>Portugals</hi> coming into the East <hi>Indies.</hi> And for his Elephants, he makes but little of them; for they take not above five or six in a year; but they are more esteem'd than any other Country Elephants, as being the most couragious in war. One thing I
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106224:258"/>
will tell you hardly to be believ'd, but that which is a certain truth, which is, that when any other King or <hi>Raja</hi> has one of these Elephants of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> if they bring him among any other breed in any other place whatever, so soon as the other Elephants behold the <hi>Ceylan</hi> Elephants, by an instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they do him reverence, laying their trunks upon the ground, and raising them up again.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Achen,</hi> with whom the <hi>Hollanders</hi> also broke their word, had more opportunity to be reveng'd upon them then the King of <hi>Candy.</hi> For he deni'd them the transportation of Pepper out of his Country, without which their trade was worth little. His Pepper being that which is most coveted by the East. So that they were forc'd to make a composition with him. The King of <hi>Achens</hi> Embassador coming to <hi>Batavia,</hi> was strangely surpriz'd to see wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sitting at the Table; but much more, when after a health drank to the Queen of <hi>Achen,</hi> the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> commanded his Wife to go and kiss the Embassador. Nor was the King behind hand with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embassador another way; whom the King beholding in a languishing distemper, ask'd him whether he had never any familiarity with any of the Natives. Yes, replied the Embassador; however I left her to marry in my own Country. Upon that the King commanded three of his Physicians to cure him in fifteen days, upon the forfeiture of their lives. Thereupon they gave him a certain potion every morning, and a little Pill at night; and at the end of nine days he took a great Vomit. Every body thought he would have dy'd with the working of it; but at length it brought up a stopple of course hair, as big as a nut; after which he presently recover'd. At his departure the King gave him a Flint about the bigness of a Goose Egg, with veins of Gold in it, like the veins of a mans hand, as the Gold grows in that Country.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The Author goes to visit the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and relates several Adventures upon that occasion.</head>
                        <p>BEing so ill treated in <hi>Batavia,</hi> I resolv'd to visit the King of <hi>Bantam;</hi> to which purpose I took my own Brother along with me, because he spoke the Language call'd <hi>Malaye;</hi> which in the East is as universal as <hi>Latin</hi> among us. Being arriv'd at <hi>Bantam</hi> in a small Bark, which we hir'd for our selves; we went first and visited the <hi>English</hi> President, who kindly entertain'd and lodg'd us.</p>
                        <p>The next day I sent my Brother to the Palace, to know when it would be seasonable for me to come and kiss the Kings Hands. When the King saw him (for he was well known to him) he would not suffer him to return, but sent others to fetch me, and to tell me withall, that if I had any rare Jewels, I should do him a kindness to bring them along with me.</p>
                        <p>When I saw my Brother return'd not with the persons which the King sent, I was almost in the mind not to have gone; remembring how the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen</hi> had serv'd the Sieur <hi>Renaud.</hi> For the <hi>French</hi> having set up an East <hi>India</hi> Company, sent away four Vessels, three great ones, and one of eight Guns, for the service of the Company. Their Voyage was the shortest that ever was heard of; arriving at <hi>Bantam</hi> in less than four months. The King also cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously receiv'd them, and let them have as much Pepper as they desir'd, and cheaper by twenty in the hundred then he sold it to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> not coming only for Pepper, sent away their small Ship with the greatest part of their Money to <hi>Macassar,</hi> to try the Market for Cloves, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, and Mace.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> being so soon dispatch'd at <hi>Bantam,</hi> had not patience to stay till the return of the small Vessel which they had sent to <hi>Macassar;</hi> but to pass the time, must needs run over to <hi>Batavia,</hi> being not above fourteen Leagues off; so that you may be at <hi>Batavia</hi> from <hi>Bantam</hi> in a tide with a good wind. When they came to an Anchor, the General of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet sent to Complement the General of <hi>Batavia,</hi> who fail'd not to answer his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and invited the Admiral ashore. Moreover he sent to those that stay'd aboard, great store of excellent chear, and a good quantity of <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Rhenish</hi> Wine, with particular order to them that carry'd it, to make the <hi>French</hi> drunk. His order was so well follow'd, that 'twas easie to set the Ships on fire, according to the private instructions which they had. So soon as the flame was discover'd from the Generals window, which overlook'd all the Road, there was a wonderful pretended astonishment among the <hi>Dutch.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral too truly conjecturing the ground and Authors of the treachery, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company with an undaunted courage; Come, come, cry'd he, lets drink on; they that set the Ships a-fire shall pay for'em. However the <hi>French</hi> Ships were all burn't, though the men were all sav'd in Boats which were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sent to their relief. After that, the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> made them great offers, which they refus'd, and return'd to <hi>Batavia,</hi> in expectation of their small Vessel. When it return'd, they could find out no better way then to sell Ship, and goods, and all to the <hi>English,</hi> and to share the Money among themselves, every one according to their condition.</p>
                        <p>But the trick which they put upon the <hi>English</hi> was far more bloody. The <hi>English</hi> were the first that found out the danger of sailing from <hi>Surat, Masli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patan,</hi> or any other distant parts, to <hi>Japon</hi> without touching by the way. Whereupon they thought it convenient to build a Fort in the Island of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosa,</hi> which not only sav'd the loss of several Vessels, but also brought them in great gain. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> mad that the <hi>English</hi> were possess'd of such an advantageous scituation, being the only place in all the Island where Vessels could ride in safety; and finding they could not carry it by force, bethought
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106224:259"/>
themselves of a Stratagem; to which purpose they sent away two Ships, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they stor'd the best of their Souldiers, who pretending they had been in a storm in Sea, put into the Harbour of <hi>Formosa,</hi> with some of their Masts by the board, their Sails scatter'd, and their Seamen seemingly sick. The <hi>English</hi> compassionating their miseries, which was only in outward appearance, invited the chief of them to come ashore to refresh themselves; which they were very ready to do, carrying as many men with them as possibly they could under pretence of sickness. While the chief of them were at Dinner with the chief of the <hi>English,</hi> they all ply'd their Cups; and when the <hi>Dutch</hi> saw the <hi>English</hi> had drunk hard enough, taking their opportunity, they pickt a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Commander of the Fort, and drawing their Swords, which they had hidden under their Coats for that purpose, they easily surpriz'd and cut all the throats of the Soldiers in the Garrison; and being thus Masters of the Fort, they kept it from that time till they were routed out by the <hi>Chineses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now for the trick that the King of <hi>Achen</hi> serv'd the Sieur <hi>Renaud;</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got a good Estate by Jewels, arriv'd at length at <hi>Achen,</hi> and as it is the custom for the Merchants to shew the King what Jewels they have, the King had no sooner cast his eye upon four Rings which the Sieur <hi>Renaud</hi> shew'd him, but he bid him fifteen thousand Crowns for them; but <hi>Renaud</hi> would not bate of eighteen thousand. Now because they could not agree, the Sieur <hi>Renaud</hi> carry'd them away with him, which very much displeas'd the King; however he sent for him the next day. Whereupon <hi>Renaud</hi> returning to him, the King paid him his eighteen thousand Crowns; but he was never seen after that, and it is thought he was secretly murther'd in the Palace.</p>
                        <p>This story came to my remembrance, when I found my Brother did not come along with those that were sent to fetch me. However I resolv'd to go, taking with me 12 or 13000 Roupies worth of Jewels; the greatest part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Rose Diamond Rings, some consisting of seven, some of nine, and some of eleven Stones; with some small Bracelets of Diamonds and Rubies. I found the King with three of his Captains and my Brother sitting together, after the manner of the East, with five great Plates of Rice before them of divers colours. For their drink they had <hi>Spanish</hi> Wine, strong Waters, and several sorts of <hi>Sherbets.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had complemented the King, and presented him with a Diamond Ring, a blew Saphir Ring, and a little Bracelet of Diamonds, Rubies, and blew Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs, he commanded me to sit down, and order'd me a glass of strong Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to whet my appetite. The glass held a quarter of a pint, and therefore I refus'd it, which the King very much wonder'd at; but being told by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I never drank any strong Water, he order'd me presently a glass of Sack.</p>
                        <p>After that he rose up, and seated himself in a Chair, the Elbows whereof were guilded. His feet and legs were bare, having a <hi>Persian</hi> Carpet of Gold and Silk to tread upon. He was clad with a piece of Calicut, part whereof cover'd his body from his waste to his knees, the rest being wound about his back and shoulders like a Scarf. Instead of Shoes he had a pair of Sandals, that stood by the Chair side, the straps whereof were embroider'd with Gold and small Pearl. About his head he had a thing like a Handkerchief, with three Corners, bound about his head like a Fillet. His hair also, which was very long, was twisted and ty'd together over his head. Two persons stood behind him with great Fans of long Peacock Feathers, the handles whereof were five or six foot in length. Upon his right hand stood an old black woman, holding in her hand a little Mortar and a Pestle of Gold, to beat his <hi>Betlé</hi> in; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he mix'd the Kernel of the Nut of <hi>Araqué,</hi> and Seed Pearl dissolv'd. When it was all beaten together, the old woman gave it the King over his Shoulders, who opening his mouth, the old woman sed him as our women feed their Children. For the King had chaw'd so much <hi>Betlé,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so much Tobacco, that his teeth were all fall'n out of his head.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Bantam</hi>'s Palace was never built by any curious Architect. It is a square place, encompass'd with a great many Pillars, varnish'd over with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of colours, against which the King leans when he sits down. At the four Corners there are four great Pillars set in the Earth, at forty foot distance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106224:260"/>
the one from the other, lin'd with a Mat made of the Rhind of a certain Tree, so thin that it looks like a piece of Linnen, which neither Fleas nor Punies will come near. The Roof was cover'd with Coco-Branches. Not far off, under another Roof supported with four great Pillars, he had sixteen Elephants, the noblest of all those that are in the Kings service: for he has a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber train'd up for war, that are not afraid of wild-fire. For his Guard he might have about two thousand men, that were drawn up in Companies under the shade of the next Trees. They are good Souldiers as well by Sea as by Land; great <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and stand not at all in fear of death. His <hi>Haram,</hi> or the Womens Apartment, was certainly a very small place. For when he had view'd what I brought him, he sent for two old women, to whom he gave some of the Jewels, to go and shew them to his Wives. The two women return'd back through a little pitiful door; the enclosure being nothing but a kind of Wall made up of Earth and Cow-dung mix'd together. Whatever he sent to the Women, they never return'd any thing again. Which made me believe they would bear a good price; and indeed whatever I sold to him, I sold to good profit, and had my Money well paid me. After this we took our leaves; but the King oblig'd us to come next day in the evening, because he had a desire to shew us a <hi>Turky</hi> Dagger, the Haft whereof, being thin of Diamonds, he had a mind to enrich with more Stones. Coming to the <hi>English</hi> House with our Money, they wonder'd that the King had laid out twenty thousand Roupies, telling me, they believ'd it was the best part of his treasure.</p>
                        <p>The next day my Brother and I went to wait upon him at the appointed hour, and we found him sitting in the same place where he sate before. There was a <hi>Moulla</hi> then read to him, who seem'd to interpret to him something of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Language. The Lecture being ended, they both rose and went to prayers; which being concluded, the King sent for the Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the Hast which was of Gold. The top of the Handle was already set with Diamonds, and upon the upper part of the cross Bar was cut in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cets, which could not be less worth than fifteen or sixteen thousand Crowns. The King told me, it was presented to him by the Queen of <hi>Borneo,</hi> and that it was cut at <hi>Goa;</hi> but that he put a far higher value upon it than I esteem'd it to be worth. The Dagger, as well as the Sheath was full of Beazils, or Collets, in very good order; but the King had neither Diamond, Ruby, nor any other Stone to set in the Collets; and therefore desir'd me to help him to some that might come at an easie rate. I told him it was impossible to find Stones that would fit the Beazils; and therefore that it was better, when he had got Stones enough, to fix other Beazils according to the proportion of the Stones. To which purpose he was first to range all his Stones in Wax; which I shew'd him how to do at the same time; but that was above his skill. And therefore do what I could to excuse my self to the contrary, he would needs oblige me to carry the Dagger to <hi>Batavia;</hi> whereupon I took my leave of the King, and departed.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>ABout elev'n a Clock at night we embark'd for <hi>Batavia;</hi> for the night winds blowing from the Land, are the only winds to serve out turn; so that we were at <hi>Batavia</hi> between ten and elev'n the next morning. There I stay'd twenty days for the King of <hi>Bantam</hi>'s sake, to make him believe I had sought for that which I knew was impossible to to be found. I had nothing to do all the while, for in <hi>Batavia</hi> there is no other recreation than gaming and drinking, which was none of my business. At that time the Sieur <hi>Cant</hi> dy'd, one of the <hi>Indian</hi> Counsellors, who was sumptuously buri'd for his good services done to the Company; but the people complain'd heavily of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice which he had done as well to the Souldiers as Mariners.</p>
                        <p>Having stay'd twenty days at <hi>Bantam,</hi> I resolv'd to go and return the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> his Dagger again; for it was impossible to meet with Stones to fit his Beazils. However I took along with me some other Stones which he had not seen. Coming to <hi>Bantam,</hi> the King caus'd us to be lodg'd in one of his own Houses in the City, which was made of <hi>Bamboo's.</hi> Thither in less then a quarter of an hour, the King sent us some Pateches, or sweet Water-Melons, red within like Scarlet. We had also Mango's, and a certain large Fruit call'd <hi>Pompone,</hi> red also within, the meat of it being soft and spungy, but of an excellent taste. Having stay'd our stomachs, we went to wait upon the King, whom we found in the same place, with his old Mortar-bearer, who every foot fed him with <hi>Betlé</hi> with her fingers. There were sitting about the Hall five or six of his Captains, viewing a certain parcel of Fire-works, as Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's, Rochets, and other devices to run upon the water, which the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> had brought; who are the most exquisite at those sports of any people in the world. When the King was at leisure, I return'd him his Dagger, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that <hi>Batavia</hi> was no place to meet with Stones; and that such as were to be found, were valu'd at double the price they were worth; and that there was no place where he could fit himself, but at <hi>Golconda, Goa,</hi> or the Diamond Mines. Thereupon the old woman took the Dagger, and carry'd it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Haram;</hi> nor did the King speak a word more about it. After that I shew'd him what other Stones I had brought, a parcel whereof I sold him to good profit; the King ordering us to come the next day for payment.</p>
                        <p>The next day about six a Clock in the morning, my Brother and I, and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Chirurgion, were going along a narrow way, between a River on the one hand, and the Pales of a great Garden on the other. Behind the Pales a Rascally <hi>Bantamois</hi> had hid himself; one of those that was newly come from <hi>Mecca,</hi> and was upon the design of <hi>Moquae;</hi> that is, in their Language, when the Rascality of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> return from <hi>Mecca,</hi> they presently take their <hi>Cric</hi> in their hands, which is a kind of Poniard, the Blade whereof is half poyson'd; with which they run through the streets, and kill all those which are not of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law, till they be kill'd themselves. These Furies think that in so doing they do God and <hi>Mahomet</hi> good service, and shall be sav'd thereby. If any of these madmen be kill'd, the Rabble of <hi>Mahumetans</hi> buries them as Saints, and every one contributes to make them a fair Tomb. Sometimes you shall have an idle Rogue, in the Habit of a <hi>Dervich,</hi> that will build him a Hut near the Tomb, which he undertakes to look to, and strew with Flowers. And as his Alms increase, he adds some other ornament to it. For the fairer and better set out the Tomb is, the more devoutly it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd, and the more Alms it brings in. I remember in the year 1642, that at <hi>Souali,</hi> which is the Port of <hi>Surat,</hi> it happen'd that a Vessel of the great <hi>Moguls</hi> return'd from <hi>Mecca,</hi> with a great number of <hi>Faquirs</hi> or <hi>Dervichs.</hi> For
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106224:261"/>
every year the King sends two Vessels to carry and bring back the Pilgrims, who have their passage free. And when these Vessels are to go, the <hi>Faquirs</hi> come from all parts of <hi>India</hi> to embark. These Vessels are lad'n with very good Commodities, which are sold at <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the profit is distributed among the poor Pilgrims. But the principal is brought back for the next year, amounting to six hundred thousand Roupies at least. 'Tis an ill Market when they do not gain 30 or 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> by their Commodities; nay there are some that produce <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> besides, that the principal persons of the <hi>Moguls Haram,</hi> and other particular persons, send very large gifts to <hi>Mecca.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of these <hi>Faquirs</hi> returning from <hi>Mecca</hi> in the year 1642, and being landed at <hi>Souali,</hi> had no sooner said his prayers, but he took his Dagger, and ran among several <hi>Dutch</hi> Mariners that were unlading goods upon the shore, and before they were aware this mad <hi>Faquir</hi> had wounded seventeen of them, of which thirteen dy'd. The <hi>Canjare</hi> which he had in his hand, was a kind of Dagger, the Blade whereof toward the Handle was three fingers broad; and because it is a very dangerous weapon, I have here given you the figure of it.
<figure/>
                           <pb n="201" facs="tcp:106224:261"/>
At length the Sentinel that stood at the entry of the Tent where the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Merchants were, shot him through the body, so that he fell down dead. Immediately all the other <hi>Faquirs</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> that were upon the place took up the body and buried it: and at the end of fifteen days they put him up a fair Monument. Every year the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> pull it down; but when they are gone, the <hi>Faquirs</hi> set it up again, and plant Banners over it; nay some there are that perform their devotions to it.</p>
                        <p>But to return to the <hi>Bantam Faquir.</hi> That Villain lying, as I said, behind the Pales, as my Brother and I, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Chirurgeon came toward him, all three a-breast, thrust his Pike between the Pales, thinking to have astbb'd it into one of our breasts. The <hi>Dutch</hi> man being next the River, and somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rest, the head of his Pike ran into his Breeches; whereupon we both laid hold of the Staff. But my Brother being next the Pales, presently leap'd over, and ran the <hi>Faquir</hi> thorough. Whereupon several <hi>Chineses,</hi> and other Idolaters, came and gave my Brother thanks for killing him. After that we waited upon the King, and told him what my Brother had done; who was so far from being displeas'd, that he gave my Brother a Girdle. For the King and his Governours are glad when those Rogues are slain, knowing them to be Desperado's, not fit to live.</p>
                        <p>The next day, coming to take my leave of the <hi>English</hi> President, he shew'd me two strings of Diamonds, and two Services of Silver, which came from <hi>England.</hi> He would have sold them all, but I only bought one of the strings of Diamonds, the other being foul; and for the Silver, I would have bought it, had they coin'd Silver in <hi>Batavia,</hi> as they were wont to do. Formerly the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> coin'd Reals, Half-Reals, and Quarter-Reals, bearing on the one side the stamp of a Ship, on the other V, O, C, like a Character, as in the Figure, signifying in <hi>Dutch, Vor Ost Indian Compagnie,</hi> for the East <hi>Indian</hi> Company. Which they did for the sake of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who loving Silver better than Gold, carri'd away all the Silver that was coin'd at <hi>Batavia,</hi> at good rates. But length they left it off, finding so few people that made use of Silver.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of the War of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with the Emperor of <hi>Java.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>HAving taken my leave of the <hi>English</hi> President, I return'd to <hi>Batavia;</hi> where having little to do, I resolv'd to give a visit to the King of <hi>Japar,</hi> otherwise call'd the Emperor of <hi>Java.</hi> This King was formerly King of all the Island, till the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> who was only Governour of a Province, rebell'd against him; the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being made by the divisions of those two Princes. For when the King of <hi>Japar</hi> besieg'd <hi>Batavia,</hi> the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> reliev'd the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and when they were attack'd by the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the King of <hi>Japar</hi> came to their assistance. And when those two Kings were together by the ears, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> always aided the weakest.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Japar</hi> keeps his Court in a City of the same name, distant from <hi>Batavia</hi> some thirty Leagues. You may coast along the shore to it by Sea; but the City stands above eight Leagues up in the Land. From the City there is a fine Walk to the Sea, where there is a handsome Port, and fairer Houses than any in the City. And the King would live there if he thought it safe.</p>
                        <p>The day before I departed, I went to take my leave of one of the <hi>Indian</hi> Counsellors, and telling him that I was going to wait upon the King of <hi>Japar,</hi> he stood amaz'd, in regard the King and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were mortal Enemies; of which he gave me this account: The deceas'd King, Father to the King that now reigns, since the <hi>Hollanders</hi> built their Fort of <hi>Batavia</hi> would never have any peace with them. And though that during the war the <hi>Hollanders</hi> took ten of his Subjects, for one of theirs, and offer'd ten for one in exchange, yet he would never exchange one upon any condition whatsoever, and charg'd his Son upon his death-bed never to release one. This obstinacy very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> General, and all the rest in <hi>Batavia,</hi> and oblig'd them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult upon ways how to right themselves Now it is the custom, when a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> King dyes, that his Successor sends certain great Lords of his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mecca</hi> with Presents, as well to engage them to pray for the Soul of the deceas'd; as also to give thanks to God and <hi>Mahomet</hi> for the coming of a new King to the Throne without any impediment; and to pray for the blessing of Victory over all his Enemies. But the new King and his Council were at a loss how to accomplish this Voyage; for first the King had none but little Vessels, that were wont only to sail along by the shore, by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience of his Seamen; and in the second place the <hi>Dutch</hi> were always ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro about the mouths of his Havens, to surprize his Subjects if they stirr'd forth. For the safety therefore of his Pilgrims, the King at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes upon making an agreement with the <hi>English.</hi> For which reason he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches away an Envoy to <hi>Bantam,</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> President and his Council, who promis'd to lend him the biggest Vessel and the best mounted which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had in the <hi>Indies.</hi> In lieu whereof the <hi>English</hi> were to pay but half Customs for ever, for all Commodities exported or imported out of his Country. Which Treaty being ratifi'd, the <hi>English</hi> furnish'd him with three stout Vessels, Mann'd and Gunn'd beyond an ordinary rate. Thereupon nine of the principal Lords of the Court, and most of the Blood Royal, with a Train of a hundred persons, embark'd themselves in the great Vessel. But all these preparations could not be carri'd so privately, but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had intelligence of it by their Spies. Thereupon the General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> makes ready three Ships, and lying just in the streight of <hi>Bantams</hi> mouth; so soon as the <hi>English</hi> came up, (for they had no other way) let fly at them so roundly, that the <hi>English</hi> fearing lest their Vessels would be sunk, struck Sail; which the <hi>Java</hi> Lords seeing, call'd the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Traytors, and drawing their poyson'd Daggers, cry'd <hi>a Mocca</hi> upon the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> killing a great number of them before they had time to put themselves into a posture of defence. And perhaps there would not one of them have escap'd, had not the <hi>Hollanders</hi> come aboard as they did. Some of the <hi>Java</hi> Lords, and about
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106224:262"/>
twenty of their Attendants, would take no quarter; so that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were forc'd to fight for't, and at last they got the better, with the loss of seven or eight men. The <hi>English</hi> Vessel being carri'd into <hi>Batavia,</hi> the General very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy sent both the Prisoners and the Vessel home again; withall giving notice to the King, that he was ready to make an exchange of Prisoners with him. But the King would not so much as Hearken to any such proposition; returning for answer, that though the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had three times as many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he would not release so much as one <hi>Hollander.</hi> So that the poor <hi>Dutch</hi> were kept slaves in <hi>Java,</hi> and the <hi>Javanners</hi> dy'd miserable in <hi>Batavia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Javanners,</hi> they are good Souldiers. And it is reported, that while <hi>Batavia</hi> was besieg'd by the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> in the year 1659, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier lying in Ambuscade in a Marsh, a <hi>Javanner,</hi> little dreaming that any body had been there, came to the same place to discover the Enemy; and was by the <hi>Dutch</hi> man thrust with his Pike into his Body. Upon which the <hi>Javanner</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself wounded, did not strive to pull the Pike out of the body, but thrust himself farther upon it, to the end he might come at his Enemy, whom he stab'd to the heart, as soon as he got within his reach.</p>

                        <p>WHile I stay'd at <hi>Batavia,</hi> my Brother dy'd; and it was pretty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what the <hi>Dutch</hi> made me pay for his Funeral. The first expence is for the Fees of those that beg leave for the Corps to be buri'd; of whom the more there are, the more honourable the Funeral is esteem'd. I sent six, and paid them to my wonder for that seventy-two Crowns. The see for the Pall is a right that belongs to the poor, for which I paid two Crowns. There was a Vessel of <hi>Spanish</hi> Wine drank out, that cost me two hundred Piasters. I gave twenty-six more for three <hi>Westphalia</hi> Hams, and some Neats-tongues, and twenty-two for Bak'd Meats. To the Bearers I gave twenty Crowns, and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen for a place in the Church-yard, for they ask'd me a hundred to bury him in the Church. And all these are Fee's demanded. So that my Brothers Funeral cost me twelve hundred and twenty three Livres of <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                        <p>Being thus put by the two Voyages which I intended to <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>Sumatra,</hi> I was advis'd to lay out my Money in <hi>Requenings</hi> or <hi>Debentures</hi> of the Servants of the <hi>Holland</hi> Company; which they that have no mind to return into their own Country, as being setled in the <hi>Indies,</hi> will sell at an easie rate; insomuch, that for sixty or seventy you may buy a hundred Piasters; the Act and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance of the Seller being made and register'd by the Publick Notary. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I bought of one of the publick Notaries, who had Bills in his hands, to the value of about eleven thousand Guelders, at fourscore and two for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. After that, I bought by means of the Advocate of the Treasury, six thousand Guelders more, at seventy-nine for the hundred. But some few days after, meeting with the same Advocate again, he pass'd a Complement upon me, and told me, he was very much troubl'd for those that had bought De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures, in regard that the General and the Council had commanded him to recall all Debentures that had been sold; for they had consider'd, how sad a thing it would be, for the poor men to lose so much of their Salaries. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd him, that for my part I was willing to return mine, provided I might have my Money again. About six or seven hours after, I was sent for by the General and his Council. When I came there, they ask'd me why I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the Debentures, which I had bought, to the Advocate, who had demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by their order. I answerd them, that they were at <hi>Bantam,</hi> whither
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106224:263"/>
I had sent them in order to my passage home; in regard that the <hi>English</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident had offer'd me a convenience to go along with him. The Council an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd me, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were as good as the <hi>English,</hi> and very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously assur'd me, they would give order for a Cabin to my self in the Vice-Admiral. But withall they told me, I must deliver up my Debentures before I stirr'd; assuring me, that they would give me a Bill to be re-imburs'd my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the Company in <hi>Holland.</hi> I thought it very hard, for I knew not how to trust 'em; but seeing the Merchants, Commanders, and all other persons clapt up, and their Papers taken from them by force, that had bought De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures; I thought it the best way to deliver mine, and stand to their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. I often press'd the General and the Council for my Bill, but after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny delays the General ascertain'd me, that my Bill should be in <hi>Holland</hi> as soon as I. Thereupon desiring the Vice-Admiral and some others to be my Wirnesses of what the General promis'd, I took my leave of him, very much repenting my going to <hi>Batavia.</hi>

                        <p>THE next day I went aboard the Vice-Admiral, and the third day after we set sail, and as soon as we were out of the Streight, we discover'd the Islands of the Prince. From thence being in the Altitude of the <hi>Coco</hi> Islands, we beat about two days to discover them; but all to no purpose, thereupon we made directly for the <hi>Cape of good Hope.</hi>

                        <p>The fourty-fifth day after our departure from <hi>Batavia,</hi> our Vice-Admiral neglected to put out his Lights; believing all the Fleet had been before at the <hi>Cape;</hi> so that it happen'd that one of the Fleet being behind, and not carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Lights out neither, it being a dark night, fell foul upon us, which put every man to his prayers, all people believing the Vessel had been lost; and indeed had she not been a sound stanch Ship (for the <hi>Provinces</hi> were so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted) she could never have endur'd so terrible a shock. At length we clear'd our selves, by cutting off the Yards of the <hi>Maestricht</hi> that hung in our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
                        <p>The fifty-fifth we came within view of the <hi>Cape of good Hope;</hi> but were forc'd to keep the Sea, because the waves roll'd so that we were not able to come to an Anchor; not that the Wind was extream high, but because the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind had blown so long that it had forc'd the Water to that part. When the Sea grew calm, we came to an Anchor.</p>
                        <p>But of all the people that ever I saw in all my travels, I never saw any so hideous nor so brutish as the <hi>Comoukes,</hi> of which I have spoken in my <hi>Persian</hi> Travels; and those of the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> whom they call <hi>Cafres,</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentotes.</hi> When they speak, they make a noise with their tongues, like the breaking of wind backward; and though they hardly speak articulately, yet they easily understand one another. They cover themselves with the Skins of wild Beasts, which they kill in the Woods; in Winter wearing the hairy part inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and in Summer outermost. But there are none but the best sort among them who are thus clad, the rest wear nothing but a nasty rag about their privy parts. The men and the women are lean and short; and when they bring forth a Male-child, the Mothers cut out his right Stone; and presently give him Water to drink, and Tobacco to eat. They cut out the right Testicle, because, say they, it makes them swifter to run. There are some of them that will catch a Roe-Buck running. They neither know what belongs to Gold nor Silver; and for Religion, they have none among them.</p>
                        <p>So soon as we cast Anchor, four women came aboard us, and brought us four young Ostriches; which were boil'd for some sick people that we had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106224:263"/>
After that they brought great store of Tortoise-Shells, and Ostriches Eggs, and other Eggs as big as Goose Eggs; which though they had no Yolk, tasted very well. The Birds that lay these Eggs are a sort of Geese, and so fat that they are hardly to be eaten, tasting rather like Fish than Flesh. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men seeing our Cook throw away the Guts of two or three Fowl which he was dressing, took them up, and squeezing out the Ordure, eat them as they were; being hugely pleas'd with the <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> which the Captain gave them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men nor women are asham'd to shew their nakedness, for indeed they are but a sort of human Beasts.</p>
                        <p>So soon as the Ship arrives, they bring their Beeves to the shore, with what other Commodities they have, to barter for strong Water and Tobacco, Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal or Agat Beads; or any sort of old Iron work. If they are not satisfi'd with what you offer them, away they fly; and then giving a whistle all their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel follow 'em; nor shall you ever see 'em again. Some, when they saw 'em fly, would shoot and kill their Cattel; but after that for some years they would never bring any more. 'Tis a very great convenience for the Vessels that touch there, to take in fresh Victuals; and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did well to build a Fort there. It is now a good handsome Town, inhabited by all sorts, that live with the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and all sorts of Grain, which are brought out of <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Asia</hi> and sow'd there, come to better perfection there then in other parts. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lies in thirty-five Degrees, and some few Minutes over, so that it cannot be said that either the heat or scituation of the Climate makes these <hi>Cafres</hi> so black. Being desirous to know the reason, and why they stunk so terribly, I learnt it from a Girl that was bred up in the Fort, who was tak'n from her Mother, as soon as she was born, and was white like our women in <hi>Europe;</hi> she told me, that the reason why the <hi>Cafres</hi> are so black is, because they rub themselves with a Greafe or Ointment compos'd of several sorts of Drugs; wherewith should they not anoint themselves very often, and as soon as they were born, they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Hydropsical, as the Blacks of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the <hi>Abyssins</hi> are; or like the people of <hi>Saba,</hi> that never live above forty years, and are always troubl'd with one Leg twice as big as the other. These <hi>Cafres,</hi> as brutish as they are, have yet some knowledg of Simples, which they know to apply to several Diseases; which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have several times experienc'd. Of nineteen sick persons that we had in our Ship, fifteen were committed to the care of these <hi>Cafres,</hi> being troubl'd with Ulcers in their Legs, and old wounds which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the wars; and in less then fifteen days they were all perfectly cur'd. Every one of these had two <hi>Cafres</hi> to look after him; and according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the wound or Ulcer, they went and fetch'd Simples, which they bruis'd between two Stones, and apply'd to the sore. As for the other four, they were so far gone with the Pox, that they would not trust the <hi>Cafres</hi> with them, having been given over at <hi>Batavia,</hi> and so they all dy'd, between the <hi>Cape</hi> and St. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the year 1661, a Gentleman of <hi>Britanny</hi> being at <hi>Batavia,</hi> was so bit by the Gnats in the night, that his Leg exulcerated presently in such a manner, as to puzzle all the art and skill of the Chirurgeons in that Town. When he came to the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> the Captain of the Ship sending him ashore, the <hi>Cafres</hi> came about him, and after they had beheld him, they told him if he would trust to them they would cure him. The Captain thereupon committed him to their care, who cur'd him and made him a sound man in less then fifteen days.</p>
                        <p>When a Ship comes to an Anchor in the <hi>Cape,</hi> it is the fashion for him that commands the Ship, to give leave to some part of the Mariners and Souldiers to go ashore to refresh themselves. The sickly have first leave by turns, and go to the Town, where they are dyeted and lodg'd for seven or eight Sous a day, and are very well us'd.</p>
                        <p>It is the custom of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> when they stay here, to send out parties of Souldiers upon the discovery of the up-land Country, and they that go farthest are best rewarded. With this design a party of Souldiers, under the Command of a Serjeant, far advanc'd in the Country; and night coming on, they made a great fire, as well to keep themselves from the Lions, as to warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sèlves, and so lay down to sleep round about it. Being asleep, a Lion came and seiz'd
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106224:264"/>
one of the Souldiers Arms, which the Serjeant perceiving, immediately shot the Lion with his Carbine; but when he was dead, they had much ado to open the Lions mouth, to get out the Souldiers Arm. Thus it appears a vulgar error, to believe that Lions will not come near the fire. As for the Souldier, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fres</hi> cur'd his Arm in twelve days. There are in the Fort abundance of Lions and Tigers Skins; among the rest, there was the Skin of a Horse which the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fres</hi> had kill'd; it was white, cross'd with black streaks, spotted like a Leopard, without a Tail. Two or three Leagues from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Fort, there was a Lion found dead, with four Porcupines Quils in his body, the third part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had pierc'd his flesh. So that it was judg'd, that the Porcupine had kill'd the Lion. The Skin, with the Quils in it, is kept in the Fort.</p>
                        <p>A League from the Fort, is a fair Town, that grows bigger and bigger every day. When the <hi>Holland</hi> Company arrives there with their Ships, if any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier or Mariner will live there, they are very glad of it. They have as much ground as they can mannage; where they have all sorts of Herbs, and Pulse, and as much Rice, and as many Grapes as they can desire. They have also young Ostridges, Beef, Sea-fish, and sweet water. To catch the Ostridges when they please, they got their Nests when they are young, and driving a stake in the ground, tye the Birds by one Leg to the stake, and when they are old enough they come and take them out of the Nest, from whence it is impossible to fly away.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Hollanders</hi> began to inhabit the <hi>Cape,</hi> they took a young Girl from her Mother, as soon as she was born; she is white, only her Nose is a little flat. A <hi>French</hi> man got her with Child, and would have marry'd her; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were so far from permitting him, that they took away above a hundred Livres of the Maids wages from her, to punish her for the misdemeanour, which was somewhat hard.</p>
                        <p>There are great numbers of Lions and Tigers, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have a pretty invention to take; they fasten a Carbine to a stake, driv'n into the Earth, and lay meat round about the Gun, which meat is fasten'd with a string to the Trigger. So that when the Beast snatches the meat, the string pulls the Trig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Gun going off, hits the Lion either in the throat or the breast.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cafres</hi> feed upon a Root like our Skerrets, which they roast and make bread of. Sometimes they grin'd it into flower, and then it tasts like a Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut. For their food they eat the same Root raw, with raw Fish; with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of Beasts, out of which they only squeeze the ordure. As for the bowels of the wild Beasts, the women wear them dry'd about their Legs, especially the bowels of those Beasts which their Husbands kill, which they look upon as a kind of Ornament. They also feed upon Tortoises, when they have so far heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at the fire, as to make the Shells come off. They are very expert in darting their <hi>Azagaya's;</hi> and those that have none, make use of pointed sticks, which they will lance a great way. With these they go down to the Sea-side, and as soon as ever they spy a Fish near the top of the water, they will not fail to strike him.</p>
                        <p>As for their Birds, which are like our Ducks, whose Eggs are without any Yolk; they breed in such great quantities in the Countrey, that in a Bay about eighteen Miles from the <hi>Cape,</hi> you may knock them on the head with a stick.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> once carried a young <hi>Cafre</hi> to the General at <hi>Batavia,</hi> who bred him carefully up, teaching him to understand the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages perfectly well. At length being desirous to return into his Country, the General gave him very good Cloaths, and good Linnen, hoping that he would have liv'd among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and bin serviceable to them in the discovery of the Country; but so soon as he got home, he flung his Cloaths i' the Sea, and return'd wild among his fellow Natives, eating raw flesh as he did before, and quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his Benefactors.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Cafres</hi> go a hunting, they go a great number together, and make such a prodigious howling and yelling, that they fright the very Breasts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and in that affright with ease destroy them; and I have been assur'd, that their cries do terrifie the Lions themselves.</p>
                        <p>The women are of so hot a constitution of Body, that at the times that their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106224:264"/>
monthly customs are upon 'em, they happen to make water, and that an <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> chances to set his feet upon it, it causes an immediate Head-ach and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which many times turns to the Plague.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> The <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet arrives at St. <hi>Helens.</hi> The description of the Island.</head>
                        <p>HAving staid two and twenty days at the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> seeing that the Wind was favourable, we weigh'd, and steer'd for St. <hi>Helens.</hi> When we were under Sail, the Mariners cry'd out, they would sleep till they came into St. <hi>Helens</hi> Road. For the wind is very constant, and carries you in sixteen or eighteen days to the Road of the Island. All the trouble that our Mariners had, was that fourteen days after our departure from the <hi>Cape,</hi> they were often forc'd to the Top-Mast head, upon discovery of the Island; for as soon as you discover the Island, the Pilot must take care to steer to the North-side of the Island, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no casting Anchor but on that side, and that very near the shore too; by reason of the deepness of the water; for if the Anchors come not to take hold, the current of the water and the wind carries the Ship quite out of the Road, which there is no recovering again, because the wind never changes.</p>
                        <p>So soon as the Ships came to an Anchor, part of the Seamen were sent ashore to get wild Hogs, of which there are great plenty; and to gather Sorrel, which grows in great abundance; and indeed they not only send the Seamen, but all the Pigs, Sheep, Geese, Ducks, and Pullets aboard, to feed upon that Sorrel, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them in such a manner, that in a few days they became so fat, that by that time we came to <hi>Holland</hi> they were hardly to be eaten. That Sorrel has the same operation upon the men, who boiling their wild Swines flesh, Rice, and Sorrel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, make thereof a kind of Potage so excellent, that it keeps their bodies open by an insensible purgation.</p>
                        <p>There are two places upon the Coast of St. <hi>Helens</hi> where Ships may come to an Anchor. But the best is that where we lay, by reason that ground is very good, and for that the water that falls from the Mountain is the best in the Island. In this part of the Island there is no plain, for the Mountain descends to the very shore of the Sea.</p>
                        <p>It is not so good anchoring in the other Road; but there is a very handsome plain, where you may sow or plant whatever you please. There are great store of Citrons, and some Oranges, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> had formerly planted there. For that Nation has that vertue, that wherever they come, they make the place the better for those that come after them; whereas the <hi>Hollanders</hi> endeavour to destroy all things wherever they set footing. I confess the Commanders are not of that humour, but the Sea-men and Souldiers, who cry one to another, we shall never come hither any more, and out of greediness will cut down a whole tree instead of gathering the fruit.</p>
                        <p>Some days after there arriv'd a <hi>Portugueze</hi> Vessel from <hi>Guiny,</hi> full of Slaves, which were bound for the Mines of <hi>Peru.</hi> Some of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that understood the language of the <hi>Negro's,</hi> told 'em how miserably they would be us'd, and thereupon the next night two hundred and fifty of them threw themselves into the Sea. And indeed it is a miserable slavery; for sometimes after they have min'd in some places for some days together, the Earth being loose, falls down and kills four or five hunder'd at a time. Besides, that after they have been mining awhile, their Faces, their Eyes, and their Skins change colour; which proceeds from the vapours that arise from those concavities; nor could they subsist in those places, but for the quantity of strong Water which they give both to the men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. There are some that are made free by their Masters, who labour however for their living; but between Saturday night and Munday morning they spend all their weeks wages in strong Water, which is very dear; so that they always live miserably.</p>
                        <p>Being ready to depart the Island of St. <hi>Helens,</hi> the Admiral call'd a Council, to advize which way to steer. The greatest part were for steering more to the West,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106224:265"/>
then to the South; because the season for sailing was far spent; and for that if we steer'd for the West <hi>Indies,</hi> we should find the wind more proper to carry us into <hi>Holland.</hi> But we had no sooner cross'd the Line, but we found the wind quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Mariners expected; so that we were forc'd to steer to the sixty-fourth Degree of Altitude with the Island, and so return by the North into <hi>Holland.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> The <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet sets Stil from St. <hi>Helens,</hi> and prosperously ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE next day after the Admiral had call'd a Council, we weigh'd and set Sail about ten a Clock at night. Three days after our departure from St. <hi>Helens,</hi> the Seamen were call'd very duly to prayers morning and evening; though all the time we stay'd in the rode, they never minded any such matter; which made me wonder, to find they should be more devout when they were out of danger, than when they were in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>After several other days sailing, we discover'd the Coast of <hi>Island,</hi> and then the Island of <hi>Ferella,</hi> where we join'd with the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet that stay'd for us. Here it is that the Commander in chief calls to account all the Mariners for their misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours during the whole Voyage.</p>
                        <p>Our Ship was bound for <hi>Zealand;</hi> but we were forc'd to lye out at Sea seven days before we could get into <hi>Flushing,</hi> because the Sand had chang'd its place. Coming to an Anchor before <hi>Flushing,</hi> two of the Company came aboard to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us home, and to advise us to lock our Chests, and put our marks upon them; for all Chests are carry'd into the East <hi>India</hi> House, where when the owners come for them, they are order'd to op'n them, lest they should have any counterband goods therein. Thereupon I set a mark upon my Chests, and went ashore, after I had giv'n a good character of the Captain, and his civility to me all the Voyage, and thence proceeded by Land to <hi>Middleburgh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Four days after I came to <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> I went to fetch my Chests; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Directors there, one a <hi>Zealander,</hi> the other of <hi>Horn,</hi> who came first aboard us; I produc'd my Keys, and offer'd my Chests to be open'd. But the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> more civil than the <hi>Horner,</hi> deliver'd me my Keys again, and taking my word, told me I was free to take away my goods. And indeed I have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that the Northern people are always more rude and ungentile than the Southern.</p>
                        <p>As for the 17500 Florins which the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> promis'd should be paid me upon my arrival in <hi>Holland,</hi> I receiv'd so many delays and put off's, that I was at length forc'd to commence a Suit that lasted above two years; nor could I get a publick Notary either at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or the <hi>Hague,</hi> that would make me out a Protest, every one fearing the Directors, who were both Judges and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. At length after five years wrangling and jangling, the Director wrote to my Brother at <hi>Batavia</hi> (for I was then return'd again to the <hi>Indies)</hi> that if I would accept of 10000 Livers, he might receive it for me; which he did, and was forc'd to give them an acquittance for the whole.</p>
                        <p>This is the return which I made from the <hi>Indies</hi> in the year 1649, and the only time that ever I return'd by Sea; having perform'd all the rest of my Travels by Land, not counting my short Voyages through the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> for any thing. And as for my first Travels, I perform'd them all by Land, from <hi>Paris</hi> through <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> as far as <hi>Constantinople;</hi> whither I return'd again in the year 1669. From <hi>Constantinople</hi> I went to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> thence I sail'd for <hi>Ligorn;</hi> from <hi>Ligorn</hi> I travel'd by Land to <hi>Genoa,</hi> thence to <hi>Turin,</hi> and so to <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <head>THE Author's Design.</head>
                  <p>I Question not but that several Relations of the <hi>Grand Seignor's Seraglio</hi> have been publish'd; but I am to acknowledge withal, that I have not had the leisure to read any one of them. I have travell'd Six seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, by Land, into the East, and by different Roads, during the space of Forty Years; and most Persons know, that my Employments were such, as would not allow me much time for the reading of Books. But when my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs afforded me any remission, I wholly employ'd those spare hours, in the collection of things the most worthy to be remark'd, whether the Scene lay in <hi>Turkey;</hi> or in <hi>Persia,</hi> or in the <hi>Indies,</hi> on this, or the other side of the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> or in the <hi>Diamond-Mines,</hi> which are in the Territories of divers Princes. While I am busied in putting into order those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires, which I conceive my self oblig'd to gratify the Publick withall, I make it a Present of this <hi>Relation</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> attended with some Observations sufficiently remarkable, which, haply, will not be unpleasant.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, which makes so much noise in the World, has not, to my thinking, been yet sufficiently well known, if I may judge of it, by what I have seen thereof my self, and have heard from several Persons. I do here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a faithful and ample description thereof: which I have extracted, as well out of what I had observ'd my self, in the several Voyages I made to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as out of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations I receiv'd from two intelligent Persons, who had spent many years in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> in very considerable Employments. One of whom was a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> advanc'd to the Charge of <hi>Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadar-bachi,</hi> or chief Officer belonging to the Treasury; and after Five and Fifty Years Service in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> was, for some slight miscarriage committed by him, banish'd to a place neer <hi>Bursa,</hi> in <hi>Natolia,</hi> from whence he made his escape into the <hi>Indies.</hi> The other, a <hi>Parisian-</hi>born, named <hi>De Vienne,</hi> had been one of the Pages of the Treasury. In his Return from the Jubilee at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year M. DC. L. being aboard a Brigantine bound from <hi>Civita Vecchia</hi> to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> he was
<pb facs="tcp:106224:271"/>
taken by the Pirates of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and the Bassa finding that young Lad well shap'd, and looking like one that promis'd much, sent him, as a Present, to the Grand Seignor. He was also pack'd away out of the Seraglio, after Fifteen Years Service, only upon this score, that there was some discovery made, of his holding a secret correspondence with the disgrac'd <hi>Sicilian,</hi> who had heretofore shewn him much kindness, and indeed it was by his credit that the <hi>Parisian</hi> was first advanc'd to the Chamber of the Treasury.</p>
                  <p>From those two men, who were in a fair capacity to make exact Observations of things, have I extracted the better part of this <hi>Relation.</hi> Though they had been forc'd to embrace the erroneous perswasion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> yet were there some Relicks of the good sentiments of Christianity: And whereas there was not the least hope of recovering the honours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they pride themselves who are exalted to Charges in the Seraglio, it is not to be imagin'd, that they could have any design to disguise things to me. They themselves thought it a certain pleasure to descend to a greater familiarity of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and to specifie even the least circumstances: but I am to discover withal, that having had their education amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> and learnt of them, to love Mony, it must have been so much the greater charge to me, to give them content. I have kept them for a considerable space of time, at my own charge, and that in several places, one at <hi>Ispahan</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they had made their residences, and the Memoires which they supply'd me withal were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly concordant.</p>
                  <p>To the Instructions, which I made a shift to get from those two men, and to what discoveries I may have made my self, of the present state of the Grand Seignor's Palace, I shall add some necessary Observations of the Manners and Customes of several Provinces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, slightly passing over those things, which, in all probability, are generally known. But that the Reader may with greater ease comprehend the matters I treat of, and that the Discourse may not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by the necessary explication of the several names of Charges and Dignities, I have thought it fit, in the first place, to give a short List of them, after which shall follow another, of the different Species of Mony, which are current all over the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire.</p>

                  <div type="report">
                     <p>THey who are advanc'd to Charges, whether it be in the Seraglio, or in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire (excepting only the Eunuchs, of whom I shall give an account anon) are <note place="margin">The Origine of the Grandees of the Port.</note> generally rais'd out of the Children taken in War, or sent by way of Presents, by the Bassa's, or out of the Tributary Children, who, about nine or ten years of Age, are taken out of their Mothers arms, through all the Provinces subdu'd by the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Princes. They are all to be of Christian Parents; and counting only the Slaves ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Enemy, we find by the Registers of the Custom-house of <hi>Constantinople</hi> alone, that, of both Sexes, there are brought thither every year, near twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. The Inhabitants of the lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi> who make continual Incursions into all the Countries, that are in hostility against the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, send up vast numbers of them, and the Grand Seignor having the choice of all those young Children, the best shap'd, and such as have the most promising looks, are distributed into several Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio's, to be there instructed in the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and all sorts of Exercises. And afterwards, out of the choice or cullings of these last is the Seraglio of <hi>Constantinople</hi> replenish'd; and they are to be distinguish'd into two Orders. The first and the most eminent is that of the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> design'd for the great Charges and Dignities of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: The second, that of the <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> employ'd in such Offices as require only strength of body. The <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> are those, in whom, besides the accomplishments of the Body, they discover also a noble Genius, fit for a high Education, and such as may render them capable of serving their Prince, some time or other.</p>
                     <p>These are accordingly instructed with great care, and educated with the observance of a most severe Discipline. They pass through four several Chambers, call'd <hi>Oda's,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The severe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline of the Seraglio.</note> which are as it were four Forms, where they learn, in order, whatever is convenient for young persons, who are to be continually about a great Prince, and are as it were his Pages, or Gentlemen. If they commit the least fault, they are severely chastis'd, and there is a great stock of patience requisite, for any one to be advanc'd to the fourth <hi>Oda,</hi> which when they have attain'd, they begin to take a little breath. But the hopes of being exalted to the greatest Honours, and the most eminent Dignities, makes them endure the barbarous treatments of the Eunuchs, who are appointed to be their Masters, and are very liberal of the Bastinado to them. I shall give an account elsewhere of the manner of their Education, and of those four <hi>Oda's,</hi> or Chambers, where they learn those things, whereby they are qualifi'd for the Charges, for which the Grand Seignor designs them. Though it be appointed by the received Custom of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that those Children should be all descended from <hi>Christian</hi> Parents, of the best extraction, and the best shap'd that can be found; yet the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> or Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Seraglio, the Principal of the white Eunuchs, who hath the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> sticks not to admit into their number some natural <hi>Turks,</hi> such as may be recommendable, upon the score of their good qualities and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But that happens very seldom, and that not without the particular permission of the Prince, who would rather have all those Children to be Renegado-Christians. And this is the Origine of the Great Persons belonging to the Grand Seignor, and the Port. They are all Slaves, and not having any knowledge of their Parents, or Relations, they wholly apply their affections to the Service of their Prince, who has been pleas'd to advance them to such high Fortunes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bassa's</hi> therefore are taken out of the Order of the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> and the name of <note place="margin">The Authority of the four Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Bassa's, of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to the Grand Seignor, and how he can take it off.</note> 
                        <hi>Bassa,</hi> or <hi>Basha,</hi> is only a Title of Honour and Dignity; common to all the Grandees of the Port, who are distinguishable, according to the difference of their Charges. The four Principal are these. The <hi>Vizir-Azem,</hi> or <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> the <hi>Bassa of the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Aga of the Janizaries.</hi> The Authority of these four Bassa's is so great, that sometimes they deprive their Sovereign of the Crown, and bestow it on whom they please; as it has happen'd, in our Age, to two Emperours immediately succeeding one the other, <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and <hi>Osman,</hi> of whom the later dy'd in Prison, by

But, on the other side, if these <hi>Bassa's</hi> know not how to take their measures rightly, they lose their heads upon the least mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, the Grand Seignor seizing to himself all their Estates at their death, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Children into the Seraglio. Nay, these last are so far from succeeding their Fathers, either as to wealth or imployments, even though it were the Son of a <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> or of a Sister of the Emperour himself, that the highest advancement they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, is to be made Captains of Gallies; the policy of the <hi>Turks</hi> not permitting, that in any one House there should be a transferrence of power from Father to Son, that so they may be prevented from taking any occasions to disturb the State. It may be seen by this account of them, that the fortune of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> which, for a time, seems so splendid, is but a tottering fortune, upon which, neither the Son, nor the Father himself, what repute soever he may be in, can make any sure relyance.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bassa's,</hi> who have the denomination of <hi>Vizirs,</hi> carry three Banners or Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <note place="margin">Observations upon the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</note> at the top of which there is a Horse-tayl fasten'd, put into what colour they please themselves, green only excepted, though they are permitted to paint the Staff, to which the Standard is fasten'd, with that colour. The Origine of this Custom was thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Story which the <hi>Turks</hi> relate of it. Having one day given Battel to the Christians, their Standard was taken in the heat of the Engagement, and the General of the <hi>Turks,</hi> perceiving that the loss of the Standard was a discouragement to the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were beginning to take their flight, he with a Cymitar cut off a Horse's tayl, and fasten'd it to the top of a half-Pike, and advanc'd it on high, crying out, <hi>Here is the Grand Standard, let him who loves me follow me.</hi> Immediately the <hi>Turks</hi> re-assum'd courage, and, having rally'd, renew'd the Charge, and gain'd the Victory. The Officers, who are about the Persons of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> have also their Standards, but they are not allow'd to add thereto one of those tayls; and it is to be observ'd, that the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's,</hi> who are not <hi>Vizirs,</hi> can carry but two of them; as the <hi>Beys,</hi> who are inferiour to the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and Governours of lesser Provinces, carry but one of them. When the Grand Seignor goes into the Country, there are seven Standards carry'd, in regard that, according to the <hi>Turks,</hi> the World is divided into seven parts, or seven Climats, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Grand Seignor is Master, if taken according to its breadth, and 'tis for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that, in their language, they give him the title of <hi>Master of all Kings.</hi> This is grounded upon what <hi>Mabomet</hi> said, That he, who, after his death, should be Master of those Territories, where his Sepulchre were found, should assume the title of Master or chief of all the Kings upon Earth. They add, that there are but three Empires, which are, those of <hi>Constantinople, Babylon</hi> and <hi>Trebizond:</hi> And 'tis for that reason, that the Grand Seignor wears three plumes of black Heron-tops, in his Turbant. Take notice by the way, that they are only the Herons of <hi>Candia</hi> which have their tops perfectly black, the Herons of all other Countries having them, either white, or of a mixt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And because there must be a considerable quantity of them to make up a plume, it must accordingly be of a very great value, which possibly has occasion'd its being out of use in <hi>Europe:</hi> For as to all the Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> they have still a great esteem for the Heron-tops; but they must not have the least defect, and if the points of them be ever so little broken, there is no account made of them, as being things of very little value. By those three Heron-tops upon the Grand Seignor's Turbant, it is known that the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> is in the Army; inasmuch as at that time, he wears but two of them, and the thing is worthy our observation. When the Army is to march, the Grand Seignor gives order for the drawing up of those Troops, which are at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the parts adjacent, and having the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> near him, he presents him to them for their General. The Souldiers, at that time, say not a word, nor do they make the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry salute, till after the Grand Seignor has caus'd one plume of the Heron-tops to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his Turbant, and to be put upon that of the <hi>Grand Vizir;</hi> and upon that Ceremony, the whole Army salutes him, and acknowledge him for their General, and from that very time are to receive their Pay from him.</p>
                     <p>Having spoken of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> in general, it is requisite I should give some Idea of those, who are advanc'd to the principal Charges of the Empire; and I shall bring into that List, the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> accompany'd by six others, who have the quality of <hi>Vizirs,</hi> the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> the <hi>Bassa of the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Aga of the Janizaries;</hi> after whom I shall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106224:274"/>
come down to the <hi>Beglierbeys,</hi> and to the <hi>Sangiacbeys,</hi> and to the <hi>Bostangi-Bachi,</hi> who has one of the most eminent Charges of the Port.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vizir-Azem,</hi> or <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> is the Lieutenant-General of the Empire, and of <note place="margin">The Honours and Disadvantages attending the Charge of <hi>Grand Vizir.</hi>
                        </note> the Armies, the principal Person of the Council, and he who, under the Grand Seignor's Orders, has the absolute disposal of all Affairs, relating to the State, or to the War, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his custody the Imperial Seal. He is attended by, and has assistant to him, in the Divan, six other <hi>Vizirs,</hi> whom they call <hi>Vizirs of the Bench,</hi> and who are properly Counsellors of State, but yet such as have not any deliberative voice, and come not into the Divan, but only to be consulted upon some point of Law, wherein they are well skill'd, without intermedling with the Government of the State; or concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in any Affair, unless their advice be requir'd. There are also five <hi>Beglerbeys,</hi> on whom the Grand Seignor bestows the qualification of <hi>Vizirs,</hi> and are possess'd of the greatest and wealthiest Governments of the Empire, to wit, the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Babylon, Cairo, Buda, Natolia</hi> and <hi>Romania.</hi> The three former, who are the three principal, had heretofore the priviledge (exclusively to all the other <hi>Bassa's)</hi> of having carried before them (in the same manner as the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> had) the three Horse-tayls, of which I have related the Story. But at the present, that priviledge extends to the two other <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi> and <hi>Romania,</hi> and they are all five equal, as to that point.</p>
                     <p>I am now to return to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> who has a magnificent Court, answerable to the greatness of the Master, whom he serves, and there are in his house above two thousand Domesticks. Though he lyes expos'd, as well as the other <hi>Bassa's,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Prince, and forc'd to send him his Head, when he requires it; yet does the Grand Seignor, in the Affairs of greatest importance, and such as concern the State, comply much with the Sentiments of his <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> and his Propositions in Council are as so many definitive Sentences. 'Tis that which renders his Power so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that in all the Empires and Kingdoms of the World, there is not any chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of State, whose Authority can be parallel'd to that of the <hi>Grand Vizir.</hi> Whoever comes to make him a Visit, he rises not out of his Chair, either to give him a recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to conduct him out again, unless it be the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who is the principal Person relating to the Law (of <hi>Mahomet)</hi> upon whose access, the Grand Seignor himself ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from his Throne. But this is particularly worth our observation, That as it belongs only to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> to propose all Affairs of importance, so does it concern him to be very careful, not to advance any thing that may be displeasing to the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; for if it should so happen, he gives immediate Order for the strangling of him, without making him any answer at all, upon this Maxime of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, that there must not be any thing propos'd to the Prince, which may give him any cause of dissatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caimacan</hi> is the Captain, and Governour of the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">A Priviledge particular to the <hi>Caimacan.</hi>
                        </note> to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> yet so as not to have any Authority, but only in his absence. And then he performs all the functions of that important Charge; he has the absolute Command, and gives Audience to Ambassadors. He is not subject, as the other <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's</hi> are, to that rigorous necessity of resigning his Head; upon this account, that if he does any thing, which may be displeasing to the Grand Seignor, he lays the blame thereof upon the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> from whom he receives his Orders.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bassa of the Sea</hi> is the Admiral, and Captain-General of the Naval Forces. The <hi>Beys,</hi> Governours of the Maritime Provinces, and such as are oblig'd to maintain the Grand Seignor's Galleys in good order, are to obey the Commands they receive from him, and to go to Sea upon the first advertisement they receive to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Janizary-Aga,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Yengeri-Agasi,</hi> is the Colonel-General of <note place="margin">The number of the real <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarles.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Janizaries.</hi> This Charge is very considerable, inasinuch as the <hi>Turkish</hi> Infantry, at this time, does for the most part pass under the name of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> though such as are really <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who derive their Institution from <hi>Ottoman</hi> the First, and their great Priviledges from <hi>Amurath</hi> the Third, do not at this day amount to a Body of above five and twenty thousand Men. They have excellent Regulations amongst themselves,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106224:274"/>
and are distributed into several Chambers, in the spacious Lodgings, whereof they are possess'd, whether it be at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or in other places. The order observ'd there is so excellent in all things, and so exactly maintain'd, that they live more like Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persons, than Souldiers; and though they are not forbidden to marry, yet it is very seldom that they do it. The great Priviledges which they enjoy all over the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, wherein they are so highly respected, induce abundance of Persons, meerly in order to their exemption from the paying of Taxes, and their being discharg'd from publick Duties, to prevail with the Officers, by Money, to protect them, and make them pass for <hi>Janizaries.</hi> But they receive no Pay from the Prince, and all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is restrain'd to the enjoyment of those Priviledges, which indeed are great enough. It is by this intermixture of the real <hi>Janizaries,</hi> with those who are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by corruption, that the number of them amounts at this day to above a hundred thousand; and yet not accounting any but such as are effectively <hi>Janizaries,</hi> their Body has sometimes been so dreadful, as that they have unthron'd the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, and chang'd the whole face of the Empire, of a sudden.</p>
                     <p>The Power of their <hi>Aga</hi> is very great, and there is not any Person can approach the <note place="margin">The great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the <hi>Aga.</hi>
                        </note> Prince, as he is permitted to do. For he may come into the Grand Seignor's presence, with his arms at absolute liberty, and with a confident deportment, whereas all the other Grandees of the Port, without any exception, even to the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> himself, dare not appear before him, otherwise than with their arms cross their bodies, and the hands, one upon the other, on the breast, as the mark of a profound submission.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Beglerbeys</hi> are, in dignity, next the four first <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and are as 'twere so many Soveraigns, in the general Governments of the Empire, whereof the Grand Seignor bestows the Command on them. But in regard it is not my design to speak of the Government of <hi>Turkey,</hi> any further than is requisite for the Subject whereof I treat, there is not any necessity, that I should inform the Reader of the number of those <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbeys,</hi> and it is enough, that I have nam'd the five principal ones, of whom I shall have occasion to speak elsewhere. I shall only add here, That those great <hi>Bassa's</hi> have, under them, a certain number of <hi>Sangiac-Beys,</hi> who are Governours of <hi>Sangiacs,</hi> or particular Provinces, as the <hi>Sangiacbey</hi> of <hi>Salonica,</hi> or of <hi>Morea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas there will also be frequently mention'd some others, under the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of <hi>Spahis, Zaims</hi> and <hi>Chiaoux,</hi> we must give a short account of those three sorts of Persons.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spahis,</hi> who make up a Body of about fifteen thousand Men, are a kind of Knights, who would pass for the Gentry or Nobility of the Country, and stand very much upon their Gallantry. They are maintain'd out of the Revenue of the <hi>Timars,</hi> that is to say, out of the Mannors, or Commanderies, which the Grand Seignor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows on them, according to the recompence he would make them for their services. Those <hi>Timars</hi> cannot be taken away from them, unless they be negligent in their duty, which is, that they should be in the Army, when the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> is there in person. These are the happiest Persons in all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and as it were petty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, in the places where they command.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Zaims</hi> differ not much from the <hi>Spahis,</hi> and, as the other, have the Command and Revenues of certain Lands, or Fiefs, which the Grand Seignor bestows on them. There is a very great number of them, over all the Empire, and they look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as the Lords and Barons of the Country. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Cavalry consists of the <hi>Zaims</hi> and the <hi>Spahis,</hi> and they know what number of Horse they are to bring into the Field, according to the Revenue of their <hi>Timars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaoux,</hi> or <hi>Chiaoux-Bachi,</hi> is the Chief of all the <hi>Chaoux</hi> of the Empire, whose imployment it is, to carry the Prince's Commands, to any part either within his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, or without, and to be sent upon Embassies, though indeed they are but as so many Messengers, or Expresses. 'Tis ordinarily into their custody that Prisoners of Quality are committed, and they suffer them not to be out of their sight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106224:275"/>
And thus you have an account of the principal Charges and Dignities of the Empire, all possess'd by Persons, taken out of the rank of the <hi>Ichoglans.</hi> I now come to the Officers of the Seraglio, and in regard they are Eunuchs, on whom the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor bestows the most eminent Charges, and who, besides, have the Government of the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> I shall follow the order of the things, in my placing of them here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say ought of the second order or rank of tributary Children, or such as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in War, who are the <hi>Azamoglans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> there are also two ranks. There are some white, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd only a simple castration; and there are black ones, who have all cut off, even <note place="margin">The prodigious number of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs</hi> all over the East.</note> with the belly. Both sorts of them are severe, humourous and morose, and their Treatments are almost insupportable to all those who are under their Charge. There is a prodigious number of them, as well in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as all over the Empire, and generally all over the Eastern parts of the World, where there is hardly a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, having any thing of abilities, but keeps an Eunuch or two, as Sentinels over his Women. And 'tis this that causes so great a commerce of Eunuchs in several parts of <note place="margin">Observations upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> 
                        <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and in the single Kingdom of <hi>Colconda,</hi> where I chanc'd to be in the year 1659, there were put off, of them, in that very year, about two and twenty thousand. It comes into my mind, that the Grand <hi>Mogor</hi>'s Ambassador, in whose Country, that Barbarism is not suffer'd, but the Eunuchs he makes use of are brought out of other places, took me one day aside, to tell me, that he car'd not how soon he return'd into his Country, out of the fear he was in, lest that Kingdom of <hi>Colconda</hi> might sink into the ground, after such cruelties. Most of the Fathers and Mothers, who are extreamly poor, and have no love for their Children, and whom they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so afraid that they cannot maintain, have no other shift, upon the first dearth of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, than to sell them to certain Merchants, who afterwards have them gelt, and sometimes make clear work, and cut off all. Some of those, who have not any thing left, when they would urine, are forc'd to make use of a little Cane or Pipe, and to put it to the bottom of the belly. And whereas few escape after so dangerous an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, such are accordingly much dearer than the others, and they are sold in <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> at the rate of six hundred Crowns; when a hundred, or a hundred and fifty, is the price of the ordinary Eunuchs. For the supply therefore of all <hi>Turkey,</hi> all <hi>Persia,</hi> all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all the Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> it may be easily judg'd, that there must come millions of them from several places. The Kingdom of <hi>Colconda,</hi> in the Peninsula on this side <hi>Ganges,</hi> and the Kingdoms of <hi>Assan, Boutan, Arachan,</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> on the other side of it, afford a prodigious number of them. All these Eunuchs are either white, or of duskish colour. The black Eunuchs, who are brought out of <hi>Africa,</hi> much inferiour in point of number, are, as I said, much the dearer. The most deformed yield the greatest price, their extream ugliness being look'd on as beauty in their kind. A flat Nose, a frightful Aspect, a large Mouth, thick Lips, the Teeth black, and standing at a distance one from another (for ordinarily the Moors have fair Teeth) are so many advantages to the Merchants who sell them. The Seraglio at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> is full of these two sorts of Eunuchs. The black are design'd for the custody of the Apartment, where the Women are, and sent to Court by the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Grand-Caire.</hi> The white, who are somewhat less savage, and have been educated with some care, are for the Grand Seignor's own Apartment.</p>
                     <p>The four principal Eunuchs, who approach the Prince's Person, are the <hi>Hazodaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> the <hi>Chasnadarbachi,</hi> the <hi>Kildrgibachi,</hi> and the <hi>Sarai-Agasi,</hi> who have for their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, <note place="margin">The principal charges of the Seraglio.</note> the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who has the superintendency of all the Chambers of the <hi>Ichog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans.</hi> They ordinarily succeed one the other, that is to say, the <hi>Sarai-Agasi</hi> succeeds the <hi>Kilargibachi;</hi> the <hi>Kilargibachi</hi> succeeds the <hi>Chasnadarbachi;</hi> and the last named suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>Hazodabachi;</hi> and in fine, the <hi>Hazodabachi</hi> succeeds the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who is always of the longest standing in service of the white Eunuchs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> or <hi>Capou-Agasi,</hi> is as it were the Grand Master of the Seraglio, he is <note place="margin">The noble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the <hi>Aga.</hi>
                        </note> the principal in dignity and repute, of all the white Eunuchs, and he is always near the Grand Seignor's Person, where-ever he is. He is the Person who introduces Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to Audience, and all great Affairs passing through his hands, ere they come into those of the Prince, his Charge renders him necessary to all others, and procures him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106224:275"/>
many rich Presents. All those Persons also, who are to make any Present to the Grand Seignor, must address themselves to the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> in order to their being presented to his Highness, of which he makes great Advantages. No Man can enter into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Apartment, nor get out of it, without his Order; and when the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> would speak to him, 'tis the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi>'s place, to take and present him to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Whether it be by night, or by day, if there happen some pressing Affair, whereof the <hi>Vizir</hi> would give the Grand Seignor immediate notice in writing, the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> receives it from him, and brings him the answer thereto. He wears his Turbant in the Seraglio, and rides up and down on Horse-back, by a Priviledge particularly annex'd to his Charge. He accompanies the Grand Seignor even into the Apartment of the Sultanesses; but he stays at the door, as having no Command in that place. When he leaves the Seraglio, upon his being dismiss'd from his Charge, which very seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, he cannot be a <hi>Bassa.</hi> As to his Table, all is at the Prince's Charge, and he has, over and above, ten <hi>Sultanines</hi> a day, which amount to sixty Livers, <hi>French</hi> Money. There have been some <hi>Capi-Aga</hi>'s, who have dy'd worth two millions, all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the Grand Seignor's Coffers. The chief of the white Eunuchs is attended by four others, who, next to him, have the principal Charges of the Grand Seignor's Quarter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hazodabachi,</hi> is, as it were, the Lord High-Chamberlain, having under his Charge the forty Pages of the Chamber, who ordinarily approach the Grand Seignor's Person.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Serai-Agasi</hi> has the general Superintendency of all the Chambers of the Grand Seignor's Quarter, as to what relates to Embellishment, and the necessary Reparations. He has a particular inspection over the <hi>Seferli Odasi,</hi> which is the Chamber of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who are to look after the Grand Seignor's Linnen, and attend him in his Progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. 'Tis incumbent also upon him to give Order for their Cloaths, and whatever else they stand in need of: And his Charge does somewhat resemble that of Captain of the <hi>Louver-Castle,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> since it is his work, generally to make provision for whatever may contribute to the decency and well-ordering of that great Palace. He has for his Assistant, or Lievtenant, the <hi>Seraiket-Odasi,</hi> who is also an Eunuch, whose imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, to have the Tapistry and Carpets, which are spread upon the Floors, in the Halls and Lodgings of the Seraglio, chang'd every six months.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Haznadar,</hi> or <hi>Chaznadar-Bachi,</hi> is the chief Intendant of the Treasury, and has the inspection of the conduct and deportment of the Pages of that Chamber. Which is not to be understood of the Treasury, design'd for the exigencies of the State, and the ordinary Pay of the Souldiery, and whereof the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> and the three <hi>Testenders,</hi> or Treasurers-General have the Keys, and Intendency. But the Treasury I here speak of, is the place, where they keep the Jewels of the Crown, and all the other Rarities, and the wealth gather'd together, from Father to Son, by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes; which I shall endeavour to lay down distinctly, before the Reader's prospect, in my Relation, when I come to open unto him both the Treasuries. However it is to be observ'd, that the <hi>Chaznadar-Bachi</hi> has only the honorary title of Chief of the Treasury, nay, that he cannot so much as enter into it, since that in the Reign of Sultan <hi>Amurat,</hi> the Pages of the Treasury having complain'd to the Grand Seignor of the ill conduct of that Eunuch, he, upon their Petition, order'd, that the <hi>Chaznadar-bachi</hi> should no longer have any Command there, and that the <hi>Chaznaket-odasi</hi> should for the future exercise his Charge, without depriving him of the title thereof. But in regard the <hi>Chaznadar-bachi</hi> is the better known, and the more pronounceable Name, I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make use of it, instead of the other; and we must not omit giving you this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, That when the Chief, or Overseer, of the Treasury, is remov'd from his Charge, he is made a <hi>Bassa.</hi> Upon this counterchanging of these two Officers of the Seraglio, it is to be observ'd, That, amongst all the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes, <hi>Turks, Persians, Indians,</hi> and of what Sect soever they may be of, what has been order'd and establish'd in the Reign of one Prince, is never revok'd by his Successor: And under the same <hi>Sultan-Amurat;</hi> the <hi>Capou-Agasi</hi> having committed some little impertinence, whereat the Grand Seignor took offence, he excluded, thence forwards, all the <hi>Capou-Agasis,</hi> who should be remov'd out of the Seraglio, from the priviledge of coming into a capacity to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106224:276"/>
be made <hi>Bassa's.</hi> I shall not think it much to alledge, upon this particular, another example of that Maxime, of which I was an eye-witness my self, in the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>'s Court. 'Twas in the Reign of <hi>Schach Abas,</hi> against whom some Grandees of the Court had enter'd into a Conspiracy, and attempted to take away the King's Life, yet with a design to have put his Son into the Throne. About Two or Three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when every one in <hi>Persia</hi> is retir'd to the <hi>Haram,</hi> which is the Appartment of the Women, the Conspirators sent, to the Palaces, twenty Men well arm'd, with Order, first, to put to the Sword all they should find at the Gates, which ordinarily are guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by two or three Men, armed with a massy Club, and afterwards to go and murther the King himself in the <hi>Haram,</hi> which would be but poorly defended by black and white Eunuchs, who are poor Souldiers. But the intended blow of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors was prevented, and the chief Porter, a Person accounted one of the most valiant of his time, being in his Station, with two of his Servants, <hi>Georgians</hi> by Country, that is to say, valiant, as all those People are, fell upon the Traitors with his Cuttelas, and beat them back so smartly, that they thought it the best way to run for't. The King having been inform'd of that action, order'd him to be brought into his Presence, and after he had commended him, made this establishment, That the Charge of chief Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, should ever continue in his Family, from Father to Son. He also commanded the Keeper of the Archives, or Records, to insert that action into the History, and wish'd that his own Name might be dash'd out of it, and all that had been done during his Reign, if any of his Successors attempted to change any thing of his Will, and deprive the House of the Faithful <hi>Georgian</hi> of that Charge.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kilargi-bachi</hi> is the chief Governour of the Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> which is the place, where they keep all the exquisite Drinks for the Grand Seignor's own drinking. It is a kind of Cup-Bearers Office, and the <hi>Kilargi-bachi,</hi> a kind of Cup-Bearer; and he is also made a <hi>Bassa,</hi> upon his removal from the Charge of <hi>Kilargi-bachi.</hi> He is moreover the Chief of all the <hi>Akegis,</hi> who are the Cooks and Confectioners, since no Body can have any entrance into those Offices, but by his Order; and he has under his custody all the Plate, which is for the peculiar service of the Grand Seignor. This Officer has for his Substitute the <hi>Kilarketodasi.</hi> Now having told you, that, upon the resignation of his Charge, he is made a <hi>Bassa,</hi> it were not amiss to advertise you further, That they who are remov'd out of the Seraglio, in order to their being <hi>Bassa's,</hi> ought to have been of the number of the forty Pages of the Chamber, and to have pass'd through one of these six Charges, of <hi>Chashaketodasi,</hi> and of <hi>Kilarketodasi,</hi> of whom I have spoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, of <hi>Dogangibachi,</hi> of the <hi>Chokadar,</hi> of the <hi>Seligdar,</hi> and of the <hi>Rikabdar,</hi> of whom I shall discourse anon. Otherwise, they can only be <hi>Beys,</hi> or <hi>Zaims,</hi> or <hi>Sphais,</hi> or at most, but <hi>Capigibachis,</hi> by the Grand Seignor's singular favour. The case is the same with the <hi>Gugombachi,</hi> who is the second Person of the Office of the Treasury, as also with the <hi>Anakdar-Agasi,</hi> who is the third. If these People remove out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, before they are admitted into the number of the Forty Pages of the Chamber, they have only a certain Pay, more or less, the highest whereof amounts not to above two hundred Aspers. I proceed to the other Officers of the Seraglio, of whom there will be some mention made in my Relation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dogangi-bachi</hi> is the Grand Falconer, and his Charge makes him a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Person about the Prince.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chokadar</hi> is he who carries the Royal Robe, called the <hi>Ciamberlue,</hi> the same Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Portemanteau.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rikabdar</hi> is he who holds the Stirrup, when the Grand Seignor gets on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seligdar</hi> is the first of the Pages of the Chamber; he carries the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Sword upon days of Ceremony, and they ordinarily advance to that Charge one of the handsomest Pages.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hammangibachi</hi> is the chief Overseer of the Bath. When he leaves the Seraglio, as also when the <hi>Kamachirbachi,</hi> who is the chiefest of the Pages of <hi>Seferli,</hi> does so; their Pay is an hundred Aspers a day; and if they are in favour, it may amount to an hundred and fifty. It is to be observ'd in the general, that when any one of the Forty Pages of the Chamber is remov'd, the vacancy is supply'd sometimes out of the Treasury, sometimes out of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> and sometimes out of the <hi>Seferti,</hi> and in that they take their turns. They always take out the most Ancient; and they who were next to them come into their places. How that is done, we shall take occasion to explicate more plainly in the Chapter of the Treasury.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106224:276"/>
The <hi>Chiamcibachi</hi> is the grand Laundry-man, or the Principal of those, who wash and order the Grand Seignor's Linnen.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Giritbey</hi> is the chief Director of those who are exercis'd in shooting with the Bowe, and calling the Dart. These two Exercises are much practis'd every <hi>Friday,</hi> in a place of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> appointed for that Divertisement. Thus have you, in few words, an account of whatever relates to the principal Charges of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> possess'd by those who have pass'd through the Chambers of the <hi>Ichoglans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Black,</hi> or <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> of whom I have but a word more to say, additional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what I have intimated before, are appointed to guard the Appartment of the Women, and they make choice, for that Office, of the most deform'd and the most <hi>Aesopical,</hi> that can be found. They are all cut even with the belly, ever since the time of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Second, who being one day in the fields, and seeing a Gelding offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leap a Mare, inferr'd thence, that the Eunnchs, who kept his Wives, might likewise endeavour to satisfie their passions; for which he bethought himself of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent remedy, by ordering them to have all cut off; and his Successors have since ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that Rule. There is a great number of those <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> and they have their variety of Chambers, and their Regulations, as the white ones have. I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here of their different Employments, and the Reader will find, in the Chapter, concerning the Appartment of the Women, all can be known, that's certain upon that Subject.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kislar-Agasi,</hi> or, as others name him, the <hi>Kuezer-Agasi,</hi> which is as much, in <note place="margin">The credit and wealth of the <hi>Kislar-Agasi,</hi> who keeps the Appartment of the Women.</note> our Language, as to say, <hi>the Guardian of the Virgins,</hi> is the chiefest of all the <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> and is of equal authority and credit with the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who is the Supreme of the <hi>white Eunuchs.</hi> The former is the Overseer of the Appartment of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, has the Keys of the Doors in his custody, and has access to the Emperor when he pleases himself. The charge he is possess'd of brings him in Presents from all parts; and there are not any such made to the Sultannesses, by the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who stand in need of their favour, in reference to the Sultan, but there comes along with it one to himself, which makes him one of the richest and most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Officers, belonging to the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> who make the second Order of young Lads, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Seraglio is replenish'd, and out of whose number they take such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for mean Officers, of whom I shall give you the List.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> are, as I said before, Tributary Children, taken away from the Christians, or made Captives, by Sea, or Land. They make choice of the handsomest, the best shap'd, and most robust, for the Seraglio, and they have neither wages nor allowances of any profit, unless they be advanc'd to some small Employments. Nor can they attain those, till after many years Services, and what is then allow'd them does not amount to above four Aspers and a half <hi>per diem.</hi> As for those who are brought up in other places, under the simple denomination of <hi>Azamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glans,</hi> and are not receiv'd into the Seraglio at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> their fortune can amount no higher, than to become <hi>Zanizaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When these young Boys are brought up to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the first distribution which is made of them is into the Seraglio's, or Royal Houses of the Grand Seignor: there are some of them left in the City, to be put to Trades; and others are sent to Sea, to serve for Seamen, and so gain experience in Navigation, by which means they capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themselves for some Employments. But to confine our discourse to the <hi>Azamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glans</hi> receiv'd into the great Seraglio, they are employ'd in several Offices, and some of them are made <hi>Bostangis,</hi> some <hi>Capigis,</hi> some <hi>Atagis,</hi> some <hi>Halvagis,</hi> and some, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagis;</hi> which terms I shall explicate to the Reader in as few words as I can.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bostangis</hi> are they who are employ'd in the Gardens of the Seraglio, out of whose number they take out those who are to row in the Grand Seignor's Brigantines, when he has a mind to divert himself in fishing, or take the air upon the Canal. They
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106224:277"/>
who thus serve in the Brigantines, and row on the right hand, may be advanc'd to the charge of <hi>Bostangi-Bachi,</hi> which is one of the most cousiderable places of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio: But they who row on the left hand, are capable only of the mean Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are bestow'd in the Gardens. If it happen that any one of them break his Oar, by strength of rowing, in the Grand Seignor's presence, his Highness imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately orders him a gratuity of fifty Crowns; and there is also a certain distribution made of some Money to the others, as the Grand Seignor takes his diversion in the Brigantine. Their greatest Pay, after they have served some years, is seven Aspers and a half <hi>per diem,</hi> besides clothing and diet, which they all equally have.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bostangi-Bachi</hi> has the general Intendency or Oversight of all the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bostangi-bachi</hi> one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b'est Charges of the Port.</note> Gardens, as well those of <hi>Constantinople</hi> as those of the neighbouring Villages, aud commands above ten thousand <hi>Bostangis,</hi> who are employ'd in the culture of them. Though he be taken out of the meanest rank of the <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> yet his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is very great, and his Employment one of the noblest and most considerable about the Court. That gives him access to the Prince's Person, to whom he may speak fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, when he carries him by Sea; for he has his Seat at the Helm of the Brigantine, wherein the Grand Seignor is, who most commonly makes use of him, to carry his Orders to some <hi>Bassa,</hi> when he would have his Head. All the Grandees of the Port stand in awe of him, and endeavour to gain his affection by their Presents, because it lies in his power, to do them either good or bad Offices about the Prince, whom he can dispose, as he pleases, when he has him abroad upon the Water. For being as 'twere at his elbow, and having the whip of the Rudder in his hand, with the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of sitting in his presence, that he may the more easily govern it, he has then the opportunity to entertain him with affairs of State, and the conduct of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and answerably to his passion, or interest, clearly to acquaint him how things pass, or turn and disguise them as he pleases. In fine, if he be highly in favour, he may obtain one of the great Governments, and become <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Buda, Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Cairo,</hi> nay haply <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> which is the most eminent Charge of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capigis</hi> are the Porters or Keepers of the Gates of the Seraglio, that is to say, of the first and second Courts; for the third Gate, which gives entrance into the inner Seraglio, is kept by Eunuchs. The Chief of the <hi>Capigis</hi> is call'd <hi>Capigi-bachi,</hi> who has under him other Officers, bearing the same Name; and whom the Grand Seignor makes use of, to carry his Orders. The <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> is above all.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Attagis</hi> are the Cooks of the Seraglio, over whom as well as over the <hi>Halvagis,</hi> the <hi>Kilargi-bachi</hi> has full Power. Every Kitchin has its <hi>Attagi-bachi,</hi> that is to say, its chief Director, or Master-Cook. And the <hi>Moutbak-Emin</hi> is the Intendant or Overseer, who supplies the Kitchins with all that is necessary, taking care also for the Tables of the Ambassadors, according to the Orders he has receiv'd from the <hi>Grand Vizir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Halvagis</hi> are the Confectioners, of whom I shall have occasion to speak more at large elsewhere. They give also the same Name to those who serve the Grandees of the Seraglio, and are permitted to go out of it and into it, when they please.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Baltagis</hi> are a robust sort of People, imploy'd in the carrying of Burthens, as Porters, and Cleavers of Wood are amongst us. <hi>Baltagi</hi> implies properly a Labouring Man, who makes use of the Wedge.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hasteler-Agasi</hi> is the Overseer of the Infirmary, who observes what comes in, and what goes out, and especially that there be no Wine brought in.</p>
                     <p>I shall have occasion also, in my Relation, to speak of two others, to wit, the <hi>Emirahour-bachi,</hi> and the <hi>Ekmeggi-bachi,</hi> who are two Officers belonging to the Sultan, but have their Habitations out of the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Emirahour-bachi</hi> is the great Gentleman-Usher, who goes before the Grand Seignor, when he appears in publick, and in all Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106224:277"/>
The <hi>Ekmeggi-bachi</hi> is the Master-Baker, who has the over-sight, and gives direction for the Baking, of all the Bread that is eaten in the Seraglio. These two Imployments are not bestow'd on any of those who have their abode within the Seraglio, but to Persons who live out of it, but have the liberty of ingress into it, egress out of it, at any time.</p>
                     <p>To be short, I shall have occasion to speak of the <hi>Caragi-bachi,</hi> and of the <hi>Cham</hi> of the lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi> and I have some curious Observations to make upon both of them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caragi-bachi</hi> is the Chief of those, who collect the Tributes, and it is of him, <note place="margin">The Oeconomy of the <hi>Partizans,</hi> or Collectors of publick Moneys.</note> as also of the <hi>Gemmerou-bachi,</hi> or grand Farmer of the Customs, and of the <hi>Bazarcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bachi,</hi> or Chief amongst the Merchants, that the Grand Seignor makes use of, to make Advancements, when he wants Money, and that there is not any in the Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, he being unwilling that they should meddle with the Secret Treasury. They must of necessity find it out, and it is no hard matter for them to do, in regard that of all the Tributes, Customs, and other Impositions due to the Grand Seignor, there is not any thing pay'd till the end of the Year, and these Officers oblige Men to the payment thereof, at the beginning of it.</p>
                     <p>All sorts of Persons, what Religion soever they are of, except the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> are oblig'd to pay the Tribute without any exception, from the time of their settling in the Empire, and having attain'd the sixteenth year of their Age. And this Tribute, or Poll-Money, amounts to five hundred and fifty old <hi>Aspers,</hi> which neither rise nor fall, but always keep at the same rate of eighty, to a <hi>Piastro,</hi> which, in the <hi>French</hi> Money, and consequently with little difference in ours, amounts to five Crowns and 5/<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. All other <hi>Christians</hi> who come into the Empire, upon the score of Trade, or Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though 'twere but for one day, are forc'd to pay, at the first City where they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive. The forreign <hi>Greeks,</hi> such as they from <hi>Muscovy</hi> or other places, pay three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty <hi>Aspers;</hi> but the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who come from <hi>Persia, Georgia, Mingrelia,</hi> and other Countreys, are tax'd but at three hundred. As to the <hi>Christians,</hi> whom they call <hi>Franguis,</hi> they pay nothing; and that has given much trouble to the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors of <hi>Europe,</hi> especially to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, there being more <hi>French</hi> that are Inhabitants in <hi>Turkey,</hi> than there are of any other Nation. And yet though the <hi>Turks</hi> make their Year to consist but of twelve Moons, ours being near twelve and a half, they make the Tributaries pay but for twelve Moons; yet in requital, and that nothing may be lost, they make them pay that Tribute double, every three and thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year, and are very frugal Husbands for the benefit and advantage of their Master.</p>
                     <p>There are but two Princes in the World that are known by the Name of <hi>Cham,</hi> to <note place="margin">The policy of the Port, to keep the <hi>Cham</hi> of the lesser <hi>Tartary</hi> quiet.</note> wit, the Emperour of great <hi>Tartary,</hi> and the King of the little <hi>Tartary,</hi> a Vassal to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs. I conceive my self oblig'd, to give the Reader some information of the present condition of the latter. When the <hi>Cham</hi> of the lesser <hi>Tartary</hi> enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Government, he comes to take his Oath of Fidelity to the Grand Seignor, and the <hi>Turks</hi> look upon him no otherwise than as a Governour of a Province, or at most, but as a Vassal-Prince. But those of his own Countrey, the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> the <hi>Poles,</hi> the <hi>Georgians,</hi> the <hi>Mingrelians,</hi> and the other Nations bordering upon him, treat him as a King, when they write to him. The Grand Seignor uses much Policy towards the <hi>Cham,</hi> lest he should revolt from him, and render himself more powerful than he is, by Alliances with the neighbouring Princes. For it is to be observ'd, That the lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi> whereof the City <hi>Cassa,</hi> near the <hi>Cimerian</hi> Streight, is the Metropolis, is not a Countrey subdu'd by the Arms of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> The ancient Kings of it did only put themselves under the Grand Seigner's protection, who receiv'd them into it, upon condition, that when the Father dy'd, his Son, or the next of kin, his Successor, was not to enter upon the Government, till he had receiv'd the Investiture from the Port, and taken the Oath of Fidelity to the Grand Seignor, obliging himself to come to him, upon the first Orders to that purpose. The Grand Seignor promis'd in requital, that he would not establish any other than what were of their race, to command in the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <hi>Tartary.</hi> And whereas there are two branches of that Family, he keeps one of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106224:278"/>
them always banish'd, in the Island of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> while the other governs. But if, after fifteen or twenty years, there should be any suspition of this latter Family's having a design, to render it self absolute, he sends for the <hi>Cham</hi> and his Children, when he has any, and sending them to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> brings thence him who was there in exile, and orders him to reign in his turn, for some years. The form of his Oath you will find in the sixth Chapter of my Relation, where I speak of the Hall of Audience, and the manner, in which that Prince is there receiv'd.</p>
                     <p>I have only now somewhat to say of the <hi>Moufti,</hi> the <hi>Cadilesquer,</hi> and the <hi>Cadis</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The principal Dignities of those who study the Law.</note> and the others relating to the Law, which I shall do in few words. Only let it be here observ'd in the general. That, according to the perswasion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> Laws are part of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and that having been given them by their Prophet, they are deriv'd from God, and require an implicite obedience. 'Tis by this course, that they are kept within their duty, and that they obey the Laws, as much out of a principle of Religion and Conscience, as out of the fear of chastisement; and in that they do not much recede from our <hi>Christian</hi> Maximes. The <hi>Mouftis</hi> and the <hi>Cadis</hi> pass therefore indifferently under the Name of Persons well skill'd in the Law, as if we should reduce our Divines and our Civil Lawyers into the same Class, and in civil and criminal Causes the <hi>Moufti</hi> is often consulted.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Moufti</hi> is the honourary Chief of the Law all over the Empire, and accounted to be the Interpreter of the <hi>Alchoran.</hi> I speak of the grand <hi>Moufti</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who is the most esteem'd, and the principal of all.

                     <p>The <hi>Cadis</hi> are under the <hi>Mollah,</hi> and ought to be well vers'd in the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of the Countrey.

                     <p>The <hi>Imans,</hi> or <hi>Emaums,</hi> are the Priests of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and as 'twere the Parsons of their <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> where they take care that all things be done in order, and at the times appointed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hogias</hi> are the Doctors of the Law, and as it were the Regents, and Instructors of Youth.</p>

                  <head>OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF Gold and Silver-Coins, And the small MONEY Now current in TURKEY. Together With the History of the TRADE in <hi>Five Sols Pieces</hi> (French MONEY) and the Abolition of it.</head>
                  <p>THere are but two Species of <hi>Gold-Coins</hi> current all over the <hi>Turkish</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What Money current in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.</hi>
                     </note> Empire; the one is the proper Countrey Money, the other comes out of Forein parts. The former is the <hi>Scherif,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Sequin,</hi> or <hi>Sultanine;</hi> and that kind of Gold is worth at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent six Franks, <hi>French</hi> Money, though heretofore it yielded but five Franks, nay came so low as four.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scheriffs</hi> come from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Cairo</hi> isthe only City of the Empire, where <note place="margin">The Gold brought to <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and coin'd there.</note> Gold is coin'd. That Gold is brought out of the Kingdom of the <hi>Abyssines,</hi> and this is the manner how it is brought to <hi>Cairo.</hi> The quantity is not the same every year, and when the passages are shut up, whether by War, or by extraordinary Rains, whereby the Fields are overflown,, there comes but little Gold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> during that time. As soon as those obstructions are taken away, and that there is a freedom of Commerce, you shall see arriving at <hi>Cairo,</hi> nay at <hi>Alexandria</hi> too, several <hi>Abyssines,</hi> who bring in, one man, two pounds, another four, every one more or less, according to his abilities. Those poor People run a thousand risques in their Travels, and 'tis almost a miracle, how they bring them to a period. Some of them are of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whence the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came, and which is now call'd the Kingdom of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> Others come from places at a greater distance, and they have sometimes fifteen days journeys to make, and cannot meet with any waters to drink, but what are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and destructive to health: which I found but too true my self, when I cross'd the Desarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> If by chance they come to some Cottage or Hut, where they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106224:279"/>
have kill'd an Elephant, it is a place for them to feast in. This consider'd, we need not wonder at the short lives of those miserable people, whose bodies are destroy'd in those Voyages, and who for the most part do not exceed forty years of age. The case is the same with those, who trade with the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> on the Coasts of <hi>Melinda</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambico,</hi> the corrupt waters they are forc'd to drink in their way make them hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal at five and twenty years at age, and generally, all the several peoples of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sabour,</hi> have the right Leg swell'd, and twice as big as the left, and seldom exceed five and thirty years.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a miraculous thing to see the fidelity wherewith those poor <hi>Abyssines</hi> demean <note place="margin">The sincerity of the <hi>Abyssines.</hi>
                     </note> themselves in trading, as well those of the Southern parts, who are <hi>Christians,</hi> as those of the North, who border upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and are <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> For after they have taken the Commodities they like for the Gold they have brought, if the Merchant they deal with will supply them with any thing further, to be paid at their return, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own words, he is sure enough of it, and need not break his sleep for it. For if it happen that one of those <hi>Abyssines,</hi> who is a Debtor, should die by the way, some of his Relations, or Friends, whom he acquaints with his affairs, brings the Gold at the next return, for the Commodity which had been taken up; and it could never hitherto be found, that any Merchant could complain, that ever he had lost ought by any one of them. All that is to be fear'd, is, that they should fall into the hands of their Enemies, who rob, and kill them, and particularly on the South-side, there being less danger, towards the North.</p>
                  <p>The foreign Coins of Gold in <hi>Turkey</hi> are the <hi>Ducates</hi> of <hi>Germany, Holland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi> They are very much sought after, and they are chang'd, at six Livers and a half, and sometimes at six Livers and fifteen Sols; and that is done in order to the sending of them to the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they drive a great Trade with them, as I shall make it appear, in my Relations of the Levant. Sometime since, there has been some abatement made in the <hi>Ducates</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> upon a discovery of their not being of so good an alloy, as those of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There will be often mention made of <hi>Purses,</hi> in that Relation of the Seraglio. A <hi>Purse</hi> implies as much as the sum of five hundred Crowns, and it is of those Purses that the Grand Seignor makes his ordinary Presents. But a <hi>Purse of Gold,</hi> wherewith he regales his Sultanesses, and his peculiar Favourites, amounts to fifteen thousand <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,</hi> or thirty thousand Crowns. A <hi>Kizé</hi> is also a bag of fifteen thousand <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</hi>

                  <p>In all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, there is not any Money of Copper to be seen, and the Species current there must be either of Silver or Gold. True it is, that there are some pieces of Silver taken there, of a very base alloy, especially the <hi>Roup,</hi> which are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Ryals, coin'd in <hi>Poland;</hi> and with the assistance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> in their several Governments, counterfeit certain foreign Coins, which are all much different from those which they are intended to imitate.</p>
                  <p>The case is the same as to Silver-Coins in <hi>Turkey,</hi> as it is with those of Gold. There are some coin'd in the Countrey, as the <hi>Asper,</hi> and the <hi>Parasi,</hi> which are the least of all. And there are some forreign Moneys, as the <hi>Spanish Ryal,</hi> and the <hi>Rix-dollars</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Asper</hi> is the least of all the Moneys, which heretofore was worth eight <hi>Deniers, French</hi> Money, that is about ⅔ of the <hi>English</hi> Penny, as being of good Silver, and the value set upon them was after the rate of 80, for the Crown-piece. But in the more remote Provinces, the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> cause such an abundance of counterfeit ones to be made, that at present, a Crown-piece will yield one hundred and twenty <hi>Aspers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Parasi</hi> is another kind of small Money, which is worth four <hi>Aspers,</hi> and coin'd at <hi>Cairo.</hi>

                     <hi>Aselani</hi> is the <hi>Rix-dollar,</hi> mark'd with the Lyon of <hi>Holland.</hi> After which follow the Pieces of four <hi>Ryals,</hi> of two <hi>Ryals,</hi> and of one <hi>Ryal;</hi> and heretofore the Pieces of <hi>five Sols, French</hi> Money, wherewith there was a great Trade driven in <hi>Turkey.</hi> 'Tis a thing not well known to all, and therefore the History thereof will haply not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>A certain Merchant of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> without any fore-thought design, sent as many Pieces of <hi>five Sols,</hi> newly come out of the Mint, as amounted to the sum of two, or <note place="margin">The Trade dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the five Sols-pieces.</note> three hundred Crowns, amongst some other Pieces of Silver-Coins, to buy Silks. The <hi>Turks</hi> found those little Pieces so pretty and so beautiful, and were at the first so taken therewith, that they thought them to be the eighth parts of a <hi>Ryal,</hi> and were content to allow a Crown, for every eight of them. The Factor, perceiving it, writ to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seilles,</hi> whence he receiv'd a very great sum in that Money, and gain'd very much thereby. If the <hi>French</hi> could have contented themselves with that honest profit, the commerce of those Pieces, which was quash'd by the excessive frauds committed in the management of it, might have continued still, and would have been very advantageous to them. The <hi>Turks</hi> were unwilling to trade in any other kind of Money, and in the payment of the Armies, to give the Souldiers content, there was a necessity of dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them among them. One day, returning out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Turkey,</hi> I was persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by several Women, who would needs have me give them some <hi>Temins,</hi> (so they call that kind of Money) and I could not have any thing to eat, for any other Money.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>French</hi> Merchants were gainers at the first, after the rate of fifty, <hi>per cent.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in <hi>Turkey</hi> but eight of those Pieces for a Crown, whereas they had twelve of them in <hi>France</hi> for the same Piece. But the other <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations, the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Italians,</hi> envying their happiness, came to give a check to their design, and making their complaints to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> that Minister order'd, That, for the future, they should allow twelve of those Pieces for the Crown, or that they should not be current any longer, and that whatever sums thereof were found in the Ships, should be confiscated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> were not at all satisfy'd with that; and whereas there was a necessity of submitting to the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi>'s Decree, they bethought themselves of having some of those Pieces coin'd, which should not have above four <hi>Sols</hi> of good Silver, which was a considerable advantage, of twenty five upon the hundred. They pass'd well enough for some time, before the <hi>Turks</hi> had discover'd the fraud; they being satisfy'd, that the Stamp was fair, and that the Pieces look'd very white: And the Women and Maidens, of the meaner sort of People, made them contribute to the ornament of their Heat-tires, about which they fasten'd those pretty little Pieces, and they came down flapping about their Foreheads, as the wealthyer sort fasten'd Pieces of Gold to theirs.</p>
                  <p>But the better to compass their design, the <hi>French</hi> Merchants were oblig'd to find out other Countreys, where it might be lawful for them to traffick in those Pieces. Their first recourse was to those of <hi>Dombes, Orange,</hi> and <hi>Avignon,</hi> and passing into <hi>Italy,</hi> they found work for some time for those of <hi>Monaco,</hi> and <hi>Massa.</hi> But having observ'd, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were more taken with the Pieces which had the impression of a Woman's Head, and those Princes being unwilling to suffer them to coin among them any Money of so base an alloy, or to give it the Stamp of <hi>Ja,</hi> the Princess of <hi>Dombes,</hi> they cast their eyes upon some Castles situate within the Territories of the <hi>Genueses,</hi> yet subject to the jurisdiction of the Empire, where they obtain'd what they desir'd, upon conditions not disadvantageous to the Lords of those places. The Pieces they got coin'd at <hi>Orange,</hi> were also sought after, and pleas'd the <hi>Turks,</hi> in regard the Stamp was beautiful, and very clear; but those of the Legat of <hi>Avignon</hi> were not so current, the Effigies thereof not being well done, and the Cross, hanging at the Neck,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106224:280"/>
displeasing to the <hi>Turks.</hi> Had they contented themselves, in that Trade, with twenty five upon the hundred, it might have continu'd, and the profit would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable: but by little and little, the thing came to so great an excess, till, at last, there was not one penny-worth of good Silver in every piece.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> to make them pass the better, gave eighteen, and sometimes twenty for a Crown, of which abuse the great Merchants of <hi>Constantinople, Aleppo, Smyrna,</hi> and other Cities of Trade, made a good hand, they giving but twelve or thirteen for the worth of a Crown, in the payments they made to the petty Merchants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Empire, for the Merchandizes they brought out of <hi>Turkey,</hi> there was none of that counterfeit Money dispers'd, and the <hi>Armenians</hi> were far enough from burthening themselves with it, in regard that all the Money, which is carried into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> is presently convey'd to the Mints, upon the Frontiers, to be melted down, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards coin'd into <hi>Abassis,</hi> whereof they give the Merchant an account, answerably to the Standard of his Money, after it has been examin'd; and by that means there can be no fraud committed. The same course is taken over all the Great <hi>Mogol's</hi> Empire; and of all the Princes in the World, he causes all the Species of Gold and Silver of the best Standard to be coin'd without admitting the least alloy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Genuese</hi> Merchants, perceiving that the <hi>French</hi> had, at the beginning been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">The jealousie of the other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</note> in their Commerce, would needs imitate them in other sorts of Money, and got two or three hundred thousand <hi>Ducats</hi> coin'd, which they carried into <hi>Turkey.</hi> But they had not the success they expected, the Gold was so counterfeit, that the cheat was immediately discover'd, the Consul, and the Captain of the Vessel, were in some trouble about it, and the persons concern'd therein, sav'd what they could of that distaster.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> also would needs come in for a share, taking another course all along the <hi>Dannow,</hi> quite to the mouth of it, from whence they got to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> through the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> With other their Merchandizes, most whereof consisted in the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Copper-wares of the City of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> things fit enough those Nations, which border upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, they carried a quantity of <hi>Roups,</hi> or quarter-<hi>Ryals,</hi> of the coinage of <hi>Poland,</hi> which were pleasant to the eye, and might have been commodious enough for the Merchants, if the adulteration had been moderate. But the <hi>Italians</hi> need not be much asham'd, that the <hi>Germans</hi> should be more successful than they upon that occasion, since that both Nations came short in point of subtilty, to deceive the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>French,</hi> the first concern'd in this History, to which it is time to pur a period. In the heat of their Commerce, and while all things were very well with them, they thought it not enough, to carry away the richest Merchandizes, but they also bought up all sorts of good Money they could meet withal, and brought it into <hi>France,</hi> to carry on and continue the coinage of their counterfeit pieces. This Trade was carry'd on so far, through the whole extent of that vast Empire, and there was so prodigious a quantity of that counterfeit Money spread abroad, that it was found by the Register-Books of the Farmers of the Customes, that the sum of what had been dispers'd of it amounted to a hundred and fourscore millions [of Livers] not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had never come to their knowledge, and what Seamen, and other private Persons might have conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>The other Merchants and Traders of <hi>Europe,</hi> who brought none but good Money, having exclaim'd against that disorder, and renew'd their complaints to the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir;</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> at last open'd their eyes, and that principal Minister, having compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that if the thing continu'd, in a short time, in stead of Silver, there would be nothing but Copper in the Empire, prohibited the bringing in of any more of those pieces of <hi>five Sols,</hi> upon pain of confiscation, and great penalties to be inflicted on those, who durst do any thing contrary thereto,</p>
                  <p>Yet could not that crying of them down, and the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi>'s prohibition make the Souldiers, who serv'd in <hi>Candia,</hi> out of love with those little pieces, the beauty whereof they were so much taken withal. Notwithstanding all the Remonstrances
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106224:281"/>
that could be made to them, they would not be paid in any other kind of Money; and some discontented Persons and Mutineers, beginning to shew their Teeth, they were forc'd immediately to to send Gallies to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and some other Cities of great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, to bring away all that could be found of that sort of money. The incredible quantity of those counterfeit pieces, dispers'd in all the Provinces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, is at least vanish'd, they are grown red, and no longer current.</p>
                  <p>At the first crying down of that counterfeit money, before the news of it could <note place="margin">A mischievous fraud gently punished.</note> have been brought to foreign Countries, a certain Person named <hi>Goulin,</hi> engag'd all he had in the world, to make up to the sum of five and twenty thousand Crowns in those pieces of <hi>five Sols,</hi> so extremely falsify'd, that there was harldly so much Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as was requisite to whiten them. He came to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where I then was, and where he soon found, that there was no way to put off his counterfeit Merchandize. Whereupon he imagin'd, that he might get it off, if he could make a speedy Voyage to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where, as he had been assur'd, some Persons took them, even after they had been cry'd down. Being unwilling to hazard all by Sea, he sent away, by Land, four or five thousand Crowns, which were taken away by Thieves, near <hi>Bursa,</hi> and carry'd the much greater part to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Vessel, of which he had also sufficient cause to repent him. After he had expos'd it at the Custom-house, for the payment of the Duties, the Chief Officer of the Customs told him, that he might return within two or three days, to take back what belong'd to him; and as soon as the other was gone, he caus'd all to be melted down in his presence. The separation being made, upon twenty thousand Crowns, which was the sum he had brought thither, there was not the full fourth part of Silver, and the Merchant coming again to the Customer, fell down all along, out of pure fear lest a severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment might follow the fraud whereof he was visibly convicted, seeing so much scum of brass on the one side, and so little silver on the other. But the <hi>Turks</hi> are not so rigorous, as some persons imagine, all was restor'd to him, nay there was no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty inflicted upon him, and they only order'd him to be gone.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> more addicted to subtilty and circumvention, than the <hi>Levantines,</hi> and for the most part not endeavouring to be sincere in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, <note place="margin">The ancient sincerity of the <hi>Turks</hi> corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the <hi>Europaeans.</hi>
                     </note> have taught the <hi>Turks</hi> several Cheats, which they were either ignorant of, or did not practise, especially since the Inhabitants of <hi>Granada,</hi> being driven out of <hi>Spain,</hi> dispers'd themselves into several Provinces of the <hi>Levant.</hi> Before that time, a man might have rely'd on their integrity and fair dealing. But now, when you treat with them, you must stand upon your guard; so prevalent is the example of evil to corrupt mens minds. Nor are we to be astonish'd at that ancient undisguized humour of the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Commerce, since we find, that the poor <hi>Abyssines,</hi> who come from the lower parts of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to traffick at <hi>Cairo,</hi> and the Idolaters themselves in the <hi>Indies</hi> amongst themselves and with Strangers, with a strict observance of an inviolable fidelity.</p>

                     <p>THE Grand Seignor's Seraglio, whereof I undertake to give a Description, <note place="margin">The origins of the word <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> common to all the Royal Houses in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        </note> is the Palace, where the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes ordinarily keep their Court. All the Royal Houses, as well in <hi>Turkey,</hi> as <hi>Persia,</hi> have the same Name, which derives its Origine from the word <hi>Serrai,</hi> which signifies a great Noble House, in the <hi>Persian</hi> Language. The Grand Seignor has many Seraglio's, in the Provinces of his Empire, and the principal of them are those of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> and <hi>Adrianople,</hi> two Residences which that Monarch does ordinarily make use of, according to the conjuncture of his Affairs.</p>
                     <p>But to confine our selves to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> we find there three Seraglio's, which have all their different Beauties. The old Seraglio is the Palace, appointed for the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those Women, who have serv'd the Predecessors of the Prince Regent, and whence they never get out, unless it be in order to Marriage. The Grand Seignor goes thither but very seldom, and that when he is out of humour, to pass away some days there in solitude. The Seraglio of the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> so call'd from the Exercises done there on Horse-back, which was built by <hi>Ibrahim Bassa,</hi> Son-in-law, and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to the Emperour <hi>Solyman</hi> the Second, serves now for an Amphitheatre for publick Festivals, Exercises, Combats, Carousels, and particularly for the Circumcision of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, which is their greatest Solemnity. The third is the Grand Seraglio, whereof I make the Relation, and to which that Name is principally attributed, so as that there needs not any thing else to be added thereto, to distinguish rit from the others. I shall have but little to say concerning the Structures of it, wherein there is not any thing extraordinary to be observ'd, but shall rather insist upon what is private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, in each Appartment of that great Palace.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seraglio is a vast place inclos'd, which reaches to that point of Land, where the ancient <hi>Byzantium</hi> was built, upon the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the joyning <note place="margin">The admirable situation of the Seraglio of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
                        </note> together of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea and the <hi>Euxine,</hi> which contribute so much to the beauty and wealth of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This great City, let the Wind sit where it will, does every hour receive some refreshments or other, from one of those Seas; and the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, advancing it self into the Channel, which makes a communication between them, receives the first Advantages that may be derived thence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106224:282"/>
That great Inclosure makes a Triangle, one side whereof is to the Land-side, and <note place="margin">Its extent, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</note> reaches to the City, and the two others lye open to the Sea and a River which falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. This Triangle is unequal, and if it be divided into eight parts, that side, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Land takes up three of them, and the five others are for the two sides abut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Sea. Its compass is about three <hi>Italiah</hi> miles, or one of our common Leagues. And this Palace is surrounded all about with high and strong Walls, flank'd on the Sea-side with square Towers, at a considerable distance one from another; and towards the City, with round Towers, which are at a nearer distance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the great Gate of the Seraglio, which is towards St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> as far as the Sea, where you imbark for <hi>Galata.</hi> In those Towers, in the night-time, there are Guards of the <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> to see that no Body approaches the Seraglio, by Sea or Land; and if occasion require, they may fire some pieces of Artillery, which stand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loaden upon a Quay, of five fathom breadth, which is carried quite about the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>Upon one of those Towers, about a hundred paces from the great Gate of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, as you go down, in order to your passage over to <hi>Galata,</hi> they have wrought a Closet, into which the Grand Seignor goes sometimes to divert himself, and to see People passing to and fro, without being seen himself. Somewhat lower, and upon the Sea-side, there is a spacious place cover'd over, under which, as if it were in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Haven, they keep the Caicks or Brigantines, wherein the Prince takes his divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Water, when he is pleas'd to do it.</p>
                     <p>Not far thence, within the inclosure of the Seraglio, are the Habitations of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stangis,</hi> who are entrusted with the conduct of the Brigantines; and at a little farther distance, in your way to the point of the Seraglio, which is towards <hi>Scudaret,</hi> stands the Quarter of the <hi>Bostangi-bachi,</hi> Overseer of the Gardens of the Seraglio, and of all the other Gardens belonging to the Grand Seignor.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Quay, which, as I told you, does surround the Walls of the Seraglio, <note place="margin">The Artillery out of order, and the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners not well skill'd.</note> there are forty or fifty pieces of Canon of different bigness, and there are some of so great a bore, that a Man might get into them. Opposite thereto, and in the middle of the Channel, there is a Tower built upon a Rock, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Quisler hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesi,</hi> or the <hi>Tower of the Virgins.</hi> It is kept by <hi>Bostangis,</hi> and has its Guns levell'd with the Water, which better defend the Streight, than those at the point of the Seraglio, which for the most part are without Carriages, and unserviceable. Besides, they want good Gunners, and if all that Artillery were well mounted, and manag'd by skilful Persons, it would better keep in awe, whatever comes out of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and the <hi>Black Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some few paces from the place where these Canons are planted, there springs a Fountain which comes out of the Seraglio, and casts a great quantity of Water, for the convenience of the Vessels, which lye at Anchor near it, and supply themselves therewith; it being not permitted that any should land on that side of the Seraglio, but upon that account.</p>
                     <p>We have spoken sufficiently of the external parts, 'tis time we now enter into the <note place="margin">A pleasant abode, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint makes it otherwise.</note> Seraglio, and rather consider what passes in every Appartment of it, than the Structures thereof, wherein, as I said, there is not any thing of Magnificence, whatever some Persons might invent, who, in my presence, have made noble Draughts of it, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their own pure Imaginations. I have seen as much of the Seraglio, as a Stranger could do, and I have seen it several times, in several Voyages, having had time enough to consider, the two first Courts, the Divan, and the Hall of Audience, but cannot ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate them much for any great Beauties I could find in them. There is, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, abundance of Marble and Porphyry in all the Appartments; but on the other side, all those Appartments are confusedly shuffled together; there is no regularity at all; most of the Rooms have but little light, and all the ornament of them consists in rich Tapistry lay'd all over the Floors thereof, and some Cushions of gold and silver Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kado, some whereof are embroider'd with Pearls. But taking things generally, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f the Walls and the Towers, which inclose the Seraglio, look more like a frightful Prison,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106224:282"/>
than a Royal Palace, the Appartments, whereof it consists, have not also that wealth, or pleasure, for which the Palaces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> are so highly celebrated, and they offer not any thing which may long entertain the sight of a curious Person. All that can make the Seraglio a pleasant place of abode, is, the advantage of its situation, and indeed a nobler cannot be imagin'd. For it looks towards the East, and takes up the upper part, and the descent of a sloping Hillock, from St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> quite to the Channel. The Buildings are upon the most eminent places, and have a prospect into the Gardens, which run along the descent, as also into the two Seas which meet at the point of the Seraglio, whence the Grand Seignor may at the same time see <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> in both which parts of the World, his Territories are very great. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Prison thought a pleasant place, and there are few in the Seraglio, who rather would live in a Hut, and have their liberty, than be continually confin'd in a Palace under such severe Discipline.</p>

                        <hi>The Regulations of the</hi> Infirmary <hi>of the Seraglio. The difficulties of getting Wine into it. The subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some people to be receiv'd into it, though they are not sick. An abominable vice, common all over the East. The fruitless endeavours us'd to check the course of it. The sacrilegious action of two</hi> Ichoglans. <hi>The Wood-piles of the Seraglio. The great advantages of those who have the charge thereof.

                     </p>
                     <p>OF the many Gates which give a Man entrance into the Seraglio, as well on the Sea-side, as on the Land-side, that towards S. <hi>Sophia</hi> is the greatest. That is alwaies open, the others not being so, but according to the Grand Seignor's pleasure. You first come to a great Portal, which has not any thing of magnificence, and where you only find certain golden Letters, and about them Feuillages and Compartiments, according to the <hi>Arabian</hi> way of Painting. That Gate is kept by Fifty <hi>Capigis,</hi> who have for their Armes, the Firelock, the Dart, and the Cymitar, and gives you entrance into the first Court of the Seraglio, which is Four hundred paces in length, and a hundred in breadth, without any paving.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106224:283"/>
On the right hand of that first Court, there runs all along a spacious structure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">The Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</note> several Appartments or Chambers, and serving for an Infirmary to the whole Seraglio. The Gate of it is kept by an Eunuch, who has under him a great many People, employ'd in attending on, and ministring to the sick, whom, answerably to their quality, they dispose into convenient quarters in that house, where they may be better assisted, then in those which their indisposition had oblig'd them to quit. The two principal Physitians, and the two principal Chirurgeons, whom they call <hi>Hequinz-bachi,</hi> and <hi>Geïrah-bachi,</hi> make their visits there every day, at certain hours. A man cannot imagine a place better order'd and regulated then that is: and the Grand Seignior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sometimes comes thither in person, to take an exact account of the Sick and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as also to enquire whether they are well treated, whether the Physitians visit them often, and whether every officer of the Infirmary perform the duty incumbent on him. There is seldom any place void in that House, for assoon as one is gone out, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes in: and though it be design'd only for such as are sick, yet several persons, who are well, are brought thither, under pretence of indisposition, or to enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a while, or to weather out some trouble or discontent. They continue there for the space of ten or twelve daies, and are diverted, according to their mode, with a wretched kind of vocal and instrumental Musick, which begins betimes in the morning, and holds on till night. The permission they have there to drink wine, which they never have elsewhere, is a greater inducement for their coming in thither, than the Musick. But that permission, which they would as 'twere conceale, and which the superstition of the <hi>Turks</hi> dares not publickly own, is accompany'd by a thousand difficulties. They are not permitted to bring in any wine in the sight of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who stands at the entrance of the place: and if any one should be surpriz'd in the doing of it, his punishment would be to receive three hundred bastinadoes, and a penalty of three hundred <hi>Aspers,</hi> to be paid to those from whom he had receiv'd them. But if he can cunningly get in with the Wine, not having been stopp'd at the Gate, assoon as he is got in, he runs no risque at all, and may drink of it without fear of any chastisement, though 'twere in the presence of the Grand Seignor.</p>
                     <p>The small quantity of wine which can be got in by this way, would signifie but <note place="margin">The difficulty of getting wine into the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary.</note> little among so many People, if there were not some other less difficult contrivances to supply them therewith. And this is one of them. The Infirmary adjoins to one side of the Gardens, from which it is separated only by a wall which is not very high; so that the <hi>Bostangis,</hi> who find that wine goes off at a good rate, and that they who are within the Seraglio know not how to spend their money, do, in the night time, by ropes convey over the wall, so many Borrachoes or bags of Buck-Skins, full of wine, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forty or fifty quarts, which some other persons of the Infirmary stand ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. This way brings in abundance of wine, but not without fear of being surpriz'd by the <hi>Bostangi-bachi,</hi> who goes the rounds every night.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the drinking of wine the main inducement which makes those counterfeit siek persons to seek out pretences, to go and pass away some daies in the Infirmary; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <note place="margin">The subtilty of some persons to be receiv'd in, though not sick.</note> that some have the lewd artifice to put themselves into a slight Feaver, which is presently remov'd. A detestable passion, and which is in a manner naturall to them, though it be against nature, makes them study all the imaginable waies to satisfie it. This proves a hard matter for the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> to do, while they are in their chambers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd and watch'd night and day by severe Overseers, who never pardon them the least misdemeanour.</p>
                     <p>For though the Grand Seignor be himself subject to the same passion, the very name whereof causes a horrour, yet he orders cruel punishments to be inflicted on those who shall presume to imitate him. He does what he can to prevent the mischief, which he would not have countenanc'd by his example, and imposes the prevention of it as a task upon the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> a vigilant sort of animals, whose Eyes are alwayes open. But in the Infirmary, all these precautions prove fruitless; the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> belonging to that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted partly by presents, partly by treats, or being made drunk with wine, or some other liquors, they bring in thither some young lads, of whom there is great store in the City of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The better to over-reach the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> they put those young lads into the habits of the <hi>Halvagis,</hi> and so the cheat succeeds, in regard they are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106224:283"/>
the attendants on the Officers of the Seraglio, and do all the errands they have to do in the City.</p>
                     <p>Of these <hi>Halvages,</hi> there is ordinarily to the number of six hundred, and they have only their cloathing and sustenance allow'd them, without any wages, till such time as they have serv'd thirteen or fourteen years. Their wages begin at the rate of two <hi>Aspers [per diem]</hi> and in time may rise to seven <hi>Aspers</hi> and a half: but they have other contingent Profits, and they know well enough, how to make their advantage of the Employments they are put upon. For whereas they only are the Persons who have the freedom of going and coming in and out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> they set double the price on every thing they buy. But their most cunsiderable gain proceeds from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous commerce of those young Lads, whom they bring in to their Masters, and whom they cunningly slip into the Infirmary, after they had put them into Habits like their own. They wear a white Cap, which rises up from the Crown of the Head, to a pretty height somewhat to the resemblance of a Sugar-loaf.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hasteler-Agasi,</hi> or chief Overseer of the Infirmary, is indeed continually at the <note place="margin">The fruitless en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours us'd to check its course.</note> Gate, with five or six other Eunuchs, and carefully observes whatever goes in, or comes out. But all that vigilence will not do the work; nay though he had a hundred eyes, yet were it impossible for him to discern those young Lads, amidst the great number of those <hi>Halvagis,</hi> and that the rather, for these reasons, that they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently chang'd, that some of them are made <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and that new ones are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in upon the advancement of the old ones to some other Employments. But if it should happen that the said Superintendent Eunuch should have any secret information of what's design'd, and seems as if he would make some noise about it, he is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeas'd with a silk Vest, or some other Present, and 'tis thence that he derives his greatest advantages. In fine, that brutish Passion is so ordinary amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Absminable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess over all the East.</note> and generally over all the Eastern parts, that notwithstanding all the endeavours that have been us'd to prevent the effects of it, they will hardly ever be able to do it. There happen'd a memorable Example of this in my time. Two Pages of the Chamber, <note place="margin">The Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous action of two Pages.</note> who could not have the convenience of executing their wicked design in the Seraglio, would needs aggravate their crime, by going into the Mosquey to satiate their bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. After Prayers were ended, they suffer'd all the people to go out, and having so well hid themselves that he who shut the doors could not perceive them, they fell to the doing of an action, whereof the very Idea causes horrour.</p>
                     <p>On the left hand of this first Court, there is a spacious Lodgement, answerable to <note place="margin">The Wood-Pi of the Straglio.</note> that of the Infirmary; and that's the habitation of the <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> persons design'd for the meanest Employments of the Seraglio. Within that Structure there is a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Court, where you shall find dispos'd in order, all about, and in the middle, so many Wood-piles, which are renew'd every year, and there are brought in thither above forty thousand Cart-loads of wood, every Cart-load being as much as two Oxen can draw. Some part of this wood comes in by the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and the rest out of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> and whereas there is a great quantity of it left every year, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the grand Seignor does not winter at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that remainder, which must be very considerable, is dispos'd of to the advantage of the principal persons among the <hi>Azamoglans.</hi> They are cunning enough to take their opportunity, when it is <note place="margin">The great profit of such as have the Charge thereof.</note> unloaden upon the Port, and computing, as well as they can, how much may go to make up the Piles, they proportionably send, what they think may be spar'd, to the City, and lodge it in the houses, where they are acquainted. Which they may do with so much the more security, in regard that no body minds what they do, and that they perform their duty, when the Piles are compleated, in the season, during which they are wont to make their Provisions. The wood they thus convert to their own use they are paid for, and the sum rais'd thereby is considerable for Persons of so mean a Quality.</p>
                     <p>On the same side as the Infirmary, and a little lower, (for the Seraglio is a rising <note place="margin">The Exercise of the <hi>Girit.</hi>
                        </note> ground for a certain space, and then there is an insensible descent on both sides, quite down to the point, whereby it is terminated) you discover the great Portal of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, which they call <hi>Bagge-Karpousi.</hi> From that Gate, which overlooks the foresaid
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106224:284"/>
descent, and where you are as it were upon an Eminency, you descend into a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Place, which the Grand Seignor causes to be always kept neat and even, where the Great Persons of the Court come to do the Exercises of the <hi>Girit,</hi> or the Dart, which is perform'd, most commonly, upon <hi>Fridays,</hi> immediately after their coming out of the Mosquey. There are about two hundred paces from the Portal to that place, and in the Court there may ordinarily be, upon those days above fifteen hundred Persons, yet so as that not any person whatsoever is permitted to go any further, unless he be call'd by the Order of the <hi>Girit-Bey,</hi> who is the chief Overseer, and Director of that Exercise. They who enter into the Lists, do many times amount to the number of a thousand Persons. If the Grand Seignor himself, who is present at those Exercises, the <note place="margin">The Grand Seignors libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> end whereof proves many times Tragical to those, by whom they are perform'd, has found any particular divertisement therein, especially when there are Limbs lost or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he orders every one to receive a Purse, which, as I told you, amount to five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns. The distribution of those Presents is greater or lesser, according to his being in a good or bad humour, and sometimes there are distributed at his departure thence, to the number of ten Purses. The Treasurer, who is always attending on him, and has ordinarily brought along with him fifteen or twenty thousand Ryals in Gold and Silver, stands ready, upon a beck, to obey his Orders.</p>
                     <p>But this is worth our observation, That when the Prince is ready to bestow his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, on those who had behav'd themselves valiantly in that exercise, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees <note place="margin">The counterfeit modesty of the Grandees of the Port.</note> of his Court, who had appear'd therein as well as others, purposely shift themselves out of the way, and leave him to make his Presents to other less considerable Persons, as being such as stand more in need of them than they do. This is their custom ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, whether it proceed from Generosity, or from a counterfeit and personated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, it matters not. And after the Grand Seignor is withdrawn, it is lawful for those who are left in the foresaid Court, and are skil'd in the handling of the Dart, to spend the remainder of the day in that Exercise. But those, how great soever their performances may be, and what wounds soever they may receive, are not to expect any Presents; There's no Prince to be a spectator of their Gallantry, nor Treasurer, to distribute his Liberalities. They only lay some wagers amongst themselves, and he who gives the fairest blow, wins, and the fairest blow is in the head, or face. There is ever and anon an Eye struck out, or a Cheek carried off, and that Solemnity proves very fatal in the end to some of them.</p>
                     <p>And this is an account of all that is observable in the said first Court, Let us now make our entrance into the second, and observe what is most remarkable in all its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments.</p>

                     <p>On both sides of that Court there runs a very noble Gallery, the pillars whereof are of marble, all along which the Companies of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are drawn up, and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, <note place="margin">The Janizaries well order'd.</note> when the Grand Seignor orders them to shew their activity, and to appear well arm'd, at the arrival of some Ambassador, who is to have Audience.</p>
                     <p>On the right hand, behind the Gallery, where the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are drawn up, on the <hi>Divan-</hi>dayes [that is to say, upon Council-dayes] are the Kitchins, and the Offices of the Seraglio, distinct one from the other, and every one serv'd by its peculiar Officers. Heretofore there were nine of them, but now that number is reduc'd to seaven. Every Office or Kitchin, has its chief Director, or Master-Cook, and there is a Superintendent above them all, named the <hi>Akegi-bachi,</hi> who has the command over four hundred Cooks.</p>
                     <p>The chiefest of these Kitchins, which is for the Grand Seignior himself is called <hi>Hasmoutbak.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The number of the Kitchins.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second is called <hi>Valede-Sultanum-Moutbaki,</hi> and is design'd for the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> as for instance, the Mother, the Wife, or, to say better, the Princess, for whom the Grand Seignor has the greatest kindness, and who had the happiness to bring into the World a Successor to the Empire, as also for his Sisters and Daughters.</p>
                     <p>The third Kitchin, which they call <hi>Kisler-Agazinum-Moutbaki</hi> is appointed for the Overseer of the Appartment of the Women, and the other Negro-Eunuchs who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about the guarding of them.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is for the <hi>Capou-Agasi,</hi> or Grand Master of the Seraglio, who has the greatest access to the Grand Seignor's Person, and whose Charge (as I said elsewhere) generally extends over whatever enters into the Palace. And this Kitchin serves also for the Officers of the <hi>Divan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth is for the <hi>Chasnadarbachi,</hi> or the chief Person concern'd about the Treasury, and for those who are under his jurisdiction, and obey his Orders.</p>
                     <p>The sixth is for the <hi>Kilargibachi,</hi> or principal Cup-bearer, and those who have their dependance upon him.</p>
                     <p>The seaventh and last, is that of the <hi>Sarai-Agasi,</hi> and of all the Officers, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as for the <hi>Bostangis,</hi> whose work lies in the Gardens, they dress their Meat themselves, and appoint some among them to execute that Office, and they provide the Commons for all the rest. There are also some of these <hi>Bostangis</hi> employ'd in the Offices design'd for the Grand Seignor.</p>
                     <p>There enters no Beef into the Kitchins of the Seraglio: but the ordinary consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The ordinary meats serv'd up in the Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</note> of every day, including all, as well those who eat within, as without, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to Five Hundred Sheep, in which number must be comprehended Lambs and Kids; and the greatest part of those Sheep, are brought from the Frontiers of <hi>Persia;</hi> which Country excels all others, as to that creature. According to this proportion of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106224:285"/>
Mutton, may be computed the quantity of Pullets, Chickens, and young Pidgeons, the number whereof is limited, according to the Seasons; as also what may be consum'd in Rice, and Butter, for the <hi>Pilau,</hi> which is accounted the best dish in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and all over the East. Those Nations, who are lovers of Temperance, and do not much stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the satisfaction of the palate, seldom have any other dish: and that not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, some haply will give me thanks, for communicating the ordering of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> and generally all the Inhabitants of the Eastern parts, make the <hi>Pilau,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lau.</hi>
                        </note> after this manner. According to the quality of the persons who are to be entertain'd, and the quantity which is to be made of it, you take either a piece of Mutton alone, or together with that some Pullets or Pidgeons, which are to be boyl'd in a pot, till they are half done, or somewhat more. When you think them so far boyl'd, then pour out both meat and broath into a Basin, and the Pot being wash'd, put it on the fire again with Butter in it, which they suffer to melt, till such time as it is very hot. Then they chop the meat, which had been but half-boyl'd into little pieces, the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets into quarters, and the Pidgeons into halves, and so they cast it into the Butter, they fricass it, till it be of a very brown colour. The Rice being well wash'd, they put some into the Pot over the meat, as much as they think fitting, and the broath, which had been pour'd into the Basin, they also put it into the Pot, Ladle-ful after La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ful, over the Rice, till such time as it stands two fingers breadth above it. Then is the Pot immediately cover'd, there is a clear fire made under it, and they ever and anon take out some grains of the Rice, to see if it be softned, as also whether it be requisite to put in some more of the broath, to compleat the stewing of it. For it is not like the Rice brought into our parts, which presently breaks asunder, but their Rice is of such a kind, that is must be fully boyl'd, and yet the Grain entire, as well as the whole Pepper, wherewith they season it. As soon as it is come to that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they cover the Pot with a cloath three or four times doubled, and set the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid upon that, and some time after, they make another melting of Butter, till it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry red; to be cast into the holes, which are made in the Rice, with the handle of the Ladle, after which they cover it again of a sudden, and so let it stand soaking awhile, and then serve it up. It is put into large Dishes, with the meat handsomly dispos'd upon it, and some part will be white, that is, continu'd in its natural colour, some part, yellow, occasion'd by a little mixture of Saffron, and a third part of a Carnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-colour, done by the tincture of the juyce of Pomegranate. Nay, though the meat be as fat as is requisite for the ordering of this Dish, yet to make the <hi>Pilau</hi> more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and palatable to them, they bestow three pounds of Butter on six pounds of Rice, which makes it so extraordinary fat, that it disgusts, and is nauseous to those who are not accustom'd thereto, and accordingly would rather have the Rice it self simply boyl'd with water and salt. There are always two or three Dishes serv'd up after that manner, to the Grandees of the Port, who, for the most part, keep open Table, and instead of flesh, they cover them with a great Aumelet or Omelet, made with good Herbs, and about three fingers thick, or with some poach'd Eggs, which are neatly dispos'd all about it. A man is never incommodated by this kind of Rice, but the other, which is too fat, is not fit for those who drink wine, and will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in them a desire to eat of it often.</p>
                     <p>Since I have given you an account how they order the <hi>Pilau,</hi> I cannot forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">A particular way of roasting in the <hi>Levant.</hi>
                        </note> you a further discovery of the <hi>Turks</hi> management of the Kitchin, and telling you how they roast their meat. The greater sort of meat, as sheep and Lambs are roasted whole, in Ovens made in the Floor, wherein they hang them by the heads, and they are taken out thence as it were brown-bak'd, and Cook'd well enough, so as to excite appetite. At the bottom of the Oven there is ordinarily a Basin plac'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in it some Rice and fair Water, which receives the drippings of the Beast, the very Tayl it self, which sometimes weighs fifteen or twenty pound, yielding a good quantity thereof, as being in a manner all fat. The Tayls of the Lambs, having not so much fat, are excellent meat, and in a manner as delicate as the Sweet-breads of Veal. These Lambs being thus roasted, are always serv'd up with Rice under them; and for the greater Tables, they serve up two of them in a Dish. So that there is no use of Spits in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Kitchins, but what is for Poultry, or Fowl, which they order so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106224:286"/>
untowardly, that when they are brought up to the Table, they appear so mangled and disorder'd, that it is no easie matter to distinguish the head from the feet. But it is to be observ'd, that the <hi>Pilau,</hi> and all sorts of Flesh-meat are not serv'd up, but only at Supper, about five of the Clock in the Evening; and that in the morning, those of better Quality eat only Sallets, Herbs, Fruits, and Conserves; the meaner sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple contenting themselves with meats made of Milk, Melons, and Cucumbers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Season.</p>
                     <p>As for Fish, the <hi>Turks</hi> care not much for it, and though the Seas and Rivers are well replenish'd therewith, yet they seldom eat of them. It seldom happens also, that any Venizon or Wild-Fowl comes into their houses, as being a kind of meat they do not any way relish. But above all meats they have an aversion for the Hare; which observation I made also in the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who are of a perswasion, that the Female <note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> have an aversion for the Hare.</note> of that Creature has its monthly courses regularly, as the Woman hath. It is easily perceivable, by what account I have given, that there is no great variety or delicacy in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Entertainments, and that the <hi>French</hi> and other <hi>Europaeans</hi> would not think themselves well treated thereat. But, however, their Kitchins are kept very neat, they have all the accommodations requisite for their way of dressing, and whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Dishes and other Vessels they use, or the meat it self, there is as much clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness as can be expected.</p>
                     <p>The Officers where the Conserves and Sweet-meats are made (there being six or <note place="margin">Conserves.</note> seven of them) are above the Kitchins, and serv'd by four hundred <hi>Halvagis,</hi> who were establish'd by Sultan <hi>Solyman,</hi> a magnificent Prince, who also regulated all the Offices and Officers of the Seraglio. They are perpetually at work in those seven Offices, and there they prepare all sorts of Conserves, dry and liquid, and several sorts of Syrups, as also several kinds of <hi>Turchi,</hi> which are Fruits preserv'd in Vinegar and Salt, into which, they put a quantity of fragrant Herbs, such as Rosemary, Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, and Sage.</p>
                     <p>In the same Offices they also prepare the ordinary drink of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which they call <hi>Sherbet,</hi> and it is made several ways. That which is most common in <hi>Turkey</hi> comes <note place="margin">Several compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of <hi>Sherbet.</hi>
                        </note> somewhat near our <hi>Lemonade,</hi> but there is very little water in it; 'tis in a manner all juyce of Lemmon, or Citron, having an intermixture of Sugar, Amber, and Musk. They make another sort of it, which is highly in esteem, and that is made with the water distill'd from the flower of a Plant, which grows in Pools and Rivers, and has the figure of a Horse-shooe. These flowers are yellow, and called <hi>Nuloufer.</hi> But the <hi>Sherbet</hi> which they most esteem, and which is drunk by the Grand Seignor himself, as also by the Bassa's and other Grandees of the Port, is made of Violets and Sugar, and there is but little juyce of Citron put into it. They make also another sort of drink, which they call <hi>Magion,</hi> compos'd of several Drugs, whereby it is made hot: and there is another sort purposely prepar'd for the Grand Seignor himself, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Muscavi,</hi> of which he takes a Dose, when he intends to visit the <hi>Sultanesses.</hi> The principal Persons about the Court send for it secretly to the <hi>Halvagibachi,</hi> who does not deny them, as being a great advantage to him, because he is well paid for it. Nor do they want Snow and Ice, to cool all those Liquors, and the <hi>Turks</hi> are much more humorous and delicate in their drinks, than they are in their Meat.</p>
                     <p>At a place ten or twelve paces distant, and opposite to these Offices, is the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, <note place="margin">Receptacles for the Waters of the Seraglio.</note> or Reservatory, which distributes all the Waters of the Seraglio, and they are thence directed to every Quarter, into the places where there is a necessity of them. One of the <hi>Baltagis</hi> has his station there all the day long, to give Water as he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. And when the Grand Seignor passes from one Quarter to another, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of that, where he is in person, plays continually during his abode there, by a Signal which is given to the <hi>Baltagi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the left hand, in the same Court, and opposite to the Kitchins, may be seen the Grand Seignor's little Stables, which do not hold above twenty five or thirty <note place="margin">The little Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> choice Horses, design'd for his Exercises with his Favourites, and above the Stables, in great Rooms, they keep the Saddles, Bridles, Housses, Trappings, Foot-cloaths, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106224:286"/>
Stirrops, which are of inestimable value, by reason of the abundance of precious Stones, whereby they are enrich'd. There are some Harnesses which amount to a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Livers, <hi>French</hi> Money. The great Stables stand all along the Canal, which beats against the Walls of the Seraglio. They are always well replenish'd, and in good order, and they take care, that there be not so much as one vacant place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In those Stables does the Grand Seignor keep a great number of Horses of value, to be reserv'd for the War, or to be us'd in some Magnificent Solemnity, that Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers may see the Splendor of his Court.</p>

'Tis a great low Hall, cover'd with Lead, and wainscoted and gilt in some places within, from which it derives a little Ornament. The Floor of it is cover'd with a great Carpet, and there are some Benches for the Officers, of whom that Council consists, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Divan.</hi> There are, as I told you, Galleries of all the sides of that Court, which makes it look as it were
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106224:287"/>
like a Cloister; and 'tis under that Gallery which is on the right hand, that the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> have their station, while the <hi>Divan</hi> is sitting.</p>
                     <p>The Council sits, ordinarily, four days in the week, which days are answerable to <note place="margin">Council-days.</note> the <hi>Saturday, Sunday, Munday,</hi> and <hi>Tuesday</hi> of the <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Justice is there exactly administred to any one that desires it, and for what cause <note place="margin">Causes soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</note> soever it be, so, as that the differing Parties have no need either of Proctors or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates names not known in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the Persons concern'd are to lay open their Cases themselves. There is no talk of delays, or putting off from one time to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; people shall not languish in expectation, but the business is decided immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what nature soever it may be of.</p>
                     <p>Though this Custom be very commendable, yet can it not be so well practis'd <note place="margin">The Reasons of that Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Justice.</note> amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> because they stand upon the property of what they have, and that is deriv'd by Inheritance from some to others, and the litigious partitions of them do many times engage the Proprietors thereof in long Suits of Law. 'Tis quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise amongst the Great Officers of the Port, who are all Slaves, either taken in War, or sent up, as Presents, by the Bassa's, and Governours of Provinces. All their Estates, when they die, return to the Grand Seignor, from whom they had receiv'd them, so that it is a perpetual Circulation: and their Children, as I told you in the beginning of this Discourse, are brought up to the Seraglio, to be educated there, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of ever succeeding their Parents, either in their Estates, or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchy has always observ'd this subtle Policy, not to permit that any Family should aggrandize it self, and be powerful from Father to Son: but they bring it down, as soon as they have rais'd it up, and timely enough deprive them of the means whereby they might create Factions, to the disturbance of the State. Thence it comes, that, besides the Royal Family of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> they know not what Gentility, and antiquity of Extraction means; there's no emulation upon that score, and Charges and Dignities are bestow'd answerably to the Merit of the Person, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration of his Extraction. Nay, it sometimes happens, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ministers of the Empire, are the Sons of Cow-keepers, as was one <hi>Rustan,</hi> a Grand Vizir, who made so much noise under the Reign of <hi>Solyman.</hi> And so, being not any way oblig'd to their birth, they acknowledge their Fortunes to be the reward of their Education.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the administration of Justice amongst the <hi>Turks.</hi> Those who make the Law their profession, and are look'd upon as the Clergy of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> leave no place for suits at Law; every one knows his priviledges, and what belongs to the function of his Charge, and there arise no differences among them, because all things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well regulated.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the people are ignorant what pleading signifies. There's no occasion for publick Notaries, in order to Matrimonial contracts; There's no great sums given with a daughter, and the jewels and cloaths which she can get out of her Fathers house, are all the portion she brings to her Husband. And this, in few words, is the reason that the <hi>Turks</hi> can put an expeditious end to all their affairs, without giving any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to that pettifogging, which, among Christians, proves the ruine of so many People.</p>
                     <p>The Officers, who sit in the <hi>Divaen</hi> are, first, the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> the Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the whole Empire, who is President of it, and represents the Grand Seignor's Person; Then the six other <hi>Vizirs;</hi> Then the <hi>Cadilesquers</hi> of <hi>Romania</hi> and <hi>Natolia,</hi> who are the Judges and Intendants of the Armies; Then the three <hi>Tefterdars,</hi> or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers-General; Then the <hi>Nissangibacha,</hi> the Lord Chancellour; And the <hi>Netangi,</hi> who is as 'twere the Secretary of State, with some Clerks, or Notaries. All these Officers come into the <hi>Divan-</hi>Hall, at four in the Morning, and continue there till noon, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Justice. The <hi>Chiaoux-bachi</hi> has his station at the Gate, with a troop of those that are under his charge, to execute the Grand <hi>Vizir's</hi> Orders, and has a silver-rod in his hand, as a badge of his Authority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106224:287"/>
On those dayes that the <hi>Divan</hi> sits, the Officers are entertain'd at dinner in the same <note place="margin">The care taken to prevent the revolt of the <hi>Janizaries.</hi>
                        </note> Hall, which is done with much sobriety, and little Ceremony. All is over and taken away, in half an hours time. The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> eats alone, unless he call a <hi>Bassa</hi> or two, to keep him company. There are carried also messes of <hi>Chourba,</hi> which is a kind of pottage made with Rice, for the dinners of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are in their stations, under the Galleries. But if it happen, that they are in a mutinous humour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd against a <hi>Vizir,</hi> or against the Grand Seignor himself, not one of them will put his hand to the <hi>Chourba,</hi> but they scornfully thrust back the dishes, and by that action discover their discontent.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor is presently advertis'd of it, and sends to them the <hi>Capou-Agasi,</hi> Grand Master of the Seraglio, to know what their pleasure is, and what they desire. Then they depute one of their own Body to go, and speak on the behalf of them all; and that person whispering the <hi>Capou-Agasi</hi> in the Ear, declares to him the occasion of their discontent. That Eunuch presently carries it to the Grand Seignor; And if they have a peek against a <hi>Vizir,</hi> or a <hi>Cadilesquer,</hi> or sometimes against their <hi>Aga,</hi> or Colonel, it often happens that to appease those mutineers, the Grand Seignor orders them to be strangled, and sends them their heads.</p>
                     <p>Sunday and Tuesday are the principal dayes of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and then it is properly a <note place="margin">How the Grand Seignor is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi>
                        </note> Council of State, and of publick affairs. The Grand Seignor most commonly assists at it, but is not seen; and that keeps in awe as well the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> as the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. He can come thither from his own Appartment, through a close Gallery, and seat himself at a window, which looks into the <hi>Divan-</hi>Hall, and has alwayes a velvet Curtain before it, which he draws when he pleases, and especially when he perceives that they have not done Justice. I shall produce here, an example, famous enough as to that particular, which happen'd in the Reign of Sultan <hi>Achmet,</hi> the Father of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> and one of the justest Princes, that ever the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire had.</p>
                     <p>The Reader is to call to mind, what I said at the beginning, concerning the <hi>Timar-Spahi,</hi> on whom they bestow, during their lives, the Government and revenue of <note place="margin">The bold action of a <hi>Timer-Spahi,</hi> who kills a Grand Vizir, and is pardon'd.</note> some Town, according as they have deserv'd by their Services. The <hi>Spahi,</hi> whose story I am going to relate, had a <hi>Timar,</hi> between <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Damas,</hi> which might bring him in a revenue of fifteen hundred Crowns. The Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> either out of some aversion to the <hi>Spahi,</hi> or upon some false reports which had been made of him, and which he had been too forward to believe, without taking an exact information of things, took away from him the <hi>Timar,</hi> whereof he was possess'd, and bestow'd it on one of his own Creatures.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spahi,</hi> finding himself so unjustly dispossess'd comes to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> enters into the <hi>Divan,</hi> and presents a Petition to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> wherein he remonstrates to him his long Services, and how he never was chargeable with any negligence of his duty. The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> having read it, tears it in his presence, which was to signifie as much, as that he would not answer it, and that there was nothing for the <hi>Spahi</hi> to hope for. The Petitioner withdrew, without saying any thing: but some days afterwards, he returns to the <hi>Divan,</hi> and presents a second Petition, which the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise tears, as he had done the former, without making any answer thereto. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this second injury, the <hi>Spahi,</hi> full of fury, and justly exasperated, draws his Poniard, falls upon the <hi>Vizir,</hi> and kills him.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor, who was then at the Window, having observ'd that action, draws the Curtain, and with a loud voice commanded that no hurt should be offer'd to the person who had done it. He thereupon orders the <hi>Spahi</hi> to approach, and ask'd him the Reason of his having demean'd himself with so much violence. The other much asham'd, humbly makes answer, but with resolution enough, That he could not forbear doing what he had done, upon the sight of so great a piece of Injustice: and thereupon presenting to him the Petition, which had been torn to pieces; the Grand Seignor caus'd it to be read, and patiently hearkned to the just complaints which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. Having fully examin'd the Affair, his Highness commended the <hi>Spahi</hi> for the Action he had done, using the word <hi>Aferim,</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>'Tis well
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106224:288"/>
done,</hi> and which is ordinary in that Language, when they approve a thing; and thereupon, there was an additional Liberality made by the Grand Seignor to the Command which he gave, that he should be re-established in his <hi>Timar.</hi> He thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took occasion to speak to the other <hi>Vizirs,</hi> and to tell them, That that Example should teach them to do just things, and not to suffer themselves to be so blinded by favour, as not to observe Equity. The violent action of the <hi>Spabi</hi> is certainly not to be approv'd, though the injustice of the <hi>Vizir</hi> was manifest: but the procedure of the Grand Seignor, cannot be look'd on otherwise then as most commendable, and a great Model of perfect Equity.</p>
                     <p>I shall not think it much, to produce here a second Example of the exact Justice, which the Grand Seignor would have administred to the People: and in this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there is something that is signally remarkable. A great Stone-Mortar, which may be seen at the Gate of the <hi>Divan,</hi> serves for a Monumental confirmation of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and whereas it is accompany'd by many circumstances worthy our observation, I think my self oblig'd not to conceal them from the Reader.</p>
                     <p>In the Reign of Sultan <hi>Amurat,</hi> a certain private Person finding himself without <note place="margin">How Sultan <hi>Amurat</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a secret breach of trust.</note> Wife or Children, resolv'd to undertake the Pilgrimage of <hi>Mecha.</hi> Before his departure, he conceiv'd, that he could not better dispose what he left behind him that was most valuable, then by putting it into the hands of a <hi>Hoggia,</hi> a Doctor of the Law. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon left in his custody certain Jewels, in a little bag, intreating him to keep them till he return'd, and declaring him his Heir, in case he dy'd in his Pilgrimage. It was the Pilgrim's fortune to return safely from <hi>Mecha,</hi> and making no question but to get what he had entrusted the <hi>Hoggia</hi> withal, calls for what he had deposited in his hands. The other makes him a very cold answer, telling him, That he knew not what he meant, leaving him very much surpriz'd at so unexpected an account of his concerns. The Pilgrim, smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his discontent, and reflecting, that the thing had been done without witnesses, did nothing for some days; but, afterwards, he Presents a Petition to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> and acquaints him how all things had pass'd between him and the Doctor. The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> perceiving there was a great nicety in that affair, and that the Doctor might easily deny a thing which had been transacted without witnesses, bid the Pilgrim have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience awhile, and that he would give the Grand Seignor an account of it; which he accordingly did.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor Commands the <hi>Vizir</hi> to be very circumspect in the management of that Affair, as being very desirous to sift out the truth of it, and orders him to send for the Doctor, to make protestations of friendship to him, and to put him in hopes of being employ'd in things of great importance. Some days pass on, while the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> minds what Game he had to play. At length, he sends for the Doctor, he commends his Ingenuity, and his Conduct; and so putting him into very fair hopes, he promises him to prevail so far with the Grand Seignor, as that he should have the honour to kiss his hands, since it was not just, that so transcendent a Wit as he should be any longer unknown to his Highness. The Doctor overjoy'd at that discourse, thought himself the happiest man in the World, especially when he saw, that the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> had made him his <hi>Hougia,</hi> which is as much as to say, his Almoner. The <hi>Vizir</hi> proceeds, and according to the secret Orders he had receiv'd from the Grand Seignor, gives the Doctor another Employment, which was, that he should bring him in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all the Criminal Affairs which could be presented. The Grand Seignor, upon the Report of the <hi>Hougia,</hi> ask'd him his advice, and what punishment the guilty Person deserv'd for the Crime whereof he was convinc'd, the execution being to be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgment which the Doctor had pass'd, whom he made his ordinary Reader, and would have near his Person.</p>
                     <p>Five or six months pass on in this manner, ere there could be any discovery made of the falsify'd Trust. And it is to be observ'd, That the Pilgrim had given the Grand Seignor an exact Inventory of all the several things, which he had put into the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bag. Among other things, there was particular mention made of a <hi>Tesbuch</hi> of fine Coral. This <hi>Tesbuch</hi> is a kind of Chappelet, or String of Beads, consisting of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106224:288"/>
and nine beads, upon each of which, the <hi>Turks</hi> repeat certain words taken out of some sentences of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> That Chapelet is divided into three parts, from thirty three, to thirty three beads, by a little string, which separates them: and at the end, there hang'd a long piece of Corral, next to which there was another round bead, of the same material, of an extraordinary bigness.</p>
                     <p>The more Puritanical sort of <hi>Turks</hi> have their Beads in their hands when they are upon visits, and especially when they approach great Persons, and that very thing made the first discovery of the <hi>Hoggia</hi>'s theft, and breach of trust. One day, coming into the Seraglio with his Coral-beads in his hand, the Grand Seignor, before whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himself, casting his eyes upon them, and presently imagining, that it might well be the Pilgrim's <hi>Tesbuch,</hi> according to the description he had given of it in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of what things were left in the little bag, told the Doctor, that he had a great rarity there. The other immediately approaches him, and intreats his Highness with all submission to accept of it. The Grand Seignor takes it, and making some discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries how acceptable that Present was to him, does, by that prudent dissimulation, cause a joy in him, whose chastisement he was then contriving.</p>
                     <p>But that single indicium the Grand Seignor does not think enough, but he will have other discoveries; and knowing that among other things that were in the bag, there was a Ring, the work of an excellent and an ancient Master, famous for that sort of Rings, which the <hi>Turks</hi> wear on the Thumb, when they shoot with the Long-bowe, he expects a second occasion, in order to a fuller discovery of the Cheat, and the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute conviction of the Doctor.</p>
                     <p>'Twas not many dayes ere that happen'd, by the contrivance of the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who calling for one of his Pages, one well skill'd in Archery, went to the place of the <hi>Girit,</hi> where he also call'd for a Bowe, there being not any person in the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire but was inferiour to him, as to strength and dexterity in the Exercises of the Bowe and the Dart. When he came to bend the Bowe, he complain'd that the Ring hurt his Thumb, presuming that the Doctor, who stood neer him, and had already presented him with the Coral-Beads, would also make him a proffer of the Ring, which he had of the Pilgrim's. It is possible, saies the Grand Seignor, that there is not at this time any Master living who can make a Ring any thing like such a one, whom he nam'd? The Doctor, whose apprehension was not so good, as to see that this trap was laid for his destruction, and thinking to insinuate himself more and more into the Grand Seignor's favour, told him T, hat, by good Fortune he had a Ring of that very Master's work, which he had kept a long time, and that if his Highness would be pleas'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, he would bring it thither, which he presently did.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as the Grand Seignor was return'd to his own Quarter, he sent for the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> and the Pilgrim, who came into his presence, and he had in his hand the Chapelet of Corral, which he made as if he were repeating, to try whether the Pilgrim would know it again. The other having well observ'd it, address'd himself to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, saying, If it shall please your Highness to permit me to open my mouth, I dare affirm, that the Chapelet, you have in your hands, is very like that, which was in my little bag of Jewels, and possibly I shall not be mistaken, if I say it is the very same. Whereupon the Grand Seignor commands him to come nearer, and putting the Chape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and the Ring into his hands, the Pilgrim affirms, upon his life, that they are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same things, which he had left in the custody of the Doctor. He coming the next morning, according to his custom to make a report of some criminal cause to the Grand Seignor, that Prince, who was a person of great ingenuity and apprehension, proposes to him a case somewhat of the same nature with that between him and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, and ask'd him what punishment such a crime deserv'd. The unfortunate man, blinded by a good fortune wherein he thought himself already well establish'd, and what was past being clearly got out of his remembrance, pronounc'd sentence against himself, and answers the Grand Seignor, That such a person, deserv'd to be pounded alive in a Mortar.</p>
                     <p>Upon that sentence, the Emperour caus'd him to be immediately secur'd, and having <note place="margin">A severe, but just Punishment.</note>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106224:289"/>
order'd all his chests to be brought into the Seraglio, by the <hi>Baltagis,</hi> whom he sent to his Lodgings, pulls out of his pocket the Chapelet of Coral, and the Ring, which he shewes him, and told him, that those two pieces were taken out of a little bag, which a Pilgrim of <hi>Mecha</hi> had entrusted him with the custody of. He afterwards shews him the note or schedule of all the other pieces, and commanding him to open his Chests, the Jewels were there found, which that unhappy man, convinc'd of his guilt, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for fear, deliver'd up into the hands of the Grand Seignor. The Pilgrim was call'd, and presently knew his bag, and his Jewels; and the Doctor, by an open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fussion, acknowledg'd his crime, and perfidiousness.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the Emperour order'd the <hi>Divan</hi> to be Assembled, at which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that all the Grandees about <hi>Constantinople</hi> should be present, to render the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the more solemn. He first commanded, that whatever belong'd to the Pilgrim should be restor'd to him, together with some additional recompence: and his next command was, That the Doctor should be punish'd, according to his own Sentence. To that end, order was given, that a stone should be made hollow, after the form of a Mortar, into which he was thrown stark naked, and pounded alive by the common Executioners. And that is the same Stone-Mortar, which I have often seen near the Gate of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and is left there, for a Memorial of so admirable and so solemn a Judgment. And this was the period of a History, whereof all the circumstances are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and which is not one of the least Monuments of the Wisdom of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Amurat.</hi> That Prince, instead of using his absolute power at the first overture of such an Affair, thought it fitter, by a perspicacity of mind and prudence, patiently to expect remote occasions, that he might thence deduce evident proofs of a conceal'd crime: and his intention was to raise the Doctor to great dignities if he had found him innocent; and to punish him severely, as he did, upon the discovery of his guilt.</p>
                     <p>I told you at the beginning of this Chapter, that of the four dayes of the Week, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">At what time, how, the Grand Seignor rids out of the way, those, whom he suspects.</note> for the sitting of the <hi>Divan,</hi> those which are answerable to our Sunday and Tuesday are the principal, as being those on which the Affairs of greatest importance are debated. They call those two dayes <hi>Arzghiunz,</hi> in regard, that after the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> the six other <hi>Vizirs,</hi> and the two <hi>Cadilesquers,</hi> who assist at the <hi>Divan,</hi> have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred Justice, they go all together to kiss the Grand Seignor's hands. If any one of those Nine Judges have ought to say to him, he is permitted, on those dayes, to speak to him freely: and it is ordinarily upon those dayes also, that the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor takes his time, if he has a mind to take off any one. He then orders the <hi>Bostangi-Bachi</hi> to be ready, with some of those who attend him, to execute his will; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declar'd to him who they are, whom he would have strangled, the order is no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given, but that either at their arrival, or at their departure, it is punctually obey'd. True it is, that he does not demean himself so, but when he is afraid of some popular sedition, in case he should send to punish them in their own Houses, where they might make some resistance. But within the Seraglio, and in sight of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are in their stations near the <hi>Divan,</hi> the unfortunate Person, whom they would have to be strangled, has no more to do then to bow down his Head, and to stretch out his Neck, without thinking of any resistance, which would be to no purpose. In the Eleventh Chapter, I shall give an account at large, how they proceed to that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                     <p>A little beyond the Hall of the <hi>Divan,</hi> you come to another Hall, rais'd up after the <note place="margin">The days on which Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors come to the <hi>Divan.</hi>
                        </note> manner of a Balcony, where the Ambassadors are seated, when they assist at the <hi>Divan,</hi> and that they do, once in three months, and upon the dayes, that the <hi>Janizaries</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their pay. There is notice sent them to be there, out of a vain ostentation, that they may see, what abundance of money goes out of the Treasury. Between these two Halls there is a Gate, which leads to the Quarter of the <hi>Baltagis.</hi> Those are a sort of strong and robust People, employ'd, as I told you, in carrying of Wood all about the Seraglio, and other mean and painful Offices. As to the wood, which is burnt in the Appartments of the Women, they disburthen themselves of it at the door, where the Negro-Eunuchs take it up, and carry it into the Baths and other rooms, into which they only are permitted to go. And this is all that's considerable in that second Court. Let us now enter further into the Seraglio, and see how things are manag'd there.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THE inner Seraglio is that part of the great Palace of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, which, from the Second Court, whereof we have given a description, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the point, at which place the Gardens are terminated, and which comprehends, in general, the Grand Seignors Quarter, and the Quarter of the Sultanesses. But in regard the former is distinguish'd into several Appartments, appointed for the Habitations of the Officers, who ordinarily approach the Grand Seignor's Person, and are his most necessary attendants, I will conduct the Reader from one to another, and give a distinct relation of every one of them. In this Chapter, I shall treat only of those Appartments which are taken up by the <hi>Eunuchs;</hi> and the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> who are under their Discipline.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of this Discourse, I made mention of the four principal <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who have others substitute to them, to observe the actions of those young Lads, who <note place="margin">The <hi>Ichoglans</hi> kept under a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere discipline.</note> are committed to their charge, and to instruct them, as well in the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as in the Exercises of the Body, and particularly, as to what relates to the Grand Seignor's Service. The Quarter, as well of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> as the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> stands next to the <hi>Divan-</hi>Hall, and begins to make part of the third Court, all along which it reaches on the left hand. It is divided into several Appartments, and among others, there are four, which they call <hi>Oda</hi>'s, that is to say Chambers, into which are distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted six hundred <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> according to the orders of the <hi>Capi-Aga;</hi> who, with the other principal <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> judges of every ones capacity. 'Tis the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> also, who orders their passing out of one <hi>Oda</hi> into another, as we remove our Scholars from a sixth form to a fifth; and the case is the same in their <hi>Oda</hi>'s as in our Forms, or Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, ths first of the four <hi>Oda's,</hi> the severities whereof they must weather out as well as they can, being the last in point of dignity. When he makes his general Visitation, upon which follows the foresaid promotion, he turns out of the Seraglio, all those whom he thinks uncapable of doing their Prince good Service, and that such as betray their disgust of so austere a life; and then they are put out of all hopes of ever entring into the Seraglio any more, and cannot pretend to any other Fortune, then that of <hi>Spahis,</hi> with a small pay. The advantage of capacitating themselves for the most eminent Charges of the Court and the Empire, makes those who remain behind to take the greater courage, and accordingly they patiently suffer, for the space of many years, the harsh and unmerciful treatments of the Eunuchs, whom, upon all occasions, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find very liberal of the Bastinado.</p>
                     <p>They are those <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> whom we may also call the Grand Seignor's Pages, who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106224:290"/>
are advanc'd to the dignity of <hi>Bassa's, Beys, Capigi-bachis, Haznadar-Bachis,</hi> and the other great Offices of the Port. But they are particularly cull'd out of the number of the Tributary Children, who are taken away from the Christians, or taken in War, by <note place="margin">The wretched condition of the Bassa's Children.</note> Sea or Land. For, as to the <hi>Beiczades,</hi> or Children of <hi>Bassa's,</hi> whom they bring up in the Seraglio, you are to remember what I have already said, that they can never ascend higher, than to the Charges of <hi>Beys,</hi> or Captains of Galleys.</p>
                     <p>When any one of these <hi>Ichoglans</hi> is desirous to remove out of the Seraglio, or if any one of the white Eunuchs has the same desire, he presents a Petition to the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who carries it to the Grand Seignor, he receives his dismission, and is allow'd a certain Pay, proportionably to the continuance and quality of his Services. But there are others, whom the same <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> turns out of the Seraglio against their wills, and that after they had weather'd out the first years, which are the most insupportable. And that is done sometimes upon this score, that the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> having had some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with any one of those <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> while they were Camerades in the time of their youth, and fearing lest he should come one day to traverse his designs, he employs all his credit and interest, to remove him out of the Seraglio, but withal procuring him a Recompence and Salary, according to the number of years he has serv'd.</p>
                     <p>The first of the four Chambers, into which the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> are distributed, has the greatest number of them, because they are yet very young, and as it were Novices, <note place="margin">The Classes through which the Lads brought into the Seraglio are to pass.</note> under the first <hi>Perula:</hi> and it is called the <hi>Couchouk-Oda,</hi> that is to say, the little Chamber, though it be the largest of them all, in regard it is the lowest in point of Dignity. There they are taught to read and write, and are initiated in the first grounds of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law. And after they have spent six years in that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they are remov'd into the second, which they call <hi>Quilar-Oda,</hi> wherein being grown more robust, they are instructed in the Exercises of the Body, in shooting with the Bowe, using the Lance and other divertisements of that kind. They are more perfected in the speaking of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, whereto they also adde the <hi>Arabian,</hi> and the <hi>Persian,</hi> which they shall have occasion to use, in the Governments whereto they may be sent.</p>
                     <p>There are four years spent in this second Chamber, out of which they are again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd into the third, which they call <hi>Chasnadar-Oda,</hi> or the Chamber of the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In this Chamber, they begin to do the Grand Seignor some service, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Wardrobe, and the Baths, and there they are also taught to ride, and to perfect themselves in the Exercises sutable to that Station, wherein they ordinarily spend four years. Each of these three forementioned Chambers has a white Eunuch for its chief Overseer. The <hi>Seraï-Agasi</hi> has the direction of the first; the <hi>Quilargi-bachi</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the second; and the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi</hi> is the Governour of the third.</p>
                     <p>I shall have occasion to speak more at large of the two last, when I come to the Chapters of the Cup-bearers Office, and the Treasury; and therefore I shall only add here, concerning all the three in general, That the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> who are instructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, have not any commerce with those of the fourth Chamber, of whom I shall give an account by and by, nor with any other person out of the Seraglio, or in the other Courts, but with the particular permission of the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> and in the presence of an Eunuch, who hears all that is said: That they cannot converse amongst themselves, but at certain regulated hours; and that conversation must be manag'd with a great observance of Modesty, as there is an exact Obedience remarkable in all their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And lastly, that they are all clad in ordinary Cloath, even to the <hi>Beiczadés;</hi> that is, the Sons of <hi>Vizirs</hi> and <hi>Bassa's</hi> who are dead, while those of the fourth Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wear Cloath of Gold and Silver, because they come into the Grand Seignor's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and often approach his person. I shall give you an account anon of their Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories, that is the places where they take their repose, as also of the Functions of the <hi>Oda-bachi</hi> and the <hi>Deflergi-Aga,</hi> who act according to the Orders they receive from the four Eunuchs.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Chamber, which is the Prince's Chamber, is called <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> and I shall speak of it, when I come to treat of the Cup-bearers Office, and the Grand
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106224:290"/>
Seignor's secret Appartment. Here, the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> who have endur'd hardship so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years in the three first Chambers, begin to take breath, and to be allow'd more liberty. They are permitted to converse with all Persons within the Seraglio, and they have the advantage of frequent approaches to the Prince's Person, to whom they make themselves known, and from whom they ever and anon receive favours.</p>
                     <p>Under the Gate of the third Court, where a certain number of Eunuchs are upon <note place="margin">The Quarters of the Four principal Eunuchs.</note> the Guard night and day, there is a passage on the left hand which leads into a little Gallery, out of which there is an entrance into the Appartment of the <hi>Capou-Agasi;</hi> and when the great Gate is open, it hides that passage, into which a man cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but with some difficulty.</p>
                     <p>A little further, and on the right hand of the Hall of the Audience, stands the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the <hi>Seraï-Agasi,</hi> who is to take care for the keeping of the Seraglio clean and in good order; and a little farther yet, near a little Mosquey, where the <hi>Icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glans</hi> of the three first Chambers go to their Devotions, lies the Quarter of the <hi>Sefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> who are an hundred and fifty of the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> or thereabouts, particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the washing of the Grand Seignor's Linnen. When he goes into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the most antient among them are of his Retinue; and there must be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that number, such as play on Timbrels, and the other Instrumental Musicians, who have the same appointments with the rest.</p>
                     <p>Let us now enter into the Hall of Audience, which is a Quarter as 'twere indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from others, and where the Grand Seignor receives Forein Ambassadors.</p>

                     <p>THe Third Court of the Seraglio, wherein we now are, is far from being <note place="margin">The Hall of Audience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> so regular, as the precedent, and the Structures within sufficiently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that the persons, by whom it was built, minded not the observance of any Order in the doing of it. When you are at the Gate of this Court, you have just opposite to you a little Appartment, not adjoyning to the others, at the entrance of which you find, on both sides, a Fountain issuing out of Wall, the Water whereof is receiv'd into two Basins or Cisterns: And 'tis in this Appartment that the Hall of Audience stands. 'Tis an arched Structure noble enough in its kind, sustain'd by Marble Pillars, and there is yet to be seen in the midst of it,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106224:291"/>
a small spout of Water, which falls into a Basin. This Hall is open of all sides, and at the lower end, opposite to the Gate, they place the Grand Seignor's Throne.</p>
                     <p>This Throne, which is rich enough, is in the manner of an Altar, and it is brought <note place="margin">The Grand Seignor's Throne.</note> into that Hall only upon those days, whereon the Grand Seignor is willing to give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Ambassadots, and when the new <hi>Cham</hi> of the Lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi> whom he has chosen to govern there, comes to receive the Investitute of his Kingdom, and to take the accustomed Oath. The back-side of the Throne, is set against a partition erected for that purpose, which is not above half a foot higher than it, and 'tis that keeps in the cushions which are behind the Grand Seignor.</p>
                     <p>There are in the Treasury-Chamber eight several very sumptuous Coverings pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely made to cover the aforesaid Throne: and they are so large, that they reach down to the ground on three sides of it, that is to say, before, on the right hand, and on the left: for as to the back-part, it is, as I told you, fasten'd to the partition. The most Magnificent of all those Coverings is of a black Velvet, with an. Embroydery of great Pearls, whereof some are long, and others round, and in the form of Buttons. There is another of white Velvet, set out with an Embroydery of Rubies and Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, most whereof are set in Beazils, or Collets, the better to keep them in. There is a third, of a Violet-colour'd Velvet, embroyder'd with Turqueses and Pearls. The three others, which are next in esteem to these, are also of Velvets of different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, with a rich Embroydery of Gold. And the two last are of a Gold-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kado, which have also their particular Beauty and sumptuoushess. The Throne is adorn'd with one of these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verings, according to the Grand Seignor's respect to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, whose Embassy he receives; and he levels his own Magnificence to that of the Prince whom he would honour.</p>
                     <p>And this is the manner, how Ambassadors are receiv'd into that Hall. For, as to <note place="margin">The manner of receiving the Ambassadors.</note> the Order, and Ceremonies of their march from the <hi>Hôtel,</hi> or great House of <hi>Pera,</hi> to the Port of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and from the Port, to the Seraglio, no question but there have been Relations enough made already. After the Ambassador has din'd in the Hall of the <hi>Divan,</hi> with the Grand-<hi>Vizir,</hi> who there expected him, while his Retinue are entertain'd under the Gallery, upon some old Carpets of Leather, which they spread upon the ground, and upon which there are a few Dishes of Meat set, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Vests or Garments, which the Grand Seignor sends him, as well for his own Person, as for those who accompany him, and they put them on immediately, over all the Cloaths they have about them, as they would do a Morning-Gown.</p>
                     <p>In this Equipage the Ambassador is conducted to the Hall of Audience, by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi-Aga,</hi> the Grand Master of the Ceremonies, who is assisted by several Eunuchs: and when he is at the Door, two <hi>Vizirs</hi> stand ready to receive him, and they go on each side of him, till he comes to the place, where he is to bowe, and to kiss the Grand Seignor's Garment. From the very Gate of the Court, kept by the Eunuchs, quite to that of the Hall, they walk all along upon Carpets of Silk; and the Floor of the Hall, though all pav'd with Marble, is also cover'd with another Carpet of Gold, the Workmanship whereof somewhat resembles that of our ordinary Straw-Mats, and much about the same thickness.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor demeans himself with a great deal of gravity, while he is in his Throne; and behind the little Wall or Partition, against which it is set, you see, standing in order, the <hi>Kisler-Agasi,</hi> who is a Negro-Eunuch, and chief Overseer of the Appartment of the Women; the <hi>Seligdar-Aga,</hi> who carries the Grand Seignor's Sword; the <hi>Choka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar-Aga,</hi> who carries the Royal Robe, an Officer whom in <hi>France,</hi> they call <hi>Porte-Mantean,</hi> the <hi>Riquabdar,</hi> who holds the Stirrup, when the Prince gets on Horse-back; and the <hi>Hazodabachi,</hi> chief of the Chamber, which Office would be equivalent in <hi>France,</hi> to that of Grand Master of the Wardrobe.</p>
                     <p>All these fore-mentioned Officers do all deport themselves with a great appearance of modesty, having their Arms cross their Breasts: And as to the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductor to the Ambassadors, and Grand Master of the Seraglio, he stands in the midst of the Hall, and in the same posture of humility. On the left side of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106224:291"/>
Throne, there is a kind of a low Seat, cover'd with red Velvet, with a Gold-fringe, on-which the Ambassadors go and sit down, after they have kiss'd the Grand Seignor's Robe, till such time as those of their Retinue, who have had Vests, the number where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is limited, have perform'd the same Ceremony. In the mean time, all the <hi>Bassa's</hi> are standing, in the presence of their Prince; nay, the <hi>Cham</hi> of the Lesser <hi>Tartary</hi> is not excepted out of that Law, when he comes to do homage. All this action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in great silence, and the Grand Seignor making no answer at all at that time, leaves it to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> to make some short Complement, in order to the dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Ambassador, who withdraws with a profound reverence, without uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his head, or turning his back, till he be out of the Hall.</p>
                     <p>The Ministers of Christian Princes and States who ordinarily reside at the Porl, are the Ambassadors of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Resident of the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who have all their respective Habitations in <hi>Pera.</hi> When there come thither any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors or Residents from the Emperor, or from <hi>Poland,</hi> or <hi>Muscovy,</hi> they oblige them to take up their abodes at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that they may be the more assu'd of their persons.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor distinguishes the Quality of those Princes and States, and the <note place="margin">Remarks on the number of Vests, which the Grand Seignor orders to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of Christian Princes.</note> esteem he has for them, by the number of Vests which he orders to be bestow'd on their Ambassadors when they come to Audience. The Ambassador of <hi>Fiance</hi> has font and twenty allow'd him; the Ambassador of <hi>England,</hi> sixteen; the Ambassador or Agent of <hi>Venice</hi> receives twelve, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassador as many.</p>
                     <p>When Monsieur <hi>de Marcheville</hi> was Ambassador in <hi>Turkey,</hi> from his most Christian Majesty of <hi>France,</hi> I had the honour to be one of those who accompany'd him to the Seraglio, where after Dinner with the <hi>Vizirs,</hi> in the <hi>Divan-</hi>Hall, while his Retinue were treated under the Gallery, the Vests were brought according to the custome. The Ambassador coming to distribute them to those whom he had a mind to favour, and take along with him to the Audience, he was much surpriz'd, to find that he had got but sixteen. He immediately sent word to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> that he wanted eight Vests, and that he would not go to his Audience, till he had the full number, which they had wont to present to the Ambassadors of <hi>France.</hi> There was some contest about it, which retarded the Audience near an hour's time; but at last Monsieur <hi>de Marcheville</hi> persisting in his resolution, the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> comply'd, and sent him eight other Vests.</p>
                     <p>What remains of this Chapter must represent the manner, how the <hi>Cham</hi> of the <note place="margin">The Form of the Oath of Allegiance made by the <hi>Cham</hi> of the Lesser <hi>Tartary</hi> to the Grand Seignor.</note> Lesser <hi>Tartary</hi> comes into this Hall of Audience to take the Oath of Allegiance to the Grand Seignor. The Reader will be pleas'd to remember, what Observation I made at the beginning of this Work concerning the Family of that Tributary Prince, whom the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors keep under the Yoke. The <hi>Cham,</hi> who is to Reign in his turn, and according to what disposal the Grand Seignor has made of the Government, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents himself before him in the Hall of Audience, and after he has kiss'd his Robe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires some paces back, and stands. Then they bring in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> upon a great green Velvet Cushion, without any Embroydery, at the four Corners whereof there are four Tassels of Gold and Silk, and they place it on the Grand Seignor's right hand. Now whereas he sits on a Carpet cross-legg'd, there must be great care taken; that the Culhion be not so high as his knees; for the <hi>Turks</hi> would account that a great sin; and they bear so great a respect to the Book of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> that they cannot touch it, till they have first wash'd themselves. Before they open it, they kiss it, and put it upon their heads, and after they have read something in it, they kiss the writing of it, and then they rub their faces with it, before they shut it. The Prince, who is to take his Oath, is standing all this time, as I told you, with his hands stretch'd out one against the other, and lifted up as high as his shoulders, to receive the Book of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran</hi> out of those of the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who had been to take it off the Cushion, having kiss'd it, and touch'd his head with it. The Oath which the <hi>Cham</hi> takes is in these Words: <hi>Bou quittab hak juchun-seadetlu, padichaim, taré fin den her né Emir, vé ferman 'bana keleurse itaat ideym.</hi> That is say, <hi>By the Truth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106224:292"/>
of this Book, I will cause to be executed all the Orders and Commands which shall be brought unto me from my Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now that I have given you the Oath of Allegiance made by the Vassal to his Lord, I shall here also adde the Form of that, which the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperour requires of all the Christian Princes, who are subject to his Jurisdiction, such as are the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Walachia.</hi> It runs in these words: <hi>Hi isa hac Juchum, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detlu padichaïm taré fin den her né Emir, vé ferman bana keleur se itaat Ideym.</hi> That is to say, <hi>By the Truth of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>I will cause to be executed all the Orders and Commands, which shall be brought unto me from the Emperour, My Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor requires also an Oath of Allegiance of all the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> whom he sends to the Frontiers of the Empire, as the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> which is more than he exacts of the other Governours of Provinces, which are not upon the Confines of his Territories, and of whom he has no ground to be afraid.</p>
                     <p>Let us now make our Entrance into the Quarter of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> and the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> whereof the Baths make a great part.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The prodigious strength of Body of a certain</hi> Ichoglan. <hi>The Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey belonging to the Appartment of the Eunuchs. The Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Dwarfs, and the Mutes. The superstition of the</hi> Turks <hi>in the manner of paring their nails.

Why the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Eastern Parts do not make use of Paper upon an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent account. The</hi> Persians <hi>more scrupulous than the</hi> Turks. <hi>They are great lovers of cleanliness. Certain Chambers very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and divertive. The strict prohibition of</hi> Mahomet <hi>for any one to suffer himself to be seen stark naked. A certain Earth which takes off the hair, and its dangerous effects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Baths design'd for the Grand Seignor's own Person, and his principal Officers, take up a great space of the Quarter of the Eunuchs. The little Ovens, whereby they are heated, called <hi>Kulkans,</hi> are adjoyning to the Appartment of the <hi>Saraï-houdasi,</hi> and fifteen <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> the most robust that can be found, are employ'd in keeping the fire going. They have the denomination of <hi>Kulkangis;</hi> and Five and twenty others, who are named <hi>Dellaks,</hi> are employ'd in the Baths, to shave and rub the Body, as also in applying Cupping-Glasses to those who stand in need
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106224:292"/>
thereof. Among the <hi>Kulkangis,</hi> he who is the most ancient in that employment has a pre-eminence and superiority over the rest, whom he many times commands to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise themselves in wrastling, and lifting a heavy Iron Barr with one hand.</p>
                     <p>There are three such Bars fasten'd upon great Cramp-Irons over the door that goes <note place="margin">The prodigious strength of Body of a certain <hi>Ichoglan.</hi>
                        </note> into the Baths, and the middlemost of the three, as it is commonly reported, weighs a hundred <hi>Okkas,</hi> which amount to Three hundred and fifty pounds, <hi>Paris</hi> weight, an <hi>Okka</hi> weighing three pounds and a half, or thereabouts. There was heretofore one of those <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> of so prodigious strength, that the Grand Seignor himself would have the satisfaction of seeing a tryal, whether he could with one hand lift up and turn about that Iron-bar; which he did to the great astonishment of the Prince, and presently after he entertain'd him with another demonstration of the strength of his Arm. Over those three Iron-bars, there hung two Head-pieces of Iron, whereof one was an inch in thickness, and the other about the eighth part of an inch. The same <hi>Ichoglan</hi> did, in the Grand Seignor's presence, at one blow of a Battle-Axe, cut through the head-piece of an inch thick, and, at one blow with a Sabre, cleft the other to the middle of it.</p>
                     <p>Opposite to those Ovens are the Cocks, whereby the Waters are distributed into the <note place="margin">The Mosquey belonging to the Appartment of the Eunuchs.</note> several Rooms of the Baths; and I forgot to tell you, That before you enter into that place, you find a little Mosquey, adjoyning to the Appartment of the <hi>Saraiket-houdasi,</hi> where all the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> go to their devotions twice a day. If they fail the doing of it, the <hi>Oda-bachi,</hi> who, in every Chamber, takes notice of their demeanours, calls them to an account, and they are sure of the bastinado, as they are also for any other fault they commit; and sometimes they receive the said punishment on the soles of their feet, and, upon some occasions to such a number of blowes, that the nails of their toes come off; and that is the punishment which is properly call'd <hi>Drubbing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of that Mosquey you pass into a Gallery, adjoyning to the Baths, and there the <note place="margin">The Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dwarfs and Mutes.</note> 
                        <hi>Dislis</hi> and the <hi>Geuges;</hi> that is to say, the Mutes and the Dwarfs are employ'd in some work or other all day long. Some spend the time in learning to make up Turbants, wherein there is more work and difficulty than is imagin'd, especially in making up the Grand Seignior's own Turbant, when he goes to the <hi>Divan.</hi> For then he takes an extraordinary large one, as do also all the Officers of the same <hi>Divan</hi> when they go to Council: and I cannot make a better representation of that kind of Turbant, then by the form of our largest sort of Citrals, if they be made hollow in the middle, so as that the head might enter into that hole.</p>
                     <p>Others are employ'd in shaving, paring the nails, and other things of that kind. They do not make use of any Scizars for the nails, in <hi>Turkey,</hi> nor in any part of <hi>Asia;</hi> it being a thing forbidden by <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his Law, and accordingly they account the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it a great sin. But they make use of a little Steel Instrument, somewhat like a Pen-knife, and the only cutting part is the end of it, and they are dextrous enough in the performance of that Office. It is the Custome all over the East, that the Barber, who trims you, should also make up your Turbant, which is many times discompos'd, pare the nails of your hands and toes, and take away the filth out of your Ears: For the <hi>Turks</hi> and all the Inhabitants of <hi>Asia</hi> are great lovers of cleanliness, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the least nastiness, either on themselves, or those who come near them, as I shall give you an account anon.</p>
                     <p>And having spoken so much of the Turbant, it will not be unseasonable, for me to <note place="margin">Colours forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their Coissure.</note> communicate this Remark to you here, That in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and all over <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> none but <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are permitted to make use of White, for the covering of their heads; whereas in <hi>Persia,</hi> and all over the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Empire, men may take what Colours they please themselves.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the Great Bath, which is adjoyning to the Chamber of the <hi>Hamangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bachi,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The description of the Baths.</note> who is the chief Overseer of it, and which makes part of the Appartment of the <hi>Seferlis,</hi> or the Grand Seignor's Laundry-men. The place where they put off their Cloaths is a spacious Louver, or Banquetting-house of Freestone, high enough, and in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106224:293"/>
one of the most eminent parts of the Seraglio. The Floor is pav'd with a very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kind of Marble laid in square pieces; and it has two large Windows jutting out upon the Gardens, somewhat like Balconies, from which you have a Prospect of the two Seas. In the midst of that <hi>Domo</hi> or <hi>Louver,</hi> you find a Fountain, the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is receiv'd into two Basins, or Cisterns: The former, which is the highest, and withal the least, is of one piece of White Marble, having in it a little intermixture of Red and Black Veins, and pierc'd through at six several places, for the reception of so many small Pipes of Copper, through which the water falls down into the other Basin, which is also of Marble, of several pieces, and several colours.</p>
                     <p>Within the Domo, there is a great number of Poles, which are dispos'd all about it, <note place="margin">Abuses reform'd.</note> and supported by certain pieces of Iron coming out of the wall. Upon those Poles they dry the Linnen, which they had us'd in the Bath; and of that Linnen there are several sorts. Heretofore, the Pages were allow'd only a long piece of Linnen Cloath, which came only twice about their wasts: but upon observation made, that they abus'd them, and that handsome young Lads playing together, snatch'd that piece of Linnen one from the other, purposely to discover their nakedness, they use in the Baths only such Garments of Linnen as are sow'd close above, and reach from the waste down to the feet, much after the manner of a Woman's Petti-coat. At their coming out of the Bath, they have two other sorts of Linnen to dry themselves withal, of the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of ordinary Table-Cloaths, whereof the one is Red, with a bordure of Silk of three fingers breadth, which covers them, as soon as they are out of the water, from the waste downwards to the Ham; and the other is white, wherewith they rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For these two sorts of Towels they have but one name, to wit, <hi>Pécheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On one side of the Fountain, which is in the midst of the <hi>Domo,</hi> there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance <note place="margin">why the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantines</hi> do not use Paper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently.</note> into the bath, and near that is the Hall, where they uncloath themselves in the Winter-time. A little Gallery which lies on the left hand, leads to the places design'd for the casing of nature, and every seat has a little Cock, which supplies them with weter to wash themselves, after they have done. It is accounted a heinous sin among them, to make use of Paper for that purpose; and the reason they give for it is this, that, possibly, the Name of God might be written upon it, or it might contain some Text of the Law, which would be a profanation of it, and consequently ought to be avoided. Besides, they have another opinion, That Paper is not so proper so well to make clean that part, which the necessity of the Body does ordinarily so much defile, but that there may be something of ordure left; and that being oblig'd to present themselves before God with an absolute Purity of Body and Mind, their Prayers could not be heard, if they should not be wholly clean.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are yet more scrupulous than the <hi>Turks</hi> upon this account. For though <note place="margin">The <hi>Persians</hi> more scrupulous than the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                        </note> they both agree in this, That their Devotions are ineffectual, nay indeed that they are not in a condition to perform them, without crime, if they be not pure, as to Body and Mind; Yet the former are of a perswasion, That the least ordure which, through negligence or inadvertency, might remain upon their persons, or their garments, would render their Prayers fruitless and criminal, which the <hi>Turks,</hi> somewhat less superstitious as to that particular, will not acknowledge.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is also, That in <hi>Persia</hi> they are extraordinary Lovers of cleanliness; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch <note place="margin">They are great lovers of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </note> that I have observ'd, That at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> the Metropolis of that Country, where the Streets are not pav'd, when there falls a little Snow or Rain, which must occasion some dirt, few people will come out of their houses, unless they be forc'd thereto by some Concern of great importance. And when they do go abroad at such a time, at the house door into which they are to enter, they put off their shooes, their upper-Garment, the Cap which covers their Turbants; and if they have the least dirt or filth about them, they think themselves impure, and that it would be a disrespect to the person whom they are to visit. Nay, a <hi>Persian</hi> shall be very scrupulous, and make a great difficulty to receive a man into his house in foul weather; and if any one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106224:293"/>
himself into that pleasure, he makes a sign to him with his hand to keep at a certain distance from him, in the place wherein he is to enter into discourse with him. For if by chance, as he comes out of the Street, where there is some dirt, and where horses pass to and fro, and may cast some of it upon him, he has the least spot of any daggling about him, and afterwards touch the Person whom he comes to visit, this latter would be <hi>nagis,</hi> that is to say, <hi>unclean,</hi> and thereupon be oblig'd immediately to change his cloaths; so great is the Superstition of the <hi>Persians,</hi> as to that particular.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the Gallery, there is a door which gives you passage into three Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <note place="margin">Chambers very divertive and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</note> which are so many Baths for the use of the Grand Seignor's Quarter. There is adjoyning to the last of those Chambers a spacious place pav'd Checquer-wise with Marble of different colours, and there the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> are trimm'd. This place has a little eminency in the midst of it, from which there is a gentle descent of all sides, that the Water wherewith the Barbers wash their Heads and Beards may the more easily be carried off, and the place be alwaies kept clean. On both sides of the Wall, whereby it is enclos'd, there is a great double Cock, with two Keyes belonging to it, which, at the same mouth, supplyes them alternately with either hot water, or cold, and that falls into a Basin or Receptacle of White Marble, wherein three or four men may bathe themselves without any inconvenience, or trouble one to the other. There is also at one of the ends a little Room of Black and White Marble, and there the Barbers, who have no knowledge of any other Profession, put up all their necessary Utensils and Instruments, as Razors, Hones, Balls, and those Irons wherewith they pare their Nails: for as for Linnen, they do not use any; and those who are to be shav'd come in stark naked from the Waste upwards, and are cover'd from thence downwards, only with a Cloath, which reaches to the Ankle. 'Tis a great Rarity to meet with any one among those Barbers that knowes how to let blood, and their Lancets are much like the Fleams, wherewith our Farriers bleed Horses.</p>
                     <p>Opposite to the Chamber of the Barbers, there are three other Rooms arch'd with Marble, the largest whereof much surpasses in Beauty those that are adjoyning to it. The Floor of it is of white and black Marble, and the Walls are done about with square pieces, that are white and blew, and in every one of them you find a Flower in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boss'd Work, done to the Life, and which a man would take for enamell. Little La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines or Plates of Gold cover the junctures of those square pieces, and there cannot any thing be imagin'd more pleasant and divertive than that Chamber is. In the Roof of it, there are several round holes, of about half a foot diameter, over which there are little Glasses made in the fashion of Bells, order'd as the Venice-Looking-Glasses are, lest any one should have the curiosity, to get up to the Roof, and laying himself upon his belly think to see what is done in the Bath. The place has no light but what it receives by the means of those holes, and while some body is in the Bath: But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they go out of it, the door is shut, the better to keep in the heat, and to prevent their being seen; which might be, if instead of those forementioned holes in the Roof, there were Windows below, according to our Mode. All the other Baths have their Structures after the same manner, and having no light but what comes at little glaz'd holes, there is not any passage into it, but that of the door, to the end that being presently shut, the heat might the better be kept within the Bath, and to prevent their being seen who are in it.</p>
                     <p>The Second Chamber is another Bath, but as to Beauty, it is much inferiour to the other; And as for the third, there is something in it which is singularly remarkable. The Floor of it is layd as with a sort of small stones, so as that the foot cannot slip, though it be wetted at their departure out of the Bath: And the whole Room is done all about with square pieces, having in them flowers of emboss'd work, done to the Life, and covered with Gold and Azure. This is the place into which the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor enters, when he comes out of the Bath; and he alwaies goes into it alone, when he intends to shave himself in those parts, which are not to be nam'd without immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106224:294"/>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> pronounces a Curse upon those persons who suffer themselves to be seen, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Prohibition to be seen naked.</note> and upon all those who look on them: And the strict observance of his Law requires, That both Men and Women ought to shave themselves, without using the assistance of any other hand.</p>
                     <p>But most of the Inhabitants of the EASTERN Parts, the <hi>Arabians, Tartars,</hi> and <note place="margin">An Earth that takes off hair, and its dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Effects.</note> the <hi>Indians,</hi> make use of a more easie expedient then the Razor, to get off hair. It is a certain Earth, which they mix with some Orpiment, or Arsenick, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes soft as butter. When they are in the Bath, and begin to sweat, they take of that Earth, and therewith rub the parts, from which they would have the hair to fall, and presently after they must be very careful to see, whether it begins to fall, as one would observe a Fowl, whose feathers he would take off, after it had been cast into scalding water. For if that Earth be left too long upon the parts whereto it had been apply'd, it burns and makes holes in the flesh, the marks whereof will remain, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what resembling those, which the Small Pox sometimes leaves behind it. Besides, the skin of those parts, whereto this application is made, becomes in time as hard and rough as Leather; and those ungrateful inconveniences have diverted the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> from using that Expedient. Nor do the <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Levantine</hi> Countries make use of it, though they imitate the <hi>Mahumetanes</hi> in the Custome of frequenting the Baths: But above all, in <hi>Persia,</hi> none make use of that remedy, but the poorer sort of people. The Ladies, not regarding the prohibition of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> employ their Female Slaves for the performance of that Office; and with a small kind of Pincers and twitchers, such as those, wherewith we take off the hair of the mustachoes, they do, with a little more trouble, but less hazard, what that Earth does in less time, but with more danger. Our <hi>Sultanesses</hi> are yet too delicate to imitate the Ladies of <hi>Persia;</hi> nay the men themselves, in <hi>Turkey,</hi> are not very forward to have that twitch'd off with pain, which the Razour can take off without any trouble.</p>

                     <p>THE Treasury of the Seraglio and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, the vast Wealth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contain'd, and the excellent order wherewith it is govern'd, requir'd my being a little more large upon that subject. I shall discover all the Rivers, which fall into that Sea, and may have some resemblance to those that enter into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and are never seen to come out of it again.</p>
                     <p>Out of the Chamber, where the Grand Seignor shaves himself, you pass into a <note place="margin">Noble Relicks of Antiquity.</note> Gallery, which is Thirty paces in length, and between Nine and ten in breadth. There are, on the one side of it, Six great Marble-Pillars, of Fifteen foot in height, and of different colours, among which there is one of a very delightful Green, and that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour makes the <hi>Turks</hi> have a great esteem for it. You have under your feet in this Gallery a Walk of large square Pieces of Marble, and the high-rais'd Fret-work thereof is a Relick of Antiquity, and there are in it excellent Pieces of Painting after the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick</hi> way, representing divers Persons, and which some conceive to have been made, for the reception and entertainment of some great Prince, in the time of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> who have not among them either Gravers or Painters, in order to the <note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> have an aversion for Figures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Man or Beast.</note> making of any representation of Man or Beast, for which they have an aversion, have thought it much to endure those Figures, and not being able to refrain from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring the heads, there is nothing left but the bodies, which is much to be regretted. It may easily be conjectur'd, That that Gallery was open on both sides, as being so Hill to the Court-side, and 'tis in the midst of the Wall, whereby it is enclos'd on the other side, that the Door of the Treasury stands.</p>
                     <p>The first Treasury consists in Four Chambers full of Riches and Rarities. The first contains a vast quantity of Long-Bowes, Arrowes, Cross-Bowes, Muskets, Fire-locks, <note place="margin">The Chambers of the Treasury and their Wealth.</note> Sabres, Cymitars, and and other Arms of that kind, which are all so many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Pieces, that have been presented, from time to time to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperors.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106224:295"/>
All these Arms are either hung up at the Ceeling, or fasten'd against the Wall; but in a pitiful condition, all over-run with rust, and cover'd with dust; and the Grand Seignor suffers them to be so neglected, because there come in daily Presents of Arms excellently wrought, the novelty whereof makes him forget the old ones; as also for that it is the humour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> not to make any great account of Curiosities, but at the very time they are presented with them.</p>
                     <p>The Second Chamber is a very spacious Arched Structure, of the same height and architecture as that of the Bath, of which I gave you an account in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where they go and uncloath themselves in the Summer time: And there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them, save only that this last has no overtures in the Roof. That place contains Six great Chests, or Coffers, each of them of Twelve foot in length, six in breadth, and six in depth; and if the Covers were not broken to pieces, two men would find it a hard matter to lift them, they are so weighty. These Coffers, which are called <hi>Ambars,</hi> are full of all sorts of Cloaths for the Grand Seignor's use, as Vests, rich Furres, Magnificent Turbants, and Cushions embroider'd with Pearls.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Six Coffers before mentioned, there are Eight others, which are but eight foot in length, and four in breadth; and these are fill'd with Pieces of Scarlet, <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Cloaths, of the finest sorts, Pieces of Velvet, Gold and Silver-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadoes, Embroyder'd Coverlets and Counterpanes for Beds, and other Rich Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of that nature. As for the Bridles and Saddles cover'd with Precious Stones, they are dispos'd upon supporters of Wood or Iron, coming out of the Wall: and all this Chamber is generally very well kept, and all things are neat, and in good order.</p>
                     <p>The Third Chamber is very spacious, and is more like a great Hall. The first thing that entertains your Eye, is a great Coffer, the in-side whereof is divided into three parts, and makes as it were three other Coffers, one upon the other: but they are open'd all on the out-side, so as that if there be any thing look'd for in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, there is no necessity of stirring the uppermost. The lowermost Coffer contains those sumptuous Coverings for the Grand Seignor's Throne, of which I have spoken in the Description of the Hall of Audience. In the middlemost are dispos'd the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Trappings, enrich'd with Embroidery, and some of them with Pearls and Precious Stones, which are us'd in great Solemnities. In the uppermost Coffer, are kept the Bridles, Breast-Pieces, Cruppers, and Stirrups, which are recommendable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the score of the Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, and other Precious Stones, whereby they are enrich'd: but the greatest part of them is cover'd with <hi>Turkish-</hi>Stones, which they have the art of setting excellently well.</p>
                     <p>It is a most astonishing sight, to behold the quantity of those precious Harnesses: <note place="margin">The Blood of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> one of the Rivers that fall into the Sea of the Treasury.</note> but it is such only to those, who are ignorant, how the Grand Seignor replenishes his Treasury with so much Wealth. It happens thus, That there being a frequent morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity amongst the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and others, who are Governours of Provinces, whether it be by a natural death, or a violent, and all they have in the World falling to the Grand Seignor, as I told you elsewhere, and being brought into the Seraglio, there are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily found, amongst their rich Harnesses, some Bridles cover'd with pretious Stones, and those Bridles are brought into the Treasury. The Case is the same with the Gold and Silver ready coyn'd, and all the Jewels, and whatever else those <hi>Bassa's</hi> were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd of. But as to their Saddles, which ordinarily, are cover'd with Plates of Gold of the thickness of a <hi>Ducat,</hi> they are put into the hands of the <hi>Imbrohor-bachi,</hi> who is the Master of the Horse, and come not within the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>There are besides, in the very same Chamber, several other Coffers, of different Bulks, wherein there is contain'd abundance of most precious things. Some of them are full of rich Swords, adorn'd with precious Stones, as also of Sabres, which have the same Ornaments. For the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they are on Horse-back, make use of both Sabres and Swords, of a good length, and somewhat broader than ours. They wear the Sabre on one side, and fasten the Sword, all along by the Saddle, as they also do the Battle-Axe, yet so as that this last passes under their Thighs, which cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them much, because, when they are mounted, they ride with very short
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106224:295"/>
Stirrups. The Sides, and the Handles of the Battle-Axes which they carry in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, are also cover'd with precious Stones; and in all their Accoutremeuts, the <hi>Turks</hi> are Magnificent, and do not spare for Money. When the Grand Seignor designs to honour a <hi>Bassa,</hi> he sends him one of those Swords, or one of those Sabres, with a Vest of Gold-Brockado, lin'd with some rich Fur. But these sumptuous Pieces do but pass to and fro, in as much as that upon the death of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> whose Estates fall to the Grand Seignor, and consequently are brought into the Seraglio, they are still found again in the Treasury, as in their Centre.</p>
                     <p>There are yet other Coffers fill'd with <hi>Amber-greece, Musk,</hi> the precious Wood call'd <note place="margin">The use of Aloes wood used in <hi>Turkey.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Sandal-</hi>wood. There is a certain sort of this <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> which is worth a thousand Crowns the pound, according as it is fat, or Oyly, the most Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being always the best, and the <hi>Turks</hi> are very expensive in this <hi>Aloes</hi> Wood. When some persons come to visit them, and assoon as they are sate down, it is their custom to present them with a Pipe of Tobacco, with some <hi>Lignum Aloes</hi> in it, which is done after this manner. They take of that Wood, according to the oyliness of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently its making a greater fumagation, the quantity of a Pea, or a small Bean, and after they have moisten'd it a little, they put it over a few Coals in a Chafing-dish, in a kind of Perfuming-pot, which they present, one after another, to all the Company. There comes out a thick Steam, or Exhalation, wherewith every one perfumes his Head, and his Beard, and sometimes the in-side of his Turbant, after which he lifts up his hands on high, crying <hi>Elmendela,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Thanks be to God.</hi> But before they present them with the Perfuming-pot, there is some Rose-water brought in a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Gold, or Silver, according to the Quality of those who make the Visit. This Vessel is commonly a foot in height, the lower part of it being about the bigness of a mans fist, and from thence growing gradually smaller and smaller to the top of it, which is about the bigness of ones little finger. At the top of it there is a little hole, out of which comes the Rose-water, wherewith they wash their hands and faces, and then hold them over the suffumigation of the <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> which not only dries up the water, but also sticks so much the closer to the hair of the Head and Beard.</p>
                     <p>There are also in those Coffers abundance of Aromatical Simples, and precious Drugs, <hi>Bezoar-</hi>Sones, and stores of <hi>Mastick,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> and the young Maids of the Seraglio pass away their time. They have of it perpetually in their Mouths, and this <hi>Mastick</hi> sweetens the Breath, and cleanses the Teeth, upon which score they are the better belov'd.</p>
                     <p>There may be seen also in the same Chamber, and in other Coffers, abundance of Plate, both Gold and Silver, which is never us'd, the Grand Seignor having other pieces, for his ordinary use, in the <hi>Kilar,</hi> whatever is serv'd up to his own Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether in Pourcelain.</p>
                     <p>There are, amongst other Pieces, several Basins and Ewers, whereof some are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd <note place="margin">Basins of a more commodious fashion than ours.</note> with several sorts of precious Stones. Those Basins are of a fashion more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious than that of ours, and it is an evident Mark of the cleanliness of the <hi>Levan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> They are round, and about half a foot in depth, and cover'd as it were with a Plate or Server, full of little holes, which makes the concavity of it of equal height with the sides, and so hides the dirtiness of the water which lies at the bottom of it. They do not rise after their refection, in <hi>Turkey,</hi> till they have wash'd their Mouths and their Hands, to do which they bring you Soap and warm Water; and amongst Persons of Quality, they present Rose-water, or some other sweet Water, into which you put the corner of your Handkercher.</p>
                     <p>They have also in those Coffers great Tapers, or Wax-Candles of above two foot <note place="margin">Tapers of a kind of Wax of great value.</note> in length, made of a certain very dear composition, of a greyish colour, which has some resemblance to Wax, and is brought out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> every Taper amounting to near a hundred Crowns. They are not us'd but only when the Grand Seignor goes to visit the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> and then there are two of those Tapers lighted, and set in great golden Candlesticks, enrich'd with precious Stones. When they are a little above half burnt out, the Negro-Eunuchs, who serve in the <hi>Haran,</hi> light others, and, out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106224:296"/>
of civility, make a Present of the fore-mentioned remainders to the principal Women attending on the <hi>Sultanesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is moreover in one of those Coffers, abundance of Clocks and Watches, <hi>German-</hi>work, as also of Knives and Ink-horns, after the <hi>Turkish</hi> Mode, all those pieces being the choice Productions and Master-pieces of great Artists, and adorn'd with pretious Stones. There is to seen, in fine, all along the Walls, but cover'd with a Scarlet Stuff, several Arms, after the <hi>Turkish-</hi>Mode, neatly kept in order, as Bowes, Arrows, Targets, Battle-Axes, excellently well wrought, and most of these Pieces are of a considerable value.</p>
                     <p>But what is most precious in that Chamber and transcends all the rest, is a strong Coffer all of Iron-work, which contains another, of about a foot and a half square, <note place="margin">An inestimable Coffer of all sorts of precious Stones.</note> wherein there is a vast Treasure. When this Goffer is open'd, you see a kind of Gold-Smiths Jewel Box, wherein are ranked all sorts of Jewels of highest value, as <hi>Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds,</hi> a huge number of excellent <hi>Topazes,</hi> and four of those Gems, call'd <hi>Cats-eyes,</hi> which are so beautiful, that they are not to be valu'd. Having satisfy'd your curiosity with the former, you come next to certain little Drawers full of several Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, great Roses of Diamonds, Pendants, other Roses of Rubies and Emeralds, Strings and Chains of Pearls and Bracelets. There stands aside by it self a Cabinet, where are the <hi>Sorgouges,</hi> or the things wherein are fasten'd the Heron-tops, which the Grand Seignor wears in his Turbant. They are as it were little handles, made in the fashion of Tulips, cover'd over with the most precious Stones of the Seraglio, and 'tis into this that the Heron-top enters, that rich Plume of Feathers, whereof I have elsewhere given the description. Of these Handles, some are higher and more precious than others; and my Overseer of the Treasury assur'd me, That, of all sorts of them, great and small, there are above a hundred and fifty. The lesser ones serve only for the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, and the great ones, which are the richest, are reserv'd for the Pomps and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificences of the Court, and when the Grand Seignor marches in Ceremony to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> If he has a desire to satisfie his sight with the lustre of his precious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, he Orders the Coffer to be brought into his own Chamber; but if he calls for some particular Piece of the Treasury, he gives order to the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> to fetch it, and that Chief Officer of the Treasury cannot enter into it, without abundance of mysterious precautions.</p>
                     <p>There are alwayes Sixty Pages, more or less, belonging to the Chambers of the Treasury. The number of them is not fixt, but the Credit of the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Precautions and Ceremonies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd at the opening of the Treasury.</note> 
                        <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> may augment or diminish it, according to their inclinations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests. Unless they fall into disgrace, as he had done from whom I have some part of these Instructions, they never go out of the Seraglio, but upon their advancement to some considerable Government, or the settlement of a handsome Pension for their maintenance; and so, provided they do nothing amiss, they are well enough accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated for their lives. The Chief Officer of the Treasury having receiv'd Orders from the Grand Seignor to bring the Piece he would have, assembles all the Pages in their Chamber, and sends for the <hi>Anakdar-Agasi,</hi> who has the Custody of the Keyes. This last having given three stroaks with his hand upon the Drawer, wherein they are enclos'd, takes them out of it, and following the <hi>Chasnadar-Bachi,</hi> attended by the Sixty Pages, they all make their appearance together at the door of the Treasury.</p>
                     <p>The first thing that is done is the untwisting of a Chain, which they had put there, for the better securing of the Seal, which the Chief Officer of the Treasury had set over the hole, and having found it entire, he orders it to be broken by the keeper of the Keyes, and commands him to open. Assoon as they are got into the Chamber in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi</hi> knowes they are to go, he sets himself down upon a low Bench, and declares what Piece it is that the Grand Seignor requires. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon open the Coffer, wherein it ought to be, then they present it to the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> and, if he be desirous of that honour, he has the priviledge to be himself the Bearer of it to the Grand Seignor. Then has he a fair Opportunity to secure some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is precious to himself, if he has the dexterity to do it without any discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When he is in the Treasury, he needs only say, That the Grand Seignor desires
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106224:296"/>
also the Piece, which he has a mind to convert to his own use, and causing all to be immediately carried to his own Chamber, he there leaves what he would keep, and presents to the Prince only that which he had commanded to be brought him. Not but that whatever is receiv'd into the Treasury, and whatever goes out of it, is exactly set down and enroll'd by the <hi>Haznaquatib,</hi> or Clerk, who keeps the Registers; and the Cheat might be easily discover'd, when at the quitting of his Charge the <hi>Chasna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar-bachi</hi> gives an account of all things to his successor. But it ordinarily happens, that they are friends, and that the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> who does not leave his Charge, but upon his advancement to that of the place of the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> in case he should dye, or be exalted to a higher Dignity; or upon his being made a <hi>Bassa</hi> and Governour of a Province, proposes him, among the Pages, for whom he has the greatest affection, and who is his Confident, as a Person qualify'd for the Charge of Principal Officer of the Treasury. Accordingly, being his Benefactor, he gives in his Accompts as he pleases himself, and delivering unto him an Inventory of what is in the Treasury, he withal produces a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the Pieces, which had been taken out thence, during his Surintendency, by the Grand Seignor's Orders. The Clerk of the Treasury, might, notwithstanding their intelligence and combination, discover the intrigue; but being one of the eldest Pages of the Chamber, and in a capacity of advancement to the Charge of <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> he shuts his eyes, and so avoids the creation of Enemies, thinking it more prudence, to be appeas'd, by the Presents he receives as well from him who enters into the Charge, as from him who quits it. But these Thieveries are not very often committed, and if there were but the least discovery made thereof, a severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment would soon be inflicted both on the Author of them, and his Complices.</p>
                     <p>As to the little Chest or Coffer, wherein the most precious Jewels are kept, it is impossible to get any thing out thence: for when the Grand Seignor would have any Piece taken out of it, he orders the Coffer it self to be brought into his Presence, by the principal Officer of the Treasury, accompany'd by the Keeper of the Keyes, and all the Pages; and before he opens it, he takes notice whether the Seal be entire. After he has taken what he desir'd, the Coffer is lock'd up in his Presence, the Seal is set upon it, and it is carry'd back into the Treasury with the same Ceremony. Then do the Sixty Pages receive, ordinarily, some demonstrations of the Grand Seignor's Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, which may amount to ten or twelve <hi>Purses,</hi> to be divided amongst them.</p>
                     <p>We are not yet got out of the third Chamber of the Treasury, which may pass for <note place="margin">Rich Tapistry, wherein <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</note> one Spacious Hall, the middle part whereof is taken up by a Scaffold, of nine or ten foot square, the height, the length, and the breadth being equal. This Scaffold is cover'd and surrounded with a piece of Tapistry of Gold and Silk, and, in the upper part of it, there is, in emboss'd Work, the Effigies of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, seated on a Throne, having in one hand, a Globe, and in the other, a Sword, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by all the Grandees of the Empire, doing him homage. At the bottom of the said Piece of Tapestry, there may be read certain Verses in <hi>Gothick</hi> characters: And the upper part of the Scaffold is full of Books in the <hi>Latine, French, Italian,</hi> high <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, English,</hi> and other <hi>European</hi> Languages. There are also some Treatises upon the subject of Navigation, together with two Globes, the Celestial, and the Terrestrial, and some Geographical Maps drawn upon Velom: whence it may be conjectur'd, that they were all taken at Sea, by some <hi>Turkish</hi> Pirate, and sent as a Present to the Grand Seignor. But not being carefully look'd after, the dust has quite spoyl'd both the Tapestry, and the Books, and so they remain there as a Monument of some Victory gain'd over the Christians.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Chamber of the Treasury is very dark, and has no other light than <note place="margin">A remarkable Story of the Bass a <hi>Rustan.</hi>
                        </note> what it receives from a little Garret-Window, which looks into the Court, and has three strong Iron-bars, one over the other. Over the Door, there are these words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd, in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language; <hi>Mony acquir'd by the diligence of Rustan.</hi> Take here an account of what occasions this Monument, which they were pleas'd to erect, to perpetuate the memory of a Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> as I have been told it, by several Persons in <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He was the Son of a Cow-keeper, and had follow'd the same Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himself: but he had a Genius that might become a Person of the highest Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and which rais'd him to the Charge of Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> and the honour of being
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106224:297"/>
Son-in-law to <hi>Solyman.</hi> He had many traverses of fortune, and was for some time out of Favour: but in fine, <hi>Solyman,</hi> who had great Affairs to manage, and was engag'd in a War with <hi>Persia,</hi> coming to a little indigency of Mony, sent for <hi>Rustan,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on him the Superintendency of his Revenues. He knew him to be a man of great Abilities, and capable of putting them, in a short time, into a good posture; and accordingly his pains and diligence in the management thereof prov'd so successful, that he presently fill'd <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Coffets, and re-establish'd the Affairs of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Upon which occasion I shall here set down a thing which is still fresh in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of many <hi>Turks,</hi> who receiv'd it from their Fathers. The <hi>Turks</hi> have so great a <note place="margin">The Heroick Sentiment of a <hi>Turk.</hi>
                        </note> zeal for the welfare of the State, that one of the Grandees of the Port, an Enemy of <hi>Rustans,</hi> and one, who, upon other occasions, would gladly have ruin'd him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to one of his Confidents, That, though it were in his power to do him an ill turn, yet he would not do it then, because he had, by his Industry and Labours, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the State, which he retriv'd from the Precipice of destruction, and was in a fair way to make a considerable augmentation of its Revenues. This generous and heroick Sentiment in the Soul of a <hi>Turk,</hi> who at his first rise was but a simple Slave, would meet with but few Examples amongst <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, to reassume our discourse concerning the Fourth Chamber of the Treasury. It is full of Chests of two foot in length, and a breadth and depth proportionable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, fortify'd with plates of Iron, and made fast, each of them, with two Chains. The number of them is not always the same, because the Mony is coming in, and going out of that Chamber, and the Coffers are transported thence according to the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent exigencies, for the payment of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and the maintenance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>All the Gold and Silver which is brought into the Treasury rises out of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Empire, and out of the Sale of what Goods the <hi>Bassa's</hi> leave at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">The principal Sources of the Wealth of the Empire.</note> out of this World. As to what is rais'd out of the Empire, which dilates it self so far into the three parts of our great Continent, and comprehends so many Kingdoms, it may be easily imagin'd, that it must supply the Treasury with vast Sums; but it is not so easie to ascertain them. Its Revenues consist principally in the collection of the Tributes, and in the Customes: and the three <hi>Tefterdars,</hi> or Treasurers-General, give an account to the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> of the Receipts of the Provinces. That Principal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister has the custody of one Key of that fourth Chamber of the Treasury, and the first <hi>Tefterdar</hi> has that of another, and besides that, it is always seal'd with the Grand Seignor's Seal. It is not ordinarily open'd, but upon those days, on which the <hi>Divan</hi> sits, that is, on Council-days, either for the reception of Money into it, or for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any out, to defray the Charges of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>What is so receiv'd into it is for the most part in Silver; and as to the Species of Gold Coins that are brought into that Chamber, they come from four Sources, two whereof are upon a Foreign account, and the other two upon that of the Country. One of the two former consists in the Commerce of the <hi>French, English, Dutch, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Moscovites,</hi> and <hi>Polanders,</hi> who bring in <hi>Ducats</hi> out of those Provinces. The other is the annual Tribute, which the <hi>Cham</hi> of the Lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Transylvania, Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>Walachia,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Ragusa,</hi> and part of <hi>Mingrelia</hi> and <hi>Russia,</hi> are to pay the Grand Seignor in Gold, which amounts to very great Sums. One of the two Sources of the Country proceeds from what is found upon the removal of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> whereof the very coined Gold makes the best part; the other, from the Revenue of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where there is an annual coinage of a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Sequins,</hi> according to the quantity of Gold, which is brought thither out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and being coin'd into <hi>Sequins,</hi> is all convey'd thence into the Treasury.</p>
                     <p>The Revenue of <hi>Egypt</hi> may amount yearly to twelve millions of Livers, [that is, <note place="margin">The Revenues of <hi>Egypt</hi> how employ'd.</note> about one million and two hundred thousand Pounds <hi>Sterling]</hi> which must be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three parts. Five millions of the twelve, are brought into the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Treasury. Four millions of the foresaid Sum, are employ'd in the maintenance of the Officers and Soldiers of that Kingdom: And the other three are design'd for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106224:297"/>
the rich Present, which the Grand Seignor sends every year to <hi>Mecha,</hi> for the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which relate to Religious Worship, and to fill the Cisterns of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which are supply'd with Water, brought by Land, many days Journeys.</p>
                     <p>Of the five Millions which are brought into the Seraglio, the greatest part is in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,</hi> according to the quantity of Gold, which the <hi>Abyssines</hi> bring into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the rest in <hi>Dutch Rix-Dollars.</hi> All is brought together into the Coffers of the fourth Chamber of the Publick Treasury. But as to the <hi>Sequins,</hi> they are carried into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Treasury, which it is time for us now to open, and give the Reader an account of, according to the description which has been made to me thereof, by two men, whom their Employments oblig'd to enter into it often.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A Vault under ground, into which few Persons have access. The great frugality of the Emperour</hi> Amurat. Ibrahim, <hi>his Successor, charg'd with evil Conduct. The Grand Seignor's precautions for the security of his Treasure. His Liberalities to the Grandees of the Port.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WIthin the fourth Chamber of the Treasury, you find a door laid all <note place="margin">A Vault under ground, into which few have access.</note> about with good store of Iron-bars, which opens the first passage, to the place that contains the Grand Seignor's Secret Treasure. It is never open'd, but when he himself has a mind to enter into it; and he do's not enter into it, but when the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> advertises him, that it is time for him to do so, and that there is a considerable Sum to be carried in. In the first place, by the light of Torches they go down a Stair-Case of ten or twelve steps, at the bottom of which, after an advancement of seven or eight paces further, they find a second Door, fortify'd with Iron-work as the former, but much less, so that a man is oblig'd to stoop ere he go into it. When it is open'd, and that they have made their entrance through it, as if they had pass'd through a Wicket, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great Vault, where they find a great many Coffers, of the same largeness, as those of the Chamber we came last out of.</p>
                     <p>In those Coffers they have, for these many years, layd up all that was not expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The great fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi>
                        </note> upon the Publick account, of the great Revenues of the <hi>Ottoman-</hi>Monarchs, and so it may be call'd his Private Exchequer, into which there is nothing but Gold has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, all the Silver being carried into the other Treasury, to be thence taken out again and dispos'd of as occasion requir'd. After the death of <hi>Amurat, Ibrahim,</hi> his Successor in the Throne, found in that Treasury four thousand Bags, which they call <hi>Kizes,</hi> and every Bag contains fifteen thousand <hi>Ducats</hi> of Gold, which amount to thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Crowns,</hi> and those reduc'd to our Pounds, come to thirty Millions <hi>Sterling.</hi> 'Twas the same <hi>Amurat</hi> (a prudent and valiant Prince, a man of great Parsimony, and as great Conduct in Military Affairs, of whom I have often had occasion to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) who enter'd into a War against the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Bagdet,</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which he took on the 22th of <hi>December,</hi> 1638. I remember, that I was then but five days Journey from that place, in the Deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as having left <hi>Aleppo,</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:106224:298"/>
in order to my going to <hi>Balsara,</hi> and that of the Threescore and five dayes, which the Caravan spent in that Journey, for nine of them, we were destitute of Water, which must needs press very hard, both on the Men and the Camels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> therefore, at his coming to the Crown, found, in the secret Treasury, that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibrahim</hi> charg'd with ill management of the Treasury.</note> prodigious quantity of Gold, whereto he could not make any augmentation; nay some, on the contrary, are of opinion, That he was forc'd to use some part of it, through his ill Conduct of the Warr of <hi>Candia.</hi> True it is, That the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that Warre made a great hole in the Revenues of the Empire; but there are Two great Reasons, which divert me from giving absolute credit, to such as affirm, That those Exigencies reach'd the Secret Treasury. For, in short, it is as 'twere a fundamental Law among them, That, before any thing is taken out thence, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, the Empire should be in imminent danger of ruine; And it is manifest, That though the <hi>Turks</hi> could not reduce <hi>Candia</hi> under their Jurisdiction, yet their Empire was so far from being near its decadence, that it still continu'd powerful. Besides, it is to be observ'd, That when the Grand Seignor loses a Battle, it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to his Provinces, upon the score of their being thereby depopulated, and so much the less cultivated; but that it is an advantage to his Coffers, in regard there's so much the less comes out of them. The reason of it is evident, because he payes the Veteranes, or Souldiers of long standing, seven or eight <hi>Aspers</hi> a day, and that those of the new-rais'd Forces do not stand him in above one and a half, or two at the most; their pay augmenting with the time, answerably to their services, and the Prince's good Pleasure. Whereto it is to be added, That when an Emperour dies, his Successor augments the pay of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> by an <hi>Asper,</hi> or two, <hi>per diem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It must be acknowledg'd indeed, That there died a great number of <hi>Turks</hi> in the Warr of <hi>Candia:</hi> but it is certain also, That if we consider the great number of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Provinces, whereof the Empire consists, among which there are some very fertile, and very well peopled, it is an easie matter to raise numerous Armies, and to recruit them, when they have been weakned, by a Defeat, or by some Sickness, which often happens among them. Upon these two grounds, I cannot be induc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was oblig'd to make any diminution of the Secret Treasury: but I am very apt to believe, that he made not any great additions thereto, because he had not either the good Conduct, or good Fortune of <hi>Amurat,</hi> and ordinarily, the one avails not much without the other.</p>
                     <p>All the Gold that lies interr'd under that Vault is in Leather-bags, every Bag con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fifteen thousand <hi>Ducats,</hi> that is Seven thousand five hundred pounds <hi>sterling:</hi> and 'tis with his own hand that the Grand Seignor puts his Seal to them, which is the same that his Predecessors had us'd before him, save only the name, which must be that of the Prince then reigning. <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Seal had these words graven upon it, <hi>Nasrum min allahi abdihil melekil Mourath:</hi> Which signifies, <hi>The as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of God is upon his Servant the Emperour</hi> Amurath.</p>
                     <p>And this is the manner how the Bags of Gold are brought into the Secret Treasury. All the Gold and Silver which come into the Seraglio, is first carried into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">The Grand Seignor's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions for the security of his Treasury.</note> of the Treasury, and each of them is dispos'd into the Coffers design'd for them. When there is as much Gold as will amount to two hundred <hi>Kizes,</hi> the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> gives notice of it to the Grand Seignor, who appoints a day, for the disposal of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Secret Treasury. The day being come, the Grand Seignor, led under the Arm by the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> who is on the left hand, which is accounted the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> and by the <hi>Seligdar-Aga,</hi> who is on the right, comes into the Chamber of the Treasury, where the Sixty Pages expect him, ranked in order on both sides, with their hands cross their Breasts. The Grand Seignor, having pass'd through the Chamber, and order'd the first Door of the Secret Treasury to be open'd, enters into it, by the light of several Torches of white Wax, and is follow'd by the Pages, two by two, till they are within the Vault, into which the Bags are brought, ty'd with a Silk-string. Upon the string they put a piece of red soft Wax, whereto the Grand Seignor sets his Seal himself, which is upon a Gold-Ring, wherein are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106224:298"/>
the words before-mentioned, with the name of the Prince then reigning, after which they put the Bags into the Coffers, which are all double chain'd.</p>
                     <p>Before they come out of the Valut, the chief Officer of the Treasury, does ordinarily <note place="margin">His Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Grandees of the <hi>Port.</hi>
                        </note> make this Complement to the Grand Seignor; <hi>Seadetlu padichaim eumijd dur quibou bendelerignus euzre ihsan cherijfgnus izhar idesis:</hi> That is to say, <hi>My Emperour, we hope, that you will make a discovery of your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities to your Slaves.</hi> According to the humour the Grand Seignor is then in, he orders, That there should be a distribution of Twenty or Thirty Purses, amongst all those who have accompany'd him, every Purse, as I told you before, amounting to Five hundred Crowns. The Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> and the other Grandees of the Port, are permitted to enter into the Chambers of the Treasury, where the sumptuous Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and the Precious Stones are kept, when the Grand Seignor comes thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but they are not to go as far as the Secret Treasury. They stay for him in the Fourth Chamber, when he is to come out of the Vault, and then he orders the Coffer of his Jewels to be opened, to shew them the most precious things there are in it. And whereas there are alwayes some Favourites attending there, as also divers other persons, whom the Prince looks upon kindly upon the score of their merit, it seldom happens, but that they all receive some Present or other from him, and he makes not any, but what is of very considerable value. The Treasury being shut up, the Grand Seignor returns to his own Quarter, and all the Grandees accompany him to the Gate of it.</p>

                     <p>All the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> on whom the Grand Seignor bestowes Governments, and generally all those, who are remov'd out of the Seraglio, upon their advancement into Charges, <note place="margin">The <hi>Bassa's</hi> Presents to the <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> upon their advancements.</note> are oblig'd, before they take possession of them, to make him some Presents, every one, answerably to the benefit he has receiv'd from the Prince. For example, the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> assoon as ever he is nominated to that Government, knowes, that two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers, that is, reduc'd to the <hi>English</hi> account, two hundred thousand pounds <hi>sterling,</hi> will hardly make good the Presents, which are expected from him at the Port, that is, those due to the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> himself, and to the principal <hi>Sultanesses;</hi> as also to the <hi>Moufti,</hi> the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> and other Persons of Credit in the Court, to whom he is engag'd for his advancement to that Charge, and of whom he may stand in need for the future. The Present he makes the Grand Seignor himself, amounts to Five hundred thousand Crowns, and the rest will come to Two hundred thousand. Add again to that, Five hundred thousand Crowns, which will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the <hi>Bassa's</hi> equipage, and so, before he sets his foot in <hi>Cairo,</hi> his own Purse, or those of his Friends, will be drain'd of Three Millions and six hundred thousand Livers.</p>
                     <p>When he comes out of the Seraglio, if he want much of the aforesaid Summe, there is a necessity of borrowing; and if the purses of his Friends cannot do it, those of the <note place="margin">The hazardous Trade of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Jewes</hi> are readily open'd for his supply. They run a great hazard, upon hopes of the great profit of making <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> interest, which the <hi>Bassa</hi> does promise them. And, to be the sooner reimburs'd of the Money they have so hazarded, lest his Government be but a short one, they teach him a thousand leud wayes, to suck out the People's blood, and particularly to harass the poor <hi>Christians.</hi> If the <hi>Bassa's</hi> can but quietly enjoy their Governments, for one year, nay for six Months, the <hi>Jewes</hi> make a good hand of it, and recover the Summes they had advanc'd. But, on the other side, they run a great hazard, in regard that it happens, many times, the Grand Seignor sends for the head of a <hi>Bassa,</hi> before he has had time enough to settle himself in his new
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106224:299"/>
Government, and then, they who have lent him Mony are not to hope ever to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any part of it.</p>
                     <p>From what has been said, it may easily be concluded, That the greatest part of the Mony of the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, is in the Grand Seignor's hands, and among the <hi>Jewes;</hi> I mean the <hi>Jewes</hi> of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> For as to those who live in the Provinces, the world goes but ill with them, and they are in a much more wretched condition, than the <hi>Christians;</hi> in regard they do not follow any thing of Husbandry: and their inclinations being altogether bent for Traffick, and the management of the publick Taxes or the Customes, 'tis impossible there should be employment for them all.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor therefore receives very considerable Summes from the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s <note place="margin">The extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Wealth of the <hi>Bassa's.</hi>
                        </note> and other persons, on whom he bestowes Charges, even before they have taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of them. But that amounts to little or nothing, in comparison of the advantages which he makes, upon their removal out of them, and especially when they have had a fair time to gather Treasures, by their insupportable exactions from the people. Some of these <hi>Bassa's</hi> have come to that excessive Wealth and Power, that their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues were equal to those of many great Princes. Such was the fortune of one <hi>Mach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut, Beglierbeg</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second; and that, of the Grand <hi>Vizir, Nassuf,</hi> under <hi>Achmet</hi> the First. At the death of the latter, there were extraordinary Riches found in his House, in Silver, Gold, and Jewels, and all was brought to the Seraglio, along with his head.</p>
                     <p>It may easily be conjectur'd, by the number of the greater and lesser Governments, whereof the Empire consists, that there is a considerable mortality amongst those, who derive their Charges and Fortunes from the pure Munificence of the Grand Seignor, and whose acquisitions thereupon falling to him, must of necessity make vast additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to the Seraglio. But besides those who are gently convey'd out of this World, by a natural death, there hardly passes a year, but violent death comes and acts its part; and upon the least jealousie, or any fantastick apprehension the Grand Seignor may have, a <hi>Bassa</hi> receives a peremptory Order to stretch out his Neck, and he is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately strangled: In the next Chapter, I shall give the Reader an Account, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and ceremony, which is observ'd upon that occasion, where he will find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worth his remarking; and I think I may confidently affirm, That they who know it is the custome, to strangle those, whose Lives the Grand Seignor would take away, know not all the Particulars observable in that Action.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as a <hi>Bassa,</hi> or other Grandee of the Port is dead, howe're it came to pass, <note place="margin">The <hi>Bassa's</hi> Goods brought into the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio.</hi>
                        </note> and an Inventory of his Goods taken, of which by the Lawes of the Country the Prince is the only Heir, all is carried away into the Seraglio, and the <hi>Baltagis</hi> bring it in Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the Door of the Treasury. The <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> having dispos'd them into one of the Chambers, Commands the Locks to be broke open, and the Coffers to be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied in his presence; and 'tis then, that as well he himself, as the Pages of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury endeavour to make their advantages of that Rich Booty. For there being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, amongst the other things, Jewels of great value, such as that wherein the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron-tops are fasten'd in their Turbants, or a Ponyard enrich'd with precious Stones, or some Carcanet of Pearls, if one or other of those Pages can make a dextrous and clean conveyance of some Piece, 'tis his own, and he puts it to what else he has in Stock, reflecting on what he has to do, at his departure out of the Seraglio, in order to his establishment in some Charge, and the great Expences he must be at upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> who does his work first of all, and with more liberty, does sometimes connive at what he sees done by the others, remembring that he has been as they are, and was then glad, that he was not reprov'd for so doing. Yet if he perceives that any one of them has secur'd to himself a piece of great value, assoon as he is got to his Chamber, he secretly sends for him, and makes him restore it, paying him one half of its worth, and so keeps it himself.</p>
                     <p>There are yet other great advantages accrewing to the Chief Officer, and the Pages, <note place="margin">The great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> and the Pages of the Treasury.</note> from those things which are brought into the Seraglio, upon the death of the <hi>Bassa's.</hi> When the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi</hi> has advertis'd the Grand Seignor, that, in the Coffers, which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106224:300"/>
had been brought in, there were many things not fit for the Service of his Highness, and that it were better to put them off, before they were injur'd by the moisture or the dust; the Prince gives his permission for the sale thereof, and thereupon they take out of the Treasury what they do not account worthy of a place there. Immediately, they send for the <hi>Bazarcan-bachi,</hi> or Chief of the Merchants, who is the best skill'd in those things, and who, in the presence of the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> and the Pages of the Treasury, sets a value on every piece, to their satisfaction; for he does not prize it at above half the worth. All the Jewels that will bear a good price, and all the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones are dispos'd into the Treasury, and they expose to sale only things of less value, yet such as are worth much, as Trappings for Horses, Ponyards Sabres, garnish'd with Gold, garments, rich Furres, Sasches, Turbants, and other things of that nature; all the pieces being valued, the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi</hi> sets aside the best of them, to be sent, together with the value set upon them to the principal persons of the Seraglio, with whom he is glad to hold a fair correspondence, and they pay for them the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, because they have them at an easie rate. The rest is distributed among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, according to the valuation, and they having made choice of such things as they will keep themselves, send away what they do not like, to be sold in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by the <hi>Halvagis,</hi> wherein they also make a vast advantage, considering the apprisement; not accounting what the same <hi>Halvagis</hi> may hedge in for themselves, as a compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their trouble.</p>
                     <p>When there is such a sale made, the <hi>Jewes</hi> are alwaies waiting about the great Gate of the Seraglio, not daring to come too near, for fear of a chastisement of the Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, from the <hi>Kapigis,</hi> which they are very free to give them. They stand in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of these <hi>Halvagis,</hi> with their bags full of Ducats and Ryals, and make the best bargains they can with them. These sales are seldom made above once in two years, and the least of them does ordinarily exceed five hundred thousand Crowns, nay some have amounted to eight hundred Thousand. The Grand Seignor is soon advertis'd, what money has been rais'd by the sale, and giving orders for the disposal of it into the Treasury, he at the same time bestows ten or twenty Purses on the principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and the Pages of the Treasury. He does not make them that Present out of any other design, then to shew his Grandeur, as being not ignorant of the advantages they have made by the Sale: but he tolerates that custome, and knows well enough, that sooner or later, all those profits will come again into the Treasury.</p>
                     <p>'Tis upon the same consideration, that the Grand Seignor permits a manifest breach <note place="margin">The prohibition to lend at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</note> of the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which prohibits the taking of any interest for money lent; for he suffers the Pages and others, to lend considerable sumes, to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> at the rate of fifteen upon the hundred, interest. And the <hi>Persians</hi> have found out a very pleasant evasion, to stave off the reproach which might be made to them, of their transgressing against the same prohibition.</p>
                     <p>The evasion is this. When they lend out money to any one, they have a Bill or Schedule made of the sum that's lent. Then they compute what the interest will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount <note place="margin">The <hi>Persians</hi> ill Casuists.</note> to, which is commonly after the rate of twelve in the Hundred. That done, they take a handkerchief, or some old Sasche, and giving it to the Person whom they lend the money to, they make him write a second Note, upon the score of the interest, wherein it is exprest, that the debt is for commodities bought, and duely receiv'd. And thus do they think to elude the reproaches of their own Consciences, and imagine, that they do not offend against the prohibition of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The promise, which the Debtor makes, in writing, is not sign'd by him, it being not the custom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but he puts his seal to it. And yet that too is not sufficient, and it is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that they go before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> or the Judge of the Law, who consummates the work, by putting his own Seal to the writing.</p>
                     <p>I have made appear, in this Chapter, the Means and Expedients, which the Grand Seignor makes use of, to augment his Revenues; we shall see in the next, the wayes he has to exercise his Liberalities, without any charge at all to himself.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Commendable Policy of the</hi> Turks. <hi>The Ceremonies attending the Presents, sent by the Grand Seignor, to those whom he would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The particular way us'd by</hi> Mahomet <hi>the Fourth, to shew himself liberal, without any charge to himself. Formalities observ'd at the Death of the</hi> Bassa's, <hi>who are strangled by the Prince's orders. When, and how they strike off the Head in</hi> Turkey. <hi>A prohibition against shedding the blood of the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans, <hi>who are condemn'd to death. The Inventories of the Goods of</hi> Bassa's <hi>deceas'd, not faithfully taken. The causes indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the</hi> Turks <hi>to defie Death with so much constancy. How difficult it is to get out of</hi> Turkey. <hi>Presents made to the</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanesses.</p>
                     <p>THE Two expedients which the Grand Seignor makes use of to augment his Treasury, besides what comes in by the ordinary revenues of the Empire, are much of the same nature, with those he uses, to bestow great largesses, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disbursing any thing himself. He makes his advantages of all; the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's</hi> are as so many spunges, and he squeezes them, as well while they are living, as when they are dead, and at their cost, assignes recompences to those, who have done him some acceptable service. Let us take things in order, one after another, and shew in the first place, how he manages his subtle design, while the <hi>Bassa's</hi> are living, in getting out of them wherewithall to make ample gratifications, without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Revenues.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the Political maximes of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, this is one of the most remarkable. They would have the <hi>Bassa's</hi> to be respected in their several Governments, by the People, as much as if they were there themselves in Person: and to make a greater, and more lively impression of that veneration in their minds, they think it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to honour them, from time to time, with some Present, which is carried to them with much Ceremony. This Present, which is a certain demonstration of the Esteem, which the Prince has for the Person to whom he sends it, is commonly some rich Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when he is willing to make it compleat, he adds the Sabre, and the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, garnish'd and adorn'd with precious stones. The Grand Seignor, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration before-mentioned, finding himself as it were oblig'd to make a Present to that <hi>Bassa,</hi> knowes well enough, that he will be sure, on the other side, to send him one which shall be worth ten times as much, and to make another to his Envoy, which he must look on as a recompence of his Services.</p>
                     <p>But it is not alwayes the Grand Seignor's design, by such Presents, to honour the <hi>Bassa,</hi> and keep the People the more in subjection to him. It happens many times,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106224:301"/>
that when he intends to ruine him, he makes him a Present, that he may thence take occasion, in case he does not receive another from him, such as he desires, to send an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Messenger for his Head. The Present, upon that occasion, is not a Vest, or Garment, but, a Sword, or a Battle-Axe, which are very Ominous Presents, and Advertisements to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> that the Grand Seignor has little kindness for him. To divert the Storm, which he sees likely to fall upon him, he doubles the Present he should have made, in case he had sent him but a Vest, which is a pledge of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if that <hi>Bassa</hi> be one of those, who Commands in the greater Governments, the Present which he sends to the Grand Seignor, ought not to amount to less than Two hundred Purses, that is to say, a Hundred thousand Crowns, not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is particularly given to the person who is sent by the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>The persons charg'd with this Commission are, for the most part, such as the <note place="margin">The Ceremonies attending the Presents sent by the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> to those whom he would honour.</note> Grand Seignor is willing to be Munificent to. So that, all things consider'd, the Present is not so much design'd for him who receives it, as for him who sends it, and the person who carries it: And in this consists the artifice of exercising great Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without disbursing any thing. The Ceremony perform'd at the delivery of this Present of the Grand Seignor, is this: He who carries it being come to the place where the <hi>Bassa</hi> lives, to whom it is sent, and having advertis'd him of it, this latter, with the noise of Drums, Trumpets, and Hawboys, assembles the people together, some of whom mount themselves on Horse-back, to do him the greater honour. The <hi>Bassa</hi> himself marches in the Head of all, and they who are not mounted follow afoot, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Curtezans, or common Strumpets, of the place, who are oblig'd to assist at this Ceremony, dancing after a Tabour, and putting themselves into a thousand lascivious postures, according to the Custome of the Country.</p>
                     <p>The Messenger who brings the Present makes a halt, in expectation of this Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, in some Garden near the City, or in the Fields under a Tent, which he had got set up for that purpose. After mutual Salutations, he casts the Vest over the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s shoulders, puts the Sabre by his Side, and thrusts the Ponyard into his Sasche before his Breast, telling him, That the Emperour, their Master, honours him with that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, upon the good report which had been made to him, that he has demean'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self well, that he does not tyrannize over his People, and that there is no complaint made, of his being defective in the administration of Justice.</p>
                     <p>This Complement past, the <hi>Bassa,</hi> in the same order, and amidst the Joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the people, takes his way, and the Grand Seignor's Envoy along with him, towards his House, where he entertains him at a great Treat, and, after all is done, with a Present, which amounts to Ten thousand Crowns at the least. For, as I told you before, if the Present be carried to one of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> who are in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Governments, as the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Buda, Cairo,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> they shall not escape under Thirty or Forty thousand Crowns, and the Present which is sent to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> ought to amount to a hundred thousand. Nay it many times happens, that the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor appoints what he would have their Present to his Envoy to amount to, and that especially, when he sends such as he has a particular kindness for, and would amply gratifie.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Fourth, who now sits on the Throne, has a particular inclination to exercise Liberality, and to bestow Rewards on those who serve him; <note place="margin">The particular way us'd by <hi>Mahomet IV.</hi> to shew himself liberal, without any Charge.</note> but he does it, so as that it costs him nothing, and consequently, there is no occasion of taking ought out of the Treasury. When there is not an opportunity to send the Person, whom he has a desire to gratifie, into the Country, with some Present, he has another Expedient, which will do the work. His Darling-Divertisement is Hunting, and he takes but little pleasure in any other Exercise. He thereupon orders the Person, whom he would recompence, to be one at the Sport, and having kill'd a Stagg, or some other Beast, he orders him to go and present it, from him, to one of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Port, whose abode is either at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or some place near it.</p>
                     <p>This Present is receiv'd with great demonstrations of joy, real, or apparent, and the person, to whom it is brought, is immediately to take order for the sending back
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106224:301"/>
of another, much exceeding it in value, to the Grand Seignor. And that consists or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in excellent Horses, good pieces of Gold-Brockado, or rich Furrs. But his work is yet not half over; there must be much more done for him, through whose hands he has receiv'd the Present, and he scapes very well, when, not accounting what he sends to the Grand Seignor, the carriage of it costs him but Ten thousand Crowns. Nay many times, he is forc'd to double the Summe, when he has not been so liberal, as the Prince expected he should have been; for he presently dispatches away an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, to reproach him with the slender account he has made of his Present, and the small recompence he had receiv'd, whom he had employ'd to bring it him. To these reproaches he sends him an express Order, to make him an additional Reward of Twenty or thirty Purses, which is immediately put in execution: and as to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which the Grand Seignor has receiv'd, he commonly makes a distribution of it, amongst those, who are then about him.</p>
                     <p>And these are the Advantages which the Grand Seignor screws out of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and other Grandees of the Port, whilst they are alive. Let us now consider those which accrew to him by their death, in order to the recompensing of those, whom he favours, without being oblig'd to take any thing out of his Coffers. When the death of a <hi>Bassa</hi> is resolv'd upon, the Grand Seignor delivers the Commission to him, whom he has design'd to be kind to; and he finds it much more advantageous, to bring him the Sentence of his death, than to bring him a Present from the Prince.</p>
                     <p>If the Execution is to be done in <hi>Constantiuople,</hi> the ordinary Executioner is the <note place="margin">Formalities ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd at the death of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> who are strangled by the Prince's Orders.</note> 
                        <hi>Bostangi-bachi,</hi> who is alwaies about the Grand Seignor's Person, and he himself does the Work. But if there be a necessity of going into some remote Province, 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly either a <hi>Kapigi-bachi,</hi> or one of the principal <hi>Bostangis,</hi> whom the Prince has a mind to shew his kindness to, who is sent to perform the Execution. He who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Order, accompany'd by five or six <hi>Capigis,</hi> sometimes manages his Affairs so, as to arrive at the place, while the Council is sitting. But if that cannot be so order'd, he goes to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> and commands him in the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s name, to call one imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. That Council consists of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> Lieutenant, the <hi>Mufti,</hi> the <hi>Cadi,</hi> the chief Commander of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> belonging to that place, and some other persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the administration of Justice, who are of the most considerable of the Province.</p>
                     <p>The Council being assembled, the <hi>Capigi-bachi</hi> enters, attended by his people and presents the <hi>Bassa</hi> with the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s Letter. He receives it with great respect, and having put it three several times to his forehead, he opens it, reads it, and finds that the Prince demands his head. He makes no other answer to that Order, then what he does in these few words; <hi>Let the Will,</hi> sayes he, <hi>of my Emperour be done: only give me leave to say my Prayers;</hi> which is granted him. His Prayers being ended, the <hi>Capigis</hi> seize him by the Arms, and the chief of them presently takes off his Girdle or Sasche, and casts it about his Neck. That Girdle consists of several small strings of Silk, with knots at both ends, which two of the company immediately catch hold of, and one drawing one way, and the other, t'other-way, they dispatch him in an instant.</p>
                     <p>If they are unwilling to make use of their Girdle, they take a handkerchief, and with the Ring which they use, in the bending of their Bowes, and which they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily wear on the right-hand Thumb, they thrust the hand between the handkerchief, which is ty'd very close, and the Throat, and so break the very Throat-Bone. Thus they make a shift to strangle a man in an instant, suffering him not to languish in pain, that he may dye a faithful <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and not have the time to enter into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair; the <hi>Turks</hi> thinking our way of hanging Criminals, who are so long in torment upon the Gibbet, a strange kind of Execution.</p>
                     <p>Though I have often us'd this expression, That the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> sends to demand <note place="margin">When and how they strike of the Head in <hi>Turkey.</hi>

place with Hay; and it was my fortune to see two Heads so order'd, at the same time, which they carried in a Bag. They were the Heads of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Kars,</hi> and <hi>Erzerom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is further to be observ'd, That when the Sentence of death is pass'd by the Prince against any one, what quality soever he may be of, the <hi>Turks</hi> make no further account of him; and when they speak of him, treat him no otherwise than they would do a Dog. The <hi>Bostangi,</hi> who had been commissionated to bring those two Heads to the Grand Seignor, finding himself weary and indispos'd at a Village in <hi>Armenia,</hi> where it was my chance to be at that time, and having understood, that there was a <hi>French-</hi>man in the Inne, ask'd one of my Servants whether I had any Wine, and would be content to let him have any, to cheer up his spirits. I immediately sent him some in a large Flaggon; whereupon having intreated me to come and take a Glass with him, which I thought it not fit to deny, he would needs shew me, whether I would or no, the Heads of those two <hi>Bassa's;</hi> a sight I had no great curiosity to see.</p>
                     <p>When there is no order given for the bringing of the Head, they bury the Body about Mid-night, without any ceremony, and the memory of the <hi>Bassa,</hi> who had made so much noise before, is soon extinguish'd and laid in the dust. But it is moreover to be <note place="margin">A Prohibition against shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> who are condemn'd to death.</note> noted, That it is the Custome in <hi>Turkey,</hi> not to cut off the Head of any one, till after they have strangled him, and that the blood is quite cold; it being against their Law, That the blood of a <hi>Mussulman</hi> (that is, one of the Faithful) should be spilt, upon any occasion, but in Warr.</p>
                     <p>The execution being over, he who brought the Order for it, makes an immediate Seizure of all that belong'd to the deceas'd <hi>Bassa;</hi> and after he has set aside what he <note place="margin">The Inventories of the Goods of <hi>Bassa's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd, not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken.</note> liked best for his own use, whether in Gold or Jewels, he brings the same persons, who had been at the precedent Councel, to proceed to the Inventory of his Goods, which are afterwards, as I have said elsewhere, transmitted to the Chambers of the Treasury. They who are assistant at the taking of that Inventory, know well enough, that many things, which belong'd to the deceas'd, are embezill'd, but they are so far from repining or murmuring at it, that they sign and attest, that there was not any more found. They are afraid, if they demean'd themselves otherwise, lest that Officer of the Seraglio, whom the Grand Seignor has sent, and who possibly is in favour, should do them ill offices at the Court, and spread some false report of them; whence, according to the example they have then before their eyes, might happen, in like manner, the loss of their Charges, and Lives.</p>
                     <p>They therefore think it prudence, to connive at what ever is done by that Envoy, as being otherwise perswaded, that he will not be disown'd by the Grand Seignor, who is not ignorant of what's done upon those occasions. Nay, on the contrary, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may have dextrously secur'd to himself of the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s Goods, they make him some additional Presents of their own, at his departure from them, engaging him thereby, to speak well of them to the Grand Seignor, and to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> at his return to the Port. And then also, not accounting what he had taken before-hand, and what Custome tolerates, he receives new marks of the Liberality of his Prince, who is satisfy'd that he has so faithfully executed his Orders: and so he participates of what is set down in the Inventory, when the <hi>Bassa's</hi> Goods are brought into the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>Some, possibly, will be apt to imagine, that this Sentence of Death pass'd in the Grand Seignor's Letter, should raise some disturbance and astonishment in the Soul of <note place="margin">The Causes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Turks</hi> to defie Diath with so much constancy.</note> him who reads it, and who reading therein his own Condemnation, knowes that it must be immediately executed. Yet is it not apparent in his Countenance, that he is much startled at it, he is not surpriz'd therewith, he sees that few of his Companions escape the same sate, and he has dispos'd himself for such an end, assoon as he first took possession of his Charge. Besides, the <hi>Turks</hi> have a strong perswasion, That the Decrees of Predestination are irrevocable, and that it is impossible to avoid them; which makes them look Death in the face, with such a degree of constancy and intrepidity, as renders them in a manner insensible. To which reflection we may adde this, That that ready and implicite obedience and submission of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to the Orders of their Soveraign, is rather a principle of Religion, than of State, which has been instill'd into
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106224:302"/>
them, by a most subtle piece of Politicks; and they believe, That, if they dye by the Command of their Prince, they go streight into Paradise.</p>
                     <p>As for the opportunity of making an escape out of <hi>Turkey,</hi> by any one who might <note place="margin">The Difficulties of making an Escape out of <hi>Turkey.</hi>
                        </note> have some presentiment of his destruction, it is to no purpose to think of it. All the Officers, and the Slaves, whom the <hi>Bassa's</hi> have in their Retinue, are so many Spies, and observers of their Actions; and it is impossible for them, to conceal what they do from them. 'Twere dangerous for a man to entrust a Secret with any one of them; they are mean Souls, and uncapable of any gallant Action, besides that the Ports and Passages are equally shut up against both. If there be the least discovery made thereof, the Governour of the Frontier places would immediately have Orders from the Port, to take the Field; nay if there were not any such, they are but over-diligent, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after, and informing themselves of all those, who pass through the extent of their Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>Besides, though there were some likelihood of compassing it, and that, travelling only in the Night time, a man might get into some Neighbouring State; yet <hi>Turkey</hi> being in a manner quite surrounded by Nations who abhor the Domination of the <hi>Ottomans;</hi> 'twere as much as to leap out of the Frying-pan into the Fire, and to go and pass for a Spy, amongst a fort of people, who would give no quarter. Whence it might be imagin'd, that there were less difficulty in attempting an escape by Sea, than to hazard it by land: but the former is the much more difficult, and the severe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions made to the <hi>Christians,</hi> upon pain of death, not to take any <hi>Turk</hi> or Slave, into their Ships, which are exactly search'd, before they weigh Anchor, shut up all the Ports of <hi>Turkey,</hi> against those of the Country, who might be desirous to get out of it.</p>
                     <p>True it is, however, that few years pass, but that a considerable number of Slaves are convey'd away, by the charity and contrivances of the <hi>Christian</hi> Consuls, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. They are secretly kept at the Houses of some <hi>Christian</hi> Inhabitants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whose secrecy and silence are bought with Mony; and the same receipt stops the mouths of those, who have the over-sight of the Ports, and are warmly entertain'd with drinking, while they cunningly get the Slaves aboard the Vessel, which has been visited, and is then ready to set sail. They would be loath to run themselves into that danger for natural <hi>Turks:</hi> there would be some ground to fear, that it might be some Plot on their side, to surprize and try the <hi>Christians;</hi> and it seldom happens that they have a thought of making any escape. They know well enough, that, whether it be by Sea, or Land, (excepting only the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> where they are hated upon the account of the difference of Sects) they cannot make their escape any where but into Christendom, where they would not be permitted the exercise of their <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, which they would not renounce for a thousand lives.</p>
                     <p>E're we close up the Discourse concerning the Liberality of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, it is to be observ'd, That sometimes they make very considerable Presents, which they <note place="margin">Presents made to the Sultanes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> take out of the Grand Treasury, and which are paid in Silver only, if they are order'd for the Grandees of the Port, whether in the Seraglio, or out of it. Those Presents consists ordinarily of a Purse of Gold, which amounts to Fifteen thousand <hi>Ducats,</hi> or Thirty thousand <hi>Crowns;</hi> and when there are any such made to the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> they receive all in Gold. To do that, there's no occasion of going to the Secret Treasury, there is gold enough in the Fourth Chamber, into which they at first bring in all the Gold and Silver of all the Revenues of the Empire; and that Summe, which makes no great hole in the great heap, returns again into the same place, by several waies.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third part of the Revenue of</hi> Egypt, <hi>how employ'd. The great Wealth of the</hi> Sheck <hi>of</hi> Mecha. <hi>Ceremonies observ'd at</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met's <hi>Tomb.

                     <p>THat I make here a particular Chapter of the Present, which the Grand Seignor sends every Year to <hi>Mecha,</hi> is occasion'd by this third part of the Revenue of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is peculiarly design'd for it; and upon this Consideration withall, That I have singular Remarks to make upon that subject.</p>
                     <p>Three Millions of <hi>Livers,</hi> of Twelve, of annual Revenue, which the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> payes the <hi>Grand Seignor,</hi> are partly expended in the Rich Carpet, and the Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">The third part of the Revenue of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how employ'd.</note> Tent, which he sends to the <hi>Sheck,</hi> every year, in honour to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb. Another part goes to the payment of those who serve in the Mosqueys; As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the <hi>Imans,</hi> who are their Priests; the <hi>Cheuchs,</hi> who are their Preachers; the <hi>Muezims,</hi> who, by their noise on the Towers of the Mosqueys, call the people to their Devotions; and the <hi>Kaijms</hi> of <hi>Mecha</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> who look to, and keep clean the Mosqueys, and light the Lamps. We must also put into the Account of these Three Millions, the Sustenance of all the Pilgrims for the space of Seventeen dayes, the Grand Seignor sending, for that end, a sufficient Summe to the <hi>Sheck.</hi> This <hi>Sheck,</hi> who is, as 'twere, the Supream Person upon the score of the Law, and the High Priest of all the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> what Country and Sect soever they be of, makes the poor ignorant people believe, that there come every year to <hi>Mecha,</hi> Seventy thousand Pilgrims, Men and Women; and if that number were not compleat, the Angels would come in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane forms, to make it up.</p>
                     <p>This Prince, whom we call the <hi>Sheck,</hi> for whom all the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> have a great Veneration, is very Rich, and very powerful, and that may be easily conjectur'd, by <note place="margin">The great Wealth of the <hi>Sheck</hi> of <hi>Mecha.</hi>
                        </note> the Presents, which he receives every year from the Grand Seignor, and the other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Princes. These Presents are all his own, to be dispos'd of as he pleases, at the end of the Year, when new ones are sent to him. He makes his advantage also of all the Presents that are made by the Pilgrims, and of the Summes of Mony, which those very Princes send him, to be distributed in Alms, which he also disposes of as he pleases; and all these Presents put together, make him such a Revenue as is hardly imaginable. For <hi>Mahumetisme</hi> spreads very much into <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and that much more then is commonly believ'd, as I shall more distinctly make it appear, at the end of my Relation, in a particular Chapter, which I design for the handling of that matter.</p>
                     <p>From several Parts of the World, there come Caravans to <hi>Mecha,</hi> and when the Devotion is to begin, the High Priest, assisted by all the people belonging to the Law, <note place="margin">Ceremonies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s Tomb.</note> spends night and day, in saying of Prayers, and performing the necessary Ceremonies. On the Seventh day, all the Pilgrims are assembled together before the <hi>Sheck's</hi> Tent,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106224:303"/>
who appears at the entrance of it, and standing upon a low Stool, that he may be seen by those who are at the greatest distance from him, Prayes, and gives his Benediction to all the people, putting a period to the Devotion, with these words, <hi>That God would enable them to return in Peace, as they came thither.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From that minute, every one must bethink himself, that he is to be at his own charge; the <hi>Sheck</hi> gives no more, and 'tis then that he begins to make great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to himself. For whatever is sold for the Sustenance of the Pilgrims, comes from him; and besides, he holds a correspondence with the Masters of the Caravans, of whom the Pilgrims are forc'd to buy conveniences for their riding back again, at more then three times the rate they are worth, when the Beasts they had brought out of their own Countries have fail'd them by the way.</p>
                     <p>The Caravan of <hi>Cairo</hi> is the most numerous, and the most considerable of all the <note place="margin">The Caravan of <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                        </note> Caravans, that come to <hi>Mecha.</hi> The <hi>Caravan-bachi,</hi> who is the Captain and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor of it, makes his gains by it, at his return, worth him Two hundred thousand Crowns; and there is a great competition about his place, which is at the disposal of the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and commonly carried by the highest bidder for it. The Captain of this Caravan is also Master of the Waters, which are carried into the Cisterns, and it is according to his Orders that they are distributed; and whereas that distribution is equal, as well in relation to the Poor, as to the Rich, if the latter would have any beyond the quantity allow'd them, they must pay dearly for it; and the Captain, who sets what imposition he pleases upon it, makes a considerable advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                     <p>But let us return to the Grand Seignor's Present. The Tent, and the Carpet, which <note place="margin">The Present sent from <hi>Mecha</hi> to the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul.</hi>
                        </note> he sends, are two Pieces equally precious, as well for the excellency of the Stuffe, as the additional embellishments hereof. The Carpet is design'd for the covering of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s Tomb; and the Tent, which is erected hard by the Mosquey, is for the <hi>Sheck,</hi> who does not stirr out of it, during the Seventeen dayes of Devotion. This High Priest of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law, has found out the secret knack, of extracting inexpressible Summes of Mony, out of that Carpet and Tent, which are renew'd every year: and when the new Present is arriv'd from the Grand Seignor, he sends, as 'twere out of a singular favour, certain pieces of the Curtain of the old Tent, to several <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes, of whom he receives Magnificent Presents in requital. This Curtain, which is set up on the out-side of the Tent, quite round it, to hinder the people from seeing those that are under it, consists of several pieces, six foot high, and of a great length: and the <hi>Sheck</hi> endeavours to perswade those Princes, That if they fasten one of those pieces to their Tents, when they are going to engage in a War, against those whom they account Infidels, good fortune will be sure to attend them, and it will not be long e're they gain the Victory. But if he sends either the whole Curtain, or the Tent, or Carpet entire, it must be to a great Monarch indeed, such as the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> or the Great <hi>Mogul:</hi> and that he does, once in ten, or twelve years; one while to the one, and another, to the other.</p>
                     <p>Of this we have a late instance, in <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> who at the present is King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and whom we otherwise call the <hi>Great Mogul.</hi> For upon his establishment in his Throne, the <hi>Sheck</hi> sent him the whole Curtain belonging to the Tent; and great joy there was at his Court, that the King had receiv'd so Magnificent a Present, from the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> as they call it. The <hi>Sheck</hi> was soon after made sensible of the Royal Liberality of that Great Monarch, one of the Richest and most Powerful of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; and thus does that Spiritual Head of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, who has a kind of Superintendency over all the Members, know how to make his advantage of them, and has found out the way, to enrich himself, at the cost of all the Princes and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who submit themselves to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p>I question not, but that they who have writ of the Religion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> have given some account of the Pilgrimage of <hi>Mecha,</hi> which is one of the most essential parts thereof; and therefore, as well for that reason, as also for that I should digress
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106224:304"/>
too much from my subject, I ought not to prosecute that matter any farther. I shall take occasion here, to make three Remarks, which I have originally learnt, of one of the most learned in the Rubricks of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p>The first is, that the <hi>Turks,</hi> by an ancient Tradition, believe, That <hi>Mecha</hi> is the place, where God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to build him a house; and that while he was there, all Nations came thronging to visit him: and that it is also the same place, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> receiv'd the Alcoran, from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The second relates to the Commandement impos'd upon all the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> to be, once in their lives, concern'd in the Pilgrimage of <hi>Mecha.</hi> For it is to be observ'd, That the obligation does not extend to the poorer sort of people, who have hardly wherewithal to live upon, and would bring great misery on their Families, by their absence, as being not able to leave them what is requisite for their sustenance.</p>
                     <p>The third Remark is concerning the preference of the two Cities of <hi>Mecha,</hi> and <hi>Medina.</hi> The former is the place of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s birth, which it was his design to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and make known, by that famous Pilgrimage, whereto he obliges all those of his Law. The latter is the place of his Burial, of which there is abundance of fabulous relations. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in his Alcoran, does only enjoyn their going to <hi>Mecha,</hi> where there are no other Relicks of that false Prophet, then one of his Sandalls: And the Doctors of the Law are also of opinion, that there is no obligation of going to <hi>Medina,</hi> and that without seeing that City, a man satisfies the Command of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> I shall treat at large of the Pilgrimage of <hi>Mecha,</hi> in the last Chapter of this Relation of my Travels, and of the different Roads by which the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> are conducted to the Tomb of their Prophet.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ancient Custome practis'd, when the Grand Seignor is presented with any thing to drink, between meals. A way to quench thirst at meals, wholly particular to the</hi> Levantines. <hi>The composition of Treacle. A stately service of Gold-Plate. Beds according to the</hi> Turkish <hi>mode. Waies to satisfie the necessities of Nature different from ours. The Causes of the abominable Sin committed by the</hi> Turks, <hi>who are confin'd within the Seraglio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Have discover'd many things particularly observable, concerning the Treasury of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, and there are yet some very Remarkable passages to be <note place="margin">The Ancient Custome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd when the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> drinks between Meals.</note> communicated, relating to the other Quarters of the inner part of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio.</p>
                     <p>Between the Treasury, and an obscure Vaulted Gallery, in length between Fifteen and Twenty paces, which conducts you to an Iron-Door, by which there is a passage into the Gardens, you find, on the left hand, the Appartment of the Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> or the Cup-Bearer's Office. That is the place where they prepare the Sherbets, and other Liquors, for the Grand Seignor's own drinking, and where they keep the Wine, if it happens, that he drinks any, as Sultan <hi>Amurath</hi> did, of whom I have often had occasion to speak. 'Tis an ancient Custome, That when the Grand Seignor calls for Water, to drink between meals, every time he so calls costs him ten <hi>Sequins,</hi> or <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins.</hi> The Ceremony observ'd therein is this: In the Chamber call'd the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> which is the Appartment of the Forty-Pages, who are alwayes near the Grand Selg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Person, there is perpetually one of them standing Sentinel at the Entrance, which leads to the Cup-Bearer's Office, where two Pages of the same Quarter are in like manner upon the Sentry. When the Grand Seignor is thirsty, and calls for water, the Page of the <hi>Haz-Oda</hi> immediately makes a sign to the two Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> of whom one advances up to the <hi>Kilar-bachi,</hi> or Cup-Bearer himself, crying out <hi>Sou,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Water, to advertise him, that the Prince would drink; and the other runs to the door of the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> where the most ancient of the Forty Pages gives him Ten <hi>Sequins.</hi> That Page is the Treasurer of the said Chamber, and he payes the small Sums which the Grand Seignor gives order for, an Office which might be call'd in <hi>English,</hi> The <hi>Treasurer of the petty Enjoyments.</hi> The Water is sometimes brought in a Cup of Gold, sometimes in a Vessel of Pourcelain, placed upon a large Server of Gold, about two foot diameter, and enrich'd with Precious Stones within and without. That is look'd on, as one of the richest pieces of Plate belonging to the Seraglio. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cup-Bearer, who is a white Eunuch, carries it with great Ceremony, attended by a hundred Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> whom he ordinarily has under his Charge, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held under the Arms by two of them, who walk on both sides of him. For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, That he should carry it lifted up above his head, and so he cannot see his way but by looking under it. When he is come to the Door of the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> the Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> who have accompany'd him so far, pass no further, save only the two who uphold his Arms, and the Pages of the Chamber go along with him quite into the Grand Seignor's Presence. But when they come to the door of the Chamber, two of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106224:305"/>
the more ancient among them, take the places of the two Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> and compleat the conducting of the <hi>Kilargi-Bachi,</hi> under the Arms, to offer the Cup to the Prince. When he has not any thing to say to him, he carries it back again into the <hi>Kilar;</hi> but if he will take his opportunity to entertain him with some Affair, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Cup and the Server into the hands of one of the Pages, who led him under the Arms, and he delivers it to those, who, belonging to the Cup-Bearer's Office, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there in expectation of his return.</p>
                     <p>'Tis in the same place, to wit, that under the over-sight of the Cup-bearer, they keep <note place="margin">A way to quench thirst at meals, wholly particular to the <hi>Levantines.</hi>
                        </note> all sorts of refreshing and cooling Waters, as that of Peaches, Cherries, Raspices, and such other fruits. The <hi>Turks</hi> do not drink during their refection, that is, not till they have given over eating; and because it is possible they may be dry, whilst they eat; take here the manner how they quench that thirst. They are serv'd at Table with these Waters, in great Cups of <hi>Pourcelaine,</hi> which hold about two Quarts, and the better to distinguish them, they put into every one of those Cups, some of the same fruit, from which the Water that is therein had been extracted, and which they had preserv'd for that purpose. Every one has lying by him a Wooden spoon, which holds three or four times as much as any of our ordinary ones, and whereof the handle is of a length proportionable: for as to Gold or Silver spoons, it is not their custome to use any. With those spoons, they can take out what is in the Cups, according to the Water which they most fancy, and so they suspend thirst, taking ever and anon some spoonfuls of it.</p>
                     <p>It is also in the Cup-bearers Appartment that the <hi>Treacle</hi> is made, which the <hi>Turks</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Composition of <hi>Treacle.</hi>
                        </note> call <hi>Tiriak-Farik,</hi> and there is a great quantity of it made, because they use it as an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal remedy, and charitably bestow it on all sorts of people, as well in City as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who are desirous of it. The Vipers which are us'd in this composition are brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and they make no account of those which other Countries afford, or they are of opinion at least, that the former are much the better for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>Before the Appartment of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> there is a Gallery whereof the floor is pav'd <note place="margin">A stately ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Gold Plate.</note> with square pieces of Black and White Marble, and sustain'd by eight fair Pillars of White Marble, and at the end of it is a little Quarter, where the principal Cup-bearer has his residence. There also are the Lodgings of his Substitute, the <hi>Kilarquet-houdasi,</hi> who is not an Eunuch, as the <hi>Kilargi-bachi</hi> is, and who, at his removal out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, is ordinarily advanc'd to the charge of a <hi>Bassa.</hi> The <hi>Kilargi-bachi</hi> has in his custody all the Gold and Silver-plate, the Basins, the Ewers, the Bowls, the Cups, the Servers, and the Candlesticks, the greatest part of that service being garnish'd with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Rubies and Emeralds, and other pretious Stones of value. As for golden Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes and Candlesticks, without any additional embellishments of precious Stone, there are some so large, and so massy, that there must be two men to carry one of them. These Candlesticks are made after a fashion quite different from ours. They are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily two or three Foot high, upon a Base of above twelve inches Diameter, and the upper part thereof is as twere a Box, or kind of Lamp, with its beak, and it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain above a pound of suet. 'Tis to prevent the fall of any thing upon the Carpet, that they make the foot of the Candlestick so large as I told you; and besides, it is requisite, that it should bear some proportion to the height. The match, or wieke, which they put into the Suet, beaten into small bits, is about the bigness of a Man's thumb, and consequently must needs make a great light in the Room. As to the <hi>Kilarquet-houdast,</hi> he is the Superiour over the <hi>Halvagis,</hi> and the <hi>Akegis,</hi> who are the Cooks and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners, of whom not one can enter into service, but by his Orders.</p>
                     <p>In my discourse of the Treasury, I made no mention of the Quarter of those Officers, who serve there, because my design was to follow the order of the Structures of the Seraglio, and to conduct the Reader, by little and little, out of one Court into another, and out of one Quarter into another. That of the Pages of the Treasury, is hard by the <hi>Kilar,</hi> and begins with a Gallery, pav'd with square pieces of Marble, of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, sustain'd by eight Pillars, of the same material, and whereof the sides and the roof are painted with all sorts of flowers, in Gold and Azure. That Gallery is open on the one side, and on the other you find in the midst of it, the Door leading into the Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106224:305"/>
of the Pages, with three great Windows on the right hand, and as many on the left: And 'tis there that the six most elderly Pages of the Treasury have their residence night and day. From that door, along a walk pav'd with white Marble stones, very large ones, about fifteen paces in length, and five in breadth, you come to another Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, of the same material, sustain'd by two Pillars of black Marble; over the said Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, there may be read these words, which are ordinary enough in the mouths of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and which I have explicated elsewhere;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Illahé Illa Alla, Muhammed Resoul Alla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It gives entrance into a long Hall, where there may be seen on both sides a kind of <note place="margin">Beds according to the <hi>Turkish</hi> mode.</note> Seat, or Scoffold, a foot and a half in height, and between seven and eight in breadth. Every Page has but four foot in breadth for his reposing place, as well by day, as by night: And for their Beds, they are permitted to have under them, only a Woollen Coverlet, four times doubled, which serves them for a Quilt, and over that they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily have one of Gold or Silver-Brockado, or some other sumptuous Silk-stuff; and in the Winter time, they are permitted to have three of them. They are not to have their Coverlets all of Wooll, which would be so much the warmer, because it would not be a decent sight for the Grand Seignor, when he comes ever and anon, in the night time, pretending indeed as if he would surprize them, and see how they demean themselves, but in effect, sometimes to cover lewd designs. 'Tis between those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlets that the Pages take their repose, having their Wast-coat and Drawers on; for there is no talk of any other kind of Linnen, either in <hi>Turkey,</hi> or any part of the East; and whether it be Winter or Summer, they alwaies lay themselves down to sleep, half clad, without any great Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>Over the Beds of the Pages, there is a Gallery, which goes quite round the Hall, <note place="margin">Wayes to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the necessities of Nature dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ours.</note> and is sustain'd by Pillars of Wood, painted all over with red varnish, and there they have their Coffers, wherein their Cloaths are kept. Every one has a Coffer to himself, but the twelve Senior Pages have each of them two Coffers, and one of those twelve has the Key of the Gallery in his custody. It is ordinarily open'd but one day in the Week, which is answerable to our <hi>Wednesday,</hi> and then, every Page goes, and takes out of his Coffer, what he stands in need of. If any one of them must of necessity look for some thing there upon any other day, he gets five or six Pages together, and they all go to the principal Officer of the Treasury, and he commands the <hi>Rafgi,</hi> who has the Key of the Gallery in his custody, to open it for them, and to have a care that they meddle not with the Coffers of their Companions.</p>
                     <p>At one of the ends of the Hall, there is a Door, which conducts you to the Fountaines, where those that have their dependance on the Treasury go and wash, when they are call'd to their Devotions. There are seven Copper Cocks for that convenience, and as well the pavement, as the Walls, of that place are of white Marble.</p>
                     <p>The places appointed for the easing of Nature are on the right hand, divided into four little Rooms, which are alwayes kept very clean, and pav'd with square pieces of white Marble, as the Room of the Fountain is. The <hi>Turks</hi> do not sit down, as we do, when they are in those places, but they squat down over the hole, which is not half a foot, or little more above the ground. That hole is cover'd with an Iron plate, which rises and falls by a Spring, and turning one way or other, at the falling of the least weight upon it, it comes to the station it was in before, assoon as the ordure is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from it. I have observed elsewhere, that the <hi>Turks,</hi> and generally all the <hi>Mahuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> do not use paper in such cases, or upon any undecent occasion, and when they go to those kinds of places, they carry along with them a Pot of water, to wash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves withal, and the Iron-plate is also made clean at the same time. And so the hole being alwaies cover'd, and the Iron plate alwaies kept clean, there can be no ill smell in the place, and that the rather, for that a small current of water, which passes under that place, carries away all the Ordure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:106224:306"/>
But it were to be wish'd, that they would not so much concern themselves in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Causes of the abominable Sin committed by the <hi>Turks</hi> who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                        </note> those places so clean, provided they could forbear polluting them with those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable impurities, which I should gladly have left unmention'd, did I not fear the reproach might be made to me, of my having been defective in point of exactness. I have already said something of it, in the Second Chapter of this Relation, and it is a subject, which is to be slightly past over, that so there may be but imperfect <hi>Idaea's</hi> left of it. It is therefore in those places, that the Pages make their nocturnal assignations, in order to the committing of the worst of all crimes, which yet they find it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to put in execution, because they are so narrowly watch'd; and if they are taken in the very act, they are punish'd with so great severity, that sometimes they are even drubb'd to death; of which chastisement, I have elsewhere given an account. In like manner, to prevent the committing of that infamous act, in the places where they take their repose, there are two Torches lighted, which last all the Night, and three Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs are ever and anon going their Rounds, by which means the Pages are depriv'd of the opportunities, which otherwise they night have, to offend.</p>
                     <p>But we need not go far, to find out the Source of this Evil: the strictness of the restraint they are in, and their being depriv'd of the sight of Women, induce those Young Men to practise such defilements, and hurry the <hi>Turks</hi> into a Gulph, to which they, by an execrable passion, are, naturally but too much inclinable. The <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> who are brought very young into the Seraglio, know not what a Woman is but by the instinct of Nature; and there are some of them, who, for one day's sight and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Woman, would be content to dye the next. All those Nations generally have so great a bent to lubricity, that it seems impossible they should quit it, but with their lives: what they cannot do one way, they endeavour to do another; and they of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> do all they can to elude the inspection of their Overseers. The <hi>Reader</hi> may call to mind the Action of the two <hi>Pages,</hi> who hid themselves in the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> and that single Example is enough, to shew, how they seek out all the wayes imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to satisfie their brutish passion.</p>
                     <p>The Quarter of the <hi>Kasnadar-bachi,</hi> as also that of his Companion, or Substitute, is adjoyning to that of the <hi>Pages</hi> of the Treasury, and from their Chambers, they have a Prospect into a little Flower-Garden, which belongs to them. We have yet some other Chambers to view, before we come to that, which they call the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> which is the Appartment of the Forty <hi>Pages</hi> of the Chamber, and the entrance to that of the Grand Seignor.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Magnificent Chambers. The ordinary Revenues of the Grand Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners. The Magnificence of the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Princes, in what relates to Hunting. Birds supplying the places of Dogs, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down a Deer, or a Hare. The delicate Chamber of the</hi> Selidgar-Agi, <hi>who carries the Grand Seignor's Sword. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order observ'd in the Seraglio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THe <hi>Dogangi-bachi,</hi> or Grand Faulconer, and the Pages, whom he has under <note place="margin">Magnificent Chambers.</note> his Charge, have their Quarter, between that of the Pages of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, and that of the Pages of the Chamber. The place appointed for the Pages of the Falconry, has nothing in it extraordinary, and a man cannot make a discovery of any thing of beauty therein: but on the other side, the two Chambers, where the Grand Falconer Lodges, have something that's Magnificent, and are as sumptuously furnish'd, as any other Room of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio. The first, which serves for an Anti-Chamber, is lesser, and they are both of them pav'd with a Checquer-work of black and white Marble, having the Roof beautify'd with Flowers, painted, and guilt. But that of the second Chamber is the more sumptuous by much, as having large Flowers, in emboss'd Work, every Flower in its square piece, and the Junctures all cover'd with Gold. The Walls are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently wainscoted, wherein also they have not spar'd for Gold, and on both sides, there are cross-barr'd Windows, whereby the Chamber receives much light. The Marble Checquer-work of the Floor is not seen, as being cover'd with a silken Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, upon which there are laid, in several parts of the Chamber, a certain number of Quilts, two or three foot in breadth, and about four Inches thick. Some of them are cover'd with Velvet, or Satin, of different Colours; others, with Gold-Brocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and every one has its Cushion, of the same Stuff, between three and four foot in length, and about two foot in heighth. These Cushions are laid behind their backs, when they are sitting, after their Mode, cross-legg'd, and those little Quilts are, to them, instead of Chairs, and Couches, in a Chamber.</p>
                     <p>If the Grand Falconer be remov'd out of the Seraglio, it is upon his advancement <note place="margin">The ordinary Revenues of the Grand Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> to the Charge of one of the principal <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and to one of the greater Governments, as that of <hi>Cairo,</hi> or <hi>Babylon;</hi> and while he continues in the Seraglio, besides his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is all at the Prince's charge, he is allow'd an annual Revenue, of ten or twelve thousand Crowns. The Pages of the Falconry, carry Hawks on their Fists, and feed them: they have the liberty to go and exercise them in the Gardens and they all attend the Grand Seignor, when he goes a Hawking, or Hunting. They wear the same Stuffs, as the Pages of the Treasury, and may also put on Vests of Cloath, but made after such a fashion, as makes them easily distinguishable from the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> of the first and second Chamber, who are always clad in Woollen-cloath. For the Pages of the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry have their Sleeves made narrower and narrower, from the Shoulder to the Wrist, and they are there fasten'd close with Buttons; but the Sleeves of the Pages of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106224:307"/>
the Treasury, are as wide below, as they are above, and that makes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The twelve Senior Pages of the Falconry have the same slaveries and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as the Pages of the Treasury, and are their Fellow-Commoners; but the other Companions of the former, are treated after the same rate as the Pages of the <hi>Seferlis,</hi> who wash the Grand Seignor's Linnen, and they all common at the same Table.</p>
                     <p>Besides the fore-mentioned Pages, the Grand Faulconer has under his command near eight hundred other persons, as well in <hi>Constantinople</hi> as the parts adjacent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <note place="margin">The Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in relation to Hunting and Hawking.</note> perpetually employ'd in the ordering and training up of all sorts of Birds for the Game, and there come none into the Seraglio, but what are so order'd, and taught. Though there may be a very great number of such, yet does not the Grand Seignor make use of any, but what have some stone of value about the neck, nay sometimes such as may be valued at ten thousand Crowns. All the <hi>Mahumetane</hi> Princes are very sumptuous, in all things relating to their Game, and particularly the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Nothing can be imagin'd more Glorious, or Magnificent, then the long Train of the Grandees of his Court, when they return from their Sports. They all march in an excellent order, every one with the Hawke on his Fist, and every Hawke having about the neck, either a Diamond, or some other precious stone, of great value, with the hood all embroider'd with Pearles; which must needs make a most delightful show.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> and other inhabitants of the <hi>Levant,</hi> breed up, in order to their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, several sorts of Birds, which the <hi>Europaeans</hi> make no use of at all, and they <note place="margin">Birds supplying the place of Dogs, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down a Deer, or Hare.</note> are of a larger size, and stronger, then ours. With those, instead of Dogs, will they run down a Hare, or a Stagge; and they have also the diversion of hunting the Wild Boar, and other savage Beasts. But what makes that Sport the more delightful is this, that in <hi>Persia,</hi> the Countrey is all open and champion, and there are no Woods, into which the Hawke, or other Bird, might get out of their sight. He discovers the Beast at a great distance, fastens of a sudden upon it, so as that it cannot get loose from him, and, sticking close to the Head, picks out the Eyes of it, vexes, and torments it, and retards the swiftness of its course, by which means, the Huntsmen come up the sooner to it, and dispatch it. But they do not give the fatal blow, till the Prince has order'd them to do it, or till he has shot off an Arrow, or discharg'd his Fire-lock: upon which signall, they who are about him are permitted to exercise their courage and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
                     <p>Next adjoyning to the Appartment of the Pages, belonging to the Falconary, there is a long Gallery, which is open but of one side, and in the floore of it, there is a little ascent. It is sustain'd by ten Pillars of Marble, of several colours, and pav'd with a square-piec'd work of the same material; with a Wainscotage, wherein there are some flowers painted, but very meanly.</p>
                     <p>From the end of the foresaid Gallery, turning on the right hand, you come to the Chamber of the <hi>Selidgar-Agi,</hi> who carries the Sword before the Grand Seignor. Some <note place="margin">The <hi>Seligdar-Aga</hi>'s Chamber, who carries the Grand Seignor<hi>'s</hi> word.</note> part of that Chamber is cover'd with Carpets, the other has a Seat or Scaffold, rais'd three foot high, but of a considerable breadth, to which they ascend by so many steps of white Marble, of four foot in length, the remainder of which Seat, being divided from the Chamber by a Ballister'd work, partly gilt with Gold, and partly Green. All within that enclosure of Ballisters is cover'd with rich silken Carpets, and all about, as well to the Wall side, as to that of the Ballisters, there are sumptuous Cushions of all sorts, of Gold and Silver-Brokadoes. The Walls of the Chamber are all gilt, and at equal distances, there are flower-pots painted, rarely well diversify'd, and affording a most delightful prospect. The place where the <hi>Selidgar-Agi</hi> sits, is at the corner of that part of the Chamber which is enclos'd with the Ballisters, on the right hand, and over his Head hang the Swords and Sabres, which he carries before the Grand Seignor, within the Seraglio; and after him, when his Highness goes out of the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as a Prince is come to the Crown, whatever he ordinarily wears, is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <note place="margin">The excellent order observ'd in the Seraglio.</note> into the Treasury, till after his death: And the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi,</hi> who is the Overseer of it, finds by his Registries, whether all the things that were taken out of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106224:307"/>
the Treasury, during the Grand Seignor's life, are brought into it again, at his death. Whenever any piece is taken out, the <hi>Seligdar-Agi,</hi> to whom it is deliver'd, gives the principal Officer of the Treasury an acknowledgment, under his hand, of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it; and by that means nothing can be embezill'd, good order being strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in all things, relating to the Seraglio. In some other parts of the Chamber you find hanging up Ponyards and Knives, all rich Pieces, and beset with precious stones, which, as all the rest, are exactly Registred in the Books of the Treasury. On each side of the said Chamber, there are two little Rooms, for four Pages of the <hi>Seferlis,</hi> who wait on the <hi>Seligdar-Aga,</hi> and are always about his person. 'Tis now time that we pass into the Grand Seignor's Quarter.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Chamber of the Forty Pages. A noble Monument of the Valour of</hi> Amurath. <hi>The situation of the Mosqueys in</hi> Turkey. <hi>The Ceremonies of their Devotions.

                     </p>
                     <p>THough the inner part of the Seraglio ought properly to be divided into but two great Quarters, which are the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s own Quarter, and the Quarter of the <hi>Sultanesses;</hi> yet have I thought it more convenient, for the Reader's better remembrance of things, to distinguish to him the different parts, of which the former consists, answerably to its several uses: and after a large account, given of the Baths, the Treasury, the Cup-Bearer's Office, and the Falconry, I come now to the particular Appartment of the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s Person.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Haz-Oda</hi> is the first Structure that offers it self to your view, and 'tis by that name the <hi>Turks</hi> call the fourth and highest Classe of the <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> which is the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">The Chamber of the Forty Pages.</note> of the <hi>Forty Pages,</hi> who are hourly employ'd in the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s Service. This Chamber is of the same largeness, as that of the Pages of the Treasury, and furnish'd much after the same rate; but it is not near so lightsome, or rather, it wants light. As there is not so great a number of them, so have they accordingly more place to sit, or lye down; and in the midst of the Chamber, you find a little square place, rais'd up somewhat higher than the Beds of the Pages, whence the <hi>Haz-Oda-bachi,</hi> their Governour, may observe all their actions, and see how they demean themselves. He has order to give the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> notice of it, Rewards being the consequences of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106224:308"/>
good actions, as chastisements are, of bad ones; and it is also incumbent upon him, to make speedy provision of all the things they stand in need of. Over the Door of that Chamber, these words, <hi>La Illa Hé Illa,</hi> &amp;c. whereof I have often made mention, are engrav'd in large golden Letters; and at the four corners, are the Names of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s four Companions, <hi>Ebou-beker, Omar, Osman,</hi> and <hi>Ali,</hi> engrav'd in like manner in black Marble. When the Grand Seignor has made a <hi>Bassa,</hi> and that he is to take his leave of his Highness, to go to his Government, he comes out at that Door, where all those names are engrav'd, and as soon as he is come out, he turns his face again to the Door, and kisses the Threshold of it, with great humility.</p>
                     <p>As soon as you are come into the Chamber, you find on the right hand several words of the Law, written, and enchac'd, in guilt squares, and one of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings is, of Sultan <hi>Achmet's,</hi> the Father of <hi>Amurath.</hi> On the left hand, you find, fasten'd to the Wall, a Coat of Mail, a Head-piece, and a great Buckler; it is one of <note place="margin">A noble Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath's</hi> Valour.</note> the Monuments of <hi>Amurath</hi>'s Valour. During the Siege of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> a <hi>Persian</hi> coming out of the City, and challenging any one of the Besiegers to meet him, that Prince, one of the most courageous and strongest men of his age, would needs receive him himself, without any other Arms, than a Sabre in his hand, though the <hi>Persian</hi> was arm'd from head to foot. <hi>Amurath</hi> who was not only a prodigious Person as to strength, and valour, but also well skill'd in the use of a Weapon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him not the time to consider whom he had to deal withal, but immediately gave him such a furious blow with the Sabre, over the right shoulder, that he cut his coat of Mail quite to the Middle of his Body, and left him dead upon the place.</p>
                     <p>Opposite to the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> or the Chamber of the forty Pages, there is a Gallery of a considerable length, and particularly remarkable for its Structure. It is open on both sides, and has, of each, a row of white Marble-Pillars; but it is built after the Serpentine fashion, and they who walk in it are, every six paces, out of sight one of the other. There are, under this Gallery four great Presses, to put up the accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the four Officers, who are always about the Grand Seignor's Person, to wit, the <hi>Seligdar-Aga,</hi> the <hi>Chokadar-Aga,</hi> the <hi>Requabdar-Aga,</hi> and the <hi>Hazoda-bachi,</hi> of whom I have spoken at the beginning of this Relation, when I gave a List of the Grandees of the Port.</p>
                     <p>This Gallery, of so fantastick and so extraordinary a Structure, is not far from that <note place="margin">The scituation of the Mosques in <hi>Turkey.</hi>
                        </note> other, which is a continu'd ascent, and whereof I made mention in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Opposite to this last, there is a Mosquey, of the middle sort, as to the largeness, the length of it somewhat exceeding its breadth, and it stands North and South, a situation the <hi>Turks</hi> observe in all their Mosqueys, which are always turn'd towards <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> which place is Meridional to all the Provinces of the Empire. There is in the Wall, opposite to the South, a kind of Neech, which they call <hi>Mihrab,</hi> into which the <hi>Iman,</hi> who is their Priest, gets up, to say Prayers at the accustomed hours, and the Grand Seignor is present thereat, with the forty Pages of the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> in a little Room, the Window whereof is opposite to the Neech. On both sides of the said Neech, there is a Gallery sustain'd by five Pillars, some whereof are of green Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the rest of Porphyry. And in the Mosquey, and in the Chamber, or Room, into which the Grand Seignor comes to do his Devotions, and in the two Galleries, there's no going but upon rich Carpets. You are not to look for ought of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; nor have the Walls any other Ornament, than that of the whiteness of the Marble, whereof they are built. But there are a great many Writings, in large <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, enchac'd in gilt Borders, hanging up in several places, and those Writings contain only things taken out of the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Window of the Chamber, into which the Grand Seignor comes to do his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, is six foot in length, and three foot high, and has a Lattice, with a Curtain behind it, as it is in several Chappels, which our Christian Princes have in their Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There is also opposite to the same Neech, before-mentioned, such another Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and such another Chamber, for the Sultanesses, and when the <hi>Muezim,</hi> whose station is of one side of the <hi>Iman,</hi> and who is as it were his Clerk, hears the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106224:308"/>
of the Curtains, he immediately rings a small Bell, which is the signal, that the Grand Seignor and the Sultanesses are come into their several Rooms.</p>
                     <p>Upon their arrival, the foresaid <hi>Muezim</hi> begins to sing these two words, <hi>Allabu Ekber,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Ceremonies of their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> which signifies, <hi>God is Great,</hi> repeating them four times: and afterwards, having added thereto some words, speaking as 'twere to himself, the <hi>Iman</hi> in his turn, sings these following; <hi>Elhamdu lillahi Rabbil alemijn,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The Grace of God is the Master of all things.</hi> He thus continues the Prayer, prostrating himself several times to the ground, and all the people present do also prostrate themselves as he does.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of the Domo of the Mosquey, there is a Hoop of Iron, all about which there hangs a great number of Lamps, of <hi>Venice-</hi>Crystal, and there are also some dispos'd along the Galleries, of the same Metal, they being not permitted to have in their Mosqueys, either Gold or Silver. They do not light those Lamps, but only for the Prayers at night, and the fire casting a reflection on those Crystals, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a most delightful Object to the sight.</p>
                     <p>The Chamber of the <hi>Sarai-Agasi,</hi> one of the four principal Eunuchs, is adjoyning to that Mosquey, and the least of all the Chambers, of the Officers, belonging to the Inner-part of the Seraglio. He has but little place more than is requisite for him to sleep in, and he is waited on by two Pages of the <hi>Couchouk-Oda,</hi> or the little Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>Adjoyning to the Door of the <hi>Haz-Oda,</hi> there is a Hall pav'd with a Checquer-work, of black and white Marble, in the midst whereof there is a Basin of the same material, but of several colours, out of which there is an ascent of water four or five foot high. That water is receiv'd into a second Basin, made in the form of a Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop-shell, out of which it falls again into a third, much larger than the two precedent ones. The upper-part of the Hall is built Domo-wise, having therein some Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which give it light, and a certain piece of dull painting is all the Ornament of its Walls. At your entrance into this Hall, you see two Doors, one on the right hand, the other, on the left. That on the left hand conducts to a Flower-Garden; and the other is the door of a Chamber, into which the Grand Seignor comes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in the Winter-season.</p>
                     <p>This Chamber is one of the most sumptuous of any in the Seraglio. It's arched <note place="margin">A magnificent Winter-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> Roof is divided into a great number of little Cells, Triangle-wise, distinguish'd by two little filets of Gold, with a green streak in the midst, and rout of every Angle, there juts somewhat like the bottom of a Lamp, excellently well gilt. Though the Walls are of a curious white Marble, yet is there a delicate piece of Wainscotage, of about the height of a man's waste, carried quite round the Room, and the rich Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, upon which you walk, deprive your sight of the large squares of Marble, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours, wherewith the Floor is embellish'd. Of a great number of Cushions, which are plac'd along the Walls, some are embroider'd with Pearls, and precious Stones, and set there only for ostentation; the others, which are for service, are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Gold, or Silver-Brokadoes, and other costly Stuffs. At one of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Chamber, there is a little Field-bed, about two foot in heighth, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd all over, the Counterpane, the Cushions, and the Quilt; and that Embroidery is all of Pearles, Rubies, and Emeralds. But when the Grand Seignor is to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Chamber, they take away the Counterpane and Cushions, which are less fit for Service than for Ornament, and they bring in others of quilted or tufted Velvet, or Satin, upon which the Grand Seignor may more conveniently repose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>Towards the feet of the said Bed, there is a kind of Neech made within the very <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Mysterious Seal.</note> Wall, in which there is a little Ebony Box, about half a foot square, and in that is lock'd up <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Seal. It is enchac'd in a Crystal, with a Bordure of Ivory, and taking all together, it may be four inches in length, and three in breadth. I have seen the Impression of it upon a piece of Paper; but he who shew'd it me, would not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106224:309"/>
suffer me to touch it, only upon this score, that he look'd on it as a great Relick. Once in three months this Chamber is made clean, and the Carpets are chang'd, the Pages of the Treasury being employ'd in that Office. And then it is, that the <hi>Chasnadar-bachi</hi> opens the Box, and having in his hands an embroider'd Hand-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, he takes out the Seal, with great respect and reverence, whilst the Senior of the Pages holds a golden Cup, garnish'd with Diamonds and blue Saphirs, on the top of which there is a kind of Perfuming-Pot, out of which there comes an exhalation of all sorts of sweet Scents, whereby the whole Room is in a manner embalm'd. The Page holds that Cup in both his hands joy'nd together, and lifting it up higher than his Head, all those that are present immediately prostrate themselves to the ground, as an acknowledgment of their veneration. As soon as they are up again, the Page brings down the Cup, lower than his chin, and the principal Officer of the Treasury, holding the Seal over the smoke, all those who are in the Room, come and kiss the Chrystal which covers one of the most precious Relicks, that they have of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. I have us'd all the endeavours I could, to get out of my two Officers of the Treasury, who had often kiss'd that Chrystal, what Observations they might have made, as to the material whereof the Seal was made, and what Letters were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd upon it; but they told me, and by reason of the smoke and the Chrystal, which covers the Seal, not to insist on the small time they have to observe it, during the act of kissing it, it is not possible that any one can give a certain judgment of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Stuff, or the Engraving of it.</p>
                     <p>Upon the fourteenth day of the <hi>Ramazan,</hi> that is to say, the Lent of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Grand Seignor comes in person into that Chamber, accompany'd only by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligdar-Aga,</hi> and taking off the Chrystal, which lies over the Seal, he delivers it into his hands, ordering him to make the Impression of it upon fifty little bits of Paper, which are not much bigger than the Seal it self. This Impression is taken off with a certain gummy Ink, which is prepar'd in a Pourcelain Dish, whereinto he thrusts his finger, and rubs the Seal with it, and keeps all those Printed Papers, for the use, to which his Highness designs them, as we shall see, e're we come to the end of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Within the same Chamber, and adjoyning to the place, where the Seal is kept, <note place="margin">The great Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                        </note> there is another Box or Coffer, of a larger size, cover'd with a Carpet of green Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, with a great fringe of Gold and Silver, wherein is kept <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Hirka.</hi> It is a Garment with large sleeves, of a white Camelet, made of Goat's hair, which the <hi>Turks</hi> do also look upon as a great Relick. The Grand Seignor having taken it out of the Coffer, kisses it with much respect and puts it into the hands of the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who is come into the Room by his Order, after they had taken the Impressions of the Seal. The Officer sends to the Overseer of the Treasury, for a large golden Cauldron, which is brought in thither by some of the Senior-Pages. It is so capacious, according to the description which they gave me of it, as to contain the sixth part of a Tun, and the out-side of it is garnish'd, in some places, with Emeralds, and Turquezes. This Vessel is fill'd with water within six fingers breadth of the brink, and the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> having put <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Garment into it, and left it to soak a little while, takes it out again, and wrings it hard, to get out the water it had imbib'd, which falls into the Cauldron, taking great care, that there falls not any of it to the ground. That done, with the said water he fills a great number of <hi>Venice-</hi>Chrystal Bottles, containing about half a pint, and when he has stopp'd them, he Seals them with the Grand Seignor's Seal. They afterwards set the Garment a drying, till the twentieth day of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazan,</hi> and then his Highness comes to see them put up again in the Coffer.</p>
                     <p>The next day after that Ceremony, which is the fifteenth after their grand Fast, <note place="margin">A ridiculous and covetous knack of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Sultan sends to the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> and the Grandees of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as also to most of the considerable <hi>Bassa's</hi> of the Empire, to each of them, an Impression of the Seal, in a little scrip of Paper roll'd up, and well fasten'd with Silk, and with that, one of those Bottles full of water, which is look'd upon as a great favour. But it proves a very dear favour to those who receive it, and for a scrip of Paper, and a Glass of water, they must send back again to the Grand Seignor very considerable Presents,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106224:309"/>
not accounting what they bestow on those persons, who bring, from him, those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and marks of his Affection.</p>
                     <p>It is to be observ'd also, That the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> is allow'd to multiply the said Water, as far as he thinks requisite, and answerably to his desire of multiplying the Presents. All he has to do, is only to fill up the Cauldron, as it is emptied, and that additional wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is as good as 'twas before, since it is intermix'd with that wherein <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been soak'd. For there are many persons, to whom he sends those Bottles, without the impression of the Seal, upon the little piece of paper, and he has a snack out of all that is bestow'd on the Bearers of those Presents. But he is not permitted to make that multiplication of the Water, any longer than for the space of three dayes; that is to say, till the Seventeenth of the <hi>Ramazan,</hi> after which time, the additional intermixture of it would not have the Vertue, which they imagine it has.</p>
                     <p>As soon as this Present is receiv'd by those to whom it is sent, they take the paper, which has the impression of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Seal, and, after they have left it to soake a little while in the Water of the little Chrystal bottle, they take off the water and the paper, swallowing down both together with great devotion. But it is to be noted, That no body must be so presumptuous as to open that paper; for they swallow it down as it is brought to them, after a little soaking in the water, they being not permitted to see the impression of the sacred Seal: And they, who receive only the bottle, without the paper, send for one of their <hi>Imans,</hi> who are as 'twere their Priests, and get him to write down these words in another piece of paper, <hi>La hé Illa, Alla hul, vahidul gebbar,</hi> That is to say, <hi>There is no other God then God, the punisher of Crimes.</hi> There are others, who order these words to be writ down; <hi>La Illa hé Illa, Allahul meliquid vehhab;</hi> which signifies, <hi>There is no other God then God alone, the Liberal Emperour, and Pardoner of Offences.</hi> The paper, having these words written upon it, is put into the water of the little Bottle, and so they swallow down both together, with a strong perswasion, that those words have the same vertue, as the impression of the Seal.</p>
                     <p>There is also to be seen, in the same Chamber, a very homely kind of Cuttelas, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Relicks of <hi>Omar.</hi>
                        </note> by the Wall, near the place where the Prophet's Seal and Garment are kept. The Scabbard is cover'd with Green cloath, and they have it by Tradition, that it had been the Cuttelas of <hi>Omar,</hi> one of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s four Companions, who govern'd after him, though <hi>Ebou-Bequer</hi> was the elder of the two, and Father-in-law to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> affirm, That <hi>Ebou-Bequer</hi> was a <hi>Jew,</hi> by extraction, and one of the most learned of his time; and that, having renounc'd the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, he taught at <hi>Mecha,</hi> in the Schools, after which he beset himself to compose some part of the Alcoran.</p>
                     <p>Near the Cuttelas, there is also to be seen a kind of short Sword, for which they have, in like manner, a great veneration, upon a perswasion, that it some time was the Sword of a certain person named <hi>Ebou-Nislum,</hi> with which he cut to pieces, those, who had spread a Heresie in the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He came not into the World till Four hundred years after the death of the Prophet, and at length destroy'd that Sect, which during the space of two Ages before, had given much trouble to the true <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and gain'd several Battels against them.</p>
                     <p>The said Sect was grown very powerful under the denomination of <hi>Muharriguu,</hi> and I have met with some remainders of it in the Mountains of <hi>Churdistan,</hi> which is the <note place="margin">A ridiculous Sect.</note> ancient <hi>Chaldea.</hi> Those people are very remarkable for their superstition, and much more for their ignorance; and a man must have a great care of striking a black Dog, in their presence, or cutting an Onion with a Knife; for their way, when they are to eat an Onion, is to crush it between two stones. The cause of that gross ignorance, is their not having any person among them, to instruct them; and a man may travel five or six dayes Journey in their Country, and not meet with either a <hi>Mollah,</hi> or a <hi>Mosquey.</hi> The same reason may also be given for their being, for the most part, uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd, and that they who have receiv'd Circumcision, had it not till they were Twelve or fifteen years of age, and that accidentally, by going to some place at a great distance, to find out a <hi>Mollah,</hi> and defraying the charges of their Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who must accompany them to that ceremony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:106224:310"/>
Between the Chamber, where these noble Relicks are to be seen, and that of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Grand Seignor's <hi>Quarter.</hi>
                        </note> Forty Pages, of which I have given an account at the beginning of this Chapter, you have the Prospect of a treble portal of Porphyry, that is, three doors at a small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance one from the other, whereof that in the middle gives entrance into the Grand Seignor's Appartment. The two others lead to the Lodgings of the <hi>Chokadar-Aga,</hi> and the <hi>Biquabdar-Aga,</hi> and those Lodgings are very dark, because they are not in a place where light can be brought into them, and that at the first building thereof, they could afford each of them but one little Window. But, abating that inconvenience, they are well enough furnish'd, according to the mode of the Country, you tread on nothing but Silken Carpets; there's no want of Brokado-Cushions, and emboyder'd ones, and the Walls, which are all of White Marble, entertain the Eye with pots of Flowers plainly painted, at certain equal distances, about which there has been an ingenious application of Gold and Azure.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor's Quarter begins with a Hall, which is spacious enough, and the embellishments of the in-side of it are correspondent to those of the out-side. It is an incrustation of Marble, of several colours, and the Floor of it is cover'd only with the large Woollen Carpets, which are brought out of <hi>Persia,</hi> but such as are more sumptuous, and much more highly esteem'd, than those which are made of Silk. All about the Hall, for the space of Five foot, there are spread Coverlets of Silk, of a light colour, some Tufted, some Embroyder'd, and upon the Coverlets there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Rich Cushions, four foot in length, and between two and three, in breadth.</p>
                     <p>Of the two Doors, which are within the Hall, one goes to the Appartment of the <hi>Pages,</hi> the other to the Quarter of the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> and as you go out by this last <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Amurath's</hi> Belvedere.</note> mentioned, you enter into a Flower-Garden, in the midst whereof there is a Basin with its water-work. From one of the ends of the Garden you pass to the <hi>Revan-Kouchki,</hi> that is to say, a Chamber supported by Pillars. It is a <hi>Belvedere,</hi> or spacious Room, having a delightful Prospect of all sides, which the Sultan <hi>Amurath</hi> caus'd to be built, at his return from the <hi>Persian</hi> War, after he had taken the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> from <hi>Shach-Sefi,</hi> the King of that Kingdom, ruin'd the Province of <hi>Tauris,</hi> and added that of <hi>Erivan</hi> to his Conquests, by the perfidiousness of the Governour. I shall give you an account anon, how he was justly punish'd, for that act of Treachery, and I reserve the compleat history of his baseness, for the Relations of my Travels.</p>
                     <p>This Room, or Arbour, which we call the <hi>Belvedere,</hi> from the delightfulness of its Prospect, is built in an Eminent place, upon a steepy Rock. It is a noble Arched Roof, and the Walls, which are rais'd no higher then that a man may rest his Elbow on them, are all of White Marble, with some <hi>Arabian</hi> Verses thereon, cut, and gilt. It is open of all sides, and the Lattices, all about it, hinder those that are within it from being seen by such as are on the out-side, and afford them withal one of the most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Prospects in the World. For, from that Room, they have the sight of all <hi>Galata</hi> and <hi>Pera,</hi> all that pleasant Landskip of <hi>Asia,</hi> about <hi>Scutaret,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the Port of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> one of the noblest of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Channel of the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> which, at the point of the Seraglio, is intermixt with the Waters of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> where there is observable in the midst, as it were, a white foamy streak, which seems naturally to denote the Confines of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Twas in this pleasant Arbour, that <hi>Amurath</hi> was often wont to divert himself, with <note place="margin">The Excellent Wines of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedos.</hi>
                        </note> that Governour of <hi>Erivan,</hi> who had taught him to drink Wine, whereto he had so easily accustom'd himself, that, many times, he spent three days together, in a continu'd debauch. The only Wine he drunk was that of the Island of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of any of the Islands of the <hi>Archiphelago,</hi> and the least intoxicating; and he soon became as good a proficient in the drinking of it, as the Master, who had taught him to do it. This <hi>Persian</hi> Governour was a man extreamly inclin'd to debauchery, insomuch that before his perfidious delivery of the place to <hi>Amurath,</hi> as I pass'd through <hi>Erivan,</hi> in one of my Voyages to <hi>Persia,</hi> he intreated me to make my abode there for the space of fifteen days, and, to humour him, there was a necessity of spending whole nights in drinking, so that I saw him not all the day long, which I question not but he employ'd in the management of his affairs, and taking his repose.</p>

But, at the long run, lewd actions meet with the punishment they justly deserve. <note place="margin">Persidiousness punish'd.</note> 
                        <hi>Shach-Sefi,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> would not entertain any proposition of Peace, no nor so much as give audience to an Ambassador from the Grand Seignor, whom I saw sent back from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where I then was, unless <hi>Amurath</hi> would deliver up the Traytor, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his punishment. Whereupon, they being both one day at their ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, in the <hi>Belvedere,</hi> the Grand Seignor, without any formality, order'd him to be Strangled, in his presence.</p>
                     <p>It was sometimes also <hi>Amurath</hi>'s custome, to bring into that pleasant place, the <note place="margin">The Fortune of a beautiful <hi>Sicilian</hi> Lady.</note> Principal <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> as, his Mothers, his Sisters, and such others as he had the greatest kindness for. But his most frequent assignations there, was with a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Lady, for whom he had a great affection, and who, being extreamly handsome, and of a mild disposition, obtain'd of him whatere she desir'd. She was taken at Sea, by the Pyrates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> as she was upon her Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> in order to her intermarriage with one of the Grandees of that Countrey: And the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Algiers</hi> sent her, a Present, to the Grand Seignor, who took a particular fancy for her, and made her as happy, as a Woman can be, who must endure the restraint of the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>From that door of the Hall, which gives entrance into the Flower-garden, you pass, <note place="margin">The Grand Seignor's Bed-Chamber.</note> on the right hand, into a kind of Gallery, about fifty paces in length, and twelve in breadth, the pavement whereof is a Chequer-work of Black and White Marble. At the end of it, there is a great Structure, which is wholly of Marble, and what first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Eye is a pretty large Door, over which there is a kind of a flat arched Roof. And both the Roof, and the Door, are adorn'd with flowers, in emboss'd work; and amongst those flowers, there are certain impresses cut in the Marble, and all curiously Gilt.</p>
                     <p>About five or six paces from that Door, you come to another, not inferiour to it, as to beauty, which is that of the Grand Seignor's own Chamber. Its Cieling, or arched Roof, is according to the model of the Winter-room, whereof I have given you a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription at the beginning of this Chapter. The only difference between them is, in what issues out of the Augles of the little Arches; and whereas in the other Room, they represent the bottoms of Lamps, gilt with Gold; in this, they are balls of Rock-Crystall, cut Facet-wise, with an inter-mixture of precious stones, of different colours, which must needs give a very divertive entertainment to the Eye. The floor of it is cover'd with Carpets, which, as to beauty, and excellency of Workmanship, exceed those of the other Chambers; and the same thing is to be said, as to the Quilts, the Counterpanes, and the Cushions; the most part of this furniture being adorn'd with an embroidery of Pearls, and the whole Room, which is very spacious, having, in all parts, several other sumptuous embellishments. And whereas this Room was Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally design'd for the Grand Seignor's Summer-Divertisement, it is accordingly the more lightsome, and has large Windowes on three sides of it. As to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he complies with the custome of the Countrey, or rather that of all the Eastern parts. There is no Bed-stead set up, but towards the Evening, the Pages spread three Quilts one upon the other, at one of the corners of the Chamber, and place over it a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, garnish'd with an embroidery of Pearls.</p>
                     <p>On the right hand, as you come into this Room, there is a Cup-board, or Press, <note place="margin">The ancient Veneration for <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Standard.</note> wrought within the very Wall, where they keep the <hi>Bajarac,</hi> that is to say, the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which has these words for its Impress, or Motto, <hi>Nasrum min Allah,</hi> that is, in our Language, <hi>The assistance is from God.</hi> This Standard was heretofore in so great veneration amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> that when there happen'd any Sedition, either at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or in the Armies, there was no safer or more expeditious remedy to appease it, then to expose that Standard to the sight of the Rebels. And that very Expedient has many times prov'd very fortunate to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, when they have been reduc'd to their great extremities, by the secret Combinations of some Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons. Then does the Grand Seignor send some of the <hi>Mollahs,</hi> who are in the nature of Priests, amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> with the Standard, and being come up to the first ranks of the Rebellious Forces, they speak to them, in their Language, to this effect: <hi>This Banner is the Standard of the Prophet; all they who are faithful, and obedient, ought to come to submit themselves at the Foot of this Standard; and they who will not come to it,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106224:311"/>
are Unbelievers, and they ought to be destroyed.</hi> But some years since, the <hi>Turks</hi> made it appear, that they made but little account of that Standard; for <hi>Hassan,</hi> one of the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's,</hi> who gave the Grand Seignor so much trouble in the year 1658. turn'd his back on <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Banner, and, follow'd by his own party, compass'd the design he was engag'd in.</p>
                     <p>Out of the Grand Seignor's Chamber, there is a passage into a great Hall, the place appointed for the reception of the Pages who approach his Person; and there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning <note place="margin">A word further of the Prince's Appartment.</note> to it a Bath, which is fill'd by three Cocks, where they wash themselves, when they go to their Devotions. Out of the same Hall, there is an ascent of some steps, which brings you to a small Closet, only Wainscoted about, but well Painted, and well Gilt. That Stair-case is alwayes cover'd with a red Cloth, the Room is open of all sides, having fair Windowes, wherein Talc is us'd, instead of Glass; and from thence you have, in a manner, the same Prospect, as from the <hi>Belvedere,</hi> built by the Emperour <hi>Amurath.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>Some inclinations common to all the Monarchs of the Eastern-parts. The Life of the Seraglio, delicious to one single person, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to many.

                     </p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, and generally all the Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> what reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soever they may have gain'd, for their valour, have alwayes been guilty <note place="margin">Inclinations common to the Eastern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</note> of a bent to voluptuousness, and effeminacy, and found great charms in a sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kind of life. They come out of their Seraglio's as seldome as they can, and that only, when an indispensable necessity forces them to shew themselves in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, whether it be at the head of their Armies, or in those Ceremonies, wherein the Law, or common Civilities, require their presence. True it is, that some of them were not so great lovers of retirement as others, and preferr'd the hardships of Warr, the divertisements of Hunting, before the blandishments of ease, and the conversation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106224:311"/>
of Women: But those may be reduc'd into a very small number, and the greatest part of them being more addicted to mind their quiet, and to lead a life void of disturbance, have transfer'd all their concerns, Civil and Military, to the management of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Minister of State, thinking it enough, to content themselves with the account he was pleas'd to give him thereof.</p>
                     <p>It may be said of the Seraglio, That it is a delicious, but withal a solitary place of <note place="margin">The <hi>Seraglio,</hi> a place delicious to one single person, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious to many.</note> abode: but as to the observations I have made of things, it is delicious only to a single person, and solitary to all the rest. Of the many Thousands, of the Male Sex, who are there as 'twere in Prison, and have a dependance, one upon the other, none but the Prince himself has the sight of Women; for the Negro-Eunuchs, whom their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of body and countenance has, in a manner, transform'd into Monsters, are not to be admitted into the number of men.</p>
                     <p>But though the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, and generally all that may be comprehended <note place="margin">The <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> zealous observers of the Law.</note> under the denomination of <hi>Turcisme,</hi> are involv'd in voluptuousness, as not having any tincture of ought relating to polite Literature, yet this is particularly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in them, that their great pursuance of pleasures does not ever make them neglect the Divine Worship, and that, setting all things aside, they are careful to perform what the Law requires of them, upon that account. They are exact and punctual, even to superstition, in all their exercises of Piety, in their wayes of washing themselves, in their Prayers, in their Fasts, in their Alms, and in their Pilgrimages; which are the Five principal Articles of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion.</p>
                     <p>It is a thing sufficiently well known to all people, that the <hi>Turks</hi> go to their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Devotions, five times a day, that is, in the space of a natural Day, which <note place="margin">The regulated times of their Devotions.</note> amounts to four and twenty hours. For the performance of this work, there are no certain hours appointed, and it is according to the Sun's being above their Horizon. Upon which account, there is a greater interval between their several Offices, in the Summer-time, than there is in the Winter, and they place the principal part of their Devotion upon observations of that nature. The first Exercise is to be perform'd at the break of day, before Sun-rising; the second at Noon; the third, between that time and Sun-set; the fourth, immediately after his setting; and the last, about an hour and a half after Night: in all which, unless sickness intervene, they are very punctual, so that nothing of business, how important soever, shall divert them.</p>
                     <p>Nay, on the contrary, some are so zealous, and their fervour is so remarkable, that <note place="margin">Their servour in acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</note> being once fixt in their Prayers, they could not be put out of them, though 'twere to force back an Enemy, who were entring into the City, or that word should be brought them, that the house wherein they are, was on fire. They are moreover of a perswasion, that it is a great sin, for them to put their hand to any part of the body, to scratch themselves, if there should be occasion; and they would have the external part to be answerable to the internal, and correspondent to that abjection, which ought to be the state of the Soul, in the presence of God, during their Exercises of Devotion.</p>
                     <p>Nor does the Grand Seignor himself desire to be dispens'd from the obligation of <note place="margin">The <hi>Grand Seignor's</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> performing these acts of Devotion, any more than the meanest of his Subjects; but, on the contrary, he is very religious in that observance of their Law, and he always begins the day with the Offices appointed for that part of it. We need say no more, than that he rises at the break of day, nay sometimes he is up before, and goes into the Bath to wash himself, especially when he has lain with one of his Wives, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines. Having finish'd his Prayers, he diverts himself in shooting with the Bowe, or, more commonly in looking after his Horses, and riding some of them: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he seats himself in a Gallery, where he cannot be seen by any, and contents himself with the diversion of seeing some exercises perform'd by his Pages. If any one of them does something that he is much pleas'd withal, he sends him a Vest, or some other thing of value, as an encouragement for his doing better another time, and to raise an emulation in his Companions. Upon Council-days, he comes through the close Gallery, to the Window, which looks into the <hi>Divan</hi> Hall, to see what they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106224:312"/>
are doing there; and upon the rising of the Council, he returns to his own Quarter, where his Dinner is brought up to him.</p>
                     <p>In the Services of his Table, there is not any great variety, or delicacy, the Dish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that are serv'd up, being answerable to the Bill of fare, which I have given you in <note place="margin">The Services of his Table.</note> the Chapter, where I treat of the Kitchins. He takes his refection, sitting, cross-legg'd, as Taylors do amongst us, being surrounded with sumptuous Brocado-cushions, which keep from him the dampness of the Walls, and upon the Carpets which cover the Scaffold, or Balcony, where he is seated, they spread others of <hi>Spanish-</hi>Leather, lest the former should be prejudic'd by any thing of greasiness, which might fall on the Table-cloath, and soak through it. This Cloath, which is laid over the <hi>Spanish-</hi>Leather-Carpet, is of those sumptuous painted Cloaths, which are made in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and embroider'd all about: and as for Napkins, there are not any used amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are neat, and cleanly at their Meals; and if sometimes there be any occasion of wiping, 'tis done with a little handkerchief. At their refections, they use the right hand only, and when they have done, there is a Basin of warm water and soap brought up, for them to wash, and every one takes out his Handkerchief from under his Sasch, or Girdle, to wipe his hands and mouth. Nor must you expect in <hi>Turkey</hi> to find Knives and Forks laid on the Table, but every one has his Knife lodg'd in his Sasch, and makes use of, when occasion requires: but they have no great use for them, inasmuch as their Bread, being made thin, as 'twere into Cakes, and eaten in a manner as soon as 'tis out of the Oven, they break it with their fingers, and all the meat, which is serv'd up to them, is cut into small pieces, which is also the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in <hi>Persia.</hi> But the Spoons they use, in taking their Pottages, and whatever is liquid upon the Table, are much larger than ours; and they are wooden ones. The Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> that is the Cup-bearers Office, bring up the Bread, and the Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, and the Pages of the Chamber go and take the Meat, at the Prince's Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of the hands of the Officers belonging to the Kitchin, who bring it in Dishes cover'd with Pourcelain, the Grand Seignor not using any Gold Vessels at his own Table.</p>
                     <p>After Dinner, the Grand Seignor says his Noon-Prayer, and sometimes, on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Tuesdays,</hi> which are the principal Council-days, he comes into the Hall of Audience, to discourse with his Ministers of State, concerning his Affairs. On the other days, he walks in the Gardens of the Seraglio, sometimes with his <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> sometimes with the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> or with his <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Mutes,</hi> who shew a thousand apish tricks, to divert him: and sometimes he goes a hunting, or a fishing, according to his inclination. But neither his Affairs, nor his Recreations, do ever divert him from performing the five Exercises of Devotion, at the times appointed by the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> and it is the general Perswasion of all the <hi>Turks,</hi> that if they neglect them, they bring down God's curse upon themselves, and that they cannot avoid the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences thereof.</p>
                     <p>I have said elsewhere, that <hi>Friday</hi> is to the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> what the <hi>Saturday</hi> is to the <note place="margin">The <hi>Sultan,</hi> when oblig'd to go, in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to the Mosquey.</note> 
                        <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Sunday</hi> to the <hi>Christians,</hi> in regard it was upon the said day, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> took his flight from <hi>Mecha;</hi> and I have also given this further intimation, that the <hi>Turks</hi> count their Months only by the number of the Moons. There is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Custome, whereby the Grand Seignor is oblidg'd upon all the first <hi>Fridays</hi> of the several Moons, to go to the new Mosquey, in regard that S. <hi>Sophia</hi> is too near the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, and besides that there is not, between those places, room enough for so great a Train, as that of the Sultan, the people of <hi>Constantinople</hi> would not have the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of seeing him.</p>
                     <p>His Devotion is so great, that he seldom misses that Ceremony, and when there passes a first <hi>Friday</hi> of the month, without his appearance in it, the people is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of opinion, that he is sick, and thereupon turbulent spirits are mutining their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous designes. On those days do they, who have any complaints to make, of some injustice that has been done them, take their opportunity, and plant themselves in the way, through which he is to pass, with Petitions in their hands, which upon a sign made by the Sultan, are receiv'd by the Eunuchs. If the injustice be very great
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106224:312"/>
and the person who presents the Petition be extremely oppress'd and injur'd, he holds a lighted Torch over his head, which is ordinarily practis'd in <hi>Turkey,</hi> upon the like occasions, and by that mysterious comportment, intimates to the Prince, That if he does not do him justice, his Soul shall burn in the other World, as that Torch does in this.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Emperour's going out of the Seraglio, the principal <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his dearest Confort, or his Sisters, are in a Room over the great Gate of that Palace, with Bags full of <hi>Aspers,</hi> which they fling among the people, that they may pray, That God would graciously hearken to the Devotions, which the Grand Seignor is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perform. His March is after the same Order, and with an observance of the Pomp, as that of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours, and I question not, but that those Authors, who have written of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire in general, or particularly of the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> have made sufficient descriptions of that Ceremony, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall think my self dispens'd from the obligation of giving a new one of it. I shall only say this of it, That it is very Magnificent, and that there is not any Monarch in the World, who makes so great an exposal of Gold and precious Stones together, wherewith the Harnesses and Trappings of most of the Horses, as well of the <hi>Grand Seignor,</hi> as those of the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s are all cover'd.</p>
                     <p>At their return from the Mosquey, the <hi>Moufti,</hi> on Horse-back, and at the head of a <note place="margin">The wicked contrivances of the <hi>Moufti,</hi> to get Money.</note> wretched Crew of <hi>Greek Christians,</hi> of the meanest sort of people (for there are very few <hi>Armenians</hi> among them) expect the Grand Seignor, at the Gates of the Seraglio, and telling his Highness, That those people were Mis-believers, who had embrac'd the good Law, intreat him to relieve them, and to make some provision for their liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Upon this exhortation, the Sultan orders twenty or thirty Purses to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst them; nay sometimes his Charity is so great, as to amount to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand Crowns, which are receiv'd by the <hi>Moufti,</hi> and the distribution thereof is made, as he pleases. But the greater part of it he converts to his own use, and holds an infamous correspondence with most of that wretched Crew, who though they often present themselves for that Benevolence, he pretends not to have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of at all. By this Imposture, which is so palpable, and suits well enough with the followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> does that High Priest of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law, put yearly into his Purse, a considerable Sum of Money, which is no small augmentation to his Revenue. But the case is the same with him as with the <hi>Bassa's:</hi> that is, he is not exempted from refunding, and we shall, by and by produce a very late Example of it.</p>
                     <p>And this may serve for a general account of the ordinary lives of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, while they are within the Seraglio. In their Armies, they have other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, especially they, who have Military Souls, as there have been some among them, of whom Histories have given us a very noble Character.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the present state of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, and to the particular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations <note place="margin">The present State of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family.</note> of the Grand Seignor, who now Reigns. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Fourth of that Name, the Son of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and a <hi>Circassian</hi> Lady, was born in the Year 1643. and he is, by that account, got into the Thirty fourth year of his Age, and the Twenty fourth of his Reign. He has two Brothers, <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and <hi>Orchan,</hi> but they are by another Mother, who is still living, and is perpetually studying how to preserve them. He has also a third Brother, named <hi>Solyman,</hi> who is the second of the Sons of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> according to the order of their Nativities. But the Mother of the last mentioned Son is dead; and thence it comes, that the Souldiery, who conceive greater hopes of that Prince, than of either <hi>Bajazet,</hi> or <hi>Orchan,</hi> his Brethren, pity him the more, and have the greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for him, upon that very score of his having lost the support, which he might have expected from a Mother.</p>
                     <p>Ever since the time of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Second, who first introduc'd that inhumane and cruel Custome, of securing the Throne of the <hi>Sultan-</hi>Regent, by the death of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, few of those unfortunate Princes have escap'd the Barbarisme of their Elder-Brother, and they, amongst them, who have been treated with somewhat less of inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106224:313"/>
have pin'd away their lives, in a strict and doleful Imprisonment, being not permitted to see any body. This was the Treatment of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the Father of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Amurath,</hi> his Brother, the Son of <hi>Achmet,</hi> by <hi>Kiosem,</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Excellent parts, and well vers'd in the management of Affairs. <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Brothers are now treated after the same rate, and the Mother of <hi>Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Orchan,</hi> uses all the endeavours she can, to secure to them the affections of the great Officers of the Port, and the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are somewhat disgusted with the capricious humour, and extraordinary covetousness of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> This Prince was advanc'd to the Throne in the Year 1650. after the death of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> his Father, who was strangled by the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> in a Sedition. He being then but Seven years of age, the Regency was bestow'd, during his minority, on the Old <hi>Sultaness,</hi> Mother to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abus'd her authority, and rais'd a dangerous Faction against her Grand-Child, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> wherein she lost her life.</p>
                     <p>The present <hi>Grand Seignor,</hi> who is a Person much addicted to his Pleasures, and <note place="margin">An extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Example of a Father and Son succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively <hi>Grand Vizirs.</hi>
                        </note> takes a particular diversion, in Hunting, leaves the management of Affairs to his Grand Vizir, <hi>Achmet,</hi> who has succeeded <hi>Coprogli,</hi> his own Father, in that principal Charge of the Empire. 'Tis a thing which may well pass for a Prodigy, amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> and such as that there has not yet been any example of it seen, as perhaps there will not be any other hereafter. I have shewn, that it is a thing absolutely contrary to their Politicks; and therefore, had it not been for the great and particular obligations, which the Empire had to <hi>Coprogli,</hi> who, on the other side, cunningly represented to the <hi>Grand Seignor,</hi> that he never durst trust any but his own Son, with the Secret of Affairs, whereof he only had the Key, this very <hi>Achmet,</hi> who, next to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Person of the Empire, would have been, at present, but a simple <hi>Bey,</hi> or Captain of a Galley.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Seignor <hi>Mahomet</hi> is handsome enough as to his Person, his Stature some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">The Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met IV.</hi> the present Prince.</note> exceeding that of the middle sort of persons; he has not too much corpulency, and his health is in an uncertain state. He is very much troubled with a Fall, which he receiv'd, in the violence of his Game, some years since, by leaping his Horse over a broad Ditch: And whereas that passion is still predominant in him, this inconvenience attends it, That, when he is not somewhat favourable and indulgent to himself, in that violent Exercise, he is sometimes taken off his Horse in a miserable condition, the Remedies which might be apply'd to that indisposition, taking no effect, by reason of the little care he takes to preserve himself. He is a person of an unconstant and unquiet disposition, which creates the greater trouble to those who wait on him; and though they study his humours, yet is it a hard matter to satisfie him. He has a Son, who has been circumcis'd with great solemnity, at the age, wherein that Ceremony is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. The <hi>Sultaness,</hi> his Mother, a Woman of a Magnificent humour, to augment the Pomp and Splendour of that Action, to the eyes as well of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as Forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, would have the Garment, which the Young Prince wore that day, to be all cover'd with Diamonds, and, to that end, caus'd several Rich Pieces of the Treasury to be broken; but after the Solemnity, all the Precious Stones were carried back into it again.</p>
                     <p>I said erewhile, that the present Sultan-<hi>Mahomet</hi> is extreamly addicted to Hunting, and makes it so much his Darling Divertisement, that he makes less account of the lives of Men, than he does of his Dogs; and withal, that he is of a very covetous humour. I shall, in one single Example make a sufficient discovery of both those inclinations in him, and that will also further make it appear, how well he was skill'd, in that Knack of exercising great Liberalities, without any deduction out of his Revenues.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> goes a Hunting, there are Orders sent to a great number of people, for the space of four or five Leagues about the place where he intends to Hunt, in order to the surrounding of a certain quantity of Ground, and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing of it so well, as that nothing can escape thence. 'Tis not to be imagin'd, this can be done, without great destruction to the Country, and much inconvenience to the poor people, who are forc'd to leave their work, to carry on an Exercise which is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106224:313"/>
much more toilsome then it, in which they many times come off with the loss of Limb, or Life, or some other disastrous Accident. These continual impositions of trouble and toil put many people into the repining humour, insomuch that an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, who was in favour, having, one day, taken the freedom to represent to the Grand Seignor the prejudice his Subjects underwent, by those courses which occasion'd the spoyling of their Grounds, and the loss of their Lives, he grew very angry, and after some dayes imprisonment, he gave him a shameful ejection out of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio.</p>
                     <p>But, in process of time, the mischievous Inconveniences occasion'd by this insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable pursuance of his Pleasures in Hunting, increasing more and more, the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> and the other <hi>Bassa's,</hi> resolv'd to intreat the <hi>Moufti,</hi> to make a Remonstrance to him, of the ill consequence thereof, he being the only person, who might presume to speak any more of it to the Grand Seignor. The <hi>Moufti</hi> would by no means hearken to it at first, imagining, as he might well, that his harangue would not be pleasing to the Sultan: But, at last, being over-perswaded to do that good office to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he took courage, and his opportunity, to speak to him, with all the insinuation he could.</p>
                     <p>He could not bethink himself of a better Expedient, to remove that predominant <note place="margin">The ancient Custome of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, to live by their handy-work.</note> passion out of his mind, then to represent to him, the Custome of his Predecessors, who took their diversion in some handy-work, when the Warr, or the Concerns of State gave them any remission: That, according to their Example, their Subjects apply'd themselves to things that were beneficial, and made all Arts and Professions to flourish in the Empire, to the great advantage of the Publick: That Sultan-<hi>Amurath,</hi> his Uncle, delighted in making those Horn-Rings, which are us'd in shooting with the Long-Bowe: That <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> his Father, was an Excellent Artist, in the making of Tooth-picks, and other small Instruments of Tortoise-shell: And that it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that so Laudable a Custome should not be lost, since it gave the people occasion to do the like, and so to avoid idleness.</p>
                     <p>He further Remonstrated to his Highness, That it was much more commendable in the sight of men, and more acceptable to God, for him to live by the labour of his hands, then by the sweat of the people, and the Mony arising by Impositions, which were forbidden by the Law: and that what was allotted for the peculiar Diet of his Predecessors, was the product of their own handy-work: That true it was indeed, they were not oblig'd to any assiduity in the Employments they had fancied, but that what they did was as much for their own diversion, as to satisfie the Precept of the Law; and when they had finish'd some piece of Work, they sent it to some <hi>Bassa,</hi> for whom they had a particular kindness, and he receiv'd it with extraordinary respect, and abundance of joy: That he, who was the Bearer of it, when he came to present it, said, That Piece of Work, was made by the Grand Seignor himself, who had sent him to sell it, in order to his own sustenance: And that the <hi>Bassa,</hi> or other person, to whom it was directed, to express how highly he was pleas'd therewith, gave him a certain number of Purses for it; not accounting the Present which was to be made to the Bearer: That what Mony came in that way, was design'd to bear the Charges of the Prince's own Table, and by that means, he could not be charg'd with living by the labour of his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>To this effect was the <hi>Moufti</hi>'s harangue; and I shall tell you by the way, That the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> have the same Custome, or rather, the same Superstition. In the Reign of <hi>Shach-Abas,</hi> there were built, at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> certain places called <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> which are publick houses, where the Merchants are lodg'd, the Rents whereof are set aside for the maintenance of the King's own Table; the Mony which is rais'd by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and other Impositions, being accounted, as to that score, for <hi>Haram,</hi> that is to say, for <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>forbidden,</hi> and reserv'd to be employ'd in the Exigencies of State, and not for the Sustenance of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> dissembling and smothering the vexation, into which the <hi>Moufti</hi>'s <note place="margin">The <hi>Sultan</hi> is cunningly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of the <hi>Moufti.</hi>
                        </note> Remonstrance had put him, pretended to take his Advertisements very kindly, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106224:314"/>
dispos'd himself to satisfie him, in a short time, how well he could make his advantage of the Lecture he had read him. He acknowledg'd, that he had often thought of what he had represented to him, and that he had a way of livelihood in his head, which he hop'd would take very well. Some daies pass'd away, ere the Grand Seignor made the least mention of Hunting; but at last, he grows impatient, he leaves the Seraglio, and had the good fortune to kill a Hare with a Gun, the first he had ever destroy'd that way. He immediately sends it to the <hi>Moufti,</hi> with order to tell him, That he has follow'd his advice, and that having learnt the Prosession of a Huntsman, he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that first piece of his Game should be brought to him, which he was willing to sell, that he might subsist by the Mony it should produce: That he fail not to give Twenty Purses to him who brings it; and that as to his own Person, he knew well enough what he ought to send him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Moufti</hi> conceal'd his surprizal as well as he could, and receiv'd the Hare with great testimonies of his resentments and joy, of the honour, which his Highness had done him; and having bestow'd, according to his own order, Twenty Purses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bearer of the Hare, sends Sixty more to the Grand Seignor himself; learning, at his own cost, and that to the value of Fourscore thousand Crowns, that men should not be over-forward to give their Sovereigns those advertisements, which they desire not of them.</p>
                     <p>To finish the Pourtraiture of Sultan-<hi>Mahomet,</hi> he is further chargeable with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of constancy, in his humour, and a roughness of deportment towards his people, who are thereupon apt to have the less affection for him. And whereas he is indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable in his Hunting-Exercises, and spends whole daies therein, even in the severest part of the Winter-Season, it happen'd, one day, as he was returning home, from the Sport of running down a Stag, that his Grand Falconer took the boldness to represent to him the inconvenience of exposing his Slaves so much in the Ice and Snow, by which means there had dy'd about Thirty of them the Night before, and the rest were in a fair way to follow them. The Prince, not mov'd at all with that Remonstrance, made this Reply to the grand Falconer, That, if the Weather prov'd very hard, they should have a care of his Dogs, and allow them cloathing, and other accommodations, lest the rigour of the Season might take off any one of them; making not the least men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, or provision for the men, whom he sacrific'd to his Divertisement. That rough repartee having been spread among the people, has begot such animosity in them against this Prince, that there's no question made of his being sensible thereof, and that it is, in some measure, the cause of his keeping so much at a distance, from the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of his Empire, where he does not think himself secure.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>IMake a Chapter by it self of the Appartment of the Women, only to entertain <note place="margin">The impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having an exact account of the Womens Appartment,</note> the Reader, with the impossibility there is, of having a perfect knowledg of it, or getting any exact account, either what the accommodations of it are; or how the Persons, who are confin'd therein, behave themselves. There is not in all Christendome any Monastery of Religious Virgins, how regular and austere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, the entrance whereof is more strictly forbidden to men, than is that of this Appartment of the Women: insomuch that my white Eunuch, who has supply'd me with so particular a description of the inner part of the Seraglio, could give me no certain information of this Quarter of it, where the Women are lodg'd. All I could get out of him, was, That the Doors of it are kept by <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> and that, besides the Grand Seignor himself, and sometimes, the Physician, in case of great necessity, there never enters any man into it, no nor Woman, besides those who live in it, and they are never permitted to go out of it, unless it be in order to their confinement in the Old Seraglio. But we must except, out of that number, the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> and their Maids, or Ladies of Honour, whom the Grand Seignor allows, when he pleases, to come into the Gardens of the Seraglio, and whom he sometimes takes abroad with him, into the Country; yet so as that they cannot be seen by any person whatsoever. Four <hi>Negro-Eunuchs</hi> carry a kind of Pavilion, under which is the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and the Horse upon which she is mounted, all save only the head of the horse, which is seen on the out-side of the Pavilion, the two fore-pieces of which, taking him about the Neck, are close fasten'd, above, and below.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Physician, he is never admitted, as I said, but in case of extream he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, into the Appartment of the Women, and with such precautions, that he can neither see the person who is indispos'd, nor be seen by her, but to feel her Pulse through a piece of Lawn, all the other Women having retir'd from her Bed-side, and the <hi>Negro-Eunuchs</hi> having taken their places. Thus you see what precautions they use, to deprive the Women, of the Seraglio, of all means of having any access to Men, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so much as a sight of them: And if it happen that some <hi>Jewess</hi> has entrance into their Quarter, to Trade with them, and to sell them some little Rarities, they are strictly search'd by the <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> lest there should happen to thrust in some Man, disguis'd in Woman's Cloaths, in which case immediate death would ensue. And when the Couriosity of some <hi>Christian</hi> Ladies has inclin'd them to see the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> they seldome escap'd without the receiving of some affront; and I could produce some examples of it, did I think it convenient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106224:315"/>
It might be imagin'd, that, by the relation of the <hi>Jewesses,</hi> it were possible to have <note place="margin">The Commerce between the <hi>Jewesses</hi> and the <hi>Sultanesses.</hi>
                        </note> some account, of the embellishments of the Halls and Chambers of the Appartment of the government of that Female Republick. But it is to be noted, That these <hi>Jewesses</hi> are not permitted to go far into it; for there is a Chamber appointed for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Traffick, and the <hi>Negro-Eunuchs</hi> are the Brokers between them, and the <hi>Sultanesses.</hi> They take cognizance of all, and what the Princesses have a mind to buy, passing through their hands, they make them pay double and treble what the things are worth, and so heap up Wealth, though they have but little occasion or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make use of it.</p>
                     <p>But I do not expect, any one should wonder at that great exactness, of not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any man; no not even a White Eunuch, to approach the Appartment of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note place="margin">The doleful Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Wrestlers.</note> after an Accident, which happen'd at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> in the Year of our Lord M. DC. XXXIX. and which I shall here insert in few words. <hi>Amurath,</hi> at his return, after the taking of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> came and made his abode, for some time, at <hi>Adrianople.</hi> He had a Page, belonging to the Treasury, who was a Native of <hi>Tocat,</hi> in <hi>Natolia,</hi> and, from the place of his birth, they gave him the name of <hi>Tocateli.</hi> He was a well-set Young man, robust, skilful in Wrestling, and, upon that account, the Grand Seignor had made Chief of the Wrestlers.</p>
                     <p>It happen'd, that one of the most Famous, for that Exercise, came about that time to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> out of the Confines of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and in all the Cities, through which he travell'd, he had alwaies been too hard for those who had presented themselves to Wrestle with him. His Reputation was spread all over the Empire, where he had not met with any Wrestler, who acknowledg'd not himself inferiour to him; Which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port coming to the Page of the Treasury, he conceiv'd so great an emulation at the Fame of that Man, whom all the World so highly celebrated, that he sent one of the <hi>Halvagis,</hi> to carry him a Civil Challenge from him, and to acquaint him, That he was desirous to have a Tryal of Skill with him, in the Grand Seignor's Presence. He sent him word withal, That, before his Highness had any notice of it, 'twere convenient, they made some tryal of their strength; And that no body might know any thing of it, he would send him a <hi>Bostangi</hi>'s Garment and Cap, by which means he might come into the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>When the Grand Seignor is not within the Seraglio, where ever it be, the <hi>Bostangis</hi> are permitted to come into, and to go out of it, by the Garden-Gate; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great number of them, it is no hard matter to get a man in under their accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements. By this contrivance did the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Wrestler get into the Seraglio, the next day, upon the sollicitation of the Page, who sent him what was requisite; the Grand Seignor being, that day, gone a Hunting. They both put on Drawers of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, well liquor'd with some fat or oyly stuff, all the rest of the body being stark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and liquor'd in like manner: and after a long dispute, the Page had the better, whether he got it fairly by his own strength, and skill, or that the other yielded the victory, out of complaisance.</p>
                     <p>This Action pass'd in the midst of the place which is before the Garden, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Mutes, and all the Pages of the Seraglio; and the Grand Seignor being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from Hunting, the Superintendent of the Treasury told him, That there was come into the City, a <hi>Pehlivan,</hi> a <hi>Muscovite</hi> by Country, robust, and of a good meen, of great strength, and well experienced in Wrestling, and that if his Highness pleas'd, he should have the satisfaction to see him engag'd in that Exercise. The Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor commanded he should be brought into the Seraglio, the next day, and that <hi>Torca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teli</hi> should have notice, to be ready to entertain him.</p>
                     <p>Being both come to the place, and in a condition ready to close, the Grand Seignor came into a Gallery, attended by all the Grandees of the Seraglio, to be Spectators of that Tryal of Skill in Wrestling. The Victory having stood as 'twere in the ballance a good while, and all the Spectators, being somewhat impatient, to see which side it would turn to, a Mute express'd himself by signs, to one of his Companions, to this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106224:315"/>
effect, That he wondred the Page, who should have deriv'd new strength and courage, from the Grand Seignor's presence, found it so difficult to get the better of the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> whom he had so easily worsted the day before.</p>
                     <p>The language of the Mutes, by signs, is as intelligible in the Seraglio, as if they had the liberty of speaking, and the Grand Seignor, who understands it as well as any of them, as having been accustom'd thereto from his Infancy, and commonly discoursing with them, was strangely surpriz'd, to understand that the <hi>Muscovite</hi> had been, the day before, in the same place. His indignation immediately flush'd into his face; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Wrestlers to give over their Exercise, and, calling the Page to him, he ask'd him, How he had contriv'd that man's entrance into the Seraglio. The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Tocateli,</hi> who could not deny a thing, which so many others were ready to testifie, acquainted his Highness with what had pass'd; whereupon, the <hi>Sultan,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd at the greatness of his confidence, prevented his making an end of the Story, by commanding the <hi>Bostangi-bachi</hi> to be presently sent for, whom he order'd to seize on the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Wrestler, and see him receive Five hundred blowes on the soles of the Feet, with a Wand or Cudgel; which no doubt was enough to make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of exercising himself, for a good while after. The Overseer had Orders, to see the same punishment inflicted upon the Page <hi>Tocateli;</hi> which was immediately put in execution: the Grand Seignor having, in the mean time, retir'd into the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the Women.</p>
                     <p>It was the Opinion of most about the Seraglio, that those two unfortunate wretches would have escap'd, with the punishment of Five hundred blowes, each of them, upon the soles of their feet. But the Grand Seignor, who was resolv'd to have their lives, and had retir'd, purposely, into the Lodgings of the Women, to prevent all mediation for their pardon, sent away presently a second Order, to the <hi>Bostangi-Bachi,</hi> whereby he was commanded to see the Page hang'd up, in the Evening, on a Tree, which is at the Corner of the place, where they had Wrestled, and the <hi>Muscovite</hi> on another Tree, which is without the Gate of the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>Some would be apt to think, that these two Executions were enough to appease the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Amurath's</hi> great Severity.</note> Prince's indignation: But it prov'd otherwise. The next morning, the Sultan-<hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> sent for the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> the chiefest amongst the Eunuchs, and the Grand Master and Comptroller, of the Seraglio, and commanded, That the <hi>Gellad,</hi> who is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Executioner, should also give his attendance. Upon the passing of these Orders, all those, that were present, cast themselves at his Highnesse's feet, beseeching him to consider, That the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> was innocent, that he had not the least notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Page, and that, if it had come to his knowledge, he would have severely punish'd it. The Grand Seignor continuing still extreamly incens'd, could not be appeas'd by all the intreaties and submissions they made to him, and would have the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> as Grand Master of the Seraglio, to be answerable for all those that come into it; when, for the good fortune of that principal Officer of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Palace, there came in the <hi>Moufti,</hi> and the <hi>Seligdar,</hi> or Chief of the Pages of the Chamber, who with much ado made a shift to beg his pardon. Yet was not that granted but in part; for all they could obtain, extended only to the saving of his life; and so the Grand Seignor order'd him to be immediately thrust out of the Seraglio, with a charge never to enter again into it, while he liv'd; and instead of the Dignity of <hi>Bassa,</hi> whereto he should have been advanc'd, to be reduc'd to a small Pension of Three hundred <hi>Aspers</hi> a day.</p>
                     <p>I thought it pertinent to my design, to bring in this Story of the Two Wrestlers, in order to the greater confirmation of what I have affirm'd at the beginning of this Chapter, concerning the impossibility there is, for any person whatsoever, Man, or Woman, to get into the Appartment of the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> when they punish, with so much severity, a Stranger, who, without express order, presumes but to set his foot within any Court of the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106224:316"/>
Take it then for granted, that this is all that can be known, with certainty, of the <note place="margin">How to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish what's true, and what fabulous, as to the <hi>Sultanesies.</hi>
                        </note> Appartment of the Women, who are subservient to the pleasures of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs; whatever is scatter'd abroad, beyond this account thereof, being grounded only upon imaginations and conjectures, which haply are at a great distance from the truth. Certain it is, that this Quarter of the Seraglio, as to some part of it, has a fair Prospect upon that of the Grand Seignor, and that the Doors of it are kept night and day, by a certain number of <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> the most deformed, and the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to look upon, that can be found. It is certain also, that it is well furnish'd with abundance of most beautiful Women, of several Countries, who, by the chance of War, or otherwise, are fallen into the hands of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and Governours of Provinces, who send them up, as Presents, to the Grand Seignor. It is known also, That, of that variety of Women, the Prince does not appropriate to himself above two or three, whom he has the greatest affection for; nay some of those Princes have confin'd themselves to the embraces of one only, after intermarriage. And this is affirm'd, at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Great, after he had plighted his faith to <hi>Roxulana,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ordinary Policy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> after the affront, done by <hi>Temur-leng,</hi> to the Wife of <hi>Bajazet.</hi> The white Eunuchs, who wait in the Grand Seignor's Lodgings, are able, in some measure, to give an account of these things, in regard that the Woman, who is to participate of the Grand Seignor's Bed, is conducted into his own Chamber; and, if it be a new Amour, the noise of it is spread, the next day, all over the Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>It is also known, That the first of those Women, who is deliver'd of a Male-child, and, by that means, becomes Mother to the presumptive Heir of the <hi>Ottoman-</hi>Empire, is consider'd as the principal <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and treated according to her dignity: and the others, who afterwards have Sons or Daughters, have also the quality and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sultanesses;</hi> but the number of the Women, who are to wait on them, is much inferiour, to that of those, who are to attend the principal <hi>Sultaness.</hi> It is known, in fine, That those young Princes are brought up under the tutelage of their Mothers, till they are so many years of age; and when they are strong enough to be put upon certain Exercises, they have Governours and Masters appointed over them, in a distinct Quarter by themselves.</p>
                     <p>Besides these things, which may be positively known, concerning the Appartment of the Women, in the Seraglio, it may well be imagin'd, that the embellishments of their Lodgings are answerable to those of the Grand Seignor, since it is the place, where he passes away the most divertive part of his time. It is also not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, but that it has its Infirmary, its Baths, and the other accommodations, and conveniences, that can be wish'd for. It may also be conjectur'd, That there is, in this Quarter, an observance of the same regulations, as there are in the Chambers of the <hi>Ichoglans:</hi> That some of the more ancient Maids are Mistresses over the Younger ones, and are, night and day employ'd in observing their actions; and that their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary restraint forces them to the same unseemly actions amongst themselves, as the brutish Passions of those Young Men engages them in, whenever they can find the opportunities to commit them. And this presumption has no doubt given occasion to the Fabulous Story, which is related of their being serv'd up with Cucumbers cut into pieces, and not entire, out of a ridiculous fear lest they should put them to undecent uses: they who have forg'd the Story not knowing, that it is the custome in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> to cut the Fruit a-cross, into great thick slices, as I shall make it appear in the Chapter, where I treat of their Gardens. But it is not only in the Seraglio, that that abominable Vice reigns, but it is predominant also in the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in all the Provinces of the Empire, and the wicked Example of the Men, who, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural use of Woman-kind, are mutually enflam'd with a detestable love for one another, unfortunately enclines the Women to imitate them.</p>
                     <p>Of this, there was a strange instance in the time of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent. An <note place="margin">A strange Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of an old Woman.</note> old Woman was guilty of such an excess of extravagance, as to put on Man's Cloaths, and to give out, that she had bought a <hi>Chiaoux</hi>'s place, the better to compass her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, of obtaining the only Daughter of a Trades-man of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106224:316"/>
she was desperately fallen in love, having made fruitless attempts, by other ways, to satisfie her infamous inclinations. The Father, not suspecting any thing of her wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked intentions, and being withal poor, grants her his Daughter, the Marriage is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd in the presence of the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and the imposture having been discover'd the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wedding-night, the old woman was condemn'd the next day to be thrown into the Sea, there to quench the <hi>Gomorrhean</hi> Inflammations of her lewd desires. This Story is to this day related in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and I have had it from several good hands.</p>
                     <p>These insatiable salaciousness amongst the Women, are the effects and consequences <note place="margin">Polygamy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to propagation.</note> of the same inclinations in the Men; and the <hi>Turks</hi> are so much the more execrable and abominable as to this particular, the more they are permitted a plurality of Wives. But, whether it happens through a just punishment from Heaven, or proceed from their Sorceries, which are common and allow'd in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and ordinarily practis'd by the Women, in opposition one to another, to appropriate the affections of their Husbands, it has always been observ'd, That the <hi>Turks</hi> who keep many Women, are not so well stor'd with Children, as they, who observe Conjugal Chastity, and confine themselves to one. I question not but those Authors, who have written of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have given a sufficient account of that plurality of Wives, and of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Matrimony, amongst the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the manner, how the Grand Seignor demeans himself in the prosecution of <note place="margin">The Secrecy of the <hi>Grand Seignor's</hi> Amours.</note> his Amours, it is a Secret, which I shall not enquire into; I have not much endeavour'd to make any discoveries of it, and it is a hard matter to give any account thereof, without some hazard of travesting <hi>History</hi> into <hi>Romance.</hi> They are Intrigues, which do not admit of any Confident, by whom they may be disclos'd, and all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly related thereof, is haply at a great distance from the true state of things: not to press this, That we ought to have a respect for all Princes, and to forbear divulging what informations we may possibly have receiv'd, of their secret Amours.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>ON the Second of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year of our Lord, One Thousand, six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, Sixty and Eight, the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> Mother to the Grand Seignor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, at her return from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> made her Entrance into <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where I then was, of which Entrance take the eusuing Description.</p>
                     <p>About Six in the Morning, some numbers of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> not observing any order, <note place="margin">The Order of the March.</note> took their way towards the Seraglio, sometimes ten, or more, sometimes twenty, in little detachments, which lasted for some time.</p>
                     <p>After them came two hundred men on Horse-back, belonging to the House of the <hi>Cologlou,</hi> that is to say, the Grand Seignor's Favourite, with short Guns resting on the Bowe of their Saddles, and all very meanly clad, as also the Officers of his Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, who coming in the Rear of the others, were, in like manner, poorly habited, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106224:317"/>
ill mounted. After them appear'd in somewhat a better order, the menial Retinue of the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> his Officers, as well those belonging to the Chamber, as those of the Stables, were very handsomely mounted, and all in their yellow Garments.</p>
                     <p>The next appearance was that of the <hi>Spahis,</hi> who are the <hi>Sultaness-</hi>Mother's Life-Guard. Of those there were four hundred, which made a handsome Shew, being all well mounted, and well clad. They had all their Coats of Mail, with their Vests of red Taffeta, and had on the right side a Quiver of Crimson-Velvet, embroider'd with Flowers of Gold; and on the left, a Bowe in a cover of red Velvet, embroider'd as the other. They had all of them Helmets on their Heads, and over them white Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants, and from the Helmets there hung small Chains of Mail, resembling Locks of Hair, which they use when occasion requires, to ward off a blow from the neck and face. Every one of them had also a Launce in his hand, and the Trappings of their Horses were of one of these three Colours, yellow, violet, and red, of a rich Stuff, with an embroidery of Silver.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spahi-Bachi</hi> came in the Rear of them, having a Plume of Heron-tops in his Turbant, three foot in height, which made him remarkable, and distinguish'd him from all the other <hi>Spahis.</hi> On the Breast-piece of his Horse, were fasten'd a dozen little Scarffs, which hung down negligently, and he was attended by six Pages, who had Caps on, after the <hi>Slavonian</hi> Mode, red Vests tuck'd up about the waste, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Hose, or Drawers.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Spahis,</hi> there pass'd several <hi>Janizaries,</hi> but not marching in any order, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by two hundred men on Horse-back, and in the Rear of them, came the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary-Aga,</hi> a Person of a very goodly presence. He had for his immediate Attendants six gentile young Persons, who had each of them, hanging over his shoulder, a kind of Quiver, full of small Wands, which are a sort of Arrows, without any Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work at the ends.</p>
                     <p>After the forementioned, there came up twelve men, who are as it were the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Ceremonies, in very ridiculous Accoutrements. They had Silver Wands resting on their Shoulders, their Vestments were garnish'd with small Bells, and they had Caps on, which had somewhat hanging down of each side, resembling Asses Ears.</p>
                     <p>The next appearance after that extravagant Party, was that of an hundred <hi>Capigis,</hi> all well mounted, every one with a Launce in his hand, with a Flag fasten'd thereto, reaching from the top to the bottom, which made a very noble Shew. In the Rear of the Troop came the <hi>Capigi-bachi,</hi> distinguish'd from the rest by a high and large Plume of Heron-tops, which added much to the gracefulness of his looks, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>After them, came a hundred <hi>Chiaoux's,</hi> well clad, and well mounted, having their great Caps on their Heads; and in the Rear of them came the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> having a Cap of the same fashion, attended by twenty Pages, very neatly clad.</p>
                     <p>The next appearance was that of five or six hundred <hi>Bostangis,</hi> with their Caps like Sugar-loaves, their Habits of a red linnen Cloath, and Muskets on their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The <hi>Bostangi-bachi</hi> came after them, sumptuously clad, and mounted, with a <hi>Chiaoux-</hi>cap upon his head, and a great number of people about him.</p>
                     <p>There appear'd next, two hundred <hi>Cadis,</hi> making a most noble Shew, all modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clad, with their Busquins of black <hi>Spanish-</hi>Leather, and white Turbants, like great Balls of Wooll, or Silk.</p>
                     <p>They were follow'd by the <hi>Scherifs,</hi> who affirm themselves to be of the kindred of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and made up a Troop of sixty Persons. As they were the Relations of the Prophet, they wore green Turbants of an extraordinary bigness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106224:317"/>
After the <hi>Scherifs,</hi> came the two principal Officers of the <hi>Moufti</hi> (for he never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in person in these sorts of Ceremonies) and they were clad in white, having a very demure and religious Countenance.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cologlou,</hi> or Grand Seignor's Favourite, appear'd next mounted on a gallant <note place="margin">The wealth of the Favourite.</note> Horse, whose Harness and Trappings were of the richest. The Stirrups were of Gold, and the Housse was embellish'd with an embroydery of Gold and Pearls. His Vest was of a red Brokado, and his Cap like those of the <hi>Chiaouxes.</hi> Two men held the reins of his Bridle, and his Horse curvetted all along, as if he had been sensible of the goodly presence of his Master, and how well it became him. He was a person of a good stature, and of a graceful countenance, having withal a mild and sprightly look, and every one saluted him, as he advanc'd still towards the Seraglio. The Servants belonging to his Stable marched after him, and fifty Grooms led each of them a Horse in his hand, and those horses were all high-priz'd, and their Harnesses as sumptuous as could be made. 'Tis commonly reported, That this Favourite, who is a person of very great merit, hath acquir'd vast Riches, and that his Train, whether as to the number of Servants, or as to that of Horses, surpasses that of many great Princes.</p>
                     <p>There came up next a small Troop of <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> marching confusedly, before <note place="margin">The <hi>Sultanesses</hi> Coaches.</note> the Coaches of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> Mother to the present. Grand Seignor, all well mounted, and Magnificently clad, in different colours,</p>
                     <p>There appear'd afterwards Six <hi>Capigis,</hi> about the first Coach, drawn by six Excellent Horses. They had each of them a Launce in his hand; and, in the Rear of them, there appear'd a Horse-tail-Banner, of a pale-red colour, whereby it was known, that some <hi>Bassa's</hi> were coming up, as indeed there were, and they were a Convoy to the second Coach, drawn by six white horses, in which was the <hi>Sultaness-</hi>Mother, and another <hi>Sultaness.</hi> Two Black Eunuchs march'd on each side of it, the Boots, or Doors being latic'd, that the Princesses might see, and not be seen. Which hindred not, however, but that, as the Coach of the <hi>Sultaness</hi> came forwards, some were still crying out to the people, and commanding them to look the other way; which Command it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them exactly to obey, and that especially in <hi>Perfia,</hi> where they must get away as far as they can, to avoid the hazard of receiving a good blow with a Sable.</p>
                     <p>After the asoresaid Coach, there pass'd by Twelve other Coaches with four horses apiece, wherein were the Female-Slaves belonging to the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> having two <hi>Negro-Eunuchs,</hi> at the Doors of each Coach, which were latic'd, as the former: After which there follow'd several Litters, and four great Waggons, full of Snow, for the use of the <hi>Sultanesses,</hi> and their Retinue.</p>
                     <p>All this Cavalcade, consisting of between five and six thousand men, took up almost three hours in its passage, and having made its Procession through <hi>Constantinople,</hi> lodg'd it self in the Seraglio, according to the description I have given you of it.</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, there were several Persons of Quality, who had the Curiosity to see that Entrance; and among others, Monsieur <hi>Ribier, de Ville-neuve,</hi> a Counsellor of the Parlement of <hi>Paris;</hi> Monsieur <hi>Le Mairat,</hi> a Counsellor of the Grand Council: The Abbot of <hi>Champhuon, de la Saulsaye,</hi> all <hi>Parisians;</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Aubert,</hi> a Native of <hi>New-France,</hi> and, by Extraction, a <hi>Norman,</hi> Son to the Governour of <hi>Guarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Revenues of the Gardens employ'd for the Grand Seignor's Table. Cucumbers, a fruit of much delicacy amongst the</hi> Levantines, <hi>and how they eat them. A noble Pyramid, resembling</hi> Trajan's <hi>Pillar. Fountains. The number of the Gardiners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT is an ancient Custome, or rather, a Law, establish'd by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, <note place="margin">The Revenues of the Gardens, how employed.</note> that the profits made out of their Gardens, should be contributary to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own Tables, and they have several of them, in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as well on the <hi>Europaean</hi> side, as the <hi>Asian,</hi> all along the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore. But I shall give an account, only of the Gardens of the Seraglio, that so I may not exceed the limits I have prescrib'd to my self in this Relation.</p>
                     <p>There are in the Seraglio several Gardens, wherein there are only Flowers, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Appartments, and particularly in that of the Grand Seignor, and, no question, but the same thing may be said of the Quarter of the <hi>Sultanesses.</hi> Yet is there not any thing extraordinary, which might oblige me to give this description thereof. The great Garden, whereof the <hi>Bostangi-bachi</hi> has the oversight, as he has also of all the others belonging to the Grand Seignor, takes up the greatest part of the Seraglio, and consists of a great number of Walks, planted, of each side, with Cypress. Those Walks are much neglected, so that in several places, they are not clear'd of Bryars and Thorns. When it is known, that the Grand Seignor is to come and take his diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement there, a great number of <hi>Bostangis</hi> are immediately commanded out, to make clean the Walks, which he uses to frequent, and the spaces between those Walks are so many Kitchin-Gardens, or Orchards, which are very well furnish'd with Fruit-Trees, of several excellent kinds. Of Strawberries and Raspices there is great store, and they have large beds of Melons, and Cucumbers; but most of these last, which are accounted a great delicacy amongst the <hi>Levantines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Cucumbers, they commonly eat them without taking off any thing of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cucumbers</hi> a great delicacy amongst the <hi>Levantines.</hi>
                        </note> tinde, after which they go and drink a glass of Water. In all <hi>Asia,</hi> it is the ordinary sustenance of the meaner sort of people, for the space of three or four months; the whole Family lives upon them, and when a Child asks for something to eat, whereas in our <hi>Europaean</hi> Countries, they would give him bread, in the <hi>Levant,</hi> they bring him only a Cucumber, which he eats raw, as it comes out of the Garrison. Laborious persons, and such as are in a manner tyr'd with working, such as Camel-drivers, and those who are entrusted with the care of the Horses, and Mules, in the Caravans, make a kind of Sallad of their Cucumbers, not much unlike the Mash, which we would give our Horses. When they are come to the Lodging place, where the Caravan is to make a stay, they take a large Basin, which they almost fill with water, and having put some sowr milk into it, they cut a great number of Cucumbers, into great slices, and so make a kind of mash of them. 'Tis a pleasant sight to see them at the confounding of it. Amongst ten, or twelve, who all stand round the said Basin, there is but one woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Spoon, which every one takes in his turn, till they have made a shift to empty the Basin. That done, they fall a drinking of water, and those who have wherewithall, go and take a dish of Coffee, or smoke a Pipe of Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106224:318"/>
But to do them all the right they deserve, the Cucumbers in the <hi>Levant</hi> are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently good, and, though eaten raw, they never do a man any hurt. The Story of the Cucumbers which occasion'd the cruel death of Seven Pages of the Grand Seignor's Chamber, is not, haply, known to all people; or at least, all know not the reason, why the Pages of the Chamber are not now permitted to go into the Gardens.</p>
                     <p>Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the second of that name, taking a turn in the Gardens of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, attended by his Pages, was much surpriz'd to see a bed of Cucumbers, which look'd very fair to the eye, and were extreamly forward, considering the Season. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great lovet of that fruit, he recommended them to the <hi>Bostangi-bachi,</hi> who told them over every day, and, with some impatience, expected their maturity, that he might present them to the Grand Seignor. Some daies after, going to Visit the bed, he found his number of Cucumbers shorter, than it should have been, by three or four, and that they who had taken those that were missing, had made choice of the ripest, and thereupon making a strict enquiry, to find out who have been guilty of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, he found that the Pages of the Chamber were the only persons who had been, that day, in the Gardens.</p>
                     <p>Upon that discovery, he went and gave an account of the whole matter to the Grand Seignor, who was so highly incens'd thereat, that, not prevailing with any one of the Pages to acknowledg the Theft, he, out of a cruelty as much above all credit, as beyond all example, caus'd the Bellies of seven of them to be ripp'd up. The Theft was found in the Belly of the seventh of those unfortunate Young Men, who, after the execution done on the other six, would not acknowledge his guilt, out of hopes, that the Prince's indignation would not have extended so far. From that very time, and in commemoration of so strange an action, the Pages of the Chamber are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go into the Gardens of the Seraglio; what one Prince has establish'd, as I have hinted elsewhere, being never revok'd by his Successors, who bear a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the enactions of their Ancestors.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of the Great Walk, which goes from the Seraglio, to the Sea-Gate <note place="margin">A Pyramid; much resembling <hi>Trajan's</hi> Pillar.</note> which looks towards <hi>Scudaret,</hi> there is a Pyramid, erected upon a square Pedestal, and which four men would have much ado to fathom. About the Pedestal they have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd some bryars and thorns to grow, and it seems to have been done out of design, to hinder peoples coming close to it. The Pyramid, from the top to the bottom, is full of Figures, whereof the heads are struck off; and it may be conjectur'd by some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders, that there was a very noble head on the top of it, as being the Master-piece of the work. This Pyramid somewhat resembles <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar at Rome; and some, who have seen both, imagine, they were the work of the same Master.</p>
                     <p>All the Fountains of the Gardens have their Basins of Marble, of different colours. <note place="margin">Fountains,</note> Near each of them, there is a little Scafsold, surrounded with Ballisters, which they spread with rich Carpets, and Brocado-Cushions, when the Sultan comes to take his walk there: and 'tis only at that time, the Waters play; which Diversion he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives the Princesses, who bear him company.</p>
                     <p>There are appointed for the culture of these Gardens two thousand <hi>Bostangis;</hi> and <note place="margin">The Gardiners</note> yet, though there be so vast a number to keep them, they come far short of the Neat Contrivances, and Imbellishments of ours.</p>

                     <p>I Have so often had occasion, in the present Relation I have made of the Grand <note place="margin">General Laws for all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Sects.</note> Seignor's Seraglio, to speak of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, that I am content, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put a period to this Work, to make it appear, how far it extends into the three parts of our great Continent: <hi>Mahumetisme</hi> having not yet set footing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which has been discover'd but two Ages since. I meddle not at all with the Doctrine of it, of which I am sufficiently assur'd that many persons have written: and I shall only entertain the Reader with a Geographical Chart of all the Countries of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> which are under the dominion of the followers of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the Opinions of their Doctors be different, as to what concerns the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Law, and that there are principally two great Sects, that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which is the Stock; and that of <hi>Hali,</hi> one of his principal Successors: Yet those two general Sects, and the particular ones, which are derivable thence, are all concordant in the fundamental Points, which every <hi>Mahumetan</hi> is oblig'd, in Conscience, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and practise. Of those I gave an account, when I made mention of the Prayers or Devotions, which the <hi>Turks</hi> are bound to perform five times a day, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of <hi>Mecha</hi> is one of those principal Articles. I have also said something of them, in the Chapters treating of the Present, which the Grand Seignor sends thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every Year; and in this last, I shall endeavour to express my self fully as to that matter.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Europe,</hi> we have no <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes but the Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Cham</hi> of the Lesser <hi>Tartary:</hi> But in <hi>Asia</hi> there are many of them, who are powerful, and possess'd of great Dominions. The Grand Seignor extends his Jurisdiction, in this part, beyond the Sources of the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> and beyond the mouths, by which it falls into the Sea, and towards the North, as far as the Territories of the <hi>Mengre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> To go thence from the West to the East, next the Grand Seignor, we must count the Princes of the Three <hi>Arabia</hi>'s, with several of whom I have often spoken, in Two of my Voyages, wherein I have been oblig'd to pass through the Desarts. The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the King of <hi>Visapour,</hi> the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> the Kings on the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> of whom the most considerable is that of <hi>Comorin;</hi> the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and the Kings of the Mountains, to the North side of the same <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:106224:319"/>
who are got into <hi>China;</hi> All these Kings, I say, follow the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>Since I have mentioned the Emperour of <hi>Java,</hi> I shall, by the way, insert here an observation, which I made at the time of my being in that Island, which was, <note place="margin">A curious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of the Emperour of <hi>Java</hi>'s Son.</note> That the eldest Son of that Emperour, who reign'd in the year 1648. had six fingers on each of his hands, and six toes on each foot, and all of equal length.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>Persia, Visapour,</hi> and <hi>Golconda</hi> follow the Sect of <hi>Hali;</hi> and the Kings <note place="margin">Kings following the Doctrine of <hi>Hali.</hi>
                        </note> of the Mountains of <hi>Tartary,</hi> with some others, have also their particular Sects. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is to observ'd, that, if we except the Grand Seignor, the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, and the <hi>Cham</hi> of Great <hi>Tartary,</hi> all the other Kings, whom I have named, have only Idolaters to their Subjects, and all the meaner sort of people is involv'd in the darkness of Paganism. But as to the Grand Seignor's, with all his Militia, they follow the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Africa,</hi> there is a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> King, whose Territories lie all along the Coast of <hi>Abex,</hi> which is towards <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> as far as the Cape of <hi>Guardafu,</hi> and his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extends over the Red Sea, and the Ocean. The Governours, whom the Grand Seignor employs in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Islands of the Red Sea, and those others, whom he has establish'd all along the Coast of <hi>Barbary,</hi> at <hi>Tripoli, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Argiers,</hi> who assume the Title of Kings, are also <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> and, in fine, the King of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco</hi> follows the same Law.</p>
                     <p>All these Kings and Princes, are principally unanimous in this Point, That they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themselves oblig'd to send every year some Present to <hi>Mecha,</hi> which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily consists in rich Carpets, to be put upon <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sepulchre. Sometimes these <note place="margin">The Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi>'s Royal sent to <hi>Mecha.</hi>
                        </note> Presents are made upon a particular Vow; and it happen'd in one of my Voyages to <hi>Agra,</hi> that the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> by way of thankfulness to the Prophet, for the recovery of his health, sent to <hi>Mecha,</hi> an <hi>Alcoran,</hi> valued at four hundred thousand Crowns, which had, in the midst of the Cover, a Diamond, of three hundred Carats; the rest of it being garnish'd with several precious Stones on both sides The occasion of this Present was, the fright which a certain <hi>Brameré</hi> put him into, upon his telling him, That he should dy before the year was expir'd, which happen'd not accordingly. But the King being extremely incens'd at that direful Prediction, and, upon the smart In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory he put to the <hi>Brameré,</hi> to wit, whether he knew also the time of his own death, having receiv'd this Answer, That it should be within three days; which real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen'd upon the third day, there was a sufficient ground for him to be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to conceive an apprehension, that the like accident might happen to himself, before the time limited. 'Twas that induc'd him to send a Present of so great value, to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sepulchre, to acknowledge the favour he had done him, in not suffering the Prediction of the <hi>Brameré</hi> to take effect, the King having not had as much as any indisposition, during all that time.</p>
                     <p>When I gave an account of the Pilgrimage of <hi>Mecha,</hi> upon occasion of the Tent <note place="margin">The several ways whereby the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> come to the Sepulchre of their Prophet.</note> and Carpet, which the Grand Seignor sends thither every year, I made no mention of the several ways which the Caravans take, according to the several parts of the World, from whence great multitudes of <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do every year take their progress thither.</p>
                     <p>In the first place, the Ambassadors, whom the Kings of the Islands, whereof I have given you the names, and the Kings of the <hi>Indies,</hi> on this side the <hi>Ganges,</hi> send to the <hi>Sheck</hi> of <hi>Mecha,</hi> with their Presents come by Sea, to <hi>Mocha,</hi> a Maritime City of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and from thence they travel to <hi>Mecha</hi> by Land, by the conveniency of Camels.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians,</hi> who inhabit all along the Sea-side make their descent from <hi>Ormus,</hi> or to <hi>Bandar,</hi> and having pass'd over the Gulf, which, at that place, is not above twelve or thirteen Leagues in breadth, are forc'd to cross <hi>Arabia</hi> ere they can get to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106224:320"/>
City. But the Inhabitants of the upper-parts of <hi>Persia,</hi> towards the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and all the <hi>Tartars,</hi> come to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> from which place, the great Caravans, which take their progress through the Desarts, set forth, and bring the Pilgrims to <hi>Mecha.</hi> Some take the way of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but very seldom, because the <hi>Bassa</hi> exacts a Tribute of them, and particularly of the <hi>Persians,</hi> whom they account Hereticks; and that consideration has oblig'd the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid his Subjects to take that Rode, thinking himself not inferiour to the <hi>Turk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of the Devouter sort of <hi>Persians,</hi> and such as are most zealous for their own <note place="margin">Troublesome Iresarts in the way to <hi>Hali</hi>'s Sepulchre.</note> Sect, take the way of <hi>Babylon,</hi> upon this score, that it brings them at the same time to the Sepulchre of their Prophet <hi>Hali,</hi> which is but eight days Journey distant from it. This is the most wretched place, of all the places upon earth, and affords no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but the most corrupted water, which is drawn out of certain Pits, and that of a Canal, which <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> caus'd to be brought thither from the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but which is now quite out of repair. Whoever expects to drink good water there, must bring it along with him, from other places, from other places, five or six days Journey di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the other: And yet that false Prophet imposes on those, who have such a Devotion for him, not only the inconveniences of coming so far off; but also those of being in a fair way to perish by thirst, and hardship of lodging.</p>
                     <p>The last time it was my fortune to pass through the Desarts, I came to that dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable place upon this occasion, that meeting with a Courrier, who was come from <hi>Babylon,</hi> with two <hi>Arabians,</hi> whom he had in his Company, he gave us intelligence, that the Grand Seignor's Forces, which had then newly taken <hi>Babylon,</hi> were upon their march back, in little Detachments, and that there was no question to be made, but they would seize on our Camels and Baggage. Which advertisements oblig'd us to take our course more to the South, and to get further into the Desert, where we spent sixty and five days in the crossing of it, to avoid meeting with those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>As for the Princes of <hi>Arabia,</hi> they have no great Journey to make, because they are the next neighbours to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sepulchre.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> come to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and there joyn the Caravan; and those of <hi>Africa</hi> pass to Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and meet in the Desarts, with the same Caravan of <note place="margin">A Miraculous Canal of water of the length of 18 days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> 
                        <hi>Aleppo</hi> at eighteen days journey from <hi>Medina,</hi> where there is a water, which goes by a Canal, quite to that City, all the way of those eighteen days journey. They have it by Tradition, That that water was found by their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as he cross'd the Desert with his Army, ready to dy for thirst, and that going to drink of it first of any, there issued a Voice to him out of the Water, which said to him, <hi>Prophet, thou wilt find it bitter:</hi> That he made the Voice this Answer, <hi>Let us all drink of it, for I know it is sweet, and I would to God, that we could always find as good.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Voice replying the second time, said to him, <hi>Prophet, Command, and I will follow thee:</hi> And that as soon as he had spoken, the Water made a Canal under ground, and follow'd him quite to <hi>Medina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Damas, Hierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Cairo,</hi> they account forty days Journey to <hi>Medina,</hi> and it is at the two and twentieth day's journey that they find that water. 'Tis part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to see that miraculous Water, which had been sweetned by the Prophet, that there goes into those places so great a concourse of People, of so many different Nations, from all parts of the World: in as much as there is no <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> let him be at ever so great a distance, and but tolerably in a condition of health, and supply'd with the external accommodations of fortune, who does not think himself oblig'd to go once in his life to <hi>Mecha,</hi> in person, or to send some other in his stead.</p>
                     <p>After the Pilgrims have continu'd certain daies at <hi>Medina,</hi> they go to <hi>Gebel-Araffa,</hi> that is to say, the place, where <hi>Adam</hi> found <hi>Eve,</hi> his Wife, five hundred years, after God had created her. It is a City in the Mountains, at the distance of Two Dayes Journey from <hi>Medina,</hi> and at one from <hi>Emena,</hi> another City, which is half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106224:320"/>
both. Assoon as the Pilgrims are come thither, all those who are so well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, buy a Weather to make a Holocaust of it, and to distribute it amongst the poor, they being not allow'd to keep above two pounds of it, for themselves. If they do not punctually observe that, and that some discovery should be made thereof, they are made incapable, ever after, while they live, of shaving their Heads, or paring their Nails.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Gebel-Araffa,</hi> they return to <hi>Medina,</hi> where they keep an account of the time, when the Caravan arrived there; in regard that all the Pilgrims, who came by Land, are, as I said elsewhere, maintain'd with sustenance for the space of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen dayes; but they who come by Sea are sustain'd, as long as they continue there, even though they should make it the place of their abode, as long as they live.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ensuing Narration was put into my hands Five or Six Years ago, by a very Intelligent Worthy Person, who long resided in the same Family with our Author, and did assure me, that the Discourse here published, was written with his own hand, and presented unto that Honourable Person who redeemed him out of Captivity. The Gentleman who bestowed these Papers upon me, will not be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for the Truth of all therein contained; but I having compared his Account of several Countries with that of <hi>Olearius</hi> and other more Ancient and Modern Writers, have found them very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant unto each other, and therefore do charitably believe him no less Faithful in his Description of those Countries and People concerning whom little hath been said by any besides. By reason of his long absence from his Native Country, and dis-use of his Mother-Tongue, his style was so rough, odd, and unpleasant, that I was forced to make therein great Alterations both as to Method and Expression, yet keeping strictly unto his sense: I have also much abbreviated his Discourse, many things being often repeated, and he having stuffed it with divers impertinencies, which would have been void of all Instruction and Delight. He would never own his true Name or Pedigree, for Reasons mentioned in his Paper, which I thought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unnecessary to be rehearsed; that of <hi>Astracan,</hi> wherewith he concludes his <hi>NARRATIVE,</hi> being fictitious, and I suppose assumed, because of his long Residence in a City of that name, from which he made most of his Excursions: And which with the Adjacent Country he hath above all others most particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, giving us the names of several Neighbouring Places and Rivers mentioned by no other Writer. I was highly pleased with the Account he gives us of <hi>Czarofs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorod,</hi> which he also sometimes calls <hi>Seraichan</hi> and <hi>Seraichena;</hi> the former of which is the <hi>Muscovitish,</hi> the latter the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Appellation, and interpreted, both signifie the Habitation of the Emperour or <hi>Cham,</hi> it being formerly the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a great Empire. As also with his mention of a place on the West-side of the <hi>Volga,</hi> where he sayes <hi>Astracan</hi> was formerly situated. Concerning both which Cities, I shall declare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things I have Collected out of several <hi>European</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Writers, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are not commonly known, or little regarded. But I must necessarily premise somewhat concerning the Antient Inhabitants of the Country wherein these Cities are situated.</p>
                  <p>The first Nation (of whom I find any mention) who made any fix'd habitation in these Quarters were the <hi>Chazari,</hi> so named by the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> but by the <hi>Mahumetans, Alchozar,</hi> and <hi>Gorjani.</hi> This Nation during the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Justine,</hi> like a Torrent Overflowed all that Vast Continent which lies between <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> Conquered part of <hi>India,</hi> All <hi>Bactria, Sogdiana,</hi> and made the <hi>Persians</hi> Tributary, by whom they are always called <hi>Turks,</hi> and their Prince, <hi>Chacan,</hi> a Title formerly common unto all great <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperours. This Mighty Monarch having conquered the <hi>Igors</hi> or <hi>Jugurs, Avares, Chuni</hi> or <hi>Huns, Abtelites</hi> or White <hi>Huns,</hi> and all other Tribes of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> together with the <hi>Alani</hi> (whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion then extended, as appears by <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> from the <hi>Boristhenes</hi> far beyond the most North-East part of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea) entred into a League with <hi>Justine,</hi> and styles himself in his Letters, <hi>Lord of the Seven Climates of the World.</hi> His Acts may be read at large in <hi>Theophilactus Simocatta; Excerptis de Legationibus:</hi> and divers others of the <hi>Bizantine</hi> Historians. This Nation Assisted the Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> in his Wars
<pb facs="tcp:106224:323"/>
against the great <hi>Cosroes,</hi> whom by their Assistance he overcame. These <hi>Chazari</hi> were also possessed of all that part of <hi>Taurica Chersonesus</hi> which is plain and fit for feeding Cattle, they being addicted, after the manner of all other <hi>Scythian Nomades,</hi> unto a Pastoral life; which <hi>Peninsula</hi> from them was untill the Famous Irruption of the <hi>Tartars</hi> in the Thirteenth Century, called <hi>Cassaria,</hi> or <hi>Cazaria,</hi> and afterwards more corruptly by the <hi>Genoeses, Venetians,</hi> and other <hi>Latines, Gazaria.</hi> I find mention of these <hi>Chazari</hi> or <hi>Chozars</hi> in divers <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Historians and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. <hi>Abulpharagius</hi> acquaints us with an Expedition they made into <hi>Persia</hi> the 183. Year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> which was after our Account in 799, from whence they returned with great Spoile, and above 100000 Captives: and afterwards, in the 514<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of the <hi>Mahumetan Epocha,</hi> being A. C. 1120. they made another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, accompanied by the <hi>Comanians,</hi> (whom the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Kaphjaks;)</hi> Frequent mention is made of them by that Deservedly Celebrated <hi>Arabian</hi> Geographer <hi>Al Edrisi,</hi> who flourished in the 548<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the <hi>Hegira;</hi> of Christ, 1153. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways calls the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, <hi>Mare Chozar:</hi> And all that Country on the North and to the West of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, <hi>Terra Chozar.</hi> He acquaints us, that the Residence of the Prince of <hi>Chozar</hi> was not far above the Mouth of the <hi>Volga,</hi> which the <hi>Tartars</hi> call <hi>Athel;</hi> which name I suppose it derived from <hi>Attila,</hi> that Renowned King of the <hi>Hunns,</hi> being so called in the Relation of the Ambassadors who were sent by the Emperour <hi>Justine,</hi> unto the Great <hi>Chacan</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> residing in the East. <hi>Al Edrisi</hi> and his Epitomizer, commonly known by the Name of <hi>Geographus Nubien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> intimate, That these <hi>Chozars</hi> inhabited divers other Cities, but that this was the Metropolis; he suppresses the Name, styling it only from the River, the City of <hi>Athel;</hi> and declares, it was divided by the River, the chief and greatest part being on the West-side; and that the other less considerable on the East-side, was inhabited only by the meaner sort of People and Merchants, it being a place of great Trade; that which made it more considerable, was the liberty allowed unto all of the Publike Profession, and Exercise of their respective Religious Perswasions, <hi>Jews, Christians, Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> being there equally countenanced, which I suppose might occasion that Dialogue published out of an Ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Manuscript, by <hi>L'Empereur,</hi> between the Author a <hi>Jewish</hi> Rabbi, and the King of <hi>Chozar.</hi> This City is said to have been extended along the River three miles in length, and it's breadth proportionable; the Western part well fortified; adorned with the Emperours Palace, and several other eminent Structures. <hi>Nassir Eddin,</hi> who wrote at the latter end of the 13th Century, calls this City in his Geographical Tables, <hi>Balanjar,</hi> and from him <hi>Abulfeda;</hi> they place it in 46 degrees 30 minutes of Northern Latitude; where within six or eight mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes our best Geographers seat <hi>Astracan.</hi> And questionless this was that City which our Author and <hi>Olearius</hi> call <hi>Old Astracan.</hi> These <hi>Chazari,</hi> did, I suppose, conserve their vast Dominion without any great Interruption, at least until <hi>A. C.</hi> 900. For <hi>Alferganus</hi> who lived about that Time, places no other Nation in his Table of Climes, between <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Boristhenes;</hi> And <hi>Eutichius,</hi> who wrote about 30 or 40 years after, makes mention of them as a mighty Nation, and many amongst them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto the Christian Belief. About the middle of the 10th Century these <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zari</hi> gave place unto the <hi>Cumanians</hi> or <hi>Comanians,</hi> who were also a <hi>Turkish</hi> Nation known unto the <hi>Turks, Persians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Kaphjack;</hi> whether they expelled the <hi>Chazari,</hi> or that the former becoming the more Eminent Tribe, gave Law and Name unto these latter (as hath since frequently happened among the <hi>Tartars)</hi> I will not here undertake to determine: but this is certain, that suddenly the Name of <hi>Chazari</hi> was extinct, and all that Tract of Land from the <hi>Nepper</hi> unto <hi>Turkestan</hi> 1500 miles beyond the <hi>Volga,</hi> was inhabited by these <hi>Cumanians,</hi> who were often troublesome unto the <hi>Russes, Lithuanians, Hungarians</hi> and other Neighbour-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But this People was almost totally destroyed by the <hi>Tartars</hi> in that great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation which happened at the beginning of the 12th Century, soon after the death of <hi>Jingiz Chan;</hi> whose Son <hi>Hocota</hi> being chosen Emperour, sent his Nephew <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> or <hi>Bathy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Tussy Jingiz Chan</hi> his Eldest Son, with 400000 Men, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Northem Parts of <hi>Asia.</hi> The <hi>Cumani</hi> for divers years valiantly resisted, and made the greatest opposition the <hi>Tartars</hi> met with in all their Conquests; repuls'd them in two pitch'd Battels; but then growing secure, and dispersing upon the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> retreat, they were unexpectedly surprized, the whole Countrey over-run, above 200000 killed, their King <hi>Kuthen</hi> hardly escaping with 40000 into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:106224:323"/>
he met with a kind reception, had land allotted him, and his Company; which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is called <hi>Campus Cumanus</hi> unto this day. This Countrey was so miserably wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that in the Years 1253, and 1254, when <hi>Rubriquis</hi> passed through it, going unto and returning from his Ambassage to <hi>Mangu Chan,</hi> there was no fixed habitation, excepting a few Cottages in the Island where <hi>Astracan</hi> is now situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Bathy</hi> having destroyed the <hi>Comanians,</hi> ruinated their Cities, and established his own Dominion, began to think of a fix'd abode, which after long observation he chose near the River <hi>Volga,</hi> on the East-side, and immediately beneath the River <hi>Acta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> a great Arm of the <hi>Volga,</hi> and the first it dismisses, which empties it self into the <hi>Caspian-Sea</hi> (having run a course of near 400 miles, and received several other Branches from the foresaid River) about 7 Leagues East off the main River. He had newly began this City at the return of <hi>Rubriquis</hi> from his Embassage unto <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu Chan,</hi> in the year 1246, and called it <hi>Serai;</hi> Which City was enlarged and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by all his Successors, unto the time of its destruction by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> which was almost 150 years. <hi>Bathy</hi> was succeeded by <hi>Barcah,</hi> who was the first professed <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Emperour; he by <hi>Hocola,</hi> or <hi>Hoctay,</hi> Contemporary with <hi>Hayton</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi> who hath in his History largely discoursed concerning him: I should here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the other Emperours interceeding between <hi>Hocota</hi> and <hi>Tucktamisch</hi> (who was dispossessed by <hi>Tamerlane)</hi> together with their Acts, but that I hasten unto that which most immediately concerns our present Design, and give some account of this City, which (as I said) was first named <hi>Serai,</hi> which interpreted signifies only a Dwelling or Habitation; the beginning of it being a Palace built for <hi>Bathy.</hi> You may see what our Traveller says concerning it, <hi>Page</hi> 112. Besides him I find two Authors who make particular mention thereof; the first is in the History of <hi>Arabshiade,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Golius.</hi> This Author represents it as one of the greatest and most populous Cities in the Universe, agrees with our Traveller in the situation, only he calls that Branch which runs out of the <hi>Volga</hi> and passes to the South-East, <hi>Sencle.</hi> The other is <hi>Michovius,</hi> who wrote his History of the <hi>Tartars</hi> in the year 1515. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affirms, That in his time there remained the ruines of 300 Temples, besides the Walls of the City, and several other Magnificent Structures. The <hi>Tartars</hi> have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times attempted to re-edifie' it, but divisions amongst themselves, Wars with the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and attempts of the <hi>Cossacks</hi> caused them to retire unto places of greater security. But because little mention is made of this great Revolution by any <hi>European</hi> Writer, I shall here present the Reader with an account thereof out of the most Authentick <hi>Turkish, Arabian,</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Writers. For <hi>Calcondilas</hi> is greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, who seems to have received by his confident way of writing, most particular information, when as nothing can be more remote from the truth than what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>viz,</hi> That <hi>Tamerlane</hi> after several attempts, and two or three Battels was forced to retire, and glad to secure his Retreat by a Peace, he first made with <hi>Tucktha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misch,</hi> which was by both afterwards kept inviolably; which is contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of much more Authentick Historians. The Origin, Progress and, Event of this War was after the ensuing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being in effect Prince, but in name only <hi>Courachan</hi> (the <hi>Greeks</hi> call it <hi>Kurgan)</hi> that is, Viceroy or General over all those Countries which are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the <hi>Oxus</hi> and <hi>Juxartes,</hi> wherein <hi>Bochara, Samarchand,</hi> and several other famous Cities were contained, extended his Conquests towards <hi>Balch</hi> and <hi>Chorasan,</hi> (the <hi>Aria</hi> of the Antients;) which progress of his filled <hi>Thuetamisch</hi> Emperour of <hi>Serai</hi> (the City we have before mentioned) with jealousies of his growing Greatness; whereupon gathering a numerous Army, he resolved to invade him, using no forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or so much as pretence, he thought to have surprized his Enemy; but <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> one of whose Master-pieces was to gain early Intelligence of whatsoever was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, or transacted by neighbouring Princes, having timely notice of his intention, gathering all his own Forces, together with considerable assistance from his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates marched directly towards his Enemy, and passing the <hi>Jaxartes,</hi> met him to his no small astonishment, on the Borders of his own Countrey; for the <hi>Jaxartes</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided their Territories. After a most obstinate bloody fight, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> gained the Victory, yet neither absolute, nor without great loss, but it was sufficient that he
<pb facs="tcp:106224:324"/>
had secured his own Dominion. After this Success he did for divers years attend other Conquests, and having subdued a great part of <hi>India,</hi> all <hi>Persia, Media, Armenia, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> he resolved to requite the Invasion of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamish:</hi> whereupon having drawn together an Army of 500000 men, he marched through <hi>Media Atropatia,</hi> then and still called <hi>Shervan;</hi> passed the <hi>Portae Caucasiae,</hi> which the <hi>Persians</hi> name <hi>Derbent;</hi> thence through <hi>Dabestan,</hi> and the great Desart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and <hi>Astracan</hi> (then named <hi>Gitturchan)</hi> and having wasted all that spacious Countrey on the West-side of the <hi>Volga,</hi> depopulated and dismantled divers fair Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (the ruines of several being yet visible to those who Navigate the <hi>Volga,</hi> as we are informed by <hi>Olearius)</hi> he passed the <hi>Volga,</hi> and on the East-side encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Thuctamisch,</hi> who had collected a mighty Force, having besides his own <hi>Hords,</hi> the assistance of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Cassan, Tumen, Kalmuke,</hi> and <hi>Dabestan:</hi> and his Army by this accession was more numerous than that of his Enemy. The Battel was long doubtful, and exceeding all that happened in that Age for carnage and cruelty, both Parties being full of hatred unto their Adversaries; and knowing that this Fight would lose or gain them a mighty Empire. They fought three days with little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, and it could not be discerned which had the advantage. But that which is thought chiefly to have occasioned <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s Victory, was the departure of a great Tribe from <hi>Thuctamisch,</hi> whose Prince <hi>Ectave</hi> pretended he had received some great injury or affront, but 'twas indeed thought he was corrupted: For retreating unto <hi>Amurath</hi> the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour, he after the same manner betrayed <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who soon after succeeded; revolting at the beginning of the fight unto <hi>Tamerlane. Thucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misch</hi> being defeated, with great difficulty made his escape, leaving his Countrey ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto the sury of the <hi>Zagataians,</hi> whom so great a slaughter of their own Friends had highly exasperated. They spared nothing that was capable of being spoiled; demolished <hi>Serai,</hi> together with <hi>Seraichick</hi> upon the <hi>Jaick,</hi> and <hi>Gitturchan,</hi> which were the only considerable Cities on the East-side of the <hi>Volga,</hi> and leaving the Countrey a meer Desart, killing, or captivating the Inhabitants, driving away the Cattle, they returned into <hi>Persia</hi> with great Booty. This happened in the 791 year of the <hi>Hegira. A. C.</hi> 1388. <hi>Serai,</hi> and <hi>Saraichick</hi> never regained their former splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; but <hi>(Giturcan</hi> now <hi>Astracan)</hi> did by degrees recover, but never arrived to that heighth it attained unto during the Empire of the <hi>Chazari</hi> and <hi>Zavolgensian Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Josaphat Barbaro,</hi> and <hi>Ambrosio Contarini,</hi> who were both Ambassadors from the <hi>Venetians</hi> unto <hi>Usun Cassan</hi> Emperour of <hi>Persia,</hi> and well acquainted with those Parts; <hi>Barbaro</hi> living sixteen years at the City <hi>Tana</hi> on the mouth of the River <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais;</hi> and <hi>Contarini</hi> being forced in his return from <hi>Persia</hi> to reside there some months: They, I say, both tell us, That this City before its destruction by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> was a very famous <hi>Emporium;</hi> all the Silks, most of the Spices and other Commodities, which were afterwards brought down to <hi>Syria,</hi> were then carried by Shipping to <hi>Astracan</hi> (which they both name <hi>Citrachan)</hi> and thence by Land in a few days to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> whether the <hi>Venetians</hi> sent every year sixteen great Gallies. But after its subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> this Commerce ceased, and the Gallies received their Lading in <hi>Syria,</hi> and at <hi>Alexandria</hi> of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> In the time of the forementioned Writers, which was from the year 1436, when <hi>Barbaro</hi> first went to <hi>Tana,</hi> until his return out of <hi>Persia</hi> in 1488. And <hi>Contarini,</hi> who returned not long before him, <hi>Citrachan</hi> was a mean Town, consisting chiefly of <hi>Tartarian</hi> Huts, and encompassed with a pitiful mud-Wall, a place of no considerable Traffick, only the <hi>Muscovites</hi> fetched thence Fish and Salt. But <hi>Juan Vassilowich</hi> having reduced it in the year 1554 under his Dominion, it hath been by succeeding Emperours both fortified and enlarged: I shall say no more concerning it, <hi>Olearius</hi> a most diligent and judicious Writer, having left us so particular a Description thereof. I shall only add, That I suppose the cause of so different names, as <hi>Gitterchan, Citrachan,</hi> and <hi>Astrachan,</hi> were occasioned by the Princes, who successively praesided, as is very obvious to any who are acquainted with the Customes of the <hi>Arabians, Persians, Turks,</hi> and other Eastern People.</p>
                  <p>But to return unto our <hi>Zavolgentian Tartars,</hi> so called by the Neighbouring <hi>Slavonick</hi> Nations, because the Seat of their Empire, and their chiefest places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence were on, or near the <hi>Volga</hi> (which River did also almost equally divide their Territory) <hi>Za</hi> being only an Expletive Particle, as I could manifest by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb facs="tcp:106224:324"/>
of several <hi>Russian, Polish,</hi> and <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Names of Men and Countries. After the devastation of their Countrey they would notwithstanding have soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their former Grandeur, had not Divisions and Intestine Wars long kept them low; and at length after divers wonderful and great Revolutions given the <hi>Russes</hi> leisure first to breath, and then invite them to deprive them of the best part of their Dominion. They not able to resist, being broken, as I said, by Discord and Division into divers petty Principalities. And on the other side, the <hi>Crim Tartar,</hi> assisted by the <hi>Turk,</hi> subdued the remainder, whereby that Tribe which before was comparatively inconsiderable, became Supreme, and is at this day a terror un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the North-East Countries of Christendom. To shew in what manner, and by what degrees all this was transacted, is rather matter of a just History, than of a Preface; the <hi>decorum</hi> whereof I have already transgressed, in making a Porch almost as large as the main Building, to which it should serve only for an Entrance.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore conclude with some short and slight Remarks on divers Passages in our Authors Relation. His account of the <hi>Periplus</hi> of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, (leaving out what he allows for the <hi>Teine Sea,</hi> or <hi>Palus Maeotis)</hi> differs little in number of Miles from that of <hi>Arrian,</hi> though they disagree somewhat in particular distances; and is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully consonant to that calculation of <hi>Eratosthones, Hecataeus, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who reckon it to amount unto 23000 <hi>Stadia,</hi> or 2875 Miles, which wants but 15 of our Travellers Computation.</p>
                  <p>He is also more particular, and I believe, more exact than any I have hitherto met with, in his Description of <hi>Crim</hi> or <hi>Taurica Chersonesus,</hi> whose length and breadth he gives us in several places directly, or by consequence. What he tells us concerning <hi>Arbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka</hi> and the great Field without it, surrounded by the Sea he calls <hi>The Ratten Sea,</hi> is scarcely mentioned by any Modern Geographer, but wonderfully consonant to what is delivered by <hi>Strabo. Arbotka</hi> seems to be <hi>Taphre,</hi> the <hi>Ratten Sea,</hi> he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Lacus putris,</hi> and affirms to be part of the <hi>Palus Maeotis:</hi> in compass 4000 furlongs, with divers other particulars, confirming our Travellers Discourse, as may be read at large in his seventh Book. And I find in a Discourse published by Mr. <hi>Thevenot</hi> concerning the <hi>Tartars,</hi> written lately by a Religious Missionary who long resided in those parts, a Description of this place very sutable unto our Author. His words are these, speaking of the most remarkable places in <hi>Crim.</hi> Arbotec <hi>est un Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steau avec une tour scituée sur la col d'une Peninsule que est enfermée entre la Mer de</hi> Limen, &amp; Tineka Woda <hi>cette gorge n'a plus d'un quart de lieue, elle est traversee d'une Pallisade qui s'ende d'une Mer a l'autre: la Peninsule est appellée par nos</hi> Cosaques Cosa, <hi>a cause q'elle a la forme d'une faulx, c'est on ce lieu ou le Chan tient son Haras qui est bien de septante mille Chevaux. Et il est un destroit entre la terre ferme e Cosa 200 pas de large qui est gayable quand il est calme, le Cossaques le passent quand ils vont derober le Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux de haras de Cham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What our Author tells us of the Communication between the <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Volga</hi> at <hi>Camusshanka,</hi> is particularly described by <hi>Olearius,</hi> who wrote many years after him; who also agrees with us in his account of the Rivers of <hi>Circassia,</hi> and <hi>Comukes</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; only our Writer is more punctual in his Description of their Sourses and Course, and mentions two or three omitted by <hi>Olearius,</hi> or unknown to him. A frequent mention is made by <hi>Procopius, Agathias,</hi> and others of the <hi>Bizantine</hi> Historians, of that strait passage between <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Anadoule,</hi> or as they word it, between <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> or <hi>Armenia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Author having given an account of the Course of the <hi>Volga,</hi> and of the most remarkable places lying upon, or near it; at last assures us, That it empties it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea only by 22 Mouthes, whose names he there rehearses: whereas other Writers ascribe unto it 70 Entrances, though as <hi>Olearius</hi> judiciously observes, most of them are rather passages made by the Sea between Islands and broken Ground, than proper distinct Arms or Branches of the forementioned Rivers.</p>
                  <p>What is said concerning the <hi>Cossacks</hi> retiring unto, and nesting in an Island of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, is confirmed by a late <hi>French</hi> Writer, who long resided in <hi>Persia,</hi> He
<pb facs="tcp:106224:325"/>
largely acquaints us with the great spoil these Outlaws made on the Coast of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanderon,</hi> that they took <hi>Asterabath</hi> one of the Emperours Royal Seats, and having continued several days in possession, retired with great Booty and little loss.</p>
                  <p>I could render some probable account of those Thieves our Writer calls <hi>Sigakes,</hi> of what Nation they are, when they began, and how they live; but shall for brevity-sake wave this and divers other Remarks; and that I may manifest how impartial my sentiments are in reference unto the Treatise I have here published, I shall first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That I never met with any Writer who calls that vast Plain between the Rivers <hi>Boristhenes</hi> and <hi>Tanais</hi> the Desart of <hi>Ingel</hi> and <hi>Vngul,</hi> although I have seen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Journals both Antient and Modern, of Persons who have frequently traversed that vast Region: and have read most Histories, and perused Geographical Books or Tables that relate unto the <hi>Tartars,</hi> or their Countrey. Secondly, I must declare my distrust of his computation concerning the compass of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; which he makes less than in truth it is as I could largely demonstrate; though he hath pretty well salved the mistake, by his allowance of a thousand Miles for Bays, broken Ground, and Promontories. Lastly, Our Author is greatly mistaken, when he affirms, There is no Nation of <hi>Tartars</hi> between those of <hi>Bochara</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> whereas indeed several very Potent Kingdoms intervene. And yet he hath luckily <hi>Andabatorum more,</hi> hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Truth, where he assures us, there are no <hi>Catayans</hi> between the <hi>Usbeg Tartars</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> For indeed there is at present no <hi>Catayne</hi> besides <hi>China,</hi> which is so called by all <hi>Tartars, Persians, Arabians,</hi> and other <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> as also by the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and other Nations who travel thither by Land, either in the Quality of Ambassadors, or Merchants. Though formerly there was a mighty People, either <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi> (they being both Originally the same, as to Extract, Language, Manners, Religion, and Government) who lay directly in the way between <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Chatae</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> but almost extirpated by <hi>Jingiz Chan,</hi> whom they vigorously resisted. And the remainder have ever since gone under the more general Names of <hi>Mogulls</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> as I shall hereafter more clearly and fully demonstrate in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which I have long ago written, and may speedily publish, concerning the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and Progress of the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Nations and Empires.</p>

                  <p>BEing given to understand, That I have been represented unto your Lordship, by several who bear me no good will, as a Person possessed with that Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ordinarily prevails among Travellers, of affirming I was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with divers Countreys and Languages, whereunto I am utterly a stranger: And perceiving that none of my Discourses have more exposed me unto this Censure, than a pretended monstrous rash Assertion (but indeed a real Truth) That I knew and had visited all the Countreys surrounding the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Caspian</hi> Seas: I thought my self necessarily obliged in order unto my Vindication, to draw up a short Account of all those Countreys, which do incompass the forementioned Seas, most of which Places I have personally surveyed, and fear not any Reprehension or Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being resolved to declare nothing but what I saw, or received from such who were best able to give me full and faithful Information. And I am well assured, That the more strict and judicious Enquiry is made into this my Report, the more favour and credit I shall gain with your Lordship, and all other considering impartial Persons.</p>
                  <p>I shall first begin with the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> as being that wherewith I was first acquainted, and near unto this most famous City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where your Lordship may easily learn, whether I am guilty of either falshood or mistake; and if I am found upon due Enquiry to declare any manifest Untruth, I deserve not only unparalleld Reproaches, but the most severe and exemplary Punishments which I should justly merit, when owing Life and Liberty unto your Lordships Bounty and Compassion, I should instead of a grateful Acknowledgment, present your Honour with a heap of impudent Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>
                  <p>I will begin my Relation or Peregrination, from that side of the <hi>Black</hi> Sea on which <hi>Constantinople</hi> is situated, and round the said Sea, until I return to <hi>Scodra,</hi> which is in <hi>Asia</hi> opposite thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The first Province is <hi>Romella;</hi> the second <hi>Wallakie;</hi> the third <hi>Ackremen;</hi> the fourth <hi>Crim;</hi> the fifth the great Desart of <hi>Ingul</hi> and <hi>Ungule,</hi> which is between <hi>Crim</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>showa;</hi> the sixth is the <hi>Little Nagoy;</hi> the seventh <hi>Circassia;</hi> the eighth <hi>Abassa;</hi> the ninth is <hi>Mingrellia;</hi> then <hi>Georgia;</hi> and lastly <hi>Anatolia.</hi> All which Countreys are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto the <hi>Turk;</hi> besides the great Desart, the <hi>Little Nagoy</hi> and <hi>Circassia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall now mention the most noted Places which I know from <hi>Fennara,</hi> which is about the entrance into the <hi>Black</hi> Sea, unto the River of the <hi>Danaw,</hi> so to the <hi>Neistre,</hi> from thence unto the <hi>Nepper,</hi> so round about <hi>Crim,</hi> unto the <hi>Gulf</hi> that goeth from the <hi>Black</hi> Sea into the <hi>Teine</hi> Sea, and thence unto <hi>Asshowa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I said, near the Entrance into the <hi>Black</hi> Sea is <hi>Fennara,</hi> then <hi>Innatada, Missewra, Warna, Balshick, Mangalley, Constancha, Karaharman, Keelley, Ackremen, Osshackowa,</hi> upon the mouth of the River of the <hi>Neppre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I shall declare the Distances of these Places from each other; the number of miles being the space betwixt what forgoes and immediately ensues. From <hi>Finnara</hi> to <hi>Inatada</hi> 80 miles; to <hi>Missewra</hi> 90; to <hi>Warna</hi> 100; to <hi>Balshick</hi> 16; to <hi>Mangalley</hi> 40; to <hi>Constancha</hi> 40; to <hi>Caraharman</hi> 40; to <hi>Kelley</hi> 80; to <hi>Ackremen</hi> or <hi>Beallohorda</hi> 100; to <hi>Osshakowa</hi> 80; in all 666 miles; and from <hi>Osshakowa,</hi> which is in the mouth of the <hi>Nepper,</hi> unto the River <hi>Don</hi> (or <hi>Tanais)</hi> is 500 miles; the Voyage by Sea and journeying by Land being much at one, <hi>viz.</hi> 1186 miles, unless you go by Land unto <hi>Precop,</hi> about <hi>Crim,</hi> and so unto <hi>Asshowa,</hi> where the <hi>Don</hi> falls into the <hi>Teine</hi> Sea <hi>(Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus

Maeotis)</hi> and then it amounts unto at the least 1500 miles. Were it not for the forementioned great Rivers of the <hi>Danaw (Danubius)</hi> and the <hi>Nepper (Boristhenes)</hi> there would be almost continual Wars between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the <hi>Poles, Lithuanians</hi> and <hi>Muscovites;</hi> for the <hi>Danaw</hi> is one of the greatest Rivers in the World arising in <hi>Dutchland,</hi> whence it passes through <hi>Hungary, Wallachy,</hi> and at the Town of <hi>Kelley</hi> falls into the <hi>Black</hi> Sea. It hath four Mouths or Entrances into the said Sea, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Bohasses, Boctegen Bohasse, Edreleisse Bohasse, Sullena Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasse,</hi> and <hi>Kelley Bohasse.</hi> It abounds with Fish, as <hi>Sturgeon, Morone,</hi> and <hi>Sheveroke,</hi> besides divers sorts of smaller Fish. The <hi>Neistre</hi> is a River that comes from <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and runs into the <hi>Black</hi> Sea under <hi>Bealohorda.</hi> The <hi>Nepper</hi> comes from <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Russland,</hi> runs by <hi>Smolensko</hi> and <hi>Kiovia</hi> to the <hi>Porrocks</hi> or Falls, thence to <hi>Aslamgorode,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Black</hi> Sea at <hi>Osshakowa.</hi> It abounds with many sorts of good Fish, and all along its Banks feed innumerable wild Beasts of divers kinds. The Town of <hi>Aslamgorod</hi> stands upon the <hi>Nepper;</hi> and in former times there dwelt in it two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Ingul</hi> and <hi>Ungul,</hi> who fell first at variance, which ended in cruel Wars, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof the adjacent Countrey became, though otherwise pleasant and fruitful, a very Wilderness. And besides, the <hi>Cossacks</hi> increasing on both sides the <hi>Nepper</hi> and upon the <hi>Don,</hi> would never since suffer that Countrey to be quietly possessed by these, or any other Hords of <hi>Tartars;</hi> so that now it lieth waste, being a vast Desart 500 miles over, and 1000 miles long, from the shallow Waters near <hi>Precop,</hi> unto the Countrey of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> About 1625 the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> sent an Army from <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to rebuild <hi>Aslamgorod,</hi> with Orders to inhabit the Countrey, and invite such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as would become subject unto the <hi>Turkish</hi> Government. But they who arrived, finding the Town of great Compass, built only a Castle on the Bank of the <hi>Nepper,</hi> and left 300 Men in Garrison. At the same time <hi>Shaugary</hi> Prince of <hi>Crim,</hi> being beat out of his Countrey by his General <hi>Chan Timur Myrsa,</hi> retired unto the <hi>Cossacks</hi> upon the <hi>Nepper,</hi> and having contracted a Friendship with them and the bordering <hi>Russes,</hi> by their assistance he gathered an Army of 40000 Men, and marched towards <hi>Crim,</hi> leaving behind him a revolted <hi>Ottoman,</hi> with a Brigade of 3 or 4000 Men, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the departure of Sultan <hi>Shaugary,</hi> marched directly towards <hi>Aslamgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and early in a Morning surprized the Castle, then in the possession of the <hi>Turks,</hi> put every Man in Garrison to the Sword, slighted the Walls and other Fortifications, retired with the Spoyl, and marched to joyn Sultan <hi>Shaugary,</hi> who in the interim arrived near <hi>Precop,</hi> where he was met by <hi>Chan Timur,</hi> and totally defeated, but by good fortune escaped, and by the way of <hi>Astracan</hi> got to <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Nepper</hi> we will pass unto <hi>Crim,</hi> with which Countrey I am well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having against my will resided there some years. <hi>Crim</hi> is a small Land, so near as I can conjecture 200 miles long, and 50 miles broad, but is wonderfully populous, and exceedingly fruitful, abounding with Corn and Grass; the only scarcity they have is Wood, which grows no where but upon the Sea-Coast, from <hi>Bakessey Seray</hi> unto the Town of <hi>Crim,</hi> which in former times was the chief City: All the rest of the Land is a Plain, where they have no Wood to burn, nor any sort of Fewel, but <hi>Fissheke, Fuss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hane, Curay,</hi> and <hi>Stroa.</hi> The Land is inclosed with the Sea, excepting at two places, <hi>Precop,</hi> and <hi>Arbotka.</hi> By <hi>Precop</hi> there is a narrow passage, through which you may go to the <hi>Nepper, Lithuania,</hi> or <hi>Muscovy,</hi> through the Desarts of <hi>Ingul</hi> and <hi>Ungul;</hi> and there is a Water comes from the <hi>Teine</hi> Sea, called the shallow Water, and goeth along the Desart, until it comes to <hi>Precop,</hi> upon West-side of <hi>Crim</hi> and by North, where it turns back on the North-side of <hi>Crim</hi> is almost surrounded with Water; for the <hi>Black</hi> Sea is on the one side, and the <hi>Ratten</hi> Sea on the other, which latter produces nothing but Salt, for it is so salt, that no Fish can live therein; I have reason to know it, because I lived in a Village which was called <hi>Seekely Otta Mamutachy.</hi> The Towns round about <hi>Crim</hi> on the Sea-side are these, <hi>Precop, Cuslowa, Crim, Caffa, Kerse</hi> and <hi>Arbotka;</hi> and within the Land, <hi>Carasu, Ackenesh, Messheite,</hi> and <hi>Bakessy Seray.</hi> The Town of <hi>Arbotka</hi> lieth on the North-East side of <hi>Crim,</hi> between the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Ratten</hi> Seas, which there come so near together, that there is no more Land between them, than that whereon the Town of <hi>Arbotka</hi> stands; and without <hi>Arbotka</hi> is a great Field 50 miles long inclosed with Water, where the <hi>Tartars</hi> in Winter do keep their Hergels or Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106224:326"/>
which Field goeth to the shallow Waters, where I ran away from the <hi>Tartars.</hi> I shall here take my leave of <hi>Crim,</hi> and pass unto the <hi>Little Nagoy,</hi> to <hi>Asshowa,</hi> on the River <hi>Don,</hi> which runs down from <hi>Bealla Ossharra,</hi> through the Country of <hi>Russia,</hi> between <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> until it comes to <hi>Peilesboy,</hi> not far from the <hi>Wolga;</hi> for from <hi>Peilesboy</hi> to the River <hi>Camusshanka,</hi> is not above 20 miles all level, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Perewolog,</hi> where the <hi>Cossacks</hi> do draw their Strukes or Boats upon Wheels, to the River of <hi>Camusshanka,</hi> by which they pass into the <hi>Volga;</hi> whereupon this Place is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Perewolog.</hi> The <hi>Don</hi> runs down between the <hi>Little Nagoy</hi> and the Desarts of <hi>Ingel</hi> and <hi>Ungule,</hi> so to <hi>Asshowa,</hi> right under the Town, and there falls into the <hi>Tein</hi> Sea. This River is full of Fish, especially <hi>Sturgeons;</hi> well inhabited by <hi>Cossacks,</hi> for there are seldom less than 10000 upon it, besides those that go on Freebooting. There are also 16 Gorodkees, or strong Skonces, well manned, and with store of great Guns, they being in continual fear of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and sometimes also of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi> The <hi>Little Nagoy</hi> lies between the <hi>Tein</hi> and <hi>Caspian</hi> Seas, the former on the West, the latter on the East, <hi>Shercassen</hi> to South, and the <hi>Volga</hi> on the North; and there is never a Town in all this Countrey excepting <hi>Asshowa.</hi> It is inhabited by <hi>Tartars,</hi> who go altogether in Hords; their Prince in my Time was <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say Myrsa,</hi> whom the <hi>Tartars</hi> call also Sultan <hi>Ulugh,</hi> or the Great Prince. They sowe no Corn but <hi>Pross,</hi> which they sowe upon the Sea-side up unto <hi>Asshowa;</hi> and after sowing they depart with their Hords, and graze up and down the Desarts to the <hi>Don,</hi> to <hi>Capbane, Shurpoha, Yedecul, Comma</hi> and <hi>Curray,</hi> to <hi>Masshargorodoke,</hi> and to <hi>Shercassen</hi> Land, under the Rivers <hi>Terigke,</hi> and <hi>Balke,</hi> and almost to <hi>Pettigor,</hi> and by the River of <hi>Cupba,</hi> and back again unto the <hi>Black</hi> Sea. Thus they ramble all the Summer, until their Harvest be ripe, and their Pross gathered, and put into Yams under ground; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they settle from <hi>Asshowa,</hi> all along the Sea-side, amongst the Reeds, and leave their Horses to winter in the Desarts. So I shall leave the <hi>Little Nagoy,</hi> and pass unto <hi>Temerassa,</hi> in <hi>Shercassen</hi> Land, which is 500 miles from <hi>Asshowa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in all <hi>Circassia</hi> are but two Towns, <hi>Temerossa</hi> on the <hi>Black</hi> Sea, upon the Gulf that goeth from the <hi>Black</hi> Sea into the <hi>Tein</hi> Sea, right over against <hi>Arbotka.</hi> The other is <hi>Tumein,</hi> upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, the distance between them being 1100 miles; and all the rest of the inhabited Places are only Cubbacks made in the Woods, piled round with Timber. Their Houses are very high, in the midst whereof they make the Fire. Their Men are proper Men, very like the <hi>Irish</hi> both for person and garb; for they go in Trowses, with short Mantles, wear long Hair on both sides of their Heads, with a shorn Crown between. Their Women are very beautiful, and loving to Strangers; for if a Stranger come unto their Houses, their young Women and Maidens will look Lice in their Shirts, and all about them, the most private parts not excepted, and will allow them the liberty to examine and handle all parts of their Bodies besides their Breasts. The <hi>Circassians</hi> are excellent Horsemen, and very couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but withal exceedingly ignorant and superstitious; for when they kill a Goat or Kid, they cut off the privy parts, and cast it against a Wall, if it stick, they pray to it; if otherwise, they cast it away, and spread the Skin upon Stakes, place it in their, Corn-fields, and worship it. They have no Writing among them, yet pretend to be good Christians. Do strangely bewail the Dead, making great Cryes, scratch their Hands and Faces, until they draw much Blood, knock their Foreheads against the ground, until Knobs arise bigger than Plums. The Men are notorious Thieves, steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from each other, and he that steals most is accounted the bravest Fellow. Their Countrey is very fruitful, abounding with most sorts of Grain; and they have store of excellent Grass. They have also much Fruit growing wild; many sorts of Beasts, as Harts, Hinds, Kine, Eissubrass, Hogs and great Adders.</p>
                  <p>The considerable Rivers which I know are <hi>Cubba,</hi> which runs from <hi>Pettigor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Shercassen</hi> Land and the <hi>Little Nagoy,</hi> betwixt <hi>Termerossa</hi> and <hi>Asshowa,</hi> 20 miles from <hi>Temerossa</hi> it falls into the <hi>Jein</hi> Sea, and hath a Course of 500 miles. The next is the River of <hi>Balke,</hi> which comes out from <hi>Cabardy,</hi> and falls into the River of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigke,</hi> 200 miles from its Source; which River of <hi>Terigke</hi> descends from the Mountains between <hi>Shollohofe Knasse</hi> and <hi>Mundarawa Knasse,</hi> runs through the Countrey almost due East, passes by <hi>Goracho Colloda,</hi> thence to the <hi>Shussa,</hi> and the <hi>Shunsa,</hi> so on to the <hi>Weistra;</hi> and 6 miles from <hi>Tumein,</hi> between <hi>Tumein</hi> and the <hi>Commocks</hi> Countrey,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106224:327"/>
it falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, having a Course of 600 miles. There is another River called <hi>Tumenka,</hi> which is a branch of <hi>Terigke,</hi> runs through <hi>Tumeine</hi> Town, and 3 miles beyond it enters the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. There is also another River which they call <hi>Keeslar,</hi> which falls out of <hi>Terigke,</hi> and 60 miles from <hi>Tumeine</hi> is received by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>Having formerly mentioned <hi>Pettigor,</hi> I shall give you some Account thereof. <hi>Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> being interpreted, is in English 5 Hills. They are five very great and high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, distant about 500 miles from the <hi>Black</hi> Sea, and 700 from the <hi>Caspian</hi> beyond <hi>Cabardy.</hi> I came thus to know them:</p>
                  <p>In the year 1618. I was sent with <hi>Shiedake Myrsa,</hi> from <hi>Astracan</hi> to the <hi>Little Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goy,</hi> to seize upon <hi>Orrake Myrsa,</hi> who being informed of our coming, fled up to <hi>Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor;</hi> yet he made not such hast but we overtook him, and having fought, overcame him, and took away his Hords, by which means I became acquainted with <hi>Pettigor.</hi> Nevertheless there are higher Hills than <hi>Pettigor,</hi> as <hi>Sneesnagore</hi> in <hi>Cabardy,</hi> which is incredibly high, which is in English, the Hill of Snow; for upon that and <hi>Shadgore,</hi> which signifies a wonderful high Hill, and overtops the former, and so along for 100 miles, from <hi>Cabardy</hi> to <hi>Shollohofe,</hi> prodigious quantities of Snow are lodged, which it's thought were never dissolved since the Creation. I asked a <hi>Circassian,</hi> Whether ever any Man arrived at the top of <hi>Shadgore,</hi> which to me seemed much elevated above the rest; who answered me, They had a Tradition among them, that formerly a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatteere,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Hroda,</hi> attempted to climb it, and after two or three days hard labour, arrived not unto the middle; but after a few days, being better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, he returned, with a resolution, if it were possible, to see the top, but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afterwards heard of; and added, That it was to that day customary for the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Circasstans,</hi> at a certain season of the year, with divers Ceremonies and great Lamentations to bewail his loss.</p>
                  <p>The next Countrey to <hi>Sheercassen</hi> Land is <hi>Abassa,</hi> which is situated between <hi>Circassia</hi> and <hi>Mingrellia,</hi> and the Inhabitants are a kind of <hi>Circassians. Mingrellia</hi> is under the Dominion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and lies on the <hi>Black</hi> Sea. Of these two Countreys I have no great knowledge, having only coasted them three or four times in Boats, when I was among the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> where also we landed divers times, taking store of Kine and Sheep, but no Prisoners, because they affirmed themselves to be Christians. They are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per handsome People, but very poor, and notorious Thieves, for they steal not only Goods, but even Women and Children from each other, and sell them unto the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> chiefly for Salt, which is there very scarce.</p>
                  <p>Next unto <hi>Mingrellia</hi> is <hi>Georgia,</hi> whose Inhabitants are little better than the former, only they have a kind of Scripture; for they worship Idols or Images, yet have Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and a sort of Monks, with some Priests of the Greek Belief. I once landed in <hi>Georgia</hi> with an Army of 5000 Men, we marched up into the Countrey, until we came within a days journey of <hi>Deimur Capou,</hi> or the Iron Gate, which is a narrow passage between <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Anatolia,</hi> with Rocks on each side, and a strong Town built in the midst: We stayed ten days ravaging the Countrey; they told us, this Town and Castle belonged to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and there is no other passage out of <hi>Georgia</hi> into <hi>Persia</hi> but through it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next Countrey unto</hi> Georgia <hi>is</hi> Anatolia, <hi>where our Traveller resided several years, having been sold by the</hi> Precopensian Tartars, <hi>unto a</hi> Turkish Spahi <hi>or</hi> Timariot; <hi>of which Countrey, and the Manners of the Inhabitants, he gives a large Description: But we being sufficiently informed thereof by divers intelligent</hi> Europeans, <hi>who dwelt long in those Parts, shall with our Traveller pass on to those Countreys which are less known. But first we will take his Account of the</hi> Periplus <hi>of the</hi> Euxine <hi>or</hi> Black <hi>Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Fennara,</hi> which is at the head of the Strait or Gulf that enters the <hi>Black</hi> Sea to <hi>Precop,</hi> is 700 miles; from thence to <hi>Caffa,</hi> a noted City and Port in <hi>Crim</hi> 300 miles; to <hi>Asshowa</hi> 500 miles; to <hi>Temerossa</hi> 500 miles; to <hi>Mingrellia</hi> 400 miles; to <hi>Trebezond</hi> 400 miles; and from thence unto <hi>Constantinople</hi> 1000 miles; in all 3800
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106224:327"/>
miles. Thus much I know of the <hi>Black</hi> Sea, which I have three times coasted by Sea, and traced above half by Land; so that now it is time to speak concerning the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and shew all the Kingdoms and Countreys which lie upon it, beginning at <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> and proceeding thence Eastwards, until I return unto the same City from the South.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Astracan</hi> is placed on a rising ground, not far from the mouth of the <hi>Volga,</hi> from which it is not distant above 50 miles; it is in an Island on the <hi>Great Nagoy</hi> side, made by the River <hi>Volga,</hi> and a branch thereof, having the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea on the South. The Town or City is secured by a strong Castle, furnished with store of great Ordnance, and in the midst of the Castle is a Roskade, which commands both Castle, Town, and the Fields round about for above a mile. The <hi>Tartar</hi>'s Town is adjoyning, placed near unto <hi>Cutuma,</hi> which is a River naturally derived from the <hi>Volga,</hi> or one of its many branches; so that the Town is incompassed with Waters, having the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Volga</hi> on the West, and <hi>Cutuma</hi> on the East. Now if you would know whence the <hi>Volga</hi> comes, I will acquaint you with what I have learned from the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi> Its utmost Source is said to be at the foot of a great Tree, whence it runs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jerislave</hi> 1000 miles; whence it proceeds to <hi>Neisna</hi> 500 miles, and thence unto <hi>Cassan</hi> 300 miles; from <hi>Cassan</hi> to <hi>Samara</hi> 500; to <hi>Saratoft</hi> 350 miles; to <hi>Saraichena</hi> 350, and thence unto <hi>Astracan</hi> 500 miles; from whence it is, as we said before, unto the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea 50 miles; in all 3550 miles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Volga</hi> is a wonderful great River, abounding with divers sorts of great Fish, as <hi>Sturgeon, Bellouke, Severuke, Shelren, Sterleke, Som, Sassan, Suke, Soudake, Konnee, Sablee, Lessee, Wobla, Tarane,</hi> and many others both great and small, which I cannot readily call unto remembrance, notwithstanding that I dwelt there ten years. The <hi>Volga</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea by 22 mouths, and upon each of them is an <hi>Oughsuke</hi> or Fish-wear, for to take Sturgeon, every one of which <hi>Oughsukes</hi> is called by the name of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as <hi>Soellova, Dertullee, Bosserigee</hi> and <hi>Ruslowa</hi> upon the main <hi>Wolga. Cokelou, Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rullee, Ewansuke, Mansor, Argeessan, Keessan, Camusshuke, Naowara, Tussockly, Collobery, Malla Collobery, Yamansuke, Eirichsha, Surka, Libessha, Bussan, Carabussan, Bealla Wollos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kee.</hi> In all which <hi>Oughsukes</hi> or Wears, they take no Fish besides Sturgeon. They are made of <hi>Shigenas,</hi> or long Poles made sharp at one end, and beaten into the ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water, and a pleiting made of Rods, somewhat resembling Osier, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Matts, which are fastned to the Poles, and hinder the Fish from passing up the River. And Houses are built near the Wears for the Convenience of the Fishers, 40, 50, more or less, according unto the greatness of the Water, or resort of Fish, and twice every day, usually in the morning and evening, they set about their Fishery. They imploy only long slender Poles, with an iron Hook or Cruke in the end baited, and do ordinarily take 400 every day in the smaller, and 600 in the larger Streams. The Sturgeon they take is all salted, excepting that wherewith they serve the Town of <hi>Astracan,</hi> where a whole fair Sturgeon may be bought for ten pence English; and when the great Caravan comes from <hi>Russia,</hi> it takes off most of their Fish, which is conveyed into divers parts of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> but chiefly unto the great City of <hi>Mosco.</hi> They return also with great quantities of Caviar and Salt, there being not far from the <hi>Volga,</hi> on the <hi>Little Nagoy</hi> side, great Salt-pits, which yield an immense quantity of Salt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared yearly by the heat of the Sun, without any further trouble, than taking it off the superficies of the Water where it daily kerns.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Volga,</hi> a little above <hi>Seraichena,</hi> 500 miles from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> dismisses a great Branch named <hi>Actabon,</hi> which passing through the Desarts of the <hi>Great Nagoy</hi> through <hi>Bussane,</hi> enters the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. The remainder of the <hi>Volga,</hi> after having parted with several smaller Branches, most of which joyn with the forementioned River, divides the <hi>Little</hi> and <hi>Great Nagoy,</hi> passes under the Town of <hi>Astrachan,</hi> whence it proceeds unto <hi>Ruslowa,</hi> on the South-west side of <hi>Crosna Boggar,</hi> then falls into the <hi>Caspian.</hi> And the distance between the East-side of the <hi>Volga</hi> near <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and the River <hi>Acta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> is about 20 miles, which is mostly Water and Islands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:106224:328"/>
And that the Course of the <hi>Volga</hi> from its first Source, until it doth dis-embogue it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, can be no less than what we have asserted, is hence confirmed, That the Snow which falls abundantly in <hi>Russia,</hi> and begins to be dissolved about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and do mightily increase the Waters of the <hi>Volga,</hi> come not unto <hi>Astrachan</hi> until <hi>Midsummer,</hi> when it so raises the <hi>Volga,</hi> that overflowing the Banks, it covers with his Waters all the Islands near <hi>Astrachan;</hi> so that from the <hi>Little Nagoy,</hi> unto <hi>Actabon</hi> in the <hi>Great Nagoy,</hi> all the Countrey seems, excepting a Hillock or two, one continued Lake, or a great Gulf of the Sea. Wherefore they who go in the <hi>Spring</hi> from <hi>Astrachan</hi> to fetch Wood, having cut it, make great Floats, which are lifted up when the River overflows, and guided each by a few Men, until they are brought unto <hi>Astrachan,</hi> or those other places for which they are designed.</p>
                  <p>The most remarkable Towns and Habitations upon the <hi>Volga,</hi> between <hi>Seraichena</hi> and <hi>Astrachan,</hi> (which are 500 miles distant from each other) are <hi>Camena, Rokegowa, Osshenofka, Chornoyar, Borisse, Offatalka, Poollowoy, Collmakof Satone, Cossoyar, Crosnoyar, Nassonoyar, Satone, Yanatavy, Daneelofka, Perre Ousshake, Eillansuke, Eiskyborro, Crukla, Bussan, Balsheeke, Tollotonygorod, Dolgoa, Goradocha</hi> (which was old <hi>Astrachan) Sharina, Bogor,</hi> which is near <hi>Astrachan,</hi> besides many other Places, with whose Names I have not charged my memory. We will now pass over the <hi>Volga</hi> through <hi>Astrachan</hi> into the <hi>Great Nagoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great Nagoy</hi> may be properly enough divided into Islands and Continent; the former are made by the <hi>Volga,</hi> and several Rivers which fall out of it, variously mix'd with each other, and are all at length emptied into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. Those Rivers or Branches have their several Names; those which I remember are <hi>Cuttoma, Boulda, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Guellusa, Creewantya, Busane, Actabon</hi> and <hi>Bereket.</hi> The Kingdom of the <hi>Great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goy</hi> is all plain and desart; 1200 miles in length between <hi>Astrachan</hi> and <hi>Samara;</hi> 500 miles in breadth from the said <hi>Astrachan</hi> unto the River of the <hi>Yeike</hi> or <hi>Jaick.</hi> There is no Wood in all this Countrey, except what grows near the Rivers. It hath no Towns or fix'd Habitations, though it had formerly divers, and some among them very considerable, as <hi>Czarofsgorod,</hi> or <hi>Czarofs Pollate,</hi> in English, the Emperor's Town, which formerly must needs have been as its Name imports, an Imperial or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City. I have often viewed it with admiration, and cannot compute it to have been less than 20 miles in Circuit; I have told fourscore great eminent Buildings, which must have been either <hi>Moschees, Pallaces,</hi> or <hi>Caravanseraies,</hi> and some of them 6 miles distant from the other. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> are of divers Opinions concerning its Destruction: Some say it was ruined by the <hi>Cossacks;</hi> but the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to brag of their Atchievements, know nothing thereof, only that they have often dispossessed the <hi>Russes,</hi> when they endeavoured to rebuild part of it. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Situation is very excellent, having the <hi>Volga</hi> on one side, the <hi>Actabon</hi> on the other: The Countrey very beautiful, healthful and fertile; and yet notwithstanding all these encouragements, it is not yet inhabited, not by the <hi>Russes,</hi> because it standing on the main Land, they would be continually exposed unto the Inroads of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars;</hi> nor by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> because its nearness unto the Rivers, would render them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the <hi>Russes,</hi> every time the great Caravan passes that way, which is at least twice each year. Yet the <hi>Muscovites</hi> do frequently fetch Brick and Stones from this ruined City, wherewith they have built a great part of <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forts or Towns, where such solid Materials are imployed. But besides this <hi>Serai,</hi> (for so the <hi>Tartars</hi> call any fix'd Habitation) there were in ancient times five or six more down along the Rivers side, in each of which formerly dwelt a <hi>Chan;</hi> but Time and Wars have almost entirely ruined them. There is also another <hi>Serai</hi> upon the River <hi>Jaick</hi> named <hi>Seraichika,</hi> where is said formerly to have been the Residence of a great <hi>Myrsa</hi> or <hi>Chan;</hi> but 'tis now quite ruinated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> who inhabit the <hi>Great Nagoy,</hi> both Men and Women, are very proper, at least of much taller Stature than many other <hi>Tartars,</hi> but have ill-favoured Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, broad Faces, flat little Noses, small Eyes sunk in their Heads; all which are common to most of the Eastern <hi>Tartars.</hi> But the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Crim</hi> are more comely, which, I suppose, may partly proceed from their Wives, who are many of them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106224:328"/>
                     <hi>Circassians, Russes, Poles, Hungars,</hi> and of divers other Nations. The <hi>Nagoy Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> are also Black or rather Tawny; which I Conjecture is not so much natural, as proceeding from the heat of the Sun, which is in these Parts some Months of the Year much more Excessive than one would expect from the Climate. And besides, their Children go stark naked during the great heats in Summer. It is also remarkable, That the Cold in Winter in the same Country is exceeding severe, and one would think to them who have such mean accommodation, intollerable. These <hi>Nagoy Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> have great store of Cattle, as Kine, Sheep, Horses and Camels, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they are very ill clad, most of their Clothing being Sheep-Skins, and those but scurvily dressed. They have no sort of Corn or Grain, mightily scorning the <hi>Europeans</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> whose chief Diet, they say, is the top of a pitiful weed. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy is not only allowed, but altogether in fashion among them, most having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Wives, more or fewer according unto their Quality and Ability; who unless they are Captivated by War, are such as they buy of their Parents or Kindred for Cattle. If one Brother dye, the other takes all his Wives, who are usually 5. or 6. But if all the Brothers die, either in War or by Diseases, then they are devolved like other Goods and Chattels unto the Elder Brother's Son, they never suffering any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Woman, during life, to go out of the Kindred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here our Author hath inserted a Discourse concerning divers odd, and some barbarous Customes which have long prevailed among the</hi> Nagoy Tartars, <hi>and wherewith they will not easily Dispence. But they giving little light unto History or Geography, I have not thought them worthy the trouble of transcribing; ner do I apprehend they would afford any considerable instruction or divertisement unto the Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Tartars</hi> of the Great <hi>Nagoy</hi> when they remove their habitation, transport their Houses from place to place in Waggons with 4 Wheels, which are drawn usually by Camels; thoy pass up and down the Country in great Hordes, their ordinary march is from the <hi>Volga</hi> unto <hi>Buskowshake;</hi> thence to <hi>Voroslane, Samara, Eirgeesse, Eishene, Ougogura, Reimpeska,</hi> and all along under the <hi>Calmukes</hi> Country, untill they arrive at the <hi>Jaick</hi> or <hi>Yeike:</hi> Sometimes they pass by <hi>Cassoone, Aurrow, Camoyes Samar,</hi> and so to <hi>Saraichika:</hi> This is ordinarily their Summer Progress. Against Winter they return unto those parts of the Country which border upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. As <hi>Baksake</hi> upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; <hi>Beallnssa, Kitgach, Sheennamara, Coudake, Caradowan, Actabon;</hi> and higher upon the <hi>Volga,</hi> scattering themselves upon the Sea-shore and Banks of the Rivers among the Reeds and VVoods, or wheresoever they find the Climate most mild and best Defence against the Cold, which in the VVinter is in those Parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely severe; so that 'tis hard to determine whether they suffer more from the Heat in Summer, or Cold in Winter. During which latter Season they leave their Hergels or Horses, and most of their greater Cattle to shift for themselves in the Deserts.</p>
                  <p>Having had often occasion to mention the River <hi>Jaicke</hi> or <hi>Yeike,</hi> I shall here give a short account of what I have observed and learnt concerning its Rise and Course. It comes from the <hi>Calmukes</hi> Land, where it is thought to spring; though some of the <hi>Russes</hi> affirm it, Fountains are more Remote in <hi>Siberia,</hi> the Southern parts of which is also inhabited if not possessed by the <hi>Kalmukes,</hi> some of whose <hi>Ulusses</hi> or Hords are subject unto the <hi>Muscovites;</hi> others in League with them: but they have sometimes cruel Wars, and did formerly destroy <hi>Tumen</hi> with some other Towns and Castles of the <hi>Russes,</hi> who they apprehended did incroach too fast upon them. But to return unto the Course of the <hi>Yeik,</hi> after it hath passed through the <hi>Calmukes</hi> Country, it divides the Great <hi>Nagoy</hi> from <hi>Cassachy Horda,</hi> and after it hath passed in all a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles, throwes it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea a little below <hi>Seraichika.</hi> This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large River, and the Land on each side well cloathed with Wood, Grass, divers sorts of Herbs and wild Fruits, and the VVater full of good Fish; which Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do oft-times invite the <hi>Cossacks</hi> to make their abode there, and from thence they make Incursions on divers parts bordering on the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. This River, among
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106224:329"/>
divers other Fish, doth so wonderfully abound with Sturgeon, that a man may stand upon the Pank side with a Pole in hand arm'd at the end with an Iron Crook, make choice of what Sturgeon best pleaseth him, which he shall rarely fail of taking though never so inexpert in Fishing, if he have but strength or help to draw it on Land. Not far from the Mouth of the <hi>Jaick</hi> in the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea near the Shore, are many Coves and Corners which they call <hi>Lapateens</hi> and <hi>Cultukes,</hi> which are alwayes full of Swans usually swimming on the Sea, which are so numerous, that it is impossible to make any reasonable Computation thereof. These Swans after Midsummer every Year cast their Feathers, a little before which time there parts from <hi>Astracan</hi> many Boats which are manned by <hi>Russes,</hi> and most of them are their Youth; after a passage of 500 miles they arrive at these places which the Swans mostly haunt, and having filled their Boats with Swans Skins and Feathers, they return unto <hi>Astracan,</hi> where a great Trade is driven with the <hi>Persians</hi> who give ordinarily a Dollar apiece for these Skins.</p>
                  <p>The next Country unto the Great <hi>Nagoy</hi> towards the East is <hi>Cassachy Horda,</hi> which hath, as I said, on the West the <hi>Jaick,</hi> by which it is divided from the Great <hi>Nagoy.</hi> On the North the <hi>Kalmukes,</hi> North East the <hi>Yurgeach,</hi> or <hi>Jurgench. Tartars,</hi> and to the South the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea and <hi>Caragans,</hi> who inhabit on the North East side of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. These <hi>Cassachy Tartars</hi> march up and down the Country much after the manner of the <hi>Nagoys.</hi> They have frequent Wars with the <hi>Kalmukes</hi> and <hi>Yurgea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians;</hi> but seldome with either <hi>Nagoys</hi> or <hi>Caragans.</hi> Only after the manner of most other <hi>Tartars</hi> they will clandestinely steal even from those Neighbours with whom they have the most uninterrupted and profound Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cassachy Horda</hi> is altogether Desart, excepting some Woods Northward, bordering upon the <hi>Kalmucks,</hi> where there are divers small Rivers which empty themselves into the <hi>Jaick;</hi> which River is also in most places bordered with Woods unto its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. And therefore the Inhabitants may well be named <hi>Cassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy Horda,</hi> or Wild people, as the name imports: They sowe no sort of Corn, their chief Food being Horse-flesh and Mares milk; which is also common to divers other Nations of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the North of <hi>Cassachy Horda</hi> dwell the <hi>Kalmuke Tartars,</hi> if such a life as they lead may be called dwelling. The Country they inhabit deserves a better People, the Land abounding with all things necessary for a Comfortable subsistence. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath store of Sables, Marterns, Black Foxes, Squerrils, and several other sorts of Furs, which they Exchange with the <hi>Russes</hi> for <hi>Aqua-vitae, Mead,</hi> Tobacco, and other Commodities. This Country hath some Towns, as <hi>Siberia,</hi> the Head of a Province of the same name, and <hi>Tumen,</hi> both which the <hi>Russes</hi> have gained from them: <hi>Ouffha, Wadle, Sellona, Lucomoria,</hi> which latter place, they say, is situated upon a Cold Sea. But <hi>Ouffha</hi> is a midland Town, 500 miles from <hi>Cassan</hi> which is near the <hi>Volga.</hi> The <hi>Kalmukes</hi> are accounted good Souldiers, being kept in continual Exercise by the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> on the one side, the <hi>Nagoyans</hi> and <hi>Cassachy-Horda</hi> on the other. Their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married Women do not only accompany the Men unto the Wars, but are said to be little inferiour unto the Men in Skill and Valour, shooting almost as strongly and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously as the men, from whom they cannot be distinguished by their Garb, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled and riding much after the same manner: Both Men and Women in all their Expeditions seldom carry along with them fewer than 5 or 6 Horses apiece. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not precisely determine what their Religion is, but I do perceive by Converse with them, that they have a more favourable opinion of the Christians than of the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, or of some of their fellow <hi>Ethnicks;</hi> for if I mistake not, they are Heathens, I not being able to discern among them any Religious Worship, excepting some kind of Adoration which they pay unto the Sun and Moon. They have a very peculiar kind of Diet; for besides Horse-flesh, which is a great Dainty, they scruple not to eat Snakes, Adders, Foxes, and indeed even Carrion of divers sorts of Creatures, such Food as to <hi>Europeans</hi> would be intollerable, even in the greatest Famine. They wear a kind of Caps or Hatts which are called by the <hi>Muscovites, Coulpackes,</hi> open before and behind, with broad Brims on each side. And thereupon they are called by the other <hi>Tartars, Calmukes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106224:329"/>
Eastward from these <hi>Calmukes,</hi> inclining unto the South towards <hi>China,</hi> live the <hi>Yurgeachians,</hi> so named from their chief Town, which some call <hi>Yurgeach,</hi> others <hi>Jur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gench:</hi> Of which Countrey I cannot say so much as concerning the former, having never been therein but once; for in the Year 1620. there being great Wars in <hi>Jurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,</hi> between the <hi>Chan</hi> or King, and the <hi>Myrsa</hi> his Son; some of the <hi>Nagoy Tartars</hi> hearing thereof, invaded the Countrey, who whilst they were united, durst not peep out of their own Borders, the <hi>Jurgeachians</hi> being a numerous and warlike People. These <hi>Nagoys</hi> were all Volunteers, who went without any Command from their own Prince, or Allowance from the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> without whose consent by mutual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are not permitted to war. The news of their Expedition being brought unto <hi>Astracan,</hi> the <hi>Voyvod,</hi> who had not long before made a League with the <hi>Jurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achians,</hi> sent out <hi>Allye</hi> (I suppose his true Name was <hi>Ali</hi> or <hi>Hali) Myrsa</hi> a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, with a 1000 of his own Subjects, and 500 <hi>Russes,</hi> all Horse. We were 20 days marching, before we came unto the Borders of <hi>Jurgeach</hi> from <hi>Astracan;</hi> whence we proceeded 10 days journey, the Countrey through which we passed being misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ravaged by the aforesaid <hi>Nagoys.</hi> At the end of which 30 days by a reasonable Computation, 'twas judged we were distant from <hi>Astracan</hi> at least a 1000 miles; about which time we overtook them in the Valley of <hi>Ougogura,</hi> having got from the <hi>Jurgeachians</hi> an innumerable company of Cattle of divers sorts, as Horse, Kine, Camels and Sheep. We took all their Booty from them; and as a further punishment for their Riot, took away their own supernumerary Horses, leaving them only a Horse a Man for to convey them home. Then <hi>Ally Myrsa</hi> divided the Spoil, half he bestowed upon those who did accompany him, and sent the remainder for a Present unto the <hi>Voyvod,</hi> returning nothing unto the <hi>Jurgeachians</hi> because they were taken from Thieves. In the mean while the Prince of <hi>Jurgeach</hi> in a pitcht Battel overthrew his Father, took him Prisoner, put out both his Eyes, and caused himself to be Crowned King. He had a younger Brother, whom fearing that in time he might occasion some insurrection, he gave Command unto some of his Creatures, that they should strangle him, and bring his Head: But divers of the Nobles, by whose means he obtained the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gaining intelligence thereof, would not permit his Order to be put in execution; but seizing on the Child, sent him unto the Emperour of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> with whom he re-mained when I was last at <hi>Astracan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I must return from the <hi>Jurgeachians</hi> unto the <hi>Caragans,</hi> whom I have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and they do more immediately refer unto my promise, which was to give an Account of all the Nations and Countreys incompassing the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Countrey of the <hi>Caragans</hi> occupies most of that vast space, which intercedes between the River <hi>Yeike</hi> and the Dominions of the <hi>Ousbegs,</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Bouchara,</hi> and their Territory surrounds the North-East corner of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, proceeding Southwards unto the River <hi>Jaxartes;</hi> and some Hords of the said People do inhabit between the said River and the <hi>Oxus,</hi> which divides the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Bochara</hi> and the <hi>Caragans,</hi> from the <hi>Persians</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Balk.</hi> This Countrey of the <hi>Caragans</hi> is very desart and barren; the People miserably poor; their Houses are wretched Huts, the greatest part under ground; they are very tawny and ill-favour'd; their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are scatt'red, scarcely deserving the Name of Villages: And they have no Town, as I have been informed, besides <hi>Preesslannes,</hi> which is situated on the South-side of the <hi>Jaxartes,</hi> near the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; which whilst I dwelt in <hi>Astracan,</hi> was by surprize ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Cossacks;</hi> but they had little cause to brag of their Victory, finding little booty therein; and the <hi>Caragans</hi> gath'ring together, beat them out with great loss of Men, forcing them to retire into an Island 2 or 3 leagues from the Land which they possess unto this day, no Nation being able, or else not caring to un-nest them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Tartars, Persians</hi> and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> do continually suffer by their Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Towards the East and by South of the <hi>Caragans,</hi> dwell the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Bochara,</hi> who are by divers called <hi>Yusbegs.</hi> The Countrey which they possess is better watred, and more fertile than most of the preceeding, and there is great resort of Merchants from divers Parts unto them, especially <hi>Persians, Muscovites,</hi> and several Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> as <hi>Moguls, Boutans,</hi> with many others, whose Names I cannot recollect. I have been
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106224:330"/>
also told, That the <hi>Chineses</hi> do sometimes trade with them. I am perswaded, that this is the famed Kingdom of <hi>Cataye;</hi> for the <hi>Catayans</hi> are a sort of <hi>Tartars,</hi> and I know no other <hi>Tartars</hi> between this Countrey and <hi>China. Caragan</hi> lieth from them to the North-West; <hi>Urgenshe</hi> due North; <hi>China</hi> to the East; the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Balk</hi> to the South; and the <hi>Persians</hi> South and by West; and the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea duely West. They are almost continually in Wars with the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Countrey I am to describe is <hi>Persia,</hi> in which Land I was never, excepting once, in that part thereof which borders upon the <hi>Comukes;</hi> but I have conversed with several <hi>Persian</hi> Merchants at <hi>Astracan,</hi> who came by Shipping from <hi>Gilan,</hi> which when the Wind is very fair and good, they sail in 2 or 3 days and nights. They wear Turbants like the <hi>Turks,</hi> and so do the <hi>Bouchars.</hi> Therefore not having seen much of <hi>Persia,</hi> nor having sufficiently informed my self concerning it, I shall pass through it unto the <hi>Comukes</hi> Land, of which I have obtained more perfect knowledge both by War and Traffick. This Countrey is bounded on the South by <hi>Persia;</hi> on the East by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; Westward by <hi>Circassia;</hi> and on the North by the River of <hi>Tumeine;</hi> on which stands a Town of the same Name, from which unto <hi>Chahamate,</hi> the most Northerly Habitation of <hi>Persia,</hi> is 600 miles. A great part of this Countrey, especially Westward, is very mountainous; I could never learn where it doth exactly terminate. I have been in four of their Towns: The first is <hi>Tarkee,</hi> where <hi>Gildar,</hi> whom they own for their Prince, doth ordinarily reside. The second is <hi>Derbeine,</hi> in the Mountains. The third <hi>Derevena,</hi> in the same mountainous Tract. The fourth <hi>Kossa,</hi> upon a River of the same Name, not far from the place where it empties it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. These <hi>Comukes</hi> are proper Men and very couragious; and that which makes them more daring and adventurous than most <hi>Tartars,</hi> is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Horses, and the advantage of their Arms, both offensive and defensive; for they seldom engage in Wars without Helmets, Jacks of Steel, Shirts of Mail, and Targets, which excepting those times wherein they fight, hang behind their backs, being very light, and not very large, and therefore not cumbersome. They have, as other <hi>Tartars,</hi> both Bows and Cymetars, and withal never go without Lances, which they use with great strength and dexterity. In their Apparel they differ little from the <hi>Circassians;</hi> but as for Religion, they are generally <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and their Language is in substance the same with other <hi>Tartars,</hi> their vicinity unto the <hi>Persians, Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Sheercasses,</hi> having somewhat disguised it. The Countrey they inhabit abounds with Wood; part of it is hilly, with small pleasant Valleys between the Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks; and in some places, especially towards <hi>Persia,</hi> and thence into the Land, it hath many great and almost inaccessible Mountains, by reason of their heighth and steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This Land was reduced under the Government of the <hi>Russes</hi> many years ago, after the ensuing manner: <hi>Evan Vassillywich</hi> being <hi>Czar</hi> or Emperour of <hi>Russia,</hi> after he had taken <hi>Cassan</hi> and <hi>Astracan,</hi> sent part of his Army into <hi>Circassia,</hi> where they took in <hi>Tumeine.</hi> Another Body entred the <hi>Comukes</hi> Countrey, and possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of <hi>Derevena, Derbeine, Tarkee</hi> and <hi>Kossa.</hi> The <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour constituted a <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vod,</hi> whom he ordred to reside in <hi>Tarkee,</hi> and left with him 10000 Men; he ordered also at the same time another considerable Brigade to stay at <hi>Coisa,</hi> where he left a great number of Boats and other Vessels, who had brought supplies of Men and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions from <hi>Mosco,</hi> and other Parts of his Dominions. And having, as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, secured his new Conquests, he returned unto <hi>Mosco:</hi> Immediately after his retreat, the <hi>Comukes</hi> gath'red their whole Force, and set down before the Town of <hi>Tarkee,</hi> which after a vigorous resistance they took, and in it with the <hi>Voyvod,</hi> several Officers of divers Nations, whom with the common Souldiers they sold unto the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassians, Tartars,</hi> and other neighb'ring Nations, so that few were ever afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. From <hi>Tarkee</hi> they marched unto <hi>Koisa,</hi> which by the instruction of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they did pretty regularly besiege and assault, and after some repulses took it by storm, killing all the <hi>Russes,</hi> excepting such as escaped in the Ships and Boats which lay before the Town. The <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour being speedily informed of these Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, immediately raised a great Army, with which he ordred all the <hi>Cossacks</hi> between the <hi>Don</hi> and <hi>Volga,</hi> unto the River of <hi>Tumeine,</hi> to joyn his Forces, and assist them, in order unto the recovery of what he had lost, and utter extirpation of the <hi>Comukes:</hi> Who hearing how highly the <hi>Czar</hi> was exasperated, and how great a Force was ready to invade them, they began to be solicitous about the Event; and having consulted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106224:330"/>
together, agreed to make some kind of submission, and sue for pardon and peace. Whereupon they sent Ambassadors unto <hi>Tumeine,</hi> where the <hi>Russe</hi> Army was encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and after a Treaty with the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Plenipotentiaries, they agreed upon these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, That the <hi>Comukes</hi> should restore the Towns they had taken, and aid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with such a number of Souldiers, as he should require, against any Enemy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; whereunto their Heads being sworn, they have inviolably observed the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto this day. But it's time we take our leave of <hi>Gildar,</hi> Prince of <hi>Terki,</hi> and his <hi>Comukes,</hi> and proceed into <hi>Shercassen</hi> Land, part of which, as I hinted before, lyes upon the Black Sea, and extends it self unto the <hi>Caspian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This side of <hi>Circassia</hi> which borders upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, is a very plentiful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and as for Fish, it is so wonderfully plentiful, that in <hi>Tumeine</hi> you may ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily purchase a good Sturgeon for two pence, and sometimes for a penny; a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious quantity of Fish being taken in the River of the <hi>Weestra;</hi> and about the Island of <hi>Chekeine,</hi> which is off at Sea not far from <hi>Tumeine.</hi> On the main Land, over against this Fishery, 4 miles above the River of <hi>Terike,</hi> there is a great Well, made by a Spring, which falls from a Rock, on the side of a great Hill, and immediately fills this little Lake, which whether it is Natural or Artificial, I know not. The Water of this Lake is so scalding hot, that the Fishers flinging in their Sturgeon or other Fish, it is in a short time boyled, as if over a fire, the heat being so intense, that no Man can detain his Hand in it for a moment; from which strange Quality it derives its Name, being called by the <hi>Russes, Goracha Colloda,</hi> or the Scalding Well.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude my Discourse with a short Account of the Little <hi>Nagoy,</hi> or of that part thereof which confines upon the <hi>Caspian;</hi> for all that space between <hi>Tumeine</hi> and <hi>Astracan,</hi> is by many ascribed unto the <hi>Nagoy Tartars.</hi> I did before declare, That the Little <hi>Nagoy</hi> is for the most part a wide waste Desart, the worst of which is all that Tract which lyeth between <hi>Tumeine</hi> and <hi>Astracan.</hi> These <hi>Tartars</hi> have no Town but only <hi>Asshowa,</hi> which is not properly theirs, though lying in their Countrey, being possessed by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a sort of People in this Countrey, whom the <hi>Tartars</hi> call <hi>Sigakes;</hi> I could never learn what their Language is, or from what Place or Nation they proceed; nor could I understand after what manner they live, whether they have any Religion, or Civil Government. Their chief Subsistence is what they gain from the <hi>Tartars;</hi> for they gather sometimes 2 or 3000, and rob the smaller Hords of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and those which are most remote from help. But sometimes the <hi>Tartars</hi> discovering the place of their Retreat or Rendevous, surround them with their Carts, and then fall in, cut them all off, never giving Quarter unto any; no Crime being so severely punished amongst the <hi>Tartars</hi> as Thievery; which makes me apprehend, that these <hi>Sigakes</hi> are some of their own People, who formerly deserted them upon some extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: But whatsoever is the reason, they do most irreconcileably hate each the other.</p>
                  <p>The most noted Places on that side the Little <hi>Nagoy,</hi> which regards the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and lye all along the Coast from <hi>Tumeine</hi> to <hi>Astracan,</hi> are <hi>Sheerlona Yeare</hi> (where I was first taken Prisoner by the <hi>Tartars) Peremetka, Arsi Bash, Moyackee, Bealla Oshera Bashmachake, Kaboylly Machakofska, Chostoway,</hi> and so over the <hi>Volga</hi> unto <hi>Astracan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to conclude all, I shall here enumerate all the Places on the Coast near <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> which have Names that are considerable for Havens, Trade, Fishing, or any other remarkable Circumstance. <hi>Soteeza Bockgra, Ueuslowa Cossa, Beerulska Cossa, Ewan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoska Cossa, Seamme Bogoroffe, Tussocleoff Lapateene, Chaska Cossa, Crosna Bogore, Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louska Cossa, Owarska Cossa, Comashaska Cossa, Colloberinska Cossa, Cocktabow, Bussans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka Lapaten, Kara Bussan;</hi> which last place is not far from <hi>Sheene Mare,</hi> which I have formerly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>I cannot so exactly tell the Circumference of the <hi>Caspian,</hi> as of the Black Sea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been only on the North and West side; but howsoever I shall from what I have seen and learnt from Experienced persons, be enabled to approach very near unto the Truth.</p>
                  <p>The Distance between <hi>Astracan</hi> and the <hi>Jaick,</hi> is 500 miles; from thence unto the Confines of <hi>Bochara</hi> 500 miles: From <hi>Jaxartes</hi> to <hi>Persia,</hi> and thence unto <hi>Gilan</hi> is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto my Information, 1100 miles. From <hi>Gilan</hi> unto <hi>Koisa</hi> 500 miles: From
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106224:331"/>
thence unto <hi>Astracan</hi> as much; in all, 3100 miles. But if any person should endeavour by Land to Travel round this Sea, or in a Voyage by Sea follow the Coast, he would make at least a Thousand miles more: for this Sea is full of great Gulphs, Bays, and broken ground; so that the Calculation I make, is upon a direct passage by Sea, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from <hi>Astracan</hi> to <hi>Gilan,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Oxus,</hi> from the <hi>Oxus</hi> to the great North-East Bay, into which the River <hi>Jem</hi> falls, which is full of Islands and broken Grounds, Shelves, Sand and Shallow Water; and from thence back to <hi>Astracan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having presented your Lordship with a short but true Account of those Countries encompassing and lying between the two forementioned <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, I shall no less briefly and faithfully declare by what Accidents I came unto this Knowledge: which cost me so dear, that I suppose the most inquisitive person would not purchase the gratification of his Curiosity at a far less Expence of time and trouble, than I have imployed (though often against my will) in my Travels and Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>I was born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet of <hi>English</hi> Extract: My Family Noble, but my Estate not corresponding with my Quality, being ambitious, and withal naturally inclined to fee Forraign Countries, I hoped to Raise my Fortune by my Sword. After I left <hi>Ireland,</hi> before I had been long in <hi>England,</hi> an opportunity presenting it self, I engaged in the Service of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who had then Wars with the <hi>Muscovite;</hi> having given some Considerable proofs of my Courage, I was gradually raised unto a Considerable Command; but being engaged too far in a Body of the Enemies, I was unhappily taken Prisoner by the <hi>Russes,</hi> and carried Prisoner unto <hi>Plescow,</hi> then in their possession, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the same time Arrears due unto me from the <hi>Swede</hi> above 5000 Dollars. The <hi>Swedes</hi> taking no care for my Enlargement, being willing, I suppose, to save so great a Summe of Money, as at my Return I should have challenged: after Three years close Imprisonment, I was proffered Liberty by the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> upon condition I would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully serve him against all his Enemies; whereunto assenting, I was sent unto <hi>Moscow,</hi> and there before the Chancellor sworn a <hi>Tolmack,</hi> and preferred unto a Command lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferiour unto what I enjoyed before. And the <hi>Poles</hi> advancing towards <hi>Moscow</hi> with a great Army, fearing lest I should go over unto them, I was sent unto <hi>Astracan,</hi> where I remained 10 years, being continually Employed against the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Circas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi> By which means I came to know <hi>Pettigor, Sneesnagor, Shadgore, Cabardye,</hi> and the Great and Little <hi>Nagoy,</hi> the <hi>Comukes,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Cassan,</hi> the <hi>Kalmukes, Cassachy Horda, Caragans, Ungensh</hi> and <hi>Usbeg, Tartars.</hi> During which Wars, I conflicted with great difficulties and hardship; In making long Journies, faring hardly: Nor was it a small labour to make floates in order unto our passing over the great Rivers I have mentioned, to say nothing of the Danger. Besides, we run great hazards in our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying over those waste wide howling Desarts, which on every side surrounded us; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wanting provisions, and sometimes Guides; so that had we failed never so little in our Conjectures, we had all perished. After Ten years hard Service, in my Return frrom Convoying <hi>Shollohofe Knez</hi> into <hi>Shercassen</hi> Land, I was taken Prisoner by the <hi>Tartars</hi> of the Little <hi>Nagoy,</hi> and by them carried unto <hi>Assowa</hi> upon the Mouth of the <hi>Tana</hi> or <hi>Don.</hi> There I was sould unto a <hi>Precopensian Tartar,</hi> who carried me along with him towards <hi>Crim:</hi> But upon the shallow Waters I very happily made my Escape. I had little Knowledge of the Country, but having formerly understood by our <hi>Cossacks</hi> at <hi>Astracan,</hi> that great Bodies of the same name, mortal Enemies unto the <hi>Tartars,</hi> dwelt upon the <hi>Nepper</hi> not far beyond <hi>Crim;</hi> by the help of the Sun and Stars, I journeyed due West many days without any disastrous Adventure, until I found them; who gave me a very kind reception: In this escape I traversed almost the whole Desart of <hi>Ingile</hi> and <hi>Ungule. Dorosensko</hi> who then Commanded all the <hi>Cossacks</hi> upon the <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> immediately made me a <hi>Poskofneke,</hi> from which time for the space of almost two years, I did accompany them in divers Expeditions, in which we visited most of those Countries which lye upon the Black Sea, to the no small vexation and loss of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. We kept a Correspondence with the <hi>Cossacks</hi> upon the <hi>Don,</hi> and frequently assisted each other. And being all Foot, and the Country exactly level, we travelled surrounded with Wagons (which they call a Tabor) for fear of the <hi>Tartars</hi> who often set upon us, but were as often repulsed, we being well accommodated with Fire-Arms and small Field-pieces, which the <hi>Tartars</hi> do exceedingly fear, and will not ordinarily attempt closely, unless they have greatly the Odds in Number. But at length
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106224:331"/>
it was my ill Fortune between the <hi>Nepper</hi> and the <hi>Don</hi> to be again taken by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and by them carried into <hi>Crim,</hi> where I lived long in great misery, and was at length sould unto a <hi>Timariot Spahi</hi> living in <hi>Anadoule, (Anatolia,</hi> or <hi>Asia minor)</hi> with whom I lived 5 years, but in more easie servitude than among the <hi>Tartars.</hi> And to make my service less irksome, my Master bestowed on me a <hi>Wallachian</hi> Woman, whom I received for my Wife, though without the usual Solemnities of Marriage, which are practised among Christians: Understanding at length that a Lord Ambassador was resident at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in behalf of the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and to manage the Affairs of the <hi>English</hi> Nation in <hi>Turkey,</hi> I prevailed with my Master, whose Favour I had gained to grant me my freedom, together with my Wives, if I should procure an hundred Dollars. Whereupon he dismissed me in the company of a <hi>Turk</hi> his Friend, who upon my humble supplication unto your Lordship receiving the forementioned Sum, did in the behalf of his Friend before the <hi>Cady</hi> make me free, and leave the Woman also at my Disposal. At the same time I very happily met with some <hi>Vallachian</hi> Gentlemen, who were sent on a Message from their <hi>Vayvod</hi> unto the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> They gladly received my Woman, and took her along with them, promising upon their Return into their own Country, to Restore her unto her Parents.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may fully satisfie your Lordship, that I had really visited all those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which I have mentioned I beseech your Lordship let your Interpreter try me in those Languages wherein he is skilled; and as for others wherewith he is not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am ready to converse with any of those Nations whom I pretend to know. For although I have never conversed much with Books, yet my great Travels accompanied with a pretty good Memory, will sufficiently Qualifie me to pass through the Countries I shall hereafter mention.</p>
                  <p>To begin my Progress from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I can pass over from <hi>Scutery,</hi> and thence by the help of my <hi>Turkish</hi> Language pass through all <hi>Anatolia;</hi> Thence leaving <hi>Armenia</hi> on my right hand, and having the <hi>Black Sea</hi> on the left, go through <hi>Georgia, Mingrellia, Abassa,</hi> and <hi>Shercassen</hi> Land with the same Tongue, and another, which with little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation is common unto them all. Thence into the <hi>Comukes</hi> Country, who are a sort of <hi>Tartars,</hi> and do agree with others of the same name in speech, as indeed most <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> do; only they who are <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and converse much with the <hi>Turks,</hi> use divers <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> words whereunto the Heathen <hi>Tartars</hi> are strangers: From <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mukes</hi> Land I can pass into <hi>Persia,</hi> but I am not so well acquainted with their Country and Language, as I have elsewhere acknowledged. Therefore to return unto <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> I can proceed from thence unto <hi>Romella,</hi> or <hi>Romania,</hi> through <hi>Wallachy, Bealla Horda, Crim,</hi> the Great <hi>Desart</hi> I have so often mentioned of <hi>Ingell</hi> and <hi>Ungull,</hi> the Little <hi>Nagoy,</hi> so over the <hi>Volga</hi> unto <hi>Astracan;</hi> thence through the Great <hi>Nagoy,</hi> and leaving the <hi>Caspian</hi> on my Right hand into the <hi>Caragans</hi> Country, and so through <hi>Boghar</hi> into <hi>Persia.</hi> I can also by my knowledg of the Languages peculiar unto the following Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries traverse all <hi>Ireland, England, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Leifland, Poland, Russia, Mordwa, Sheremessa, Cassan, Kalmukes</hi> Land, <hi>Cassachy Horda, Yurgench,</hi> and leaving <hi>China</hi> on the left hand through <hi>Bochara</hi> into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, Sir, nothing remains, But that I make most humble and hearty acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of your great Generosity and Christian Charity, in delivering a Stranger out of a Captivity, wherein I had Otherwise continued without hope of seeing my Friends or Country. And were I as expert at my Pen, as I have heretofore been at managing a Sword, I would by Consigning my Travels to Writing, leave behind me a lasting Monument of your Fame: But being for want of Learning and by long Disuse of my Mother Tongue rendred unfit for such a Work, I shall wheresoever I come proclaim your Worthiness, and continually pray unto the Omnipotent GOD to return your Kindness into your Bosome a Thousand fold. And shall ever remain, during Life,</p>
