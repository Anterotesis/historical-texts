            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Supplementum Sublatum,
John Tombes his Supplement, or second Book
about Swearing disproved.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOhn Tombes,</hi> thy first <hi>part of speech</hi> in proof of the <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Swearing,</hi> being (it seems) such an Adjective as
could not well stand by it self against such as have answered
it, without the supply of some other words to be joyned
with it, thou hast added another part of speech, (for even
this also is but <hi>a part</hi> of what thou sayst thou yet intendest to make
upon that subject) as <hi>a little Supplement</hi> (so thou cal'st it) to supply
the defects of the former, which thou confessest did want <hi>framing,
method,</hi> and <hi>matter.</hi> But when thou again reviewest this thy last
<hi>Supplement,</hi> it will need little more condemnation than the words
of thy own mouth. Therefore we shall say a little to thee, lest thou
be wise in thy own conceit, if thou be unanswered altogether; and
yet but a little, lest we should seem to be like thy self, in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words without <hi>method</hi> and <hi>matter.</hi> The substance of thy book
being answered already in a book called <hi>One Antidote more against
Swearing,</hi> we shall speak to some passages in it relating to our
selves.</p>
            <p>As first, Thou sayst page 5. that the using of these speeches,
<hi>God knows,</hi> or <hi>I affirm before God,</hi> or <hi>God is our witness,</hi> or <hi>This we
say in the presence of him that shall judge the quick and the dead;</hi> as
an appeal to God's contestation, is plain swearing; and that <hi>Sam.
Fisher</hi> swears in his book entituled <hi>The Rusticks Alarm to the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi>
p. 48. 61. in saying, <hi>God knows, I affirm here before God and
all men;</hi> and so while we speak against all swearing, we practise
some swearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> It is made plain in that book entituled <hi>One Antidote more
against swearing,</hi> that these are <hi>no oaths,</hi> and here again, that
if they were oaths, it being very frequent with <hi>Paul</hi> (as <hi>Hen. Den</hi>
saith) to use them, then that Apostle (whom ye justifie therein) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
to it, by or before a Magistrate, (which is the only swearing
now disputed for) did swear as <hi>frequently, commonly, ordinarily</hi> in his
<hi>communications</hi> with the <hi>Saints</hi> &amp; <hi>Churches,</hi> (among whom his credit
was so good, that his word might at any time be taken without an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45615:3"/>
               <hi>oath</hi>) and consequently as <hi>unnecessarily</hi> as other men, which do use
<hi>frequent, ordinary,</hi> and <hi>unnecessary</hi> swearing, which both <hi>J. Tombes,
Hen. Den,</hi> and <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> do unanimously diallow; and so ye are
guilty of egregious partiality, condemning in some the things
which ye allow in others.</p>
            <p>Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>over, if those be <hi>Oaths,</hi> how is it that the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces</hi>
in Sessions will not own them as so, and set free those priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
when they offer to say <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d knows, God is witness,</hi> &amp;c. that
we intend no other but good, peaceableness, faithfulness and truth
to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>all men,</hi> &amp;c? Surely the <hi>Magistrates</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
do not believe the <hi>Priests</hi> doctrine, for if they did, they would
practise it; so that we may conclude, That they do but beat the
Ayr, and spend their strength for nought, when both Magistrates
and people will neither believe nor practise that for truth, which
their Priests deliver for doctrine.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>J. Tombes</hi> saith in p. 5. <hi>That those Baptists of</hi> Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
<hi>have offered an Engagement taken before some Justice of the
Peace in a solemn manner, with calling God to witness to the truth of
what they say, and that they do offer to swear, and take an oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Herein he hath condemned the <hi>Judges</hi> at <hi>Maidstone,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be ignorant of an <hi>Oath,</hi> or else to proceed in unjust judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against them; seeing the <hi>Judges</hi> required nothing of them
but an <hi>Oath,</hi> and they offered an <hi>Oath,</hi> and yet they would not
receive it; so that instead of condemning the prisoners because
they cannot swear, he hath condemned the <hi>Judges,</hi> for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or at least not owning an <hi>Oath</hi> when it was offered them: and
so contrary unto right Rule and Justice, keeping them still in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for not <hi>swearing,</hi> who offered willingly to <hi>swear</hi> (as he saith)
so that it appears that the <hi>Judges</hi> do no more agree with <hi>J. Tombes</hi>'s
judgement that that was an <hi>Oath,</hi> then the <hi>Quakers</hi> do; But what
strange Doctrine (or rather confusion) is this in <hi>J. Tombes,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the <hi>Quakers</hi> because they will not <hi>swear,</hi> and yet say that they
do <hi>swear</hi> fully and plainly? And yet the <hi>Judges, Mayors,</hi> and
<hi>Magistrates</hi> will not take it: So that by <hi>J. Tombes</hi>'s book, and the
rest that have been written for <hi>swearing,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> are found
guiltless, and the <hi>Magistrates</hi> only are to be blamed and reproved,
because they will not accept of an <hi>Oath,</hi> when it is offered to be
given by those of whom they require it.</p>
            <p>But again secondly, If to say, <hi>God knows,</hi> or <hi>God is witness,</hi> as
an appeal <hi>to Gods contestation, be swearing by God,</hi> then to say <hi>such a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45615:3"/>
man knows,</hi> or <hi>such a man is witness</hi> to the truth of what I say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
an appeal to that man's <hi>contestation, is a swearing by that man;</hi> which
<hi>(Absit absurdum hoc nigro carbone no tandum)</hi> if these Baptists <hi>J. T.
H. D. Jer. Ives,</hi> or any others shall say it is, We shall say they are
not yet so wise as they will be, when they once come with the
<hi>Quakers</hi> to own the truth, which they now deny.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Jo. Tombes</hi> saith, That Christ is <hi>no where called</hi> the Oath
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> In the same sence, and place, in which he is called the
<hi>Covenant</hi> of God, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 5. he is called the <hi>Oath of God;</hi> for
God's Covenant is his Oath, which he swore <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72, 73.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>J. T.</hi> saith, That <hi>there is no instance given by</hi> Sam. Fisher
<hi>of any place where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>is used in a more moderate sence then to bind
by Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> What needed one to be given by <hi>S. F.</hi> when thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
one thy self? <hi>viz. 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 27. which is translated (truly
enough) <hi>I charge you by the Lord;</hi> which is no more but I <hi>will,
require,</hi> or <hi>command</hi> you, in God's sight, presence, or such like;
which thou falsly saist is a <hi>charging</hi> or <hi>requiring one to swear</hi> by the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Or secondly, What need any more instance be given then thou
hast given thy self, who confessest it over again in thy <hi>Supplement,</hi>
p. 8, 9. more plainly then in thy former? confessing to thy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confutation, that these three places, <hi>viz 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 27.
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 13. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. are <hi>alike charges,</hi> and that the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>used 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. is only to <hi>command,</hi> or <hi>enjoyn, and
doth not include an oath, or swearing;</hi> and that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
used 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. signifies no more then <hi>I witness before God;</hi> so
that as it was told thee before, it is most evident, that <hi>Paul</hi> at that
distance wherein he was from them when he wrote to the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
and <hi>Timothy,</hi> either did not charge them to take an <hi>Oath,</hi>
or if he did, they did not take it, nor <hi>swear</hi> to him; unless we shall
suppose they swore to some other that stood present as <hi>Paul's proxy,</hi>
by word of mouth to exact it of them; which absurdity is more
fit to be <hi>exploded</hi> then <hi>supposed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Thou sayst <hi>p. 10.</hi> That <hi>S. F. shews no instance where in
with an Accusative case is a particle of affirming without swearing,
and till he doth, it necessarily is a particle of swearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> No, not necessarily; for whether <hi>with</hi> or <hi>without</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusative
case, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>soundeth out no more then some <hi>strong asseveration</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45615:4"/>
of a thing, as with <hi>verily, truly, indeed,</hi> or such like; and differs
little more from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>in Greek (with is <hi>yea</hi> in English) then the
English <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>yea verily</hi> do differ from each other; witness the
Latine adverb <hi>nae,</hi> with <hi>ae</hi> dipthong, derived (as is to be seen in
the Latine Dictionaries) of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>in the Greek, with <hi>eta</hi> or long

deed,</hi> or such like; and the very Accidence it self makes it a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>affirming</hi> only, and not of <hi>swearing.</hi> And however <hi>J. Tombes</hi>
saith, that <hi>Grammarians</hi> make the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>a particle of <hi>swearing,</hi>
yet the <hi>Lexicographers</hi> make it as well a particle of <hi>affirming only,
without swearing,</hi> as in that place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. it being evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that <hi>Paul</hi> in that place did not <hi>swear,</hi> when he saith, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
by your rejoycing,</hi> &amp;c. for to swear by any thing but God, is by
all judged to be unlawful.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I. Tombes</hi> replies thus; <hi>That Paul sware by God even in
those expressions</hi> an Oath (saith he) of Oppignoration, Pawning,
or Execration, <hi>wishing therein the forfeiture of his own rejoycing in
Christ Jesus, if it were not so as he said; as when we say On my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is so,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If this had been an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Oppignoration</hi> (as thou vainly
cal'st it) or pawning of his <hi>own</hi> part or share in Christ's joy, then he
would have mentioned <hi>his own</hi> rejoycing in Christ Jesus only, and
not that of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> also; for what reason soever he had to
with the forfeiture, or to pawn <hi>his own,</hi> yet he had neither right
nor reason to wish the forfeiture of theirs, or to pawn the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
part in the joy of Christ Jesus upon it, that it was so as he
spake unto them; no more then any of us have to wish evil to
<hi>another man,</hi> or to pawn <hi>other mens salvation,</hi> or to wish <hi>another
man damned,</hi> in case it be not true that we speak; which is a thing
altogether <hi>ungodly, unlawful,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> unto those that have
the spirit of judgement and understanding. And so <hi>J. Tombes</hi> his
pleading for swearing from such places, is only to be judged a
fruit of ignorance of Christ's Doctrine, or rather enmity against it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>J. Tombes</hi>saith, <hi>that swearing is a moral commandment, and
therefore lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If swearing be a commandment, and a duty to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
as the rest of the commandments are. Then it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as a duty and command continually, without any respect
to the Magistrate's imposing or requiring of it; for we are to love
God with our whole heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without being required by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45615:4"/>
Magistrate, which is the first Commandment; and we are to love
our neighbour as our selves, being the second, in which all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is included; none of which respect are a command from man
for the obedience of them.</p>
            <p>But again, <hi>I. Tombes</hi> falls from the command, and saith, his
greatest argument and inducement to swear, is, <hi>because the denying
of it hath caused, and is like to cause great persecution to those that
hold the truth about Baptisme, and that they will be counted persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
intolerable;</hi> and also he saith, <hi>that by his preaching swearing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
he hath saved hundreds, yea thousands (having brought them and
their families by it to enjoy their liberty) from ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> So that it appears it is to save people from persecution,
and spoiling of their goods, and to keep their outward liberty, that
<hi>I. Tombes</hi> hath preached up swearing, and so it seems they have the
reward of their obedience to his Doctrine already; and upon this
account, he, nor those that follow him, need never suffer persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if they will but alwayes deny the commands of Christ, as any
outward power comes upon them to threaten them with suffering;
so that in the day of his tryal, we have no ground otherwise to
believe, but that he will deny and break any of Christ's commands,
(and teach men so) rather then suffer persecution, seeing he hath
thus begun with this command of Christ, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> which
he would make of none effect by his tradition.</p>
            <p>Now seeing the Scripture saith, <hi>He that breaketh the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and teach men so, he shall be least</hi> (or not at all) <hi>in the
Kingdom of God;</hi> therefore all such are to be denyed, who make a
<hi>trade of preaching,</hi> and when their Doctrines come to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are found to be but the <hi>Ministers of sin,</hi> and to live by
the sins of the people; so that all people may consider and take
notice, whether this be a sufficient ground or plea, either for
preaching up, or believing swearing to be lawful, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be freed from persecution; which is the greatest hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
that can be either preached or practised by those that
profess to be religious. But the day is come which to some hath
made, and to others is making all things manifest, and is declaring
every man's work of what sort it is, that the deceivers folly may be
made manifest unto all men, that from them the people may be
brought into the doctrine and way of salvation, which is now free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held forth and published by the power, and in the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit of God, as they have freely received it; not for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45615:5"/>
filthy lucre, but of a ready minde; for the earth hath been cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and the land filled with such who have made a Trade of
the Saints words, preaching them for filthy lucre sake, not freely,
nor of a ready minde, but time-servers, having mens persons in
admiration because of advantage, and for a piece of bread such
men will transgress; as it is evidently manifest.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Jo. Tombes</hi> writes himself <hi>B. D.</hi> yet he is read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
such as are truly wise, by the name of <hi>Blinde Divine,</hi> rather
than <hi>Batchelor of Divinity;</hi> who hath spent so much of his time in
such vain Treatises, tending to nothing but to bring people out of
the obedience to <hi>Christ's Doctrine,</hi> who saith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and
having also confuted himself in his own words, there needs the
less be said by others to make him manifest; so for the further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing
of the truth of those things unto people, and for ending
of the Controversie between the <hi>Owners</hi> of Christ's Doctrine, and
the <hi>Opposers</hi> of it; we shall commend our selves, and our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
unto every man's Conscience in the sight of God; that his
witness may justifie the Truth, and clear it unto all men.</p>
