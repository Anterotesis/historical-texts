         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DIALOGUE
Betwixt a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-Man.</speaker>
               <p>WELL met. It is a most
ſcandalous Reflection ye cast
on our Church, (as I find in
a late Dialogue writ by one
of your Friends, called, <hi>A Sober Dialogue betwixt a</hi>
Scoteh Presbyterian, <hi>a</hi> London Church-Man, <hi>and a real</hi>
Quaker) for you to ſay, ye are of the ſame Faith with us:
And ye groſly pervert a Paſſage in our Common Prayer, to
Prove our Agreement with you; as becauſe we pray, that
God would inſpire us with his Holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Inſpirations we pray for, are your Light within,
that is common to you and all Mankind; and which ye
ſay, is ſufficient to your and all Mens Salvation, without
any thing elſe; than which nothing can be more contrary
to the Doctrine of our Church, as appears by the Thirty Nine
Articles of our Church, her Homilies, and whole Liturgy:
All which hold forth Jeſus Christ of <hi>Nazareth</hi> as he is in
Heaven, in our Nature, to the great object of Faith,
for Remiſſion of Sin, and Eternal Salvation; and alſo to
be the great Object of Adoration, together with the Father,
and the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs there is a great Confuſion among
us, about our Faith; eſpecially ever ſince <hi>Fr. Bugg,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43616:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
T. C.</hi> and <hi>G. Keith,</hi> has Printed ſo many large and full
Quotations out of our Friends Books, both ancient and
late, to ſhew our diſagreement with the Doctrine,
not only of your Church, but with the Doctrine of all
Chriſtian Societies in the whole VVorld, and (if they
are to be believed) with the Doctrine of the Holy
Scriptures; and none of all our Oppoſers has done us
a greater diskindneſs, to expoſe us to the World, than
he whom <hi>W. P.</hi> calls the <hi>Rattle-Snake Man,</hi> in his
<hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> that has been ſo generally well
liked, that it hath had three Impreſſions, and in his
<hi>Satan diſrobed,</hi> that hath had two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſhould theſe Books make ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
among you? You had wont to glory of your Vnity;
but where Confuſion is, Vnity ſurely is not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Before theſe miſchievous Books came forth,
we all generally agreed (as we thought) that the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principle of Truth was but one; and that
one was the <hi>Light in every Man's Conſcience,</hi> that taught
us and all Men, that there was a great God Almighty
that created all things, and that our whole Duty lay
within the compaſs of a few things, <hi>viz.</hi> to love God,
truſt in him, pray to him, and give him Thanks for
our Creation and Preſervation, and daily Mercies, and
to live ſoberly and juſtly in this World, doing as we
would be done by; and if we practiced theſe few
things, that ſhould ſerve us for Religion, and by our
Obedience to the Light in our Conſciences, which
taught us theſe few things we did believe, we ſhould
be happy after Death, and our Souls ſhould enjoy God
Eternally, though the Body that lyeth down in the
Grave, being Elementary and Earthly, finally periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
as all other Elementary and Earthly Bodies do.
But ſince the publiſhing of thoſe miſchievous Books,
many of our Friends, both in City and Country, begin
to think that Chriſt, as he is both God and Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, is a neceſſary Object of their Faith for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Sin, as he dyed, and as his Blood was ſhed,
and as he roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven in our
Nature, (as they ſay) and as he is now in Heaven,
Making Interceſſion for Men. And <hi>G. K.</hi> firſt in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43616:3"/>
and ſince here, having with his Meetings at
<hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> and his three Narratives, made ſuch a
heavy Charge againſt us, particularly againſt <hi>G. W.</hi> and
<hi>W. P.</hi> [wherein he has had Aſſociates, <hi>Fr. Bugg, Th.
Criſp,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Snake</hi>] that we have no
other Religion but Deiſm. This hath occaſioned <hi>G. W.</hi>
and <hi>W. P.</hi> to give forth ſeveral new Creeds, wherein
they have changed both the matter and manner of
their Doctrine, from what it formerly was, making the
World believe they hold all the Articles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Creed, as other Chriſtians do, and that they differ
not (in the main) from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
yea ſcarcely at all, ſetting aſide ſome School-Terms
in matter of Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>What is your ſenſe upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and particularly as to theſe new Creeds?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, to the whole matter. If Chriſt as
without us, and as (as ſome call him) God-Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
forth to be the neceſſary Object of Faith, for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Salvation, it quite overturns our whole Fabrick;
as <hi>W. P.</hi> (I think very properly) charged <hi>G. K.</hi> at <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe</hi>
Meeting, that he did indeavour to pluck up the
Teſtimony of Truth by the Roots, by preaching the
neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, as without us. This ſort
of Doctrine doth certainly undo all that we have been
building, as in reſpect of our Chriſtianity, which we
thought was all one with Morality; but now <hi>G. K.</hi>
and his Aſſociates, tell us, <hi>That Morality at beſt is but
a part of Chriſtianity; and if it is not built on the Faith
of Chriſt God-Man without us, it is not ſo much as a part
of it, but pure Heatheniſm and Deiſm.</hi> But I cannot
be of that mind, That Chriſt, conſidered as God-Man
without us, in the neceſſary Object of our Faith for
Salvation: For if this be granted, many great and
ſad Conſequences will neceſſary follow that Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that will bring great Trouble upon us. And as
to theſe new Creeds, the Authors of them had done
better to have let them alone, and not publiſhed
them; for our Friends have oft declared againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Creeds and Confeſſions of Faith, as hurtful; and
I believe they will cauſe great breaches amongſt us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe it is apparent, that our chief
Leaders, that give out theſe new Creeds, not only
contradict their elder Brethren, but alſo their own
Books. And the ſenſe of many of our Friends is,
concerning <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> that they are not a-whit
changed in their Faith, but that they give forth thoſe
new Creeds to quiet the Nation, and be a blind to
them, to make all thing the <hi>Quakers</hi> Toleration is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to them, as much as of any Diſſenters; for by
theſe Creeds, all will be apt to thing, we are one in
Faith and Doctrine, with all the Diſſenters who are
included in the Act of Toleration; and that we own
all the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> excepting
ſome few, that are excepted in the Act it ſelf in favour
of ſuch Diſſenters as are of the ſame Faith with your
Church in all the other Articles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems your chief Leaders have ſome
of the Policy of the Jeſuits, and other Popiſh Orders, that
to lye and diſſemble is no Sin, providing the Peace of the
Church can be preſerved thereby.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>I cannotdeny, but that ſome of our chief
Leaders, and particularly <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> ſeem to
agree with them in ſuch Politicks, as in too many other
things; which is a great grief to many ſincere and
ſimple-hearted perſons among us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But do ye not in good earneſt believe the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>As for my ſelf, I cannot ſay that I believe
them all, for there are divers of them I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and ſo I am perſwaded many hundreds of our
Friends do not believe them no more than I do; for
the very Books of our Friends, of beſt account with
us, hath taught us to believe the contrary; and none
have more plainly led us into a contrary Belief, than
the Books of <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Pray what Articles, or parts of that

               <p>Your Creed, that ye commonly call the

Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was
crucified, dead and buried; and a third concerning
your Belief in the Holy Ghoſt; By which it is plain
to me, and I think ye will not deny it, that your
Creed holds forth a diſtinction of Father, Son, and
Holy Ghoſt, as three diſtinct Perſons, diſtinguiſhed by
certain incommunicable Properties, as ye commonly
call them; otherwiſe, why make ye three Articles
concerning them, but that ye believe them to be three
diſtinct Perſons? But both <hi>G. W</hi>'s Books, and <hi>W. P</hi>'s,
have taught us a plaint contrary Belief; and what they
have taught us, we believed that they had given them
by Divine Inſpiration; for <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Divinity of
Chriſt,</hi> denyeth any diſtinction of Perſons; and in his
<hi>Truth defending the</hi> Quakers, denyeth that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by incommunicable Properties; and <hi>W. P.</hi>
in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> hath not only argued againſt
three Perſons, but againſt three, in any ſenſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
otherwiſe than nominally, as he ſomewhere
words it; as to ſay, three Manifeſtations, or three
differing Names. But at this rate ye may infer thirty
as well as three; for it is certain, there are thirty
various Names given to God in Scripture, and many
more; and there are as many various Manifeſtations
and Operations. Again, whereas your Creed teacheth
you to believe, that he who ſuffered under <hi>Pontius
Pilate</hi> was the Son of God, <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Serious Apology,</hi>
hath taught us a contrary Belief, <hi>That that outward
Perſon that ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem (ſo he calleth him that
was born of <hi>Mary,</hi>) <hi>was not properly the Son of God;</hi>
and ſaith plainly, <hi>we utterly deny it.</hi> And <hi>G. W.</hi> in his
<hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> denyeth that Chriſt did conſiſt of
Fleſh and Bones; he grants he had a Body of Fleſh
and Bones, but denyeth that he did conſiſt of it, that
is, as any part of him, as you and I have our Bodies
of Fleſh and Bones to be parts of us; and we conſiſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43616:5"/>
of them, as well as we have our more noble parts, to
wit, our Souls, of which we alſo conſiſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But if ye believe that he who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſuffered Death at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was properly the
Son of God, ye muſt alſo not believe, that he who was
born of Mary was properly the Son of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>No more we do; for the Son and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are but two Names, and but one God; and if
we ſhould believe that he that was born of <hi>Mary</hi> was
the Son of God, we ſhould believe that he was God,
and ſo <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be the Mother of God; which,
as <hi>G. W.</hi> hath taught us to believe, is plain Popery.</p>

were your remote Fathers; but who was the immediate
Father of Chriſt, if not God? And if God was his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

God, and God was properly his Father.</p>

               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>That Article in your Creed, that Chriſt
deſcended into Hell; and that other Article, that he
aroſe the third day, and afterwards aſcended into
Heaven; if by Hell and Heaven ye mean local places
without us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>We do indeed by Hell and Heaven, mean

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>W. P.</hi> hath taught us to believe, that
a local Heaven or Hell is <hi>Mahometan;</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> hath
taught us, that to ſay, Chriſt exiſteth Bodily without
us at God's right hand, in a perſonal exiſtence, is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphitiſm</hi>

               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>That outward Perſon that was crucified on
the wooden Croſs, and was buried, was not the Chriſt
of God; but the Chriſt of God was in that outward
Perſon that was crucified and buried. I pity thy Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
to think that any thing that was mortal, or
could dye, could be Chriſt; or that Chriſt could be
buried. Our worthy Friend <hi>John Whitehead</hi> hath
taught us, that nothing that is mortal can be called
Chriſt; and <hi>G. W.</hi> hath told us, that Chriſt was never
ſeen with carnal Eyes; and our Friend <hi>W. P.</hi> hath
proved it againſt <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> that it was not Chriſt that
did hang on the Croſs, but the Body in which Chriſt
was.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But what ſay ye to the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that expreſly ſay, that Chriſt dyed and was buried?
<hi>as 1 Cor. 15. 3, 4.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Our inſpired Teachers have taught us,
that the Scriptures are not always to be underſtood
literally.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>At this rate, I fear, ye believe ſcarcely
one Article of our Creed. Do ye believe that the ſame
Body of Jeſus that was buried, roſe again, and aſcended
into Heaven?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>We believe that Jeſus roſe again, but not
that he roſe in the ſame Body, or that he aſcended
in the ſame Body; for he roſe in a Spiritual Body,
that came in, the doors being ſhut, as the Diſciples
were met together: But the Body that did hang on
the Croſs, and was buried, was a Carnal or Natural
Body, and Chriſt's Body is Heavenly and Spiritual,
and is in us; for we eat it, as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath argued, and
nobly defended our ancient Friend <hi>G. P.</hi> but that was
not the Carnal Body that was crucified and buried; and
<hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> hath taught us, that an
Earthly Body and a Heavenly Body cannot be the
ſame Subſtance; and <hi>W. P.</hi> hath taught us, in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> that to ſay, a Natural Body can be
changed to a Spiritual Body, and yet be the ſame in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43616:6"/>
Subſtance, is to out-do the abſurd Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Do ye believe that other Article of our
Creed, that Christ will come, in a Bodily Exiſtence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, as the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> to judge the quick and the
dead?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>We cannot believe any ſuch Carnal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that ſuppoſeth that Chriſt is in Heaven, as in
a local place, without us, and has our true Nature in
Heaven; but <hi>Ed. Burr.</hi> our great Prophet, hath taught
us, that it is Blaſphemy to ſay that Chriſt is in Heaven,
in our Nature; alſo it contradicts <hi>G. W.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Do ye believe that Article of our Creed,
the forgiveneſs of Sins?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>We do not believe it as ye ſtate it, and
according to your Notion of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why? What is our Notion of it, that ye

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Ye tell us, God forgives you your Sins,
upon the account of Chriſt's having paid the Debt of
your Sins, and having ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for
them; but we have no ſuch Belief; for <hi>W. Pen</hi> hath
taught us, that a Debt cannot be both paid and freely
forgiven; and this he ſaith, doth <hi>totally exclude Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>
And you tell us, that we muſt not only repent,
but believe in the Man Chriſt without us; and that
ſuch a Faith is abſolutely neceſſary to our forgiveneſs:
This we altogether deny; for this would contradict
our ancient Faith, <hi>That the Light within us in ſufficient
to Salvation, without any thing elſe.</hi> Ye are ſo ignorant,
as not to diſtinguiſh betwixt a Hiſtorical Faith, and a
Saving Faith: The Hiſtorical Faith is your Faith, in a
Chriſt without you, that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Hundred Years paſt; but the Saving Faith is in
the Power of God within us, the Light and Life, and
that is the true and proper Chriſt. Beſides, your
Doctrine of Remiſſion of Sins, teacheth you to pray
for a daily forgiveneſs, becauſe ye ſin daily; ſo that
in your Common-Prayer, from Seven to Seventy, ye
are ſtill praying, <hi>God be merciful to us miſerable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43616:6"/>
Sinners,</hi> as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath well obſerved. We neither
need nor expect ſuch a forgiveneſs; and therefore we
are not taught ſo to pray, nor do we uſe ſuch Prayers
for our ſelves; as Strangers that frequent our Publick
Meetings can ſufficiently inform thee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Do ye own the Reſurrection of the Body
that dyeth, and that the deceaſed Saints look for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of their Bodies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Nay; for if the deceaſed Saints look for
any ſuch Reſurrection, as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath taught us, it
would follow they were in ſome Purgatory for the
time; and he hath alſo taught us, that a Natural Body,
and a Spiritual Body, are two Bodies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>I am greatly amazed; I did not think
that ye did ſo univerſally disbelieve our <hi>Creed,</hi> as I find
ye do; for I cannot underſtand that ye believe any one

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>What talks thou to me of your Orthodox
Chriſtians; we deny you to be Chriſtians, but in
Name: But ſuppoſe we believed all your twelve Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
as ſtated by you, what would that Faith profit
us? How many of them think ye neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
to be believed by us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>I think all of them very neceſſary.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>And I think ſcarce any of them, as ſtated

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Pray why?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing is neceſſary to be believed by us
to our Salvation, but what the Light within us, which
is the ſame in every Man, teacheth us to believe; but
there is ſcarce one of your twelve Articles that our
Light within us teacheth us to believe; for if it did,
it would teach our Jewiſh and Mahometan Brethren,
and many other pious Gentiles, and excellent Moral
Livers, theſe Articles of your Creed; but this it doth
Not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Do ye then take all Juſt and Moral
Men, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that profeſs the ſame
Light within, and obey its dictates, to be your Christian
Brethren?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43616:7"/>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Yea we do; for <hi>W. P.</hi> hath taught us in
his <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants,</hi> that it is uncharitable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any meer juſt Man from our Society; and there
are many juſt Men among them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But why think ye, that to take Chriſt
God-Man, without you, to be the Object of your Faith,
together with the Light within you, will bring any great
inconveniences, and ſad inferences and conſequences upon
you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, Time would fail to number them
all; I will mention ſome of them to thee. Firſt, as
I told thee before, it quite overturns our whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
that we have been building almoſt theſe Fifty
Years paſt, and plucks up by the Roots the Teſtimony
of ancient Friends; yea, and our preſent Teſtimony
among our ſelves: For Chriſt <hi>God-Man,</hi> as they phraſe
it, without us in Heaven, in a Bodily Exiſtence, is
the World's Chriſt, which our Friends neither think
neceſſary, nor profitable to preach; for we find, that
the preaching of it hath not profited the Hearers;
and as our great Prophet <hi>Ed. Burr.</hi> hath taught us,
the Light of Chriſt within, is only that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be taught for Salvation. Secondly, That
Doctrine of a Chriſt God-Man without us, being the
neceſſary Object of our Faith, will neceſſarily infer,
that we muſt ſet up another Rule of Faith, than the
Light within us, to wit, the Scriptures: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is a Ru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of Faith, muſt propoſe to our Minds all
the things neceſſary to be believed, and the full and
compleat Object of Faith; but this the Light within
us doth not. If Chriſt <hi>God-Man</hi> be the neceſſary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Faith, as he was conceived by the Holy
Ghoſt, born of a Virgin, dyed, roſe again the third
day, and aſcended into Heaven, none of all which
doth our Light within us teach us to believe; but the
Scripture without us, by way of Hiſtory, teacheth
ſome ſuch things; and this is but a Hiſtorical Belief,
which ſome of our Friends have, [may be as amply
as ye,] but many more have it not. This Hiſtorical
Belief we little regard; for as he that hath it, is not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43616:7"/>
profited by it to his Salvation, ſo he that hath it not
is not hurt, nor in danger for want of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But I have heard ſome of you call it
beneficial, though not abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Some of us may call it ſo, and perhaps
think it ſo; but I, and many other faithful Friends
do not think it ſo; for it is but the Letter that kills
the Fleſh profits nothing, it is only the Spirit that
quickens; <hi>Paul</hi> renounced his knowledge of Chriſt
after the Fleſh. Pray, what profit can be in that
Faith to us, that plucks up our ancient Teſtimony by
The Roots, as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath well obſerved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard ſome of you call the
Scriptures a ſecondary Rule of Faith; and I think I have
Read it in ſome of your Friends Books.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps thou haſt; but all that was daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with untempered mortar: Thou ſhalt find no ſuch
diſtinction, I warrant thee, in any of our moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and moſt approved Friends Books. If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be allowed to be a ſecondary Rule, it teacheth
nothing but what the primary Rule, the Light within
us, and in every Man, firſt teacheth; but the Light
within us, and in every Man, teacheth us, not that
Hiſtorical Faith and Doctrine thou contendeſt for;
as that Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, having
two Natures, and that as ſuch he is the Object of Faith
and Worſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Poſſibly ſome of your Friends that hold
the Scripture to be a ſecondary Rule will ſay, the Light
in all Men would reveal Chriſt God-Man, without them,
to be the Object of their Faith and Worſhip, if all Men were
duly faithful and obedient to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>If they ſay or think ſo, they are greatly
miſtaken. How many hundreds of faithful Men have
we of our Brethren, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
and how many Deiſts have we here in <hi>England,</hi> who
are excellent Men for Sobriety and Juſtice, and are
obedient to the Light within them, and take it for
their Rule of Faith and Life; and yet if ye ask them
if their Light within them doth teach them any thing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43616:8"/>
of a Chriſt without them, they will plainly tell you,
nay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But I find not that your Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and your Deiſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
here in <hi>England,</hi> own or confeſs a Chriſt in them:
They ſeem as ignorant of any knowledge, or Faith of a
Chriſt within them, as of a Chriſt without them.</p>

               <p>Names of things are no wiſe material.
What if they call not Chriſt in them by the outward
Names, Chriſt and Jeſus? It is enough to their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
and Salvation, that they inwardly feel the
Power, Life and Virtue, of the thing it ſelf. they
call it the <hi>Light within,</hi> and magnifie it with other high
Titles, and that is ſufficient.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what other hurtful Conſequences
would your owning the neceſſity of Chriſt God-Man without
you, as the great, yea and only Object of your Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as your High Prieſt, and only Atonement for the
Remiſſion of Sins, bring upon you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>A third hurtful Conſequence if this, It
would exceedingly leſſen the number of our Chriſtian
Brethren, and abridge our Charity, which is now very
diffuſive and large, as the Sand of the Sea. Ye talk
of your Catholick Church; but our Church is more
Catholick and Univerſal than yours. The Members of
your Church are only ſuch, as believe in Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
and hold all, or the greateſt part, of that ye
call the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> whereof we have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
at large; but the Members of our Church,
who are <hi>one Body</hi> with us, are all juſt and ſober Men,
of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and remoteſt Nations, that
own a great God Almighty, and obey the Dictates of
the Light within them. A fourth very hurtful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is, That if the Doctrine of a Chriſt God-Man
without us, be received among us, as the neceſſary
Object of our Faith for Salvation, it will bring in ſo
many other things with it, by neceſſary Conſequence,
that we ſhall ere long be one with you, both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice; and then we ſhall be utterly at a
loſs to juſtifie our Separation from you: yea, fifthly,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43616:8"/>
we ſhould be conſtrained to return to the outward
Baptiſm, and Supper, which we have all along called
<hi>Beggerly Elements</hi> and <hi>Worldly Rudiments,</hi> [as ſome that
were among us lately have done]; and daily to pray
for the Pardon of our Sins. And laſtly, this new
Scheme of Doctrine, if introduced among us, will not
only deprive our Friends (of the Miniſtry) of their
Infallibility, for which they have ſo earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but will break our Meetings of all ſorts, and
wonderfully divide and ſcatter us, by the confuſion of
the manner of Preaching that will be among us, and
is begun to be among us already in divers parts, to the
great Grief of many ſincere Souls, even as the People,
by the Confuſion of the Languages, at <hi>Babylon,</hi> were
ſcattered aſunder.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Church-man.</speaker>
               <p>But Friend, it has of late been (divers
times) queried of your Friends, whether <hi>Ja. Nayler</hi> was
a Blaſphemer, yea or nay, and I cannot get a direct Anſwer.
Pray what think you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Ohno, we cannot admit of a plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
for if we ſay no, then the Apoſtate Chriſtians
will be ready to ſtone us: If we ſay yea, then will
they prove it upon us, that <hi>Geo. Fox, Edw. Burrough,
Sol. Eccles,</hi> and others of our ancient Friends were
Balſphemers: And thou knoweſt that would go down
ruggedly, and would not ſuit our preſent Intereſt.</p>

the Challenge, yet they cannot deny, with any ſhadow
of Reaſon, but that they accepted at leaſt the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
given (as they ſay) by the Clergy; and at the
Place and Time appointed came from divers places;
particularly ſome of their Teachers came from <hi>London,</hi>

great Cowardice, and conviction of Guilt, if <hi>G. W.</hi>
and <hi>W. P.</hi> or any others concerned, will neither give
a Challenge to <hi>G. K.</hi> whom they charge to have wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

not give me a Challenge, they are once more deſired
to accept of mine; and let us agree, about Time and
Place: Or if they will not agree about them, with
what colour can they blame me, if I ſhall once more
appoint Time and Place to them, and prove out of
their, and their Friends Books owned by them, that
their new Creeds are utterly repugnant to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
formerly delivered in their Printed Books; and
that it is a manifeſt fallacy that their late <hi>Creed,</hi> given
