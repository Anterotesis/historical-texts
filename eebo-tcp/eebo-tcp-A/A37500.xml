            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Bserving that our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with
the Assembly of Divines, and the rest of the Preshyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
judgement, do often both in their discourse and
writings, exceedingly presse for <hi>Vniformity;</hi> I have
been urged in my spirit, to think upon the matter, and
to consider whether there could be any such thing
found in the word of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Churches of Christ. And for my part, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
professe I cannot yet discover it, and would
be glad if any would instruct me further in this particular, so he do it from
the Word.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Vniformity</hi> what is it, but an unity of form? and the form they mean,
no doubt, is outward: for the inward form, as it cannot be known by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
senses; so neither can it be accomplished by outward power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(till I know their meaning better) I conceive that by <hi>uniformity</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
an unity of outward form in the Churches of God: yea some of them
do declate so much, calling the thing they would have, <hi>Externall uniformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now such a thing as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (after so much meditation and recollection, as my
other imployments, and the many distractions that necessarily attend my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition, will permit me) I cannot discern in the word of the Gospell.
For Christ speaking of the Church of the New Testoment, saith, <hi>Iohn 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23.
The hour cometh and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in
Spirit and Truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit, and
and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> In which words
it is most evident, that the worship of God in the time of the New Testament,
is inward and spirituall, consisting in faith, hope, love, and prayer, the op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the three former, &amp;c. And so, is so far from <hi>Vniformity</hi> as hath been
explicated, and as they understand it, that it is not at all capable of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot but wonder at the strange workings of darknesse in the mindes of
men, who would have an externall <hi>Vniformity</hi> in a worship that is inward and
spirituall, and of which the outward form is no part at all, but is meerly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall,
and so absolutely various.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57849:2"/>
Again, as I finde not this Uniformity in the doctrine of the Gospel, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the practice of the Saints, who had the spirit of the Gospel, as that
practice is represented to us in the Word.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Acts 1. 14.</hi> I read how the Apostles being together with the women, and
<hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Jesus, &amp; his brethren, continued with one accord in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and supplication: and <hi>Acts 2. v. 44.</hi> &amp; 46. how <hi>all that believed were together,
and continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and did break bread from house
to house, &amp;c.</hi> And in all this there was Unity, but no externall <hi>Vniformity,</hi>
neither name nor thing. Again, <hi>Acts 4. 23. Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> being let go by the
Magistrates, <hi>went to their own company</hi> (which many of our Clergy would
term a Conventicle) <hi>and reported all that the chief Priests and Elders had said to
them; and when they heard it, they lift up their voice to God</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with one
accord, and prayed.</hi> Here was inward Unity, in faith, and love, and joy, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
prayer, bur no externall Uniformity: and vers. 32. <hi>The multitude of
them that believed were of one heart, and one soul.</hi> Unity still, but nothing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<hi>uniformity.</hi> Further, we read <hi>Acts</hi> chap. 7. and chap. 8. that <hi>Stephen</hi>
and <hi>Philip,</hi> who by the Church were ordained Deacons and were to serve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Ministery of the Table, yet by vertue of the anointing, preached the
word of God freely, and powerfully: and how all the Members of the Church
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who were neither Ministers nor Deacons, being scattered abroad
by persecution, went preaching the Word every where, where they came, in
that case of necessity: the unction of the Spirit, of which all believers partake
alike, being one fundamentall ground of such Ministery, where there are no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to call to the Office: and in all this, though there was <hi>unity</hi> of faith,
spirit, and doctrine, yet I am sure they will say, there was no such <hi>uniformity</hi>
as they would have. Again, <hi>Asts 20. Paul</hi> the first day of the Week, preached
to the Disciples of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> from the Evening till Midnight (which Dr. <hi>Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>
in a printed Sermon saith, was out of order, that is, out of Prelaticall
order, or Presbyteriall <hi>uniformity)</hi> and after brake bread and did eat, and talked
with them a long while, till break of day: and going from thence, he arrived
at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and there called the Elders of the Church together, and appeals to
them after what manner he had been with them, to wit, serving the Lord with
all humility of minde, (I wish the Assembly would mark that, and mark it
again) and with many tears and temptations, &amp;c. and how he had held back
nothing profitable for them, but had taught them publikely, and from house to
house (which I wish were more in use now-a-dayes, if it might obtain so much
leave from <hi>uniformity)</hi> and had preached to them R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pentance towards God,
and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, our chief work toward God since
our fall and corruption being Repentance, which is the change of the creature
towards God, through Gods own work in the creature, and this is not done
without the sorrow of the flesh; and our chief work towards Christ, who is
given to us as a head, being Faith or Union. And in the end, exhorts the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:57849:3"/>
to take heed to themselves (who according to the Church principles of this
age, want no admonition themselves, seeing they are become a peremptory
rule to all others) and to the flocks over which the holy Ghost (and not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons)
hath made them overseers, to feed the Church of God which he had
purchased with his own bloud, &amp;c. But in all this neither practices himselfe,
nor preaches to them, nor commands them to preach to others, or impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others any such kind of thing as externall <hi>vniformity.</hi> And so surely they
that so vehemently urge this thing, that they make it all in all in their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
have some other teacher then the Apostle, who being taught of Christ
as Christ was taught of God, yet knew no such thing at all in the worship of
God, as <hi>vniformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet further, that the world (if it be possible) may be the more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
observe a little more seriously the practice of Christ and the Saints, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to this poynt, and you shall see nothing lesse then externall Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
See this in the prayer of Christ, (prayer for the duty it felf being nothing
but so much spirituall worship as being the voyce of the Spirit in the flesh,
both in head and members) This Christ sometimes performed with his eyes
lifted up to heaven, sometimes being prostrate with his body on the earth, and
so severall times severall wayes: and as he, so the Saints have some prayed
standing, and lifting up their hands, as <hi>Moses,</hi> some kneeling and lifting up
their hands, as <hi>Solomon,</hi> some standing and not lifting up their eyes, as the
Publicans, &amp;c. And what externall Uniformity in all this? And as for praying
so for preaching, Christ sometimes preached in a ship, sometimes on the shore,
sometimes in the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> someimes in the Temple, sometimes in
the desart, sometimes early, sometimes late, as if he intended on purpose to
witnesse against that piece of the mystery of iniquity which in after ages
should be called <hi>Vniformity.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> preached sometimes on the Jews Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
sometimes on the first day of the week, sometimes each day of the week,
sometimes in the day, sometimes in the night, sometimes prayed in the house,
sometimes on the shore; he circumcised <hi>Timothy</hi> among the weak, refused to
circumcise <hi>Titus</hi> among the perverse, became as a Jew to the Jews, as a Greek
to the Greeks, to the weak as weak, to the strong as strong, all things to all
men, that he might win some: and what externall Uniformity was here? And
then for the Sacraments, Christ administred the Sacrament of the Supper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after supper, <hi>Paul</hi> at midnight, and it may be others in the morning,
or at noone: and what externall Uniformity in all this? And for government;
sometimes the Apostles met together into a Councell and in that Councell
ordered things not of their own heads, or by plurality of voyces, but by the
Word and Spirit, and what they ordered by the Word and Spirit, they put in
execution by the power of the Word and Spirit, and not by the power of the
World. At other times Ministers and believers did things by the Word and
Spirit among themselves, by the mutuall consent of both; or else believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb facs="tcp:57849:3"/>
among themselves, if there were no Ministers present. And where the
number of believers were more, they stood in need of more Officers, and
where fewer, of fewer Officers, and all these things are the free ordering of the
Churches, who have Christ, the Spirit, and the Father among them and in
them, and so are taken out of the bondage of men into the freedome of God.
That truly I see not the Gospel more setting its spirit against any thing of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
then against this point of externall Uniformity. For if we have one
Lord, Christ, Spirit, Faith, Baptisme, God, all other things are free to the
Churches, as God shall order by them, and no otherwise; and the reason, and
wisdome, and prudence of man, have no place in this world, where the Sun of
righteousness shines as the onely light.</p>
            <p>But against this that hath been said, do lie some objections: as first,</p>
            <p>The Prophet foretold that <hi>the Lord should be one, and his Name one,</hi> and doth
not this imply externall Uniformity?</p>
            <p>I answer, nothing lesse: for the Apostle explicates plainly and clearly, whar
it is to have the Lord one, and his Name one among believers, <hi>Eph. 4. ch. 4.
5. 6.</hi> where he saith, there is in the spirituall Church, <hi>one Body, and one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
one hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all, who is above all, through all, and in all.</hi> Whereby you see, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
believers there is a manifold Unity, but no externall Uniformity; yea,
the prayer of Christ the Son for the Church, unfolds clearly the promise of
God the Father to the Church, <hi>Iohn 17.</hi> Christ prayes, <hi>that they all</hi> (who are
many among themselves according to the flesh) <hi>may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one, as thou Father art
in mee, and I in thee,</hi> (that is, according to the unity of the Spirit, not exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Uniformity) <hi>that after this manner they also may be one in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againe it is objected out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that the Apostle requires that
<hi>all things may be done in the Church decently and in order:</hi> and doth not this
imply externall Uniformity?</p>
            <p>I answer, that they will hardly admit in their parish Churches such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and order as the Apostle there means, neither are they capable of it. For
he saith before, <hi>When the whole Church is come together into some place, that all
may prophesie one by one, that all may learne and all be comforted:</hi> and that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this exercise of prophesying, <hi>if any thing be revealed to another, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is to give place;</hi> and he must speak that hath the clearest light, seeing the
Spirit, to whomsoever it is given to profit withall. And that though all may
prophesie one by one, yet all may not prophesie at once, for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en it would not
be order, but confusion, which the Apostle would have avoyded, saying, <hi>Let
all things be done decently and in order.</hi> And this decency too he perswades to
by the word, he doth not in force by secular power. And if they will call this
Uniformity, for Church-members to prophesie one after another, according
to the variety of the gifts of the Spirit, and not many or two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> three at once
or the same time, we willingly agree with them: but how farre this thing is
from their sence, every one knowes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57849:4"/>
Thus you see these objections answered, and I am confident there are no
more can be brought but may as clearly and easily be answered as these.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I say, I wonder and wonder againe, that we having cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
and agreed together solemnly, to endeavour for a Government most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the word of God, should in the meane time be left so void of the
spirit and light of the Gospel, as to fall upon externall Uniformity, which is no
where to be found in the Gospel, nor in the practise of primative Christians.</p>
            <p>Yea, while I consider more seriously of the Matter, me thinks externall <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
is a monstrous thing (how glorious soever in their eyes) and not to be
found either in nature or in grace, either in Christs Kingdome, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world.</p>
            <p>In nature is no externall <hi>vniformity</hi> extended to all the workes of nature,
for looke into the world and see if there be not variety of forms; heavenly
and earthly bodies having severall formes; and in the earth each bird,
beast, tree, plant, creature, differs one from another in outward form. If
the whole creation should appeare in one form, or externall <hi>vniformity,</hi> what
a monstrous thing would it be, nothing differing from the first chaos? but the
variety of forms in the world is the beauty of the world. So that though there
be a most admirable unity among all the creatures, yet there is nothing lesse
then externall <hi>vniformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, as there is no externall <hi>vniformity</hi> spread over the great world, so
nor yet over the little world, or man. For looke upon a man consisting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead
and members, unto which the Apostle compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es the Church, and you shall
not finde all the members like one another, neither in regard of their outward
forms, nor operations: for the hand doth not move as the foot, nor the foot
act as the hand; and if all the members should appear and act in one form, what
a monster would a man bee? And yet among the members though there be
no externall <hi>vniformity,</hi> yet there is admirable unity.</p>
            <p>And yet again, look in to the Kingdomes of the world, and you shall see no
such thing in them as externall <hi>vniformity:</hi> Here in <hi>England</hi> you shall observe
that <hi>York</hi> is not governed as <hi>Hull,</hi> nor <hi>Hull</hi> as <hi>Hallifax,</hi> nor that as <hi>Bristoll,
&amp;c.</hi> neither is one County governed uniformly as another; there is no <hi>vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
in the government of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> nor one town governed like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
in Godmanchester, the youngest son inherit, in Huntington the Eldest,
nor one Corporation governed like another, nor one Company in the Citie
governed as another; and yet between all Counties, Cities, Towns, Corporations
Companies, there is unitie, though no externall <hi>vniformity.</hi> Yea, look upon
the famous Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and there are, it may be, an hundred thousand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
or more in it, and each one gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d after a severall manner, and among
all these families there is no externall <hi>vniformity,</hi> and yet they all agree well
enough into the unity of a City.</p>
            <p>Nay further, to bring but one man to an <hi>vniformity</hi> of life and practice, by
<pb facs="tcp:57849:4"/>
an outward Law, would be the most absolute tyranny in the world, and make
his life worse then death. To compell every man by a Law every day in the
week, or every Munday, Tuesday, &amp;c. in the week, to an <hi>uniformity</hi> of life, that
he shall rise at the same time, use the same postures, speak the same words, eat
the same food, receive the same Physick, sit, and stand, and walk, and lye
down at the same set times, who ever heard of such a cruel bondage? What an
absurd and intollerable thing then is <hi>uniformity</hi> in the life of a man, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all freedome of the soule? But how much more evill and intollerable is
<hi>uniformity</hi> in the life of a Christian, or of true Churches of Christ, taking away
all freedome of the spirit of God, who being one with God, works in the
freedome of God, and is not to be bound with any authoritative or coercive
power, of poor, dark, ignorant, vain, foolish, proud, and sinfull men.</p>
            <p>What now then do the Presbyters mean by <hi>Vniformity?</hi> Would they have
the Word preached, and the Sacraments administred, and the Name of God
called on, and all this done in spirit and truth in the Churches of Christ? This
truly is <hi>Vnity</hi> and not <hi>Vniformity,</hi> and such an <hi>unity</hi> as no man can compell.
But would they have the Word preached, the name of God called on, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
administred, the spirituall discipline of the spirituall Church managed,
the vertues of Christ, and graces of the Spirit in the Saints exercised, and all
this in one and the same outward form, or uniformity? This is the burden of
the Saints, the bondage of the Church, the straitning the Spirit, the limiting of
Christ, and the eclipsing the glory of the Father. And how wise soever these
men may be in naturall and carnall things, yet their wisedome is but
foolishnesse in spirituall things, in which there is no more uniformity,
then in the workings of the Spirit, who works severally in severall Saints,
and severally in the same Saints at severall times. And therefore they that
would tye the Church to an <hi>uniformity</hi> which works not of it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf, but as the
Spirit works in it, let them first tye the Spirit to an <hi>uniformity,</hi> and we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
But these men seem to run a sad hazard, who would thus reduce the
workings of the Spirit in Christians and Churches, to an outward <hi>uniformity,</hi>
according to their own minde and fancy, and so would rule and order, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
and straiten the Spirit of God by the spirit of man; seeing it is worse to
sin against Christ in the spirit, then against Christ in the flesh.</p>
            <p>And therefore till I be otherwise taught by the Word, I cannot conceive
that there ought to be or is possible to be any such externall <hi>uniformity</hi> in the
Churches of Christ, as these men strive, wrastle, sweat, contend for, I will not
say are ready to fight for, but that severall Churches of Christ having unity of
doctrine, faith, the spirit, ordinances, &amp;c. may have divers forms of outward
administrations, as God and Christ by the spirit shall lead them; and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church is in these things to be left free, and no Church forced by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
power to follow or imitate another Church against its will, not being
freely led unto it by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57849:5"/>
Neither do I think that God hath set up any company of men, or Synod in
the world, to shine to a whole Nation, so that all people shall be constrained to
follow their judgement, and to walk by their light, seeing other Ministers and
Christians may have more light and spirit then they. Neither hath Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
his presence and spirit to Ministers more then to believers, nor more to
an hundred then two or three: and if two or three Christians in the Country
being met together in the name of Christ, have Christ himself with his Word
and Spirit among them, they need not ride many miles to the Assembly at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to know what to do, or how to carry and behave themselves in the things
of God. And therefore for any company of men of what repute soever, to set
up their own judgement in a Kingdome, for a peremptory rule from which no
man must vary, and to compell all the faithfull people of God, who are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
members of Jesus Christ himself, to fall down before it, upon pain of being
cast into the burning fiery furnace of their indignation, heated seven times more
hot th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n ordinary, through the desired accesse of secular power to their power,
is a far worse work in my eyes, then that of King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> setting up
a golden Image, and forcing all to fall down before it; seeing spirituall idolatry
is so much worse then corporall, as the spirit is better then the flesh.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do think (let them teach me better by the Word that can)
that <hi>uniformity</hi> (the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and the Image that falls
