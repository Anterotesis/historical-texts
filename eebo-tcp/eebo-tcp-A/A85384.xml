         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing much ſtricken in years, and not far
from that turning in the courſe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
where <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God,
found in his dayes the ordinary period of
the life of man<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 90. 10.</note>; I am by the high and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
concernment of my diſſolution approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
importuned to the uttermoſt to bethink my
ſelf and conſider, what ſervice I may do, whileſt
my earthly tabernacle yet ſtandeth, to my dear
Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and for his ſake, to
the world about me, which is like to be of choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
acceptance with him, and which will turn to
the beſt account unto my ſelf at my appearance
before him. In my thoughts about this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
affair, I traverſed much ground, and had a
great variety of particulars, from time to time
preſented unto me, which all commended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto my conſcience in both thoſe reſpects,
which I made after with the greateſt ſtrength of
my deſire. Amongſt others, and with more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
importunity than the reſt, ſome brief <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi>
or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt the two <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall</hi>
Orders of <hi>Commiſſioned officers</hi> amongſt us
<pb facs="tcp:168452:3"/>
(whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civill, can hardly be
determined, but by a <hi>Nemo ſcit</hi>) however known
by the names of <hi>Triers,</hi> and <hi>Ejectors,</hi> much ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
and preſſed me in that behalf. From the
firſt day that I heard of theſe Commiſſions, and
underſtood, though but in generall, the purport
of them, my heart was troubled within me, and
began ſecretly to preſage the many and great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
which through the Adminiſtration and
execution of them, they were like to bring upon
the Goſpel in the Miniſtry of it, and upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
godly, worthy, and well deſerving men.
Of the truth of which preſagements, my ſelf in
part, with ſeverall others, who have had better
and more opportunity than I, to underſtand the
occaſioned productions of the ſaid Commiſſions,
are ſad witneſſes.</p>
            <p>I call God for a record upon my ſoule, that as
concerning the perſons entruſted with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the ſaid Commiſſions (ſome few
of them being known unto me, but far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part unknown) I bear not the leaſt grudge
of ill will againſt any of them, but from the
heart wiſh them all proſperity and peace, as well
in their temporall as ſpirituall affairs; yea, and
with all Chriſtian candor and clearneſſe of ſpirit,
ſhall upon all occaſions ſeek to promote them:
Onely, my ſoule hath no pleaſure in their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Office (ſuch as it is) into which the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Commiſſions (reſpectively) have temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, much leſſe in many ſtrains and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb facs="tcp:168452:3"/>
in their managing of it: yea, for thoſe of
them, who are known unto me, I believe them
to be men of conſcience and worth, fearing God,
and lovers of Truth, as far as God hath cauſed
the light thereof to ſhine in their hearts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings;
and for the reſt, I charitably hope
the ſame alſo. But as one obſerved, that <hi>etiam ex
timidiſſimis animalibus acris multitudo cogi poteſt,</hi>
ſome creatures that being very timerous and
fearfull, whileſt ſingle and alone, are yet daring
and fierce in herds and greater companies; ſo
frequent experience ſheweth, (and hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all ages) that many men, who <hi>diviſim</hi>
and apart are of a ſober and Chriſtian temper,
inclineable unto things that are honeſt, juſt
and good, yet <hi>conjunctim</hi> and in conſort,
prove boyſterous and peremptory, apt to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and led by oppreſſive counſels and principles
of much unworthineſſe. The reaſon whereof
may be, becauſe the guilt and ſhame of unworthy
doings being divided amongſt many, weigh but
light upon the apprehenſions and conſciences of
particulars; whereas in the mean time, the old
man, or the fleſh, in theſe particulars, may be as
much or more gratified by what is done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
and company, as by the ſame things, in caſe
they were tranſacted and done perſonally onely
and in particular, by the ſame men. I ſhall not
here inſiſt upon any explication of this reaſon, a
conſidering man will ſee enough to ſatisfie him
in this brief propoſall of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:168452:4"/>
Concerning the Perſons, by whoſe authority
the ſaid Commiſſions have iſſued, and been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
I have (I preſume) much leſſe need to
profeſſe the Chriſtian loyalty and intireneſſe of
my reſpects towards them, than the fairneſſe and
friendlineſſe of my ſpirit towards the other. The
proſperity and peace both of the Parliamentary
and preſent Government, together with theirs,
who are intruſted with it, have been the great
conteſt and ſtrife of my ſoul, both with God and
man, ever ſince the day wherein God laid the
foundations of it, and this againſt diſoblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not a few, nor inconſiderable. That I
ſpeak the truth in this, and ly not, I have many
witneſſes. But it hath been a kind of fatall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe
incident to the Rulers of the Earth
profeſſing Chriſtianity: whether out of their
zeal of God, without knowledge, or out of a
deſire to make their power (I mean their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or lawfull power) to be thought greater
than (indeed) it is; or elſe by the plauſible ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
and inſinuations, or by the importune
or minatory puttings on, or thruſtings forward of
others, who under a pretence, ſeek to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of their power, to be drawn into this ſnare,
Namely, to think it their duty, and a ſervice well
pleaſing unto God, to employ that Authority and
power which is veſted in them, for other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
about making, and enforcing by the civil
ſword additional Ordinances, Proviſions &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
as it were to ſupply that which is, or ſeems
<pb facs="tcp:168452:4"/>
to them to be, wanting in that ſyſtem or body of
Councells, Orders, and Directions, which the
Lord Chriſt himſelf hath drawn up, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto the Chriſtian world, to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
by thoſe who profeſſe the Goſpell, and
the true worſhip of God, for the beſt advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the intereſt of both amongſt men.
Whereas the truth is, that multiplications in
this kinde, and ſubſtractions, are of the ſame
demerit and provocation in the ſight of God,
and are accordingly cenſed and prohibited as it
were with the ſame breath by him, <hi>Ye ſhall not
adde unto the Word, which I command you, neither
ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keep
the Commandements of the Lord your God which I
command you</hi> (Deut. 4. 2.) This laſt clauſe,
<hi>That ye may keep,</hi> &amp;c. clearly importeth, that
when any thing is <hi>added</hi> [in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and appertaining to the conſcience) unto
the Word of God, it is as impedimental or
deſtructive to the keeping of <hi>Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as the taking away of any thing from it
would be Hereof I give ſome brief account
in theſe Papers. So elſe where: <hi>What thing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I command you, obſerve to do it; thou ſhalt
not adde thereto, nor diminiſh from it,</hi> Deut. 12. 32.
And <hi>Agurs</hi> advice by the Holy Ghoſt, is; <hi>Adde
thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee
[viz.</hi> by puniſhing thee in one kinde or other]
<hi>and thou be found a lyar</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 30. 6.</note> [meaning unto thy
ſelf, who promiſedeſt unto thy ſelf ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb facs="tcp:168452:5"/>
in the ſight of God for thy imaginary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in ſupplying that, which in thy conceit,
was wanting in his <hi>words,</hi> whereas thou reapeſt
his diſpleaſure by it.] This <hi>adding</hi> unto the
words of God, of which we now ſpeak, is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
(I conceive) termed, <hi>A turning aſide on
the right hand</hi> [from what God had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed]
as a taking away from theſe words, <hi>A tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
aſide to the left:</hi> And is voted by God
himſelf an enemy to the proſperity and peace
of men, as well as this. <hi>Turn not from it</hi> (ſaith
God to <hi>Joſhua</hi> concerning his Law) <hi>to the right
hand, or to the left, that thou maieſt proſper whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever
thou goeſt</hi> (Joſh. 1. 7.) Plainly imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that as well <hi>turning aſide on the right hand</hi>
[from the commands of God, by which I know
not, as was even now hinted, what can be
meant, but mens adding words and ordinances
of their own, to fill up that which they conceive
to be defective and empty in his] As <hi>turning
aſide on the left,</hi> is provoking in the ſight of God,
and obſtructive to the peace and comforts of

to deliberate: and ſo they become intangled
and enſnared in their own Counſels, and run to
confuſion. This is the expreſſe doom that in all
ages hath befallen Kings, and Princes, and States,
and Perſons in power, when they have lift up
their hearts in a conceit, as if that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

or of increaſe of guilt, they will turn unto thoſe

deſire and prayer unto God for them is, that he

(reſpectively) exerciſe over the Faith of that great

both the providence of God, and the faithfulneſſe of men le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally

Doubtleſſe the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> never took upon him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of any ſuch Authority, as to appoint a few men for
the deveſting of any ſort of men whatſoever, much leſſe the

onely becauſe their faith in matters appertaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, is not the ſame in all points with the faith of other
men.</p>
            <p>If it be replied, that neither ſort of Commiſſioners, Trier;
or Ejectors, are impowred by the tenor or words of their
Commiſſions, to puniſh any miniſter, either <hi>poenâ ſenſus,</hi> or
<hi>poenâ damni,</hi> ſimply for not believing, or (which is the ſame
in effect) for not profeſſing, or not teaching others to believe
as themſelves believe; ſo that when they do any ſuch thing as
this, they act beſides their Commiſſions. I anſwer, firſt, The
Commiſſioners themſelves, at leaſt ſuch of them as are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
knwon to underſtand their Commiſſions, as well as, or
rather better then, their fellowes, do ſo conſtrue and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them, as giving them power, both to reject, and eject
for not finding their own ſenſe and belief in thoſe, that come
before them. Secondly, Their frequent, if not conſtant,
practiſe in this kind, being ſufficiently known unto, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at, if not approved of, by thoſe under whoſe authority
and protection they thus practiſe, clearly ſheweth that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168452:9"/>
ſenſe intended, or at preſent owned, in both the Commiſſions
by thoſe who are in authority, and who have power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the ſenſe of either Commiſſion, is that which hath been
ſuppoſed in the argument, though depoſed, or denied, in the
reply.</p>
            <p>They who deviſe new ſtratagems,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> methods, or inventions
to aid the Goſpel, and to prevent dangers or in onveniencies
incident to it, beyond or beſides all that Chriſt either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
or directed to be done upon any ſuch account, or for
any ſuch end, do in effect deny what the holy Ghoſt expreſly
teſtifieth of him, <hi>viz that he was faithful to him that appointed
him</hi> [meaning, God the Father] <hi>as alſo Moſes was faithful
in all his houſe, Heb.</hi> 3. 2. For if it be ſuppoſed that the two
Commiſſions ſpecified, be advantagious and benedict to the
intereſt of the Goſpel, and that this is more like to run and
be glorified in the world, becauſe ſeconded and aſſiſted by
the ſaid Commiſſions, then was not Jeſus Chriſt faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God in all his houſe, neglecting or forgetting to give any
order to his Apoſtles or others concerning the levying or
ſetting on foot any ſuch meanes as theſe for the relief of the
Goſpel; nor is it eaſie to imagine (But much more difficult
is it to prove) when, unto whom, or by whom, Chriſt direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the making of any ſuch Evangelical engines, as either of
the ſaid Commiſſions are.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> being (as was ſaid) faithful,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as <hi>Moſes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
was, in all the houſe of God, and his wiſdome and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
every waies anſwerable to this his faithfulneſſe, it
cannot be conceived but that with his precepts, counſels, and
directions, for the advancement and proſperity of the Goſpel,
he hath taken up and filled the whol roomth or ſpace,
which is capable of receiving Injunctions, Orders, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in that kind So that no man can add, inſert or thruſt
in any thing byway of advice, or under the notion of a pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

juſtle or thruſt out, and (in our Saviours phraſe) make of
none effect, ſome or other of thoſe precepts, or directions,
which have been given by the Lord Chriſt himſelf, for the
ſame end. Even as the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot gratifie any new Saint
with a day in the Kalendar but onely either by turning ſome

of the more ancient out of their long-continued poſſeſſions,
or elſe by compelling them to take the other into part &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip

               </gap>on foot
any method, meanes, or device of theirs for the promoting
of this end, but by diſauthorizing, or with reflexion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement
upon, ſome or other, or all, of the ſaid preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Nor is it poſſible for any man to invent or
form any projection, or make any proviſion, which upon
a true account will be found in any degree materiall, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
for the welfare or ſucceſſe of the Goſpel, wherein
he hath not been prevented by the Great Authour and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Goſpel himſelf Otherwiſe it muſt be ſuppoſed
that men are, either (as hath been ſaid) wiſer then God,
and able to ſupply that, which hath been wanting in him; or
elſe that they are more ſollicitous and carefull over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Goſpell, more intent upon the ſalvation of
the precious ſoules of men, then He. Therefore the two
Commiſſions we implead, the one of Triers, the other of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,
being neither of them given in charge by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
for the promotion of the Goſpel nor holding any true or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
communion with any of his Orders in that behalfe, muſt
needs be of another Spirit and tendency from theſe, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
counter-workers, then co-workers with them: and
this experience it ſelf hath ſufficiently diſcovered.</p>
            <p>To entruſt an inconſiderable number of men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſubject to
the like errours, paſſions, weakneſſes, miſcarriages, with all
other men, with a negative vote, yea I had almoſt ſaid with
an affirmative alſo, in and about the placing and diſplac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and diſpoſing of all miniſters over all the reſpective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
(I mean Parochial) in a great nation, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chriſtian
and unheard of prodigie, and muſt needs be of a
ſad abode and portendance unto the people, eſpecially unto
the godly and well affected party of the people in that nation.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168452:10"/>
For by this meanes, in caſe the Triers ſhal at any time be fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
or ſhall upon any pretence bear a private grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a pariſh or congregation, or any conſiderable perſon,
whether for Religion, or otherwiſe, in it; or ſhall judge him
unſound in the faith, whom the congregation ſhall deſire
for their Miniſter, for ſome ſpecial opinion, one, or more,
for which (it is poſſible) the congregation may in ſpeciall
manner deſire him, and can deſire or admit of none that is
contrary-minded; in all theſe caſes (and poſſibly in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like) a congregation may never be permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
ſuch a Miniſter whom they can cordially reverence or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or by whom they can edifie, but muſt either be like ſheep
ſcattered, and in danger of being loſt for want of a ſhepherd,
or elſe content themſelves to be in ſubjection to ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in this great office, whom the Triers, <hi>pro libitu ſuo</hi> ſhall
obtrude upon them, be he never ſo froward, never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,
never ſo unſound in judgement, or ill-conditioned
otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid commiſſions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> eſpecially as they have been, and ſtill
are from time to time acted and adminiſtred, entrench upon
the ſpiritual rights and priviledges of the people of God. For
whereas they are inveſted by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> with a liberty or
power to chuſe for themſelves (and accordingly to enjoy
whilſt they pleaſe, and God give the opportunity) a ſpiritual
ſhepherd, a man to be over them in the Lord, and to take the
charge and care of their ſouls, the Commiſſioners we ſpeak
of take upon them by virtue of the ſaid Commiſſions, when,
and as oft as they pleſe, to keep aſunder thoſe whom God
would have joyned together, and diſgracefully reject and
thruſt by him, though never ſo worthy, whom the people
have greatly deſired, and accordingly choſen, to ſerve them
in that great work: and refuſe to grant the indulgence of
their paſſe, but unto ſuch who will ſwallow their camels, and
yea it, and nay it, with them from the one end of their faith
unto the other.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſion of Triers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſtrikes, though not formally
and directly, yet materially and in effect, at the civil Rights
both of many Pariſhes or bodies of people, and of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons likewiſe in the land, viz. all theirs, both in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168452:10"/>
the one kind and the other, who by law are inveſted with a
law-right of Preſentation unto Parochial demeſns, which are
called Benefices, or ſpiritual promotions. For though ſuch
Pariſhes and Perſons, ſtill may (and I ſuppoſe do) preſent
whom they judge meet, to ſuch preferments, yet the men of
their recommendation though never ſo deſerving, lye at the
mercy of the Triers whether they ſhall ever poſſeſſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
ſuch preferments collated upon them, or no. By means
whereof, as often as theſe Triers ſhall pleaſe to act their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in quarrelling and oppoſing the Clerk preſented unto them
by either of the ſaid Patrons (a practiſe whereof they are not
over-tender, whether there be any Chriſtian or reaſonable
cauſe for their ſo acting, or no) the Patrons are not ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
of thoſe accommodations, which the law intended
them in their right of preſentation: but this with diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reflection; and this both upon themſelves, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to gratifie and perfer unworthy men; and upon their
friends alſo, or perſons preſented by them, whom in ſuch
caſes, they caſt out as unſavoury ſalt upon the dunghil, good
for little but to be troden under foot by men. So that by means
of the Commiſſion we implead, and her ſons, the right and
priviledge, of preſenting is ſo far, in the practick &amp; exerciſe of
it, from being a royal priviledge, or matter of conveniency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men (as the law intended) that it is turned into a ſnare &amp;
occaſion of diſhonour &amp; trouble onely, both to themſelves, &amp;
thoſe whom they in ſpecial manner deſire to gratifie. Yea by
meanes of that power which is inveſted in the triers by their
Commiſſions, in conjunction with their intereſt, and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of working and bringing about their ends, they are found
(<hi>effective</hi>) the Patrons of all ſpirituall livings in the Nation;
and accordingly receive the tribute of thanks and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
due to Patrons and Benefactors (if no baſer

            <p>And whereas in the daies of Prelacy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> in caſe the Biſhops,
who were then the Triers, were at any time ſullen, or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

not the Commiſſions we ſpeak of, of this calculation? Do
they not ſet up a generation of men to be judges over thoſe,
who diſſent from them in ſome weighty matters of faith?
Or do not the men thus ſet up exerciſe a bloudy dominion
over their Adverſaries onely for diſſenting from them (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they nick-naming the ſame, call it, a diſſenting from
the Truth) dooming them and theirs from time to time,
with the Prophet <hi>Micaiahs</hi> doom) to <hi>be fed with the bread of
affliction, and water of affliction,</hi> or to ſuffer cold, hunger, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs

            <p>To ſpread ſnares and temptations in the way of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
ſo as to expoſe them to danger of pollution and
defilement, and of offering violence to themſelves, is not
conſiſtent with a good conſcience in any man, or with the
approved principles of Chriſtianity. <hi>But judge this rather, that
no man put a stumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in his brothers
way,</hi> Rom. 14 27. Now whether the men armed with the
power and authority of the two Commiſſions proteſted, do
not either by vertue, or colour, of the ſaid Commiſſions
frequently perpetrate and practice the ſaid high unchriſtian
miſdemeanor, I could be content to make themſelves judges,
if they would but make their own proceedings the law, and
rule of their ſentence. For 1. is not the ſimple profeſſing
and owning of thoſe great and important truths of God that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed, or <hi>gave himſelf a ranſome for all men</hi> (as the
Scripture ſaith) that God reprobated no man under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
conſideration, nor intended ſo to reprobate any man,
from eternity, that he vouchſafeth a ſufficiency of means
unto all men whereby to repent and be ſaved, that he neither
conſtraineth, nor neceſſitateth, any man to believe, or to be
ſaved, that thoſe who at preſent truly believe, may put [or
thruſt] away a good conſcience from them, and hereby
make ſhipwreck of their Faith, and periſh; is not (I ſay)
the profeſſing and owning of theſe moſt worthy truths (with
others confederate with them) a bar againſt all ſpirituall
or eccleſiaſtick promotion in the courſe and proceſſe of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168452:12"/>
their conſiſtory? And may not thieves and murderers as
ſoon (or ſooner) purchaſe the ſeal of their approbation,
and (<hi>ſolutis ſolvendis</hi>) obtain their paſſe unto any benefice, or
augmentation, as men whoſe faces are but ſet towards any
the ſaid Tenents, though otherwiſe never ſo ſignally <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
both with moralls and intellectualls for the Miniſtry?
Again 2 is it not their guiſe and manner to ſcrue and dive
as far and as deep as they know how, into the judgements
and conſcience of thoſe who come before them (at leaſt if
they be not known vaſſalls to their ſenſe in the points men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

touch or tincture (at leaſt) of ſome propenſion or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

(they and theirs) by theſe conſiſtorian judges, to
the ſpade, or flail, or elſe to cleaneſs of teeth, or begging
their bread where they can finde it. So that when young
men who are fair for preferment, &amp; want nothing but theſe
mens, good will in wax and paper to the poſſeſſion and
enjoyment of it, ſhall come before them, knowing that they
are not like to be ſupplyed with that which they want in
this caſe, but by a profeſsed diſowning thoſe great truths of
God [lately ſpecified] let the regret of their judgements and
conſciences in the act be never ſo ſtrong, are they not now
under a ſore temptation, and hard to be reſiſted by fleſh and
bloud, to diſſemble both with God and man, and to pollute
their conſciences, in caſe they ſtand inwardly convinced of
the clearneſs of thoſe truths, which they are thus ſorely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
openly to renounce and diſclaim? And may not ſuch
faultring and diſſembling with God as this, prove, yea hath
it not oft proved, of that ſad conſequence, as to occaſion ſuch
a breath between him, and his creature, as was never repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
afterwards? Woe to ſuch a generation of men that
ſhall ſpread ſuch ſnares of death, lay ſuch ſtumbling blocks,
as theſe in their Brethrens way. If they ſtumble and fall by
them, ſhall not their bloud be required at their hands? Or

            <p>According to the beſt principles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> policy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> ſuch

in the Lords harveſt, which the Lord of the harveſt thruſts

ſuch authority or power, by which they ſhall be enabled to
do this great diſſervice both unto God and men. But ſuch
are the Perſons, at leaſt the far greater part of them (and
ſuch were they before their intruſtment) who by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
aforeſaid, are made the authorized Judges of the
judgements of all the Miniſters (at leaſt of all the publick
Miniſters) of the Nation; they are, and were, by a true and
ſolid eſtimate of them (in reſpect of their ſpirit, principles,

preſcribe unto God and Jeſus Chriſt, who, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of perſons they ſhould do well to authorize and imploy
in the publick Miniſtry in this Nation; and again, who, and
what manner of perſons it would be expedient for them to
reject and put by from that imployment; but further, more
generally to recommend and order unto them (that I ſay
not, obtrude upon them) for the ſervice, men far leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,
than many of thoſe, whom they (God I mean, and
the Lord Chriſt) recommend daily, and providentially ſend
unto them for their approbation, and yet are diſallowed
and rejected by them. For certainly they who know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and believe, and are excellently qualified to teach
the juſt compaſs and extent of the Grace [or free Grace]
of God in the Death and Goſpell of his Son (and ſo are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform

and conſiſtent in their teachings) other endowments,
as of meekneſs, humility, love, zeal, good will to the work
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> concurring, are perſons more competent for the work of
the miniſtry, than thoſe, who confining the ſaid Grace of
God within the narrow ſphere of their own apprehenſions,
are hereby inevitably entangled in the courſe of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
ſo as ever and anon to pull down, what even now they
built up; and again, preſently to build up, what a very

ſuch the principles and Tenents of the men now under cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
(and the nature and property of all theſe accordingly
might eaſily have been known by thoſe who put them into
Commiſſion, before this grand and unhappy overſight was
committed) that they take themſelves bound in conſcience

from time to time permitted to ſtretch it ſelf beyond the line
of its original grant, and ſo by degrees to ſwell and grow out
of all ſhape, to a prodigeous kinde of enormity, it is apt to
become unweildy and unruly in his hand that holds it, and
to teach him things that are exorbitant and uncomely: Yea
he that underſtands himſelf armed with power incompetent
for men, greater then ſubjection to give an account of its
actings unto any man, is not like to be far from ſuch
an intoxication, which inclines men to think that they are
ſome Demi-gods, &amp; that it is but reaſon that both the natural
and civill rights and priviledges, and comforts, yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
alſo of other men, ſhould be ſacrificed upon the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of their intereſt, or pleaſure onely. It is generally known
what monſtrous and blaſphemous conceits with practices ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
the overgrown power claimed and exerciſed by the
Pope, hath dictated unto him, and ingaged him to juſtifie
and maintain. And is not the power, claimed and acted by
the Triers, whether by vertue of their foundation, or by
the underhand indulgence and connivence of their founders,
very ſuperlative, and of the houſe and lineage of the Papall?
The Popes (ſaith <hi>Thuanus</hi>) held it for a principle inviolable
not to confeſſe themſelves to err in any thing: and Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
made a Decree, That none preſume to reprehend his
judgment, nor to judge of it: It hath been a long time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon the world, to believe the infallibility of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Chair. The abſolute anomie and lawleſneſſe of the
Pope is ſuch, or claimed for ſuch, that no man may judge of
him, no man may diſpute of his judgement, or call it in
queſtion, though he draw millions of ſouls with him into hell.
When the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to reform the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
of the Pope, and began to enquire of them, Anſwer was
made by all here, that the Apoſtolique See being the head of
all Churches, ought to be judged of none; eſpecially, not by
a lay man. <hi>The ſpirituall man judgeth all things, but he himſelf
is judged of no man,</hi> is pleaded for the Popes priviledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168452:14"/>
from all cenſure or queſtion. The Popes in their
Decretals and Canoniſts, arrogate and aſſume to themſelves
<hi>plenitudinem poteſtatis &amp; ſcientiae;</hi> and teach that they have
one and the ſame tribunall with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> They
ſuffer none to buy or ſell (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe that wonder after them, or that have the mark, or
the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his name. Is there not
an eye of theſe principles, practiſes, and uſurpations in the
ſpirits and practiſes of our Tryers? If any Miniſter that
comes before them ſhall diſpute, or call into queſtion their
judgments, though never ſo erroneous and deſtructive to the
precious ſouls of men (as in the points of Election, Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the death of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is he not made a grand delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
for ſo doing, and the doore of preferment, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi>
ſhut up with bars of Iron againſt him? If any man wonders
not after them and their leanring and tenents, do they not
preſently ſet the black brand of their Reprobation upon him,
and interdict him all communion in all Eccleſiaſticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where they have to do? And as the Popes paraſites have
a ſaying in gratification of their great Maſter and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>What the Pope doth, is done;</hi> meaning, is ſo done, as not
to be reverſed or undone by any authority whatſoever; ſo
are the proceedings of theſe men in their lawleſſe Conſiſtory;
ſo auto-cratoricall and ſacred, that they magnifie themſelves
againſt all appeal and reverſall by men If they ſhut, no man
can open. Now their power, whether by inveſtiture, Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
or connivance, being thus vaſt, and diſproportioned
to the weakneſſe and obnoxiouſneſſe of fleſh and blood, it is
no otherwiſe like, but that it ſhould miſcarry in the exerciſe
of it, and be found treacherous and diſloyall to the intereſt
and comforts of thoſe, who are ſubject unto it, unto whom
notwithſtanding it oweth the beſt of its ſervice and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
And is not the generation of Tryers accordingly
troubleſome and burdenſome with their power, to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of the Nation; yea to far the greater part of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
godly and well affected here? Do they not uſe it to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and maintaining of parties and factions, to the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and multiplying of diſciples to themſelves, to the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
themſelves upon their enemies (ſo ſuppoſed by them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168452:15"/>
for not ſubjecting their judgements and conſciences unto
them) to the ingratiating of themſelves with ſome men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
and trampling others under their feet? Do they
not uſe it to the wringing and ſtraining of many mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
by impoſing the bloudy law of a neceſſity upon
them, either to praiſe their ſayings and commend them for
orthodox, by profeſſing themſelves of the ſame ſenſe and
judgement with them (though they be really and inwardly
of an other) or elſe to feell the weight of their loyns, and
to be caſt into their hell fire, where there is weeping and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for want of bread, and other things needfull for the
life of man? Yea do they not uſe it to the ſpiritual affami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
and ſtarving of ſome pariſhes by obſtructing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
and acceſſe of ſuch worthy perſons, onely becauſe
they are not of their faction and party, who are deſigned for
the feeding of them with the bread of life, by thoſe, who
judge themſelves bound in conſcience, according to their
truſt by law, to make proviſion for them in this kinde? The
day would fail me to rehearſe and inſiſt upon all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of the irregular and erroneous deportments of perſons
lifted up to a height of power, above what their heads and

            <p>The Goſpel ſtands in no need of any commiſſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of humane deviſe or contrivance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> to promote or
carry on the intereſt of it in the world. The fervent and
conſtant prayers of the Saints, with their proper fruits and
effects, thorough the gracious audience and condeſcention of
God vouchſafed unto them, are ſufficient to render the ſtate
and condition of the Goſpel flouriſhing and proſperous on
the earth; at leaſt in conjunction with the obſervance of
ſuch other Orders and Directions, as the Lord Chriſt hath
plainly and in perſpicuous terms left us in the Goſpel, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Labourers thruſt forth into the Lords harveſt, will, through
the ordinary bleſſing of God upon their labours, advance
the intereſt of the Goſpel amongſt men, as our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in this paſſage of Scripture clearly ſuppoſeth; becauſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168452:15"/>
otherwiſe it were not worth the while to pray for their thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
forth, as viz. in caſe their thruſting forth were like
to turn to no account either of glory unto God, or benefit
and bleſſing unto men. And yet we ſee that Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
no other courſe or means for the obtaining of this
high favour from God, but prayer onely: therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this is ſufficient for the obtaining of it at his hand.
By the way; our Triers are ſo far from being co-workers,
or co-actors with God in his gracious act of thruſting forth
labourers into his harveſt, that they are counter-workers
againſt him many times, and when he thruſts forth labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
indeed, they thruſt them back, thruſting loiterers and
unworthy men upon him in their ſtead. And doubtleſſe the
Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who when time was, deſired nothing in this
world (at leaſt comparatively) before his departure from
it, but onely to <hi>ſee that fire kindled which he came to ſend on
the earth,</hi> (Luke 12. 49.). <hi>i.</hi> To ſee the Goſpel (as it were) to
have gotten ſome footing, and taken ſome good hold in the
world, was ſollicitous and provident enough by himſelf, or
by his Apoſtles (at leaſt) to order and enjoyn all things
neceſſary or meet for the propagation and ſpreading of it
upon terms of the beſt advantage after him, and not to
leave ſo important an affair to the umpirage, care, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of the ſecular powers; yea, the truth is, and the
experience of many ages hath demonſtrated it, that as for
men to blend the grace and merits of Chriſt with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of the law and their own works, for the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and obtaining of juſtification, is a certain way or
means never to be juſtified (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4.) in like manner
for men, whoever they be, to compound the wiſedome,
counſells and inſtitutions of Chriſt for the advancement of
the Goſpell in the world, with their own deviſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
and ſo to incumber and intangle them, is the next
way to obſtruct the courſe of the Goſpell, and to keep it
from running ſo as to be glorified in the world. And yet
the profeſſing powers of this world, have in all times had
itching deſires to be officious unto Jeſus Chriſt in this kinde,
and to obtrude upon him their own projections and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to accommodate and help him through the world with

power Rulers cannot be, which is not veſted in them by God,
or nature. And if any people ſhould derive (or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
or declare to derive) unto their Prince or chief Ruler,
whom they ſet over them, any ſuch power, which they have
not themſelves, either formally, or eminently, their act
of delegation or derivation in this kinde is null and void;
as any donation of what is not the givers own, or which he
hath no right to give, is a nullity, and nothing paſſeth to
another by vertue of it. And yet more evident it is, that chief
Rulers and Magiſtrates have no right of claim to any ſuch
authority, nor can with a good conſcience exerciſe or act
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168452:16"/>
any ſuch power or Authority, which never was conferred,
nor intended to be conferred upon them, by their people.
Now 1. certain it is that no body (much leſs any politick
or civill body) or community of people, hath any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or power from God, either by the law of nature, or
otherwiſe, to eſtabliſh any ſuch Rule or law, one, or more,
amongſt them, no not by or with the univerſall conſent of
every individual member of this body, according unto which
they ſhall all ſtand bound to believe every man the ſame
things with an other in all points of Chriſtian Religion, or
that any one mans judgement, or the judgement of any
number of men amongſt them, ſhall be the ſtandard unto
which all the reſt ſhall conform their judgements in matters
of Faith or worſhip, or elſe incurre ſome civill puniſhment.
The reaſon is, becauſe God never gives a power unto any
man, or any number of men, to enſlave or ſubject the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of men in matters appertaining unto himſelf, either
unto themſelves &amp; their judgement, or unto any others; or to
inflict any civill mulct or puniſhment upon any man, for
thinking that they are miſtaken in ſome of their Tenents
concerning God, and Chriſt, and conſequently that he
ought to diſſent from them. God reſerves the legiſlative
power over the conſciences of men unto himſelf alone: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in caſe any people ſhould conferre, or do what lies
in them to conferre, ſuch a power as this upon their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Magiſtrate or Ruler, this Magiſtrate or Ruler ſhould
have no right at all, either to own, or exerciſe this power,
notwithſtanding the intended collation of it upon them by
his people. Yet a It is at no hand probable, nor have I ſo
much as ever heard, or read, it inſiſted upon, or pleaded,
by the Rulers in chief in this Nation, or on their behalf,
that the people of this land ever gave unto them, or inveſted
in them, any ſuch power as that now declared, <hi>viz</hi> whereby
they might inveſt any one, or more of their ſubjects (much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
of forreigners or ſtrangers) with power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to mold and form the judgements and conſciences of their
fellow ſubjects in matters of faith, or (which is the ſame)
to inflict any civill mulct or puniſhment, or to ſet any brand
of publick infamy and reproach upon them, as by exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168452:17"/>
them as unworthy, from places of publick truſt, yea from
all means of livelihood and ſubſiſtance, of which they are (in
an ordinary way) capable, and ever likely to obtain, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot ſet their judgements by theirs, or make
one lip with them in ſome controverted points of <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Religion. Therefore the Commiſſion, by vertue or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
wherof our <hi>Triers</hi> (and there is not a much differing
conſideration of their Brethren in iniquity, our <hi>Ejectors,</hi> and
their Commiſſion) ſell their Brethren (many of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
not inferiour in any point of Chriſtian worth to the beſt
of themſelves) into the hand of poverty and diſgrace, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe they will not proſtitute their judgements to the
luſt and ambition of theirs, ſtands not upon any regular
foundation of power or authority: nor is there any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or number of perſons under heaven, competent or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualified to enjoyn ſuch an execution of this Commiſſion,
as that, which that occupied part of our Triers, who keep
the ſtage, lift up their hearts and hands unto from time to
time, and are more (it is greatly feared) than connived
at, by thoſe who have power to reſtrain them from their
evill.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Inquiſition accuſeth aloud the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of cruelty and bloud,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> and ſo of a pregnant and fiery
antipathy to the Genius and ſpirit of the Goſpell, which
magnifie themſelves in their high attempts of working the
hearts and ſpirits of men to all meekneſs, ſweetneſs, and
love. If ſo much of the Commiſſion of Triers, wherein no
ſon thereof is named, is ſo far innocent, as not to fimbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
with the ſpirit or Genius of the ſaid Inquiſition, yet
the names of ſome of the Children in the womb of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged
that by ſuch an interpretation as they meant to give
unto it in their way of execution, they would reduce it to a
near affinity therewith. And what the names perſaged,
the men have effected and brought to paſſe (yea it ſeems
that the minde and intent, whether Antecedent, or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
or both, of thoſe who armed them with that power
and authority, by which they act ſo Inquiſition, like, that not
milk to milk, not egge to egg, more like, was. I wiſh I
could ſay, but is not, that they ſhould underſtand their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168452:17"/>
to ſignifie as much as they practice.) For what do the
bloudy Fathers of the Inquiſition more than feed men better,
and more orthodox and ſound in the Faith, than themſelves,
with the bread of ſore affliction, under the pretence of hereſie
and dangerouſneſſe of opinion? And what do our Conſiſtory,
or Inquiſition of Triers yea of Ejectors alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leſſe? Do they
not from time to time (in effect) grinde the faces, and
break the bones of men of ſignall piety and worth, who
know more of God, and of his Goſpell, and Grace here,
than themſelves, under a pretence of errour, unſoundneſſe
in Doctrine, holding dangerous Opinions, and ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating
and unchriſtian imputations? Do they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſuch perſons with their wives and children, and all
depending on their hand for outward ſupplies, to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of all extremities of hunger, cold, nakedneſſe, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
ignominy, diſgrace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by thruſting them back in
a contumelious and diſgracefull manner, from ſuch live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
and means of ſubſiſtance, which both God and man
had agreed to provide for them, and beſtow upon them;
and this onely for not complying with the luſts of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and ambition, and not imbaſing their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by profeſſing the ſame profeſſion of an erroneous and
miſgrounded Faith with them? For let this be but done,
the men are ſatisfied and overcome, the door of entrance
is opened immediately: and let the Clerk or Regiſter be
but a little over-conſidered, the <hi>Dedimus poteſtatem</hi> will be
given with the heaped meaſure of expedition.</p>
            <p>When the trees of the forreſt (in <hi>Jothams</hi> parable) went
forth to annoint a King over them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> the Olive-tree, the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
and the Vine, refuſed the honour, though offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, alleadging, that if they ſhould accept it, they
muſt part with their ſeverall ſerviceableneſſes (reſpectively)
both unto God and men, which they pleaded was not meet
for them to do. Onely when the trees came to the Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and made their motion unto it, the Bramble accepted
it, but withall enjoyned them (Prince-like) to put their
truſt in his ſhadow; threatening them, that if they ſhould
not, <hi>fire</hi> would <hi>come out of the Bramble, and devoure the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars
of Lebanon.</hi> The honour (ſuch as it is) which is dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168452:18"/>
by the two Commiſſions of <hi>Triers</hi> and <hi>Ejectors,</hi> was
not proper to be entertained by men, who were conſcious
of any uſefulneſſe in themſelves for the ſervice, either of
God or man, unleſſe they mean to part with it, and take
this honour in exchange for it. Nor was it like to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
but onely by <hi>Brambles,</hi> who had a minde to ſcratch,
and rend, and tear the fleſh, of thoſe who ſhould come
near them, and withall refuſe to put their truſt in their
ſhadow, [I mean in their learning and judgement touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matters of Faith] And there is a fire come out from
theſe brambles, [the Conſiſtory of Triers, and Conſiſtory
of Ejectors.] which hath <hi>devoured the Cedars of Lebanon:</hi>
they have conſumed and undone perſons of eminent growth
and ſtature in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> worth and excellency; and if
their Kingdome be continued unto them, are like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
more. Men of Chriſtian and ſweet principles would
have bethought themſelves of better opportunities for the
exerciſe and improvement of them, than a fitting upon a
Conſiſtorian throne to the great grievance and offence (in
a manner) of a whole Nation, and for the ſelling of their
Brethren into the hand of poverty, diſgrace, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of miſery, and this for no other crime or miſdemeanor,
than this conceit of their own, that their Brethrens Faith
in ſome points (and theſe by their own confeſſion, very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
myſterious, and abſtruſe) is not ſo good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
as theirs. Men of modeſt and Chriſtianly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
ſpirits would never endure it, that their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
ſome of them (it may be) every waies? equall to the
beſt of themſelves, ſhould take long, weariſome, and chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
journies, from the remoteſt part of the land to give
attendance upon them, ſitting upon their ſeats of honour,
and with patience, reverence and ſubmiſſion, to wait
their leiſure and pleaſure, (I know not how long) for the
diſpatch of their occaſions, yea the leiſure and pleaſure of
their underlings, whether Regiſter, Clarks, or by what other
name they call them.</p>
            <p>No argument that yet hath been, or (there is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground to believe) can be alledged for the neceſſity of
that eſtabliſhment of <hi>Triers,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> which hath been hitherto oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168452:18"/>
is much conſiderable. For what reaſon can there be for
any neceſſity to exchange or put by ſuch a way or method,
which is generally known, for another, which beſides that
it threatens a diſturbance and diſcontent through the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of it, is not like to obviate or prevent thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
that are ſometimes found in the former, unleſſe
it be with introducing or occaſioning greater in their ſtead?
For what if Patrons of benefices, whether parochiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
or ſingle perſons, have ſometimes recommended
or preſerted unworthy men to ſome of theſe places, have
not the Triers been as great or greater Delinquents in this
kinde, as they? Have not they approved of, and given
wings unto birds of as unclean a feather, as any that were
wont to fly from the others hand? I alwaies judged it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
a ſpirit of ingenuity to hold intelligence with any
man for information of the ſiniſter, and undue practices of
men, or to give encouragement unto thoſe, who love to be
the meſſengers of ſuch tidings; nor did I ever beſtow the
fourth part of an hour in following the ſcent of any report
I have occaſionally met with concerning the Triers, and
their unhandſome and un hallowed doings in their way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have met with many in this kinde: Nor have I
kept a Regiſter either with my pen or memory, of ſuch ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Onely I cannot but be ſenſible of the ſmart, which
ever and anon I ſuffer, with having both my ears beaten
with the loud complaints, clamours, and out-cries, which
I hear from many of their <hi>tranſeats</hi> or paſſe-ports granted to
the firſt-born of undeſerving men, and of their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
in the mean time to perſons excellently qualified, and
commended unto them by God, as well as by men, for that
great work of the miniſtry. In this latter, they are much
more irregular and obnoxious, than the other Patrons we
ſpake of; yea, even when they ſtumble at the ſtone of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
preſentations. For though in theſe caſes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves amiſſe in helping Chaplains, taken out the
Devils ſchool, to imployment in Gods houſe; yet do they
not (thus far) contumeliouſly entreat more deſerving men,
nor obſtruct their way to any preferment, unto which God
hath called them. Therefore they are much leſſe peccant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168452:19"/>
of the two, than our Commiſſioned Triers. The truth is,
the generality of the Triers, being men bent in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and deſires to promote a faction under the name
and pretence of countenancing Orthodox Doctrine, and to
ſuppreſſe all of a contrary judgement to themſelves as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
men, corrupt and dangerous in their principles <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
it was none otherwiſe like from the beginning, but that
they would ſteer that crooked courſe, which now they have
ſteered; and that they would ſhine the light of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
upon men of the greateſt demerit otherwiſe, if they
were right for the deſign; eſpecially if it ſhould ſo fall out
(as I ſuppoſe it hath done) that men of a more regular
behaviour and better fame, ſhould not come in unto them
faſt enough, to compleat the number of Diſciples, and to
augment the party to their minde.</p>
            <p>If it be argued on the behalf of the Commiſſion, that it is
neither meet in point of conſcience or Religion, nor yet
prudentiall or ſafe in point of policy, that all Patrons, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
for ſuch by the law, ſhould be ſuffered to prefer
to the work of the miniſtry, in all places where they have
to do, whom, or what manner of perſons they pleaſe. For
by this means a great part of the Parochicall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the land ſhould (in all likelihood) have either Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,
or ignorant, or ungodly, or malignant perſons ſet
over them in the work of the Lord: the ſad conſequence
whereof is every mans apprehenſion. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That in the caſe in hand, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb is of too
commodious an application; <hi>The remedy is worſe than the
diſeaſe.</hi> For by means of the Commiſſion, and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
operating together, not onely a great part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
of the Nation are miniſterially ſupplyed with perſons
of all, or the moſt of, thoſe evill characters mentioned in
the plea, but many of them are defrauded alſo, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
of men of Chriſtian worth and choicely qualified
for the office and work of the miniſtry, whom God had
graciouſly provided for them, and men worſe than barely
inſufficient obtruded upon them in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>2. To prevent the dangers and inconveniences inſiſted on
in the argument, it is no waies neceſſary; either the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168452:19"/>
miſſioners ſhould be entruſted with the inſpection of
the buſineſs throughout the whole Nation, or that
thoſe that now occupie the places of Commiſſioners,
ſhould put no difference between the vile, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
but joyn both together in their decrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
if yet they do not put an unnaturall and
left-handed difference between them, reſpecting the
<hi>vile</hi> many times more than the <hi>precious,</hi> and making
reprobates of theſe, when they approve of the other.
And doubtleſſe it had been a courſe much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
a prevention of thoſe evills, which the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſuggeſts and inſinuates, to have framed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Triers, according to the modell and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Commiſſion for Ejectors, and to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
men for that ſervice in each County, (reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.)
So ſhould the grandure of their authority
and power have been ſome what more competent and
tolerable, and not ſo hyper-archepiſcopall, ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metropolitan
and Roming as now it is. And (as
hath heen already offered to conſideration) a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of power, for the moſt part acquits it ſelf with
more diligence and faithfulneſs, than an extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and exceſſe. A cup that is filled to the brim, is
hardly carried without ſpilling. Beſides the device
of Triers, had it diſtributed it ſelf into the reſpective
Counties, had been leſſe burdenſome by many degrees
unto thoſe, who live in the remote parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when their occaſions ſhould neceſſitate them to do
their homage of attendance unto them.</p>
            <p>3. In caſe a project of trying all that ſhould: paſſe
into the publick miniſtry of the Nation, be judged
neceſſary to keep the people of the land free from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by their Teachers, as by drinking in doctrines
dangerous, either to the ſoul, or to the ſtate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168452:20"/>
Government, the work is more proper for the
congregated Churches through the Nation, than for
a petty handfull of Clergy men (as they are called)
unto whom alone it is now upon the matter devolved
(and was like to be from the beginning) ſitting in
one angle onely of the Nation: Yea, and was much
more like to proſper in the hand of the former, than
of the latter. For beſides that the holy Ghoſt made
uſe of Churches, not of Clergy men, to ſend forth
men to preach the Goſpell, <hi>Act. 11. 22. Act.</hi> 13. 4. here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
declaring it to be a work more proper for them;
Churches are like, Firſt to be more conſiderate in what
they ſhould do in this kinde, than the ſealed knot of
<hi>Triers;</hi> theſe all being but a few, and making but one
Conſiſtory, and ſo the whole buſineſſe of trying
throughout the Nation lying on their hand, are in no
capacity (eſpecially meeting ſo ſeldome conſiſtory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
as they do) to allow a meet proportion of time
for the regular traverſing of matters committed unto
them, at leaſt not without conſtraining many of their
Suitors to dance a troubleſome and burthenſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon them for their diſpatch; whereas the
Churches being many, the work and buſineſſe of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being diſtributed amongſt them (as it is like it
would be, in caſe it were committed unto them)
would have leiſure to make a due inquiry into matters
that ſhould come before them, and this without any
tedious or chargeable delay unto the Perſons. 2. It is
like the Churches would be more faithfull in the tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
of the affair, as being leſſe under tentation or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
inducements to miſcarry, or act unworthily. They
in their reſpective communities or bodies, have no
relations of dependances upon, or expectations from,
Great men, nor are like to be ſwayed by recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
or other applications of Perſons claiming
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168452:20"/>
intereſt in them. How of the Triers have daſhed their
foot at theſe, and ſuch like ſtones, is known unto, and
lamented by many. Thirdly, neither are the Church-bodies
accompliſhed with any ſuch politick reaches,
deep methods, or ſubtil, contrivancies for the
bringing about ſecular projects, or by-ends, as our
<hi>Triers</hi> are Neither (indeed) are they in reſpect of their
numbers, and complicated variety of intereſts and
conditions in their reſpective members, very capable
of conſpiring or combinging ſo much as in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
of any unworthy or undue ends to themſelves;
and in theſe reſpects are like to be more ſincere and
plain hearted in their proceedings, than they. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Churches being of different judgements touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcipline and worſhip, and ſome other opinions
much controverted and debated amongſt godly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and worthy men in the Nation, may amongſt
them, and this with a full concurrence and conſent
of their judgements, and without the leaſt regret or
check of conſcience, accommodate all pious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons of what judgement ſoever otherwiſe, in
all their juſt deſires or requeſts. Whereas indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and wrath againſt men diſſenting in judgement
from them, have lac'd the conſciences of our Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſo ſtrait, that themſelves profeſſe, they are not
at liberty, they cannot without ſin open the door of
entrance into the miniſtry unto any man, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
never ſo well qualified thereunto, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto thoſe, whoſe thoughts are their thoughts,
and who can make one ſpirit of judgement with them
all along in the matters of Chriſtian Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Fifthly (and laſtly) the Churches are by
the good providence of God, commodiouſly diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(as hath been lately hinted) through the Nation,
for perſons from all quarters thereof to repain unto
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168452:21"/>
one or other of them, without the trouble or charge
of any tedious and long journey: Whereas our Engliſh
Inquiſitors [ſirnamed, Triers] having their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Audience fixed ſome hundreds of miles from
the skirts and frontiers of the Nation (in ſeverall parts
of it) impoſe an hard neceſſity (differing little from
a formall oppreſſion) upon all the candidate Miniſter
of theſe parts) who muſt, by order of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
paſſe thorough their Purgatory, or elſe never
come at the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields of a fair benefice) to take
journies ſo longſome, weariſome, and expenſive, to
come at them, that it may be a matter of doubtfull
diſputation, whether the ſweet of the enjoyment of
a good Benefice, or the ſowre of getting acceſſe to it,
be preponderant.</p>
            <p>4. If a triall of miniſters before admiſſion to a place of
publick ſervice, be admitted as neceſſary, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God in the nation not deemed competent to take,
or make, a regular triall of them, yet why ſhould not
thoſe, who are authorized as competent for the
ordination, or creation of miniſters, be judged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
for their triall? Or is it any good harmony
in reaſon, either that they who are judged meet to
be inveſted with the office of a miniſter, ſhould not
without a new and further triall, be entruſſted with
the work of a miniſter? Or that they, who are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſufficient and meet to try men in reference to the
former, ſhould not be as ſufficient for their triall in
reference to the latter? What need was there then of
our new Colledge of Triers, the erection wherof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the irregular deportments of the maſters
of it, hath (I dare ſay) more diſaffected the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Nation, and more eſpecially of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
party of it, to the preſent Government, than any
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168452:21"/>
other State tranſaction whatſoever. Nor do I know
any one Act beſides, whereby the Government is more
like to commend it ſelf unto the people (eſpecially the
people of God) in the land, than by plucking up by
roots, that which hath been ſo unhappily planted.
But,</p>
            <p>5. If neither Churches, nor Presbyteries, be wood of
which to make the <hi>Mercury</hi> of Trying, yet why might
not this image have been carved in ſmoother timber,
and of a better grain, than that, wherein it is now
formed? Why ſhould the children of great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,
and ſuch who pretend their judgements be
fairer than the moon, without ſpot, or ſtain of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or miſtake; who cannot with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
give the Lord Chriſt in his ſervants any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
quarter, unleſſe he will declare for them,
and their opinions, who ſpread ſnares of death in
mens way, and (Sathan-like) tempt men to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to their own judgements and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and ſo to condemn themſelves in that which
they do allow, who count the cruſhing of godly
men, to be godlineſs, if they underſtand more than
themſelves in the things of God; why (I ſay)
ſhould men of this mold, rather than any other, be
the proper materiall of which to form the Trier?
Is no vein of men meet to make <hi>Triers,</hi> but they
that can perſecute the innnocent and harmleſs with
a good, conſcience, and think they do God ſervice,
when they keep out of his vineyard, thoſe which he
ſends to labour in it, and who are like to make the
beſt and faithfuleſt labourers here?</p>
            <p>6. Why the reſpective Congregations in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould not be allowed Triers of thoſe, that
are to ſerve them in the work of the miniſtry, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168452:22"/>
to whom, upon that account, they are to allow
maintenance, I believe no reaſon, that will hold
water better than a Sieve, can be given; eſpecially
if it be but granted withall, that they are in a
capacity to have Miniſters over them, or (which is
tantamont) that they are in duty bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them. For if it be againſt reaſon that the
State, or civill Magiſtrate, ſhould be any law, or
Edict, reſtrain men from hiring or entertaining
ſuch ſervants for their civill or domeſtick affairs, which
they judge are like to prove moſt ſerviceable and
uſefull unto them in theſe, or to appoint others to
aſſign them what ſervants in this kinde they pleaſe;
much more unreaſonable is it, that greater bodies
or ſocieties of men ſhould not be permitted to have
ſuch to ſerve them in their ſpirituall affairs, whom
(upon adviſe and conſultation had with thoſe,
whom they judge moſt faithfull unto them, and
beſt able to give adviſe in ſuch caſes) they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and conſcienciouſly perſwaded are moſt like to
build them up in the ſound and ſaving knowledge
of God, and to promote the intereſt of their ſouls;
eſpecially it being pretended or alledged (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
ſubmitted freely unto by them) that
they are bound to maintain thoſe, that ſhall miniſter
unto them in this kinde. And as the Magiſtrate is
no waies acceſſary unto, or reſponſible for, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or weakneſſe of ſuch a man, who ſhall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
entertain a negligent or unfaithfull ſervant, by
whom he is much endammaged in his outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
but in caſe he had a ſervant authoritatively
obtruded by the Magiſtrate upon him, by whom he
ſhould ſuffer in this kinde, the Magiſtrate were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chargeable here: In like manner when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
ſhall be permitted either the choice, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168452:22"/>
allowance, of their Miniſter, themſelves onely (with
ſuch their Miniſter) are culpable for what ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
danger or detriment ſoever they ſhall incurre and
ſuſtain, either by his inability for, or unfaithfulneſs in,
his work; but in caſe the Magiſtrate ſhall take this
power from them, and will not ſuffer them to be
the approvers or allowers of their Miniſters, but
will by his power take this upon himſelf, now in
what kinde or degree ſoever, the people ſhall ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſuffer or miſcarry, either by the ignorance
or inſufficiency, or by the negligence or unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of him that teacheth them, the Magiſtrate is
juſtly chargeable before God with it. Nor doth his
guilt, or crime, in this caſe, lie in this, that he
was deceived or miſtaken in the man, whom he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the people to receive for their Miniſter, but in
this rather, that voluntarily and without a call, he
would be medling with ſuch ſacred edge-tools, as
an authoritative and forcible impoſing of Miniſters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. This is a direct way to bring all the
bloud of all the ſouls that periſh, either thorough
the weakneſs, or wickedneſs, of the Miniſtry, in all
the Parochiall Congregagations in the land, upon the
head of the Magiſtrate: Whereas if the people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
either by the inſufficiency, or unfaithfulneſs, of
a miniſtry of their own choice and approbation, in
caſe they were vigilant, and circumſpect in their
act of chooſing, or approving in this kinde, their
bloud ſhall be chiefly required at the hand of their
Miniſters: neither ſhall they contract any guilt, or
incurre any further degree of condemnation, by
their chooſing, or approving ſuch Miniſters, who
afterwards prove negligent and unfaithfull in the
work and charge committed unto them, becauſe in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168452:23"/>
theſe actions they put their ſickles into their own corn,
and not into other mens.</p>
            <p>7. (And laſtly) For danger likely to befall,
the State, or Government, by allowing the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Congregations in the Land the right of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their own Miniſters (reſpectively) the truth
is, that the danger is like to be the greater by
their being denyed ſo juſt and equitable a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
than by a permiſſion to enjoy it. States ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffered by indulging their people in things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and juſt; but a forcible wreſting out of
their hand, or withholding from them, their due
intereſts and rights, hath ſtill been exaſperating and
provoking. And in caſe a Miniſter allowed by the
people, ſhould prove of a malignant humour;</p>
            <p>Firſt, So may a Miniſter though with the <hi>Triers</hi>
paſſe: this is no amulet or charm againſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if a Miniſters tongue prove at any time
malignant in the pulpit, there is another Miniſter
of God at hand to reſtrain him (I mean the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate)
who beareth not the ſword in vain. But
though men who have committed murder or theft,
may be put in priſon for their miſdemeanours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated,
yet may not others, who have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſuch facts, be impriſoned to prevent their
committing them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the greateſt danger threatening the State
from malignant Miniſters, is not by the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they have, or may have, of preaching publickly,
but by clandeſtine inſinuations, conſultations, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<hi>&amp;c,</hi> for the plotting and practiſing
whereof they have both the more leiſure, and may
have the more opportunties, by being taken off,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168452:23"/>
or put by their imployment in preaching.</p>
            <p>4. (And laſtly) VVhen perſons ſomewhat (it
may be) malignantly inclined, ſhall be contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly
entreated by the State, or by their Officers,
as ſuppoſe any of them ſhould be made to drink of
the Triers cup of reprobation (as many a worthy
man hath been) is not this a direct way or means
to awaken and ſet on work ſuch an inclination?
Therefore the politick conſideration ſuggeſted in the
argument in countenance of the Triers, and their
Conſtitution, is clearly anti-politick, and ſrowns
rather than ſmiles upon their conſiſtory. And if
Policy having weighed them in her ballance, finde
them wanting; and Religion having weighed them
in the ballance of the Sanctuary, hath found them
yet wanting more: let their Kindome be divided,
and given to the Congregations of the Land.</p>

            <p>IF there be any thing found in the Papers now in thy
hand, which ſome may pleaſe to conſtrue as favouring
more of an undue liberty or plainneſſe of ſpeech, then of
that reverence and reſpects, which are due unto Authority,
and more eſpecially to that authority, from whence the two
Commiſſions impleaded therein, were iſſued; the Author
deſireth that it may be conſidered, 1. That the great men
of the earth are in nothing more expoſed to danger and
diſaſter, then through want of ſeaſonable ſmitings and
reproofs of faithful men, upon their miſdoings. 2. That all
evictions and reproofs of irregular actions, being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
and duly adminiſtred, are more the reproofs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, then of the men, who ever they be, by whom
they are adminiſtred. 3. That Kings and Princes, and the
greateſt Rulers of the earth, are, in their miſcarriages, liable
to the reproofs of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as meaner men.
4. That thoſe that reprove in the Name of Chriſt, and
in his ſtead, are not in this ſervice to reſpect perſons, but
only the nature and demerit of the cauſe or thing reproved.
5. and laſtly, That the Author ſtands particularly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
engaged to the Nation, to take and uſe all Chriſtian
boldneſſe and freedome, in declaring unto the Rulers of his
people their errors and miſtakes, upon the account of his
zeal and faithfulneſs, ſo often publickly teſtified, in aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

power, but of their actings alſo, when, and as far, as juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;

adverſaries.</p>
