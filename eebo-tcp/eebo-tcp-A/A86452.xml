            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Having given directions, that the accounts of theſe Regiments may be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for thoſe Gentlemen that are appointed to take care of the Counties ſatisfaction, both in the debts of the Officers, and likewiſe for the billiting of the common Souldiers; which I have howſoever put in a way by the caſuall meeting of Sir <hi>Tho. Hansby</hi> at Doncaſter, where ſome of our Horſe-troopes are quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which I drew together to attend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty into the Towne; which occaſioned ſome diſcourſe betwixt us, That as yet I had not received the names of thoſe Gentlemen, neither had any of them bin with me, that are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aſſiſt in theſe accounts between the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and the County: whereupon he ſhewed me a Letter written unto him and ſome others, for the Weſt riding of the Knights of the Shire to that purpoſe; but told me as yet they had not met to agree of any thing about it, but that within one day or two they ſhould doe it. My advice unto him then was, out of my deſire to obey (as ſpeedily as poſſibly I might) the orders of the Parliament, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112102:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 84 -->they would looſe no time in it; and by a joynt letter informed me, of their orders for this ſervice; that ſo I might for that Diviſion (a place being named) appoint the Officers to ajust their accounts with them: and likewiſe that thoſe Gentlemen for the other Diviſions may doe the like. Who I ſuppoſe (the Aſſizes and comming of the Iudges to this Towne being upon Monday next) may have deferred the giving me the Account of this their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment untill this time, I pray God, by the private intelligence that comes amongst us, there be not a generall Aſſizes and judgement appointed for this Kingdome in theſe great troubles, which are ſuch as cannot be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or averted, but by the adviſed counſels that are expected from our great and higheſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the Parliament; who may be both aſſured, and ſecured of all readineſſe in our obedience to thoſe orders I have received from them, being ful of that reſpect &amp; duty that becomes me towards their Lordſhips; My Lord J am moſt faithfull.</p>
