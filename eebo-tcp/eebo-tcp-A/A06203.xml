            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this cause (gentle Reader) I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (through Gods great goodnesse) fels in the direction and

protection of my vnstable youth, a plentifull portion of the wonderfull care he hath ouer vs, and of the vnspeakeable force of praier and thansgiuing in all extremities: the more to stirre vp my selfe to a memorie thereof, haue thought good to set downe these abrupt passions of my passed afflictions, as witnesses of the impediments most stopping me in my Christian pilgrimage, and testimonies of the meanes of my euasion hitherto, which may serue for presidents for my selfe in the like future occasions: and not be altogither vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for others to imitate. In which (as in a glasse) may be seene, the state of a regenerate soule, sicke with sinne, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (Agus-like) shiuering with cold dispaire, straight waies inflamed with seruencie of faith and hope. One while yeelding vnder the burthen of sinne to eternall death, and presently incouraged to runne cheerfully forward the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted course of this his pilgrimage, and like a practized trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, vsed to the change of companie, diet, heate, cold, paine, pleasure, plentie, and want, not to amaze himselfe long with anie chaunge: but by a consideration of pleasures passed or rest expected, patientlie to passe ouer this world full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comberances, from a sence and feeling wherof in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, no true childe of God is anie long time (as I suppose) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt. Now although I doubt not but euen these reasons will carrie the iudgement of the godlie Christian Reader to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable interpretation of my purpose herein, and to some delight in the tast thereof, to whom no person or occasion, stile or phrase, will seeme vnseasonable, being imployd to the glorifying of God, &amp; profit of the Church, or proceeding from a zeale of that effect: yet the consideration that the greater number to whose handes this Treatise may happen to come, are either not so well affected, or so discreet and temperate
<pb facs="tcp:10181:5"/>
as were to be wished, maketh me thinke it needfull to saie something in declaration of my purpose herein: not in excuse of my exercising my self in such theames which indeed ought to be the common action in some measure of all men, as oft as necessarie affaires of this life will permit them, neither in that I make common with others this my exercise which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in secret onely to be practised by my selfe: for that I take it not to be alwaies a token of pride or vaine glorie, to make knowne for a common good to others, that which may breed a suspect of ambition in the Author among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or cauelling multitude, though how herein I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my selfe, I leaue to God the searcher of hearts to iudge: onely I would satisfie them first in the cause of my writing them in verse, then of the confused placing of them without speciall titles.

               <l>Which in first patents franckly did abound,</l>
               <l>And better part of natures strength did marre.</l>
