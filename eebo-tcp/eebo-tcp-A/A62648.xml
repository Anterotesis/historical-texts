            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Chapter <hi>Job</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth of the knowledg of Nature, and the ſecret and unaccountable operations of Natural Cauſes, and of the unſearchable perfections of the Works of <hi>God.</hi> And en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe, <hi>where this Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is to be found,</hi> he tells us, that it is not to be met with in any of the Creatures; <hi>It is not found in the land of the living; The depth ſaith, It is not in me, and the Sea ſaith, It is not in me,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore he puts the queſtion again, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Whence then cometh Wiſdom, and where is the place of underſtanding, ſeeing it is hid from the eyes of all living?</hi> To which he returns an anſwer, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>God underſtandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof, for he looketh to the ends of the earth, and ſeeth under the whole heaven to make the weight for the wind,</hi> &amp;c. The reſult of which diſcourſe is, That a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51554:4"/>
knowledg of nature is no where to be found but in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it; no leſs wiſdom and underſtanding then that which made the World, and contrived this vaſt and regular frame of Nature, can throughly underſtand the Philoſophy of it, and give a perfect account of all its motions and operations. But there is a <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>knowledg</hi> which is very proper to man, and lies level to a humane underſtanding, which is ſuited and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the end, and uſes, and neceſſities of man: and that is, the <hi>knowledg</hi> of God, and of that duty which we owe to him; the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of pleaſing God, by doing what he commands, and avoiding what he forbids: This <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> may be attained by man, and is ſufficient to make him happy. <hi>And unto man he ſaid, Behold the fear of the Lord, that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words conſiſt of two propoſitions, which are not diſtinct in ſenſe, but one and the ſame thing variouſly expreſſed; For <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> are <hi>Synonymous</hi> words here, and though ſometimes they have different notions, yet in the <hi>Poetical books of Scripture</hi> they are moſt frequently uſed as words equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and do both of them indifferently ſignifie either a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knowledg</hi> of things, or a <hi>practical skill</hi> about them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigency of the matter or thing ſpoken of. And ſo likewiſe <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>departure from evil,</hi> are <hi>phraſes</hi> of a very near ſenſe, and like importance, and therefore we find them ſeveral times put together in Scripture. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Fear the Lord and depart from evil. Prov.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi> So that they differ onely as <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> which by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> uſual in all ſorts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, are frequently put for one another.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>To fear the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to depart from evil,</hi> are phraſes which the Scripture uſeth in a very great latitude, to expreſs to us <hi>the ſum of Religion, and the whole of our duty.</hi> And becauſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51554:4"/>
the large acceptation of theſe phraſes is to be the foundation of my ſubſequent diſcourſe, I ſhall for the further clearing of this matter endeavour to ſhew theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is very uſual in the language of Scripture, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>whole of Religion</hi> by theſe, and ſuch like phraſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The particular fitneſs of theſe two phraſes to deſcribe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is very uſual in the language of Scripture, to expreſs the <hi>Whole of Religion</hi> by ſome eminent Principle or part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The great Principles of Religion are <hi>Knowledg, Faith, Remembrance, Love</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> by all which, the Scripture u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to expreſs the <hi>Whole duty</hi> of man. In the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> by the <hi>Knowledg, Remembrance,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> of God. Religion is called <hi>The knowledg of the holy, Prov.</hi> 30. 3. And wicked men are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>know not God.</hi> So likewiſe, by the <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> frequently in this book of <hi>Job,</hi> and in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Proverbs.</hi> And <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another.</hi> And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13. the <hi>fear of God</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be the ſum of Religion; <hi>Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole of man.</hi> And on the contrary, the wicked are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>have not the fear of God before their eyes, Pſal.</hi> 36. 1. And ſo likewiſe by the <hi>remembrance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth:</hi> that is, enter upon a Religious courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. And on the contrary, the Character of the Wicked is, that <hi>they forget God,</hi> Pſal. 9. 17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> In the <hi>New Teſtament, Religion</hi> is uſually expreſſed by <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>love</hi> of them, Hence it is that true Chriſtians are ſo frequently called <hi>believers,</hi> and wicked and ungodly men, <hi>unbelievers.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. Good men are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>love God, All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51554:5"/>
ſuch as <hi>love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 24. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why theſe are put for the <hi>Whole of Religion,</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>knowledg,</hi> and <hi>remembrance,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of God, are ſuch powerful principles, and have ſo great an influence upon men to make them Religious, that where any one of theſe really is, all the reſt, together with the true and genuine effects of them, are ſuppoſed to be. And ſo likewiſe the ſum of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is often expreſſed by ſome <hi>eminent part</hi> of it; which will explain the ſecond phraſe here in the Text, <hi>Departing from evil.</hi> The <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> is an eminent <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is often in Scripture expreſſed by <hi>ſeeking God,</hi> and <hi>calling upon his Name,</hi> is a chief part of Religious Worſhip. Hence Religion is deſcribed by <hi>ſeeking God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him;</hi> and by <hi>calling upon his Name,</hi> Act. 2. 21. <hi>Whoſoever calleth upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And ſo by <hi>coming to God,</hi> and by <hi>departing from evil.</hi> In this fallen ſtate of man, Religion begins with <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> the two oppoſite terms of which are <hi>God</hi> and <hi>ſin;</hi> hence it is that Religion is deſcribed ſometimes by <hi>coming to God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is;</hi> that is, No man can be religious, unleſs he believe there is a God. Sometimes by <hi>departing from ſin,</hi> Iſa. 59. 15. <hi>And he that departeth from evil maketh himſelf a Prey:</hi> that is, ſuch was the bad ſtate of thoſe times the Prophet complains of, that no man could be religious, but he was in danger of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the fitneſs of theſe two phraſes to deſcribe Religion by. 1. For the firſt, <hi>The fear of the Lord;</hi> the fitneſs of this phraſe will appear, if we conſider that very great influence which the fear of God hath upon men to make them religious. Fear is a paſſion that is moſt deeply rooted in our natures, and flows immediately from that principle of ſelf-preſervation which God

hath planted in every man. Every man deſires his own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and happineſs, and therefore hath a natural dread and horrour of every thing that can deſtroy his being, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his happineſs; Now the greateſt <hi>danger</hi> is from the greateſt <hi>power,</hi> and that is <hi>Omnipotency.</hi> So that <hi>the fear of God</hi> is an inward acknowledgment of a Holy and juſt Being, which is armed with an almighty and irreſiſtible power; God having hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every mans conſcience a ſecret awe and dread of his infinite Power, and eternal Juſtice. Now Fear, being ſo intimate to our natures, it is the ſtrongeſt bond of Laws, and the great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our duty. There are two Bridles or reſtraints which God hath put upon humane nature, <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Fear. Shame</hi> is the weaker, and hath place onely in thoſe in whom there are ſome remainders of Virtue; <hi>Fear</hi> is the ſtronger, and works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all who love themſelves, and deſire their own preſervation. Therefore, in this degenerate ſtate of man-kind, <hi>Fear</hi> is that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which hath the greateſt power over us, and by which, God and his Laws take the ſureſt hold of us: Our <hi>Deſire,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> are not ſo apt to be wrought upon by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Virtue, and the promiſes of Reward and Happineſs as our <hi>Fear</hi> is from the apprehenſions of Divine diſpleaſure; For though we have loſt, in a great meaſure, the guſt and reliſh of true happineſs, yet we ſtill retain a quick ſenſe of pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that <hi>Fear</hi> relies upon a natural love of our ſelves, and is complicated with a neceſſary deſire of our own preſervation; therefore Religion uſually makes it's firſt entrance into us by this paſſion; and hence it is that <hi>Solomon,</hi> more then once, calls <hi>the Fear of the Lord</hi> the beginning of Wiſdom. 2. As for the ſecond phraſe, <hi>departing from evil;</hi> the fitneſs of it to expreſs the <hi>whole duty of Man</hi> will appear, if we conſider the neceſſary connexion that is between the negative and poſitive part of our duty. He that is careful to avoid all ſin, will ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51554:6"/>
to perform his duty; for, the ſoul of man is an active prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and buſie, and will be employed one way or other, it will be doing ſomething; if a man abſtain from evil, he will do good. Now there being ſuch a ſtrait connexion between theſe, the <hi>whole of our duty</hi> may be expreſſed by either of them, but moſt fitly by <hi>departing from evil,</hi> becauſe that is the firſt part of our duty: Religion begins in the forſaking of ſin; <hi>Virtus eſt Vitium fugere, &amp; Sapientia prima Stultitiâ caruiſſe; Virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the forſaking of Vice, and the firſt part of Wiſdom is, not to be a Fool.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which mentions theſe parts of our duty, doth conſtantly put <hi>departing from evil</hi> firſt; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 27. <hi>Depart from evil, and do good. Iſa.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord.</hi> Epheſ, 4. 23, 24. We are firſt to <hi>put off the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful luſts,</hi> and then to <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, and to put on the new man,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 3. 11. <hi>Let him eſchew evil, and do do good.</hi> To all which I may add this further Conſideration, That the Law of God, contained in the Ten Commandments, conſiſting moſtly of prohibitions, <hi>Thou ſhalt not</hi> do ſuch or ſuch a thing, our obſervance of them is moſt fitly expreſſed by <hi>departing from evil,</hi> which yet includes obedience likewiſe to the poſitive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts implied in thoſe prohibitions.</p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, the <hi>Propoſition</hi> that I ſhall ſpeak to is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>Doctr. <hi>That Religion is the beſt Knowledge and Wiſdom.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus,
<q>
                  <p>He that is truly Religious is the moſt wiſe and knowing perſon.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt endeavour to <hi>confirm</hi> the truth of this Propoſition, and then make ſome <hi>Uſe</hi> and improvement of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51554:6"/>
The <hi>Confirmation</hi> of it I ſhall attempt theſe three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By a direct Proof of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By ſhewing on the contrary, the folly and ignorance of irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By vindicating Religion from thoſe common Imputations which ſeem to charge it with Ignorance or Imprudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with the direct proof of this; And becauſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion comprehends two things, the <hi>knowledg</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> of it, and <hi>a ſuitable life and practice;</hi> (the firſt of which being <hi>ſpeculative</hi> may more properly be called <hi>knowledg,</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe 'tis <hi>practical,</hi> may be called <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>prudence)</hi> therefore I ſhall endeavour diſtinctly to prove theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That Religion is the beſt Knowledg.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That it is the trueſt Wiſdom.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt, That it is the beſt knowledg.</hi> The knowledg of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion commends its ſelf to us upon theſe two accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the knowledg of thoſe things which are in themſelves moſt excellent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of thoſe things which are moſt uſeful and neceſſary for us to know.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is the beſt knowledg, becauſe it is the knowledg of thoſe things which are in themſelves moſt <hi>excellent,</hi> and <hi>deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be known,</hi> and thoſe are <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>duty. God</hi> is the ſum and comprehenſion of all perfection. It is delightful to know the <hi>Creatures,</hi> becauſe they are ſome ſhadows of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; There are particular excellencies ſcattered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt among the Creatures, which 'tis very pleaſant to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate; But in <hi>God</hi> all perfections in their higheſt degree and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation meet together and are united; how much more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then muſt it needs be, to fix our minds upon ſuch an object in which there is nothing but <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>brightneſs,</hi> what is <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and what is <hi>excellent;</hi> what will <hi>raviſh our affections and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51554:7"/>
raiſe our wonder, pleaſe</hi> us and <hi>aſtoniſh</hi> us at once? And that the finite meaſure and capacity of our underſtandings is not able to take in and comprehend the infinite excellencies and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, this indeed ſhews the excellency of the object, but doth not at all detract from the delightfulneſs of the knowledg; for it is a greater pleaſure for a finite underſtanding to be loſt in the contemplation of its object, and to view unlimited excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which have no ſhore nor bounds, then to look upon thoſe perfections of which we can ſee the end and utmoſt; as 'tis more pleaſant to the eye to have an endleſs proſpect, then to be terminated; for this is that which properly cauſeth admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we diſcover a great deal in an object which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be excellent, and yet we ſee we know not how much more beyond that, which our underſtandings cannot fully reach and comprehend.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>knowledg of God</hi> in his <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>perfections</hi> is excellent and deſireable; ſo likewiſe to know him in thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtations of himſelf <hi>in the works of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> and above all (though it be little ſpoken of by the Saints of the Old Teſtament, by reaſon of the obſcure degree of its diſcovery in thoſe times) <hi>the knowledg of God in his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> in that ſtupendious manifeſtation of his wiſdom and mercy in the contrivance of our Recovery, which is ſuch a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and ſo excellent a piece of knowledg, that <hi>the Angels deſire to pry into it,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>the knowledg of God</hi> is excellent, ſo likewiſe <hi>of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is nothing elſe but <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> which are the Image of God, a conformity to the nature and will of God, and an imitation of the Divine excellencies and perfections ſo far as we are capable: For to know our duty, is to know what it is to be like God in <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Pity,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> and <hi>Clemency,</hi> in <hi>pardoning injuries,</hi> and <hi>paſsing by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51554:7"/>
in <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> and in a hatred and deteſtation of the contrary of theſe. In a word, it is to know what is the good and acceptable will of God, what it is that he loves and delights in, and is pleaſed withal, and would have us to do in order to our perfection, and our happineſs. It is deſervedly accounted a piece of excellent knowledg, to know the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> and the <hi>Cuſtoms of the Country</hi> we live in, and the <hi>Will of the Prince</hi> we live under; How much more, to know the <hi>Statutes of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of Eternity,</hi> thoſe immutable and eternal Laws of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs? to know the will and pleaſure of the great Monarch, and Univerſal King of the World, and the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of that <hi>Country</hi> where we muſt live for ever? This made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to admire the Law of God at that ſtrange rate he doth in the 119<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and to advance the knowledg of it above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledg, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis the <hi>knowledg</hi> of thoſe things which are moſt <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> for us to know. The <hi>goodneſs</hi> of every thing is meaſured by its <hi>end</hi> and <hi>uſe,</hi> and that's the beſt thing which ſerves the beſt end and purpoſe; and the more neceſſary any thing is to an end, the better it is: So that the beſt knowledg is that which is of greateſt uſe and neceſſity to us in order to our <hi>great end,</hi> which is <hi>Eternal happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation of our Souls.</hi> Curious ſpeculations, and the contemplation of things that are impertinent to us, and do not concern us, nor ſerve to promote our happineſs, are but a more ſpecious and ingenious ſort of idleneſs, a more pardonable and creditable kind of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That man that doth not know thoſe things which are of uſe and neceſſity for him to know, is but an ignorant man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may know beſides; Now the knowledg of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of our <hi>duty,</hi> is of the greateſt uſefulneſs and neceſſity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51554:8"/>
to us in order to our happineſs: It's of abſolute neceſſity that we ſhould know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in order to our being happy: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternal</hi> (that is, the onely way to it) <hi>to know thee the only true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is neceſſary alſo in order to our happineſs, to know our <hi>Duty,</hi> becauſe 'tis neceſſary for us to do it, and it is impoſſible to do it except we know it: So that whatever other knowledg a man may be endued withal, he is but an ignorant perſon who doth not know God, the Authour of his being, the Preſerver and Protector of his life, his Soveraign, and his Judg, the giver of every good and perfect gift, his ſureſt refuge in trouble, his beſt friend or worſt enemy, the preſent ſupport of his life, his hopes in death, his future happineſs, and his portion for ever; Who does not know his relation to God, the duty that he owes him, and the way to pleaſe <hi>him</hi> who can make him happy or miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ever; Who does not know <hi>the things of his peace,</hi> and the way how to get his ſins pardoned, and himſelf reconciled to an offended God; Who doth not know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> So that if a man by a vaſt and imperious mind, and <hi>a heart large as the ſand upon the Sea ſhore,</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Solomon)</hi> could command all the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>things;</hi> could attain to a Maſtery in all Languages, and ſound the depth of all Arts and Sciences, meaſure the Earth and the Heavens, and tell the Stars, and give an account of their order and motions; could diſcourſe of the Intereſts of all States, the Intrigues of all Courts, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Civil Laws and Conſtitutions, and give an account of the Hiſtory of all ages; could ſpeak of Trees, <hi>from the Cedar tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the Hyſop that ſpringeth out of the wall, and of beaſts alſo, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fiſhes;</hi> and yet ſhould, in the mean time, be deſtitute of the knowledg of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>duty;</hi> all this would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51554:8"/>
be but an impertinent vanity, and a more glittering kind of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and ſuch a man (like the Philoſopher, who whileſt he was gazing upon the Stars, fell into the ditch) would but <hi>Sapienter deſcendere in infernum,</hi> be undone with all this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and with a great deal of wiſdom go down to Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>That to be Religious is the trueſt Wiſdom;</hi> and that likewiſe upon two accounts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe it is to be wiſe for our ſelves.</item>
               <item>2. It is to be wiſe as to our main intereſt and concernment.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>'Tis to be wiſe for our ſelves.</hi> There's an expreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. <hi>He that is wiſe is profitable to himſelf;</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf;</hi> intimating, that Wiſdom regards a mans own intereſt and advantage, and he is not a wiſe man that doth not take care of himſelf and his own concernments, according to that of old <hi>Ennius, Nequic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſapere ſapientem, qui ſibi ipſi prodeſſe non quiret;</hi> that man hath but an empty title of Wiſdom, and is not really wiſe, who is not wiſe for himſelf. As <hi>Self preſervation</hi> is the firſt principle of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo care of our ſelves and our own intereſt is the firſt part of <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> He that is wiſe in the affairs and concernments of other men, but careleſs and negligent of his own, that man may be ſaid to be buſie, but he is not wiſe; he is employed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not ſo as a wiſe man ſhould be: Now this is the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Religion,</hi> that it directs a man to a care of his own proper intereſt and concernment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is to be wiſe as to our main intereſt.</hi> Our chief end and higheſt intereſt is happineſs; Now this is <hi>happineſs,</hi> To be freed from all (if it may be,) however, from the greateſt evils; and to enjoy (if it may be) all good, however, the chiefeſt. <hi>To be happy,</hi> is not onely to be freed from the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> but from <hi>anxiety</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> of <hi>Spirit;</hi> not onely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſence,</hi> but <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and tranquill<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51554:9"/>
of <hi>mind. To be happy,</hi> is not onely to be ſo for a little while, but as long as may be, and if it be poſſible, for ever. Now <hi>Religion</hi> deſigns our <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>longeſt happineſs;</hi> it aims at a freedom from the greateſt evils, and to bring us to the poſſeſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the greateſt good. For Religion wiſely conſiders, that men have <hi>Immortal Spirits,</hi> which as they are <hi>Spirits,</hi> are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a pleaſure and happineſs diſtinct from that of our <hi>bodies</hi> and our <hi>ſenſes;</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>Immortal,</hi> are capable of an everlaſting happineſs. Now our <hi>Souls</hi> being the beſt part of our ſelves, and <hi>Eternity</hi> being infinitely the moſt conſiderable dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the greateſt <hi>wiſdom</hi> is to ſecure the intereſt of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and the intereſt of <hi>Eternity,</hi> though it be with the loſs, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of our <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>inferiour</hi> Intereſts: Therefore <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> directs us rather to ſecure <hi>inward peace,</hi> then <hi>outward eaſe;</hi> to be more careful to avoid <hi>everlaſting</hi> and <hi>intolerable torments,</hi> then <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>light afflictions which are but for a moment;</hi> to court the <hi>favour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> more then the <hi>friendſhip</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> and not ſo much <hi>to fear them that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do,</hi> as <hi>him who after he hath kill'd can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell.</hi> In a word, our <hi>main Intereſt</hi> is to be <hi>as happy as we can,</hi> and <hi>as long as is poſſible;</hi> and if we be caſt into ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that we muſt be either in part and for a time, or elſe wholly and always miſerable; the <hi>beſt wiſdom</hi> is to chooſe the <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>laſting happineſs,</hi> but the <hi>leaſt</hi> and <hi>ſhorteſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery:</hi> Upon this account <hi>Religion</hi> preferrs thoſe <hi>pleaſures which flow from the preſence of God for evermore,</hi> infinitely before the <hi>tranſitory pleaſures</hi> of this world; and is much more careful to avoid <hi>eternal miſery,</hi> then <hi>preſent ſufferings.</hi> This is the <hi>Wiſdom of Religion,</hi> that upon conſideration of the whole, and caſting up all things together, <hi>it does adviſe and lead us to our beſt Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>ſecond</hi> way of Confirmation ſhall be by ſhewing the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs:</hi> And this I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51554:9"/>
might do by the Rule of Contraries; for, if he that is truly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> be the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>knowing</hi> perſon, then thoſe that are <hi>irreligious</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> are neither <hi>knowing</hi> nor <hi>wiſe.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this may ſufficiently appear by applying what I have ſaid in the <hi>direct proof</hi> of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> the juſt contrary way, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not enlarge upon this in the ſame method, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon other <hi>Heads</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of ſuch perſons. Now all that are irreligious are ſo upon one of theſe two accounts; Either, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they do not believe the <hi>Foundations</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion, as, <hi>The Exiſtence of God, The Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>Future and Eternal Rewards;</hi> and of this kind there are but few, in compariſon, who do not in ſome ſort believe theſe things: Or elſe, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Men are <hi>irreligious,</hi> becauſe though they do in ſome ſort believe theſe things, yet they act contrary to their belief; and of this <hi>kind</hi> are the far greateſt part of wicked men: The <hi>firſt</hi> ſort are guilty of that which we call <hi>Speculative,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> of <hi>Practical Atheiſm I</hi> ſhall endeavour to diſcover the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of both theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Speculative Atheiſm,</hi> is <hi>Firſt,</hi> abſurd in the <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,</hi> which argues <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is an <hi>impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Opinion,</hi> both becauſe it is againſt our preſent intereſt, and is alſo <hi>unſafe</hi> in the ultimate iſſue of it; which argues <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. It is abſurd in the <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Speculation;</hi> and that upon theſe five accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it gives no probable account of the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of things. We ſee a World of Creatures, and a vaſt Frame of things, which we who believe a God attribute to God as the <hi>Authour, (i e.)</hi> to a <hi>Being</hi> endued with infinite <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which is a very likely Cauſe to produce a World: For, what more likely to communicate Being to ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a progeny of goodly Creatures, then <hi>infinite Goodneſs?</hi> What more likely to create ſo vaſt a World, that is, to ſtretch
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51554:10"/>
forth the Heavens and lay the foundations of the Earth, to form theſe and all the Creatures in them <hi>out of Nothing,</hi> then <hi>infinite Power?</hi> What ſo likely to <hi>contrive</hi> all theſe <hi>Creatures</hi> each of them ſo perfect in their kind, and all of them ſo fitly and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly ſuited to each other and to the whole, as <hi>infinite Counſel</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom?</hi> This ſeems to be a reaſonable account. But what account doth the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> give of this? Either he muſt ſay, that the <hi>World</hi> was <hi>Eternal,</hi> and that things alwayes were as they are, without any firſt Cauſe of their Being, which is the way of the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Atheiſts; or elſe he muſt aſcribe the <hi>Original</hi> of the World to <hi>Chance,</hi> and the caſual concourſe of Matter, which is the way of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atheiſts. But neither of theſe ways gives a probable account of the Exiſtence of things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Not the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> way; For, though we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame thing always to have been, yet it is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable how there ſhould have been <hi>an infinite orderly ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of things, that is, a <hi>third, fourth, fifth,</hi> &amp;c. without a <hi>firſt.</hi> I ſay, this is utterly unimaginable; But yet I will ſuppoſe that this matter doth admit of ſeeming and unanſwerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations both ways, <hi>viz.</hi> both <hi>That an eternal ſucceſſion of things is poſſible, and that it is impoſſible;</hi> as the Queſtion about the infinite diviſibility of Quantity doth, and indeed all Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about any thing that is <hi>infinite,</hi> it being but reaſonable to expect that our <hi>finite</hi> Underſtandings ſhould be puzzled and loſt about any thing that is <hi>infinite.</hi> Now granting this, which is the utmoſt any man can challenge in this Queſtion, this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things from an <hi>Eternal order and ſucceſſion of Cauſes</hi> comes to juſt nothing; For, though it be granted, that there are plauſible Arguments for the poſſibility of this, yet ſo long as they are countepoiſed by other Arguments every whit as ſtrong and unanſwerable, they can ſignifie nothing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51554:10"/>
in the ballance of Reaſon, becauſe the ſtrength of them is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enervated and taken off by equal Demonſtrations on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; and ſo long as their hands are thus tied, ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is altogether uſeleſs, and nothing can be built upon it; For what man will allow it <hi>probable</hi> that there hath been an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſucceſſion of things, without any Original, or <hi>firſt Cauſe,</hi> whileſt it is an even Queſtion, whether an Eternal ſucceſsion of things be ſo much as <hi>poſſible?</hi> And beſides all this, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf (who is ſuppoſed to be the great <hi>Patron</hi> of this <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Eternity of the World)</hi> doth elſewhere in ſeveral places of his works, own it as one of the greateſt abſurdities that can be, to aſſert an <hi>infinite progreſs of Cauſes,</hi> and ſays, that it is <hi>unworthy of a Philoſopher</hi> to reſolve any thing this way, and that the mind of man can have no reſt, nor any reaſonable and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account of things be given, but by ſtaying in ſome <hi>firſt Cauſe.</hi> But I needed not have ſaid ſo much to this, becauſe the <hi>Modern Atheiſts</hi> do generally deſert this way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Nor the <hi>Epicurean</hi> way, which imputes this vaſt pile of the World, this regular and orderly Frame of things (which it acknowledges to have had a beginning) not to <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>counſel,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom;</hi> but to a <hi>fortunate chance,</hi> and <hi>happy caſualty.</hi> Now there is nothing can be more unreaſonable then obſtinately to impute that to <hi>Chance,</hi> which doth plainly and apparently contain in it all the Arguments and Characters of <hi>a wiſe deſign</hi> and <hi>contrivance.</hi> Was ever any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable work, in which there was required great variety of parts, and a regular and orderly diſpoſition of thoſe parts, done by <hi>Chance?</hi> Will <hi>Chance</hi> fit <hi>means</hi> to <hi>ends,</hi> and that in ten thouſand inſtances, and not fail in any one? How often might a man, after he had jumbled a ſet of Letters in a Bag, fling them out upon the ground before they would fall into an exact Poem, yea, or make a good Diſcourſe in Proſe? And may not a little
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51554:11"/>
               <hi>Book</hi> be as eaſily made by Chance, as this great <hi>Volume</hi> of the World? How long might a man be in ſprinkling colours upon Canvas with a careleſs hand, before they would happen to make the exact picture of a Man? And is a Man eaſilier made by chance then his Picture? How long might twenty thouſand <hi>blind Men.</hi> which ſhould be ſent out from the ſeveral remote parts of <hi>England,</hi> wander up and down before they would all meet upon <hi>Salisbury Plains,</hi> and fall into <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File</hi> in the exact order of an <hi>Army?</hi> And yet this is much more eaſie to be imagined, then how the innumerabe <hi>blind parts</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> ſhould <hi>Rendezvous</hi> themſelves into a <hi>World.</hi> A man that ſees <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh's Chappel</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> might with as good reaſon maintain (yea, with much better, conſidering the vaſt difference betwixt that little <hi>Structure,</hi> and the huge Fabrick of the World) that it was never contrived or built by any Man, but that the ſtones did by Chance grow into thoſe curious Figures into which they ſeem to have been cut and graven; And that <hi>upon a time,</hi> (as <hi>Tales</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually begin) the <hi>Materials</hi> of that building, the <hi>Stone, Morter, Timber, Iron, Lead</hi> and <hi>Glaſs,</hi> happily met together, and very fortunately rang'd themſelves into that delicate order in which we ſee them now ſo cloſe compacted, that it muſt be a very great <hi>Chance</hi> that parts them again. What would the world think of a man that ſhould advance ſuch an <hi>opinion</hi> as this, and write a <hi>Book</hi> for it? If they would do him right, they ought to look upon him as mad, with a little more reaſon then any man can have to ſay that the World was made by Chance, or that the <hi>firſt Men</hi> grew up out of the Earth as <hi>Plants</hi> do now. And yet they who give this account of the Original things, aſſume to themſelves to be the <hi>Men of Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>great Wits</hi> of the World, the onely <hi>cautious</hi> and wary perſons, that hate to be impoſed upon, that muſt have convincing evidence for every thing, and can aſſent to nothing without a clear Demonſtration for it.</p>

2. Becauſe it gives no reaſonable account of the <hi>Univerſal Conſent</hi> of Mankind in this apprehenſion, <hi>that there is a God.</hi> That men do generally believe a God, and have done in all Ages, the preſent experience of the World, and the Records of former times do abundantly teſtifie. Now how comes this perſwaſion to have gained ſo univerſal a poſſeſſion of the mind of Man, and to have found ſuch general entertainment in all <hi>Nations,</hi> even thoſe that are moſt <hi>barbarous?</hi> If there be no ſuch thing as God in the world, how comes it to paſs that this object doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally encounter our underſtandings? whence is it that we are ſo perpetually <hi>haunted</hi> with the <hi>Apparition</hi> of a Deity, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it where-ever we go? If it be not natural to the mind of Man, but proceeds from ſome accidental diſtemper of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, how comes it to be ſo Univerſal, that no differences of <hi>age,</hi> or <hi>temper,</hi> or <hi>education,</hi> can wear it out, and ſet any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of men free from it? Into what can we reſolve this ſtrong inclination of mankind to this error and miſtake? how come all Nations to be thus ſeduced? It is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable, but that the Reaſon of ſo Univerſal a conſent in all places and ages of the world, and among all differences of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſhould be <hi>one</hi> and <hi>conſtant;</hi> But no <hi>one</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> reaſon of this can be given, but from the nature of Mans mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which hath this Notion of a Deity born with it, and ſtamped upon it; or, which is all one, is of ſuch a frame, that in the free uſe and exerciſe of it ſelf, it will find out God; And what more reaſonable then to think, that if we be Gods Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, he ſhould ſet this <hi>mark</hi> of himſelf upon all <hi>reaſonable Creatures,</hi> that they may know to whom they belong, and may acknowledg the <hi>Author</hi> of their Beings? This ſeems to be a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and ſatisfactory account of ſo <hi>Univerſal</hi> a <hi>conſent</hi> in this matter. But now what doth the Atheiſt reſolve this into? He is not at one with himſelf what account to give of it; nor can it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51554:12"/>
be expected he ſhould; For he that will over-look the <hi>true</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a thing, which is but <hi>one,</hi> may eaſily find <hi>many falſe</hi> ones, <hi>Error</hi> being infinite. But there are <hi>three</hi> which he principally rellyes upon, <hi>Fear, Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Policy of State.</hi> I ſhall briefly conſider theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He would fain make us believe that this apprehenſion of a God, doth ſpring from an <hi>infinite jealouſie</hi> in the mind of Man, and an <hi>endleſs fear</hi> of the worſt that may happen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>Divine ſaying</hi> of the Poet, (which he can never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admire) <hi>Primus in orbe Deos fecit Timor, Fear firſt made Gods.</hi> So that it is granted on both ſides, that the <hi>fear</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> doth univerſally poſſeſs the minds of Men: Now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether it be more likely that the exiſtence of a God ſhould be the cauſe of this fear, or that this fear ſhould be the cauſe why men imagine there is a God? If there be a God who hath impreſſed this image of himſelf upon the mind of Man, there's great reaſon why all men ſhould ſtand in awe of him; But if there be no God, it is not eaſie to conceive how <hi>fear</hi> ſhould create an univerſal confidence and aſſurance in men that there is one. For, whence ſhould this Fear come? it muſt be either from <hi>without,</hi> from the ſuggeſtion of others, who firſt tell us there is ſuch a <hi>being,</hi> and then our fear believes it; or elſe it muſt ariſe from <hi>within, viz.</hi> from the Nature of Man, which is apt to fancy dreadful and terrible things. If from the ſuggeſtion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who tell us ſo, the queſtion returns, who told <hi>them</hi> ſo? and will never be ſatisfied till the firſt Author of this report be found out; ſo that this account of <hi>fear</hi> reſolves it ſelf into <hi>Tradition,</hi> which ſhall be ſpoken to in its proper place. But if it be ſaid, that this <hi>fear</hi> ariſeth from <hi>within,</hi> from the Nature of man which is apt to imagine dreadful things, this likewiſe is liable to inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable difficulties. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the proper <hi>object</hi> of <hi>fear</hi> is ſomething that is <hi>dreadful,</hi> that is, ſomething that threatens
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51554:12"/>
Men with harm, or danger, and that in God muſt either be <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and ſuch an object as this, <hi>fear</hi> indeed may create: But <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> are eſſential to the Notion of a God, as well as <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> Now how ſhould <hi>fear</hi> put men upon fancying a <hi>Being</hi> that is infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>merciful?</hi> No man hath reaſon to be afraid of ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as <hi>ſuch.</hi> So that the Atheiſt muſt joyn another cauſe to <hi>Fear, viz. Hope,</hi> to enable men to create this imagination of a God. And what would the <hi>Product</hi> of theſe two <hi>contrary Paſsions</hi> be? The ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of a <hi>Being,</hi> which we ſhould <hi>fear</hi> would do us as much <hi>harm,</hi> as we could <hi>hope</hi> it would do us <hi>good;</hi> which would be <hi>Quid pro Quo,</hi> and which our Reaſon would oblige us to lay aſide ſo ſoon as we had fancied it, becauſe it would ſignifie juſt nothing. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe <hi>fear</hi> alone could do it; how comes the mind of Man to be ſubject to ſuch groundleſs and unreaſonable fears? The <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Atheiſt will ſay, it always was ſo; But this is to <hi>affirm,</hi> and not to give any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a thing: The <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atheiſt, if he will ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantly to himſelf, muſt ſay, that there happened in the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> conſtitution of the <hi>firſt</hi> men ſuch a contexture of <hi>Atomes,</hi> as doth naturally diſpoſe men to theſe <hi>panick</hi> fears; unleſs he will ſay, that when the <hi>firſt</hi> men grew out of the earth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards broke looſe from their root, finding themſelves weak, and naked, and unarmed, and meeting with ſeveral fierce crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtronger then themſelves, they were put to ſuch a fright as did a little diſtemper their underſtandings, and let looſe their imaginatians to endleſs ſuſpicious, and unbounded jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which did at laſt ſettle in the conceit of an inviſible <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> infinitely powerful, and able to do them harm; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully poſſeſt with this apprehenſion, (nothing being mo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ordinary then for crazed perſons to believe their own <hi>fancies)</hi> they became <hi>Religious,</hi> and afterwards when mankind began
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51554:13"/>
to be propagated in the way of <hi>generation,</hi> then <hi>Religion</hi> obliged them to inſtill theſe <hi>principles</hi> into their Children in their tender years, that ſo they might make the greater impreſſion upon them; and this courſe having been continued ever ſince, the Notion of a God hath been kept up in the world. This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuitable to <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Hypotheſis of the Original of Men; but if any man think fit to ſay thus, I cannot think it fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether Men were from all Eternity ſuch timorous and fanciful Creatures, or happened to be made ſo in the firſt conſtitution of things; it ſeems however, that this <hi>fear</hi> of a Deity hath a foundation in Nature; And if it be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> ought we not rather to conclude, That there is ſome ground and reaſon for theſe <hi>Fears,</hi> and that Nature hath not planted them in us to no purpoſe, then that they are vain and groundleſs? There is no <hi>Principle</hi> that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (the grand Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of the Eternity of the World) doth more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate then this, That <hi>Nature doth nothing in vain;</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is forced to acknowledge, (and ſo will every man, who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſiders the frame of the World) That although things were made by Chance, yet they have happened as well as if the greateſt Wiſdom had had the ordering and contriving of them; And ſurely Wiſdom would never have planted ſuch a vain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as the fear of a Deity in the Nature of Man, if there had not been a God in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If <hi>Fear</hi> be not a ſufficient account of this Univerſal Conſent, the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> thinks it may very probably be reſolved into <hi>Univerſal Tradition.</hi> But this likewiſe is liable to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; For, whence came this Tradition? It muſt begin ſome time, it muſt have its original from ſome body; and it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well worth our knowing, who that <hi>Man</hi> was that firſt raiſed this <hi>Spirit</hi> which all the Reaſon of mankind could never <hi>conjure</hi> down ſince; <hi>Where</hi> did he live, and <hi>when?</hi> In what <hi>Countrey,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51554:13"/>
in what <hi>Age</hi> of the World? <hi>What was his Name, or his Sons Name, that we may know him?</hi> This the Atheiſt can give no punctual account of; onely he imagines it not improbable, that ſome body long ago (no body knows when) beyond the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of all Ages, did ſtart ſuch a notion in the world, and that it hath paſt for currant ever ſince. But whatever he imagine, <hi>that</hi> is very improbable which relies upon no ſtronger arguments then his own conceit: But beſides, If this <hi>Tradition</hi> be granted ſo very ancient as to have been before all Books, and to be elder then any Hiſtory, it may, for any thing any body can tell, have been from the beginning; and then it is much more likely to be a Notion which was bred in the mind of Man, and born with him, then a Tradition tranſmitted from hand to hand through all generations; eſpecially if we conſider how many <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>barbarous Nations</hi> there are in the World which conſent in the Opinion of a God, and yet have no certain Tradition of any thing that was done among them but two or three Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But if neither of theſe be ſatisfactory, he hath one way more; which although it ſignifie little to Men of ſober and ſevere Reaſon, yet it very unhappily hits the jealous and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humour of the generality of men, who from the experience they have had of themſelves and others, are very apt to ſuſpect that every body, but eſpecially their <hi>Superiours</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> have a deſign to impoſe upon them for their own ends. In ſhort, it is this; That this noiſe about a God is a meer <hi>State Engine,</hi> and a <hi>Politick device,</hi> invented at firſt by ſome <hi>great Prince,</hi> or <hi>Miniſter of State,</hi> to keep people in awe and order. And if ſo, from hence (ſaith the Atheiſt) we may eaſily apprehend, how from ſuch an original it might be generally propagated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come univerſally <hi>currant,</hi> having the ſtamp of publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon it; beſides, that <hi>People</hi> have always been found eaſie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51554:14"/>
to comply with the inclinations of their <hi>Prince.</hi> And from hence likewiſe we may ſee the Reaſon why this Notion hath continued ſo long; for being found by experience to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an Inſtrument of Government, we may be ſure it would always be cheriſhed and kept up. And now <hi>he</hi> triumphs, and thinks the buſineſs is very clear: Thus it was; ſome time or other, (moſt probably towards the beginning of the world, (if it had a beginning) when all Mankind was under one Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarch;) ſome great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſet up this <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and commanded <hi>all People and Nations to fall down and worſhip it:</hi> And this being found a ſucceſsfull device, to awe people into obedience to Government, it hath been continued to this day, and is like to laſt to the end of the world. To this <hi>fine conjecture</hi> I have theſe <hi>four things</hi> to ſay: 1. That all this is meer conjecture and ſuppoſition; <hi>he</hi> cannot bring the leaſt ſhadow of proof or evidence for any one <hi>tittle</hi> of it. 2. This ſuppoſition grants the opinion of a God to conduce very much to the ſupport of Government and order in the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to be very beneficial to Mankind; ſo that the Atheiſt cannot but acknowledge that it is great pity that it ſhould not be true, and that it is the common intereſt of Mankind, if there were but probable Arguments for it, not to admit of any ſlight Reaſons againſt it; and to proſecute all thoſe who would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to Atheiſm, as the great <hi>diſturbers</hi> of the world, and <hi>peſts</hi> of humane ſociety. 3. This ſuppoſition can have nothing of certainty in it, unleſs this be true, That whoever makes a politick advantage of other mens Principles, is preſumed to contrive thoſe Principles into them; whereas it is much more common (becauſe more eaſie) for men to ſerve their own ends of thoſe Principles or Opinions, which they do not put into men, but find there; ſo that if the queſtion of a God were to be decided by the probability of this Conjecture, (which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51554:14"/>
the Atheiſt applauds himſelf moſt in) it would be concluded in the affirmative; It being much more likely, that becauſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians <hi>reap</hi> the advantages of obedience and a more ready ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Government from mens believing that there is a God, that they found the minds of men <hi>prepoſſeſt</hi> to their hands with the notion of a God, then that they <hi>planted</hi> it there; and we need not doubt but that they would be very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>to reap where they did not ſow, and to gather where they did not ſtrew.</hi> 4. We have as much evidence of the contrary to this <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> as ſuch a thing is capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was not an <hi>Arcanum Imperii,</hi> a <hi>Secret of Government,</hi> to propagate the belief of a God among the people, when the Governours themſelves knew it to be a cheat. For we find in the Hiſtories of all Ages of which we have any Records, (and of other Ages we cannot poſſibly judge) that Princes have not been more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from troubles of Conſcience, and the fears of Religion, and the terrours of another World, (nay, many of them more ſubject to theſe) then other men, as I could give many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe no mean ones: What made <hi>Caligula</hi> creep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bed when it thunder'd? What made <hi>Tiberius</hi> (that great Maſter of the <hi>Crafts of Government)</hi> complain ſo much of the grievous <hi>ſtings</hi> and <hi>laſhes</hi> he felt in his Conſcience? What mov'd that <hi>Great Emperour, Charls the Fifth,</hi> to quit his Kingdom, and retire into a Monaſtery to prepare for another World? What made <hi>Cardinal Wolſey</hi> (one of the greateſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State</hi> that ever was) to pour forth his ſoul in thoſe ſad words? <hi>Had I been as diligent to pleaſe my God as I have been to pleaſe my King, he would not have forſaken me now in my gray hairs.</hi> What reaſon for ſuch Actions and Speeches, if theſe <hi>Great Men</hi> had known that Religion was but a cheat? Now if ſuch <hi>great</hi> and <hi>politick</hi> perſons (as the <hi>three</hi> laſt of theſe were) knew nothing of this <hi>Secret,</hi> I think we may ſafely conclude, that the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51554:15"/>
Notion of a God did not come from the <hi>Court,</hi> that it is not the invention of Politicians, and a juggle of State, to cozen the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into obedience. And now from all this that hath been ſaid it ſeems to be very evident, that the general conſent of Man-kind in this apprehenſion <hi>That there is a God,</hi> muſt in all Reaſon be aſcribed to ſome more <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> Cauſe then <hi>Fear,</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi> or <hi>State Policy, viz.</hi> to <hi>this,</hi> That God himſelf hath ſtamped this <hi>Image</hi> of himſelf upon the Mind of Man, and ſo woven it into the very <hi>frame</hi> of his <hi>Being,</hi> that (like <hi>Phidias</hi> his Picture in <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Shield) it can never totally be defaced without the ruine of humane nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I do but know one <hi>Objection</hi> that this Diſcourſe is liable to; it is this: The Univerſal Conſent of Man-kind in the apprehenſion of a God is no more an Argument of the Being of a God, then the general agreement of ſo many Nations for ſo many Ages in <hi>Polytheiſme</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> is an Argument for theſe. <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, 1. That the generality of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and wiſe men of all Nations and Ages did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the multitude in theſe things; they believed but one Supreme Deity, which, with reſpect to the various benefits men received from him, had ſeveral Titles beſtowed upon him; and although they did ſervilely comply with the People in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God by ſenſible Images and Repreſentations, yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Writings that they deſpiſed this way of Worſhip as ſuperſtitious, and unſuitable to the Nature of God. So that <hi>Polytheiſme</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> are far from being able to pretend to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Conſent from their having had the Vote of the multitude in moſt Nations for ſeveral Ages together; becauſe the opinion of the vulgar ſeparated from the Conſent and Approbation of the Wiſe, ſignifies no more then a great many <hi>Cyphers</hi> would do without <hi>Figures.</hi> 2. The groſs <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> about <hi>God</hi> and his Worſhip are a good Argument

that there is a God, becauſe they ſhew, That men ſunk into the moſt degenerate condition, into the greateſt blindneſs and darkneſs imaginable, do yet retain ſome ſenſe and awe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; that Religion is a property of our Natures, and that the Notion of a Deity is intimate to our Underſtandings, and ſticks cloſe to them, ſeeing Men will rather have any God then <hi>none,</hi> and rather then want a Deity, they will worſhip any thing. 3.

            <p n="3">3. Speculative Atheiſme is abſurd in the Theory, becauſe it requires more evidence for things then they are capable of. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath long ſince well obſerved, how unreaſonable it is to expect the ſame kind of <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> for <hi>every</hi> thing, which we have for <hi>ſome</hi> things. <hi>Mathematical</hi> things, being of an abſtracted nature, are onely capable of clear <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> But Concluſions in <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi> are to be proved by a ſufficient <hi>Induction</hi> of experiments; things of a <hi>moral</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by <hi>moral</hi> Arguments; and <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> by <hi>credible Teſtimony:</hi> And though none of theſe be capable of <hi>ſtrict De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51554:16"/>
yet we have an undoubted aſſurance of them, when they are proved by the beſt Arguments that the nature and quality of the thing will bear. No man can demonſtrate to me, that there is ſuch an <hi>Iſland</hi> in <hi>America</hi> as <hi>Jamaica;</hi> yet upon the Teſtimony of credible perſons who have ſeen it, and Authors who haue written of it, I am as free from all doubt concerning it, as I am from doubting of the cleereſt Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. So that this is to be entertained as a firm <hi>principle</hi> by all thoſe who pretend to be certain of any thing at all; <hi>That when any thing is proved by as good arguments as that thing is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and we have as great aſſurance that it is, as we could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have ſuppoſing it were, we ought not in reaſon to make any doubt of the exiſtence of that thing?</hi> Now to apply this to the preſent Caſe: The being of a God is not <hi>Mathematically</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, nor can it be expected it ſhould, becauſe onely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical matters admit of this kind of evidence; Nor can it be proved <hi>immediately</hi> by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>God</hi> being ſuppoſed to be a <hi>pure Spirit,</hi> cannot be the <hi>Object</hi> of any <hi>corporeal ſenſe.</hi> But yet we have as great aſſurance that there is a God as the nature of the thing to be proved is capable of, and as we could in reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have, ſuppoſing that he were. For let us ſuppoſe there were ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as an <hi>Infinite Spirit cloathed with all poſsible perfection, that is,</hi> as <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Powerful, &amp;c.</hi> as can be imagined, what conceiveable ways are there whereby we ſhould come to be aſſured that there is ſuch a <hi>Being,</hi> but either by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal impreſſion</hi> of the Notion of a God upon our Minds, or elſe by ſuch <hi>external</hi> and viſible <hi>Effects</hi> as our Reaſon tells us muſt be attributed to ſome <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and which we cannot without great violence to our Underſtandings attribute to any other Cauſe but ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as we conceive <hi>God</hi> to be, <hi>that is, One</hi> that is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Powerful?</hi> Now we have this double <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> that there is a God, and greater or other then this the thing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51554:16"/>
is not capable of. If God ſhould aſſume a Body, and preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before our eyes, this might amaze us, but could not give us any rational aſſurance that there is an <hi>Infinite Spirit;</hi> If he ſhould work a <hi>Miracle,</hi> that could not in reaſon convince an Atheiſt more then the Arguments he already hath for it; If <hi>he</hi> were to <hi>ask a ſign in heaven above, or in the earth beneath,</hi> what could he deſire God to do for his conviction more then he hath already done? Could he deſire him to work a greater Miracle then to make a World? Why if God ſhould carry this <hi>perverſe man</hi> out of the limits of this World, and ſhew him a <hi>new Heaven</hi> and a <hi>new Earth,</hi> ſpringing out of nothing, he might ſay, that innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parts of Matter chanc'd juſt then to rally together, and to form themſelves into this new World, and that God did not make it. Thus you ſee that we have all the rational aſſurance of a God that the thing is capable of, and that Atheiſm is abſurd and unreaſonable in requiring more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Atheiſt is abſurd, becauſe he pretends to know that which no man can know, and to be certain of that which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be certain of; that is <hi>That there is no God,</hi> and (which is conſequent upon this, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards) <hi>That it is not poſsible there ſhould be one.</hi> And the Atheiſt muſt pretend to know this certainly; for it were the greateſt folly in the world for a man to deny and deſpiſe God, if he be not certain that <hi>he</hi> is not. Now whoever pretends to be certain that there is no God, hath this great diſadvantage; He pretends to be certain of a <hi>pure Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:</hi> But of <hi>Negatives</hi> we have far the leaſt certainty, and they are always <hi>hardeſt,</hi> and many times <hi>impoſsible</hi> to be proved: Indeed ſuch <hi>Negatives</hi> as only deny ſome particular <hi>mode</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a things exiſtence, a man may have a certainty of them, becauſe, when we ſee things to be, we may ſee what they are, and in what manner they do, or do not exiſt; <hi>For inſtance,</hi> we may be certain that Man is not a creature that hath Wings, becauſe this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51554:17"/>
onely concerns the manner of his exiſtence; and we ſeeing what he is, may certainly know that he is not ſo, or ſo. But <hi>pure Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> that is, ſuch as abſolutely deny the exiſtence of things, or the poſſibility of their exiſtence, can never be proved; for after all that can be ſaid againſt a thing, this will ſtill be true, That many things poſſibly are which we know not of, and that many more things may be then are; and if ſo, after all our arguments againſt a thing, it will be uncertain whether it be or not; and this is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true, unleſs the thing denied to be, do plainly imply a contradiction, from which I ſhall afterwards ſhew the Notion of a God to be free. Now the Atheiſt pretends to be certain of a <hi>pure Negative, viz.</hi> That there is no ſuch Being as God, and that it is not poſſible there ſhould be; But no man can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably pretend to know thus much, but he muſt pretend to know all things that are, or can be; which if any man ſhould be ſo <hi>vain</hi> as to pretend to, yet it is to be hoped, that no body would be ſo <hi>weak</hi> as to believe him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Speculative Atheiſm</hi> is abſurd, becauſe it is <hi>ſelf-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> There are theſe <hi>two</hi> great contradictions in the denial of a God. 1. He that denies a God, ſays that that is <hi>impoſſible</hi> which he muſt grant to be <hi>poſſible.</hi> He ſays it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as God, in ſaying that <hi>de facto</hi> there is no ſuch <hi>Being;</hi> for <hi>Eternity</hi> being eſſential to the Notion of a God, if there be not a God already, it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> now that there ſhould be one; becauſe ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as is ſuppoſed to be eſſentially <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>without beginning,</hi> cannot <hi>now begin to be.</hi> And yet he muſt grant it <hi>poſſible</hi> that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Being,</hi> becauſe it is poſſible there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Being as hath all poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as this is that which we call <hi>God,</hi> and is that very thing which the Atheiſt denies, and others affirm to be; for he that denies a God, muſt deny ſuch a Being as all the world deſcribe God to be, and this is the general Notion which all men
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51554:17"/>
have of God, <hi>That he is a Being as perfect as is poſſible;</hi> that is, endued with all ſuch perfections as do not imply a contradiction, as none of thoſe perfections which we attribute to God do; Not <hi>neceſsity of being,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-exiſtence,</hi> and <hi>eternity,</hi> and <hi>immenſity</hi> or <hi>unlimitedneſs; theſe</hi> the Atheiſt muſt grant <hi>poſsible</hi> and <hi>free from contradiction,</hi> becauſe he aſcribes them to the <hi>World,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>Matter;</hi> Not <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> becauſe he aſcribes <hi>theſe</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> nor conſequently the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degrees of theſe that are poſſible; nor, <hi>laſtly,</hi> doth <hi>immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality</hi> or the Notion of a <hi>Spirit</hi> imply a contradiction, becauſe the Atheiſt muſt either grant that there is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in Man, <hi>that is,</hi> ſomething that is not <hi>Matter,</hi> (and conſequently, that an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material principle</hi> is <hi>not impoſsible)</hi> or elſe give a fair and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account how <hi>meer Matter</hi> can <hi>think</hi> and <hi>underſtand,</hi> and how that which moves by <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Laws,</hi> that is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move unleſs it be moved by another, and cannot but move if it be impell'd by another, is capable of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom;</hi> which I think is impoſſible to be done. 2. Another contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which attends the denial of a God, is this; Atheiſm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> to be, as doth in the <hi>eſſential Notion</hi> of it include <hi>neceſſary exiſtence,</hi> that is, an impoſſibility of not being; And this in plain Engliſh, is to deny that thing to be, which cannot but be. Now that the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> doth eſſentially include in it <hi>neceſsary exiſtence,</hi> appears from the general Notion that all men have of <hi>God, viz.</hi> that he is a Being that hath all poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; But that <hi>neceſſary exiſtence</hi> is a <hi>perfection,</hi> is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if Being be good, it is better to have it <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently;</hi> to have it ſecur'd, then to be in danger of loſing it: And that it is a <hi>poſſible perfection,</hi> the Atheiſt cannot deny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he aſcribes it to <hi>Matter,</hi> as I ſhewed before. So that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> doth finally reſolve it ſelf into theſe <hi>two</hi> groſs Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, <hi>viz. That it is impoſſible that there ſhould be ſuch a Being
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51554:18"/>
as hath all poſſible perfections;</hi> that is, That that which may be, cannot be: And, <hi>That ſuch a Being as neceſſarily exiſts, doth not, nor can poſſibly exiſt;</hi> that is to ſay, That a thing which cannot but be, is not, nor can be.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> as it is an <hi>abſurd,</hi> ſo it is an <hi>imprudent</hi> Opinion; and that upon theſe two accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is againſt mens preſent Intereſt. Did but Men conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what God is, they would ſee him to be ſo <hi>lovely</hi> a Being, and ſo full of <hi>goodneſs</hi> and all <hi>deſireable</hi> perfections, that even thoſe very perſons, who are of ſuch irregular Underſtandings as not to believe that there is a God, yet could not (if they underſtood themſelves) refrain from wiſhing with all their hearts that there were one. For, is it not every mans intereſt that there ſhould be ſuch a Being in the World as takes particular care of him, and loves him, and is able and willing to do him good, and to make him happy; to ſupply all his wants, and to relieve him in all his ſtraits, when no body elſe can; to preſerve him in the greateſt dangers, and aſſiſt him againſt his greateſt enemies, and ſecure him from miſery and deſtruction? Is is not every mans intereſt that there ſhould be ſuch a Being in the World, as would govern us for our advantage, and require nothing of us, but what is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our intereſt, and what (if we rightly underſtood our own concernment) we our ſelves would chooſe to do? And God is ſuch a Being, if he be at all. Now why ſhould any man be aggrieved that there is ſuch a Being as this, or count it his intereſt to ſhut <hi>Him</hi> out of the World? Why ſhould any man be concern'd or troubled that there is a Being as good as we can poſſibly deſire or imagine? I dare ſay, if a wiſe and conſiderate man were left to himſelf and his own choice, to wiſh the greateſt good to himſelf he could deviſe; the <hi>ſum</hi> of all his wiſhes would be, that there were <hi>juſt ſuch a Being as God is;</hi> nor would he chooſe any other <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> or <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Protector</hi> for <hi>himſelf,</hi> or <hi>Governor</hi> for the whole
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51554:18"/>
               <hi>World,</hi> then <hi>infinite Power</hi> conducted &amp; managed by <hi>infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which is the true <hi>Notion</hi> of a God. I confeſs, it is not a wicked Mans intereſt, if he reſolve to continue ſuch, that there ſhould be a God; But then it is not mens intereſt to be wicked: It is for the general good of humane ſociety, and conſequently, of particular perſons, to be <hi>true &amp; juſt;</hi> it is for mens health to be <hi>temperate;</hi> and ſo I could inſtance in all other vertues. But this is the myſtery of Atheiſm, men are wedded to their luſts, and reſolv'd upon a wicked courſe, &amp; ſo it becomes their intereſt to wiſh there were no God, and to believe ſo if they can; whereas if men were minded to live righteouſly and ſoberly and vertuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the world, <hi>to believe a God</hi> would be no hinderance or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any ſuch deſign, but very much for the advancement and furtherance of it. Men that are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> do eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a God; ſo that it is vehemently to be ſuſpected, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſtrength of mens luſts, and the power of vicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, do ſway their minds, and ſet a <hi>byaſs</hi> upon their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings towards Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Atheiſm is <hi>imprudent,</hi> becauſe it is unſafe in the iſſue. The Atheiſt doth, <hi>as it were,</hi> lay a <hi>Wager</hi> againſt the Religious man that there is no God; but upon ſtrange inequality and odds; for <hi>he</hi> ventures his Eternal Intereſt: whereas the <hi>other</hi> ventures onely the loſs of his Luſts, (which it is much better for him to be without) or at the utmoſt, of ſome temporal convenience; and all this while is inwardly more contented and happy, and uſually more healthful, and perhaps meets with more reſpect, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller friends, and lives in a more ſecure and flouriſhing condition, and freer from the evils and puniſhments of this world, then the Atheiſtical perſon does, (however, it is not much that he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;) And after this life, if there be no God, is as well as he; but if there be a God, is infinitely better, even as much as unſpeakable and eternal happineſs is better then extream and endleſs miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51554:19"/>
So that if the Arguments <hi>for</hi> and <hi>againſt</hi> a God were equal, and it were an <hi>even Queſtion</hi> Whether there were one or nor, yet the hazard and danger is ſo infinitely unequal, that in point of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and intereſt every man were obliged to incline to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; and what-ever doubts he might have about it, to chooſe the ſafeſt ſide of the Queſtion, and to make <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to live by. For, he that acts wiſely, and is a throughly prudent man, will be provided <hi>in emnem eventum,</hi> will take care to ſecure the <hi>main chance,</hi> what-ever happens: but the Atheiſt, in caſe things ſhould fall out contrary to his belief and expectation, he hath made no proviſion for this caſe; if, contrary to his confidence, it ſhould prove in the Iſſue that there is a God, the <hi>man</hi> is loſt and undone for ever; If the Atheiſt when he dies ſhall find that his ſoul remains after his body, and has onely quitted it's lodging, how will this man be amazed and blank'd, when, contrary to his expectation, he ſhall find himſelf in a new and ſtrange place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt a world of Spirits, entred upon an everlaſting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable ſtate? How ſadly will the <hi>man</hi> be diſappointed when he finds all things otherwiſe then he had ſtated and determined them in this world? When he comes to appear before that God whom he hath denied, and againſt whom he hath ſpoken as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightful things as he could? Who can imagine the pale and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty looks of this man, and how he will ſhiver and tremble <hi>for the fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty?</hi> How will he be ſurprized with terrors on every ſide, to find himſelf thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly and irrecoverably plunged into a ſtate of ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation? And thus things may happen for all this <hi>mans</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence now: For our belief or diſ-belief of a thing does not alter the nature of the thing; we cannot fancy things into being, or make them vaniſh into nothing by the ſtubborn confidence of our imaginations; things are as fullen as we are, and will be what they are, what-ever we think of them; and if there be a God, a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51554:19"/>
man cannot by an obſtinate diſ-belief of him make him ceaſe to be, any more then a man can put out the Sun by winking.</p>
            <p>And thus I have as briefly and clearly as I could endeavour'd to ſhew the <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> of <hi>Speculative Atheiſm</hi> in denying the <hi>exiſtence of God.</hi> And now it will be leſs needful to ſpeak of the other <hi>two Principles</hi> of Religion, the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>future Rewards;</hi> For no man can have any reaſonable ſcruple about <hi>theſe,</hi> who believes that there is a God; becauſe no man that owns the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of an <hi>infinite Spirit,</hi> can doubt of the <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi> of a <hi>finite Spirit,</hi> that is, ſuch a thing as is <hi>immaterial,</hi> and does not contain any principle of <hi>ſelf-corruption</hi> in it ſelf; And no man that believes the goodneſs of God, can doubt but that he hath made ſome things as good as may be, and for as long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance as they are capable of. Nor can any man that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, and that he loves righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and hates iniquity, and that he is <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of the World, and conſequently concerned to countenance obedience to, and puniſh the violation of his Laws; and withal conſiders the promiſcuous diſpenſations many times of Gods Providence in this World, think it unreaſonable to conclude, that after this life good men ſhall be rewarded, and ſinners puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And now I think I may with reaſon intreat ſuch as are Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtically enclined, to conſider theſe things <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> and <hi>imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;</hi> And if there be weight in theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> which I have offered to them to ſway with reaſonable men, I would beg of ſuch, that they would not ſuffer themſelves to be by aſſed by <hi>prejudice,</hi> or <hi>paſsion,</hi> or the <hi>intereſt</hi> of any <hi>luſt</hi> or <hi>worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> to a contrary perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would intteat them <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> and <hi>diligently</hi> to conſider theſe things, becauſe they are of ſo great moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every man; If any thing in the world deſerve our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtudy and conſideration, theſe <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion do;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51554:20"/>
For what can import us more to be ſatisfied in, then <hi>whether there be a God, or not? whether our Souls ſhall periſh with our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or be immortal, and ſhall continue for ever?</hi> And if ſo, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that eternal ſtate which remains for men after this Life, they ſhall not be happy or miſerable for ever, according as they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned themſelves in this world?</hi> If theſe things be ſo, they are of infinite conſequence to us; and therefore it highly concerns us to enquire diligently about them, and to ſatisfie our minds concerning them one way or other. For theſe are not matters to be ſlightly and ſuperficially thought upon, much leſs (as the way of Atheiſtical men is) to be <hi>played</hi> and <hi>jeſted</hi> withal. There is no greater argument of a <hi>light</hi> and <hi>inconſiderate</hi> perſon, then <hi>profanely to ſcoff at Religion;</hi> It is a ſign that <hi>that man</hi> hath no regard to himſelf, and that <hi>he</hi> is not touched with a ſenſe of his own intereſt; For, <hi>He jeſts with edg'd tools,</hi> and <hi>plays</hi> with <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and makes <hi>nothing</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi> He is <hi>the</hi> very mad-man that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Who caſteth fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, arrows and death, and ſaith, Am I not in ſport?</hi> To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ſeverely, and debate ſeriouſly the <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion, is a thing worthy of a Wiſe man; but if any man ſhall turn <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> into <hi>Raillery,</hi> and confute it by two or three <hi>bold jeſts,</hi> this man doth not render <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>himſelf</hi> ridiculous in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all conſiderate men, becauſe <hi>he ſports with his own Life.</hi> If the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> were <hi>doubtful and uncertain,</hi> yet they concern us ſo neerly, that we ought to be ſerious in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them; and though <hi>they</hi> were never ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> yet they may be made <hi>ridiculous</hi> by <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>frothy</hi> men, as the graveſt and wiſeſt Perſonage in the World may be abuſed by being put into a <hi>Fools Coat,</hi> and the moſt <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>excellent Poem</hi> may be debaſed and made vile by being turned into <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque.</hi> So that it concerns every man that would not <hi>trifle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his <hi>Soul,</hi> and fool himſelf into irrecoverable miſery, with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51554:20"/>
the greateſt ſeriouſneſs to enquire into <hi>theſe matters</hi> whether they be ſo or not, and patiently to conſider the arguments which are brought for them; Many have miſcarried about theſe things, not becauſe there is not <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> enough for them, but becauſe they have not had <hi>patience</hi> enough to conſider them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider theſe things <hi>impartially.</hi> All <hi>wicked men</hi> are of a <hi>Party</hi> againſt <hi>Religion;</hi> Some <hi>Luſt</hi> or <hi>Intereſt</hi> engageth them againſt it. Hence it comes to paſs that they are apt to <hi>ſlight</hi> the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Arguments that can be brought for it, and to <hi>cry up</hi> very <hi>weak</hi> ones againſt it. Men do generally and without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aſſent to <hi>Mathematical</hi> Truths, becauſe it is no bodies intereſt to deny them; but men are ſlow to believe <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Truths, becauſe the Luſts and <hi>Intereſts</hi> of men do prejudice them againſt them. And therefore you may obſerve, That the more vertuouſly any man lives, and the leſs he is enſlaved to any Luſt, the more ready he is to entertain the Principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when you are examining theſe matters, do not take into conſideration any <hi>ſenſual</hi> or <hi>worldly</hi> Intereſt, but deal clearly and impartially with your ſelves; Let not <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>little advantages</hi> ſway you againſt a <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>durable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</hi> Think thus with your ſelves; That you have not the <hi>making</hi> of things <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> but that the truth and exiſtence of things is already fix'd and ſetled, and that the Principles of Religion are already either determinately true or falſe, before you think of them: Either there is a God, or there is not; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Souls are Immortal, or they are not; one of theſe is certain and neceſſary; and they are not now to be altered; The truth of things will not comply with your conceits, and bend it ſelf to your intereſts. Therefore do not think what you would have to be, but conſider impartially what is, and (if it be) will be whether you will or no. Do not reaſon thus; I would fain be wicked, and therefore is is my intereſt that there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51554:21"/>
ſhould be no God, nor no life after this, and therefore I will endeavour to prove that there is no ſuch thing, and will ſhew all the favour I can to that <hi>ſide</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion;</hi> I will bend my underſtanding and wit to ſtrengthen the Negative, and will ſtudy to make it as true as I can. This is fond, becauſe it is the way to cheat thy ſelf; and that thou mayeſt do, if thou likeſt it: We may cozen our ſelves as often as we pleaſe, but <hi>Res nolunt decipi, The nature of things will not be impoſed upon.</hi> If then thou be as wiſe as thou oughteſt to be, thou wilt reaſon thus with thy ſelf; My higheſt intereſt is <hi>not to be deceived</hi> about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, therefore ſetting aſide all other conſiderations, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to know the truth, and yield to that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, The <hi>Practical Atheiſt,</hi> who is wicked and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious notwithſtanding he does in ſome ſort believe that there is a God, and a future ſtate; he is likewiſe guilty of prodigious Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: The <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Speculative</hi> Atheiſt argues more <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> but the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> argues greater <hi>Folly.</hi> Not to believe a God and another Life, for which there is ſo much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reaſon, is great ignorance and folly; but 'tis the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt madneſs, when a man does believe theſe things, to live as if he did not believe them: When a man does not doubt but that there is a God, and according as he demeans himſelf towards him, he will make him happy or miſerable for ever; yet to live ſo as if he were certain of the contrary, and as no man in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can live, but he that is well aſſured that there is no God. It was a ſhrewd ſaying of the old <hi>Monk,</hi> That two kind of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would ſerve for all offenders in the World, an <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and a <hi>Bedlam;</hi> If any man ſhould deny the Being of a God, and the Immortallity of the Soul, ſuch a one ſhould be put into the firſt of theſe, the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> as being a deſperate <hi>Heretick;</hi> if any man ſhould profeſs to believe theſe, and allow himſelf in any known wickedneſs, ſuch a one ſhould be put into <hi>Bedlam;</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51554:21"/>
becauſe there cannot be a greater <hi>folly</hi> and madneſs, then for a man in matters of greateſt moment and concernment to act againſt his beſt Reaſon and Underſtanding, and by his <hi>Life</hi> to contradict his <hi>Belief;</hi> ſuch a man does <hi>Vivus videnſque perire,</hi> periſh with his eyes open, and knowingly undoes himſelf; he runs upon the greateſt dangers which he clearly ſees to be before him, and precipitates himſelf into thoſe evils which he profeſſes to believe are real and intolerable; and wilfully neglects the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that unſpeakable good and happineſs which he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded is certain and attainable. But of this more in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Third</hi> way of <hi>Confirmation</hi> ſhall be by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vindicate Religion from thoſe common <hi>Imputations</hi> which ſeem to charge it with <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Imprudence.</hi> The <hi>profane Wits</hi> of the world caſt upon Religion theſe three <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Credulity:</hi> Say they, The Foundation of Religion is the belief of thoſe things for which we have no ſufficient Reaſon, and conſequently, of which we can have no good aſſurance; as the belief of a God, and of a future ſtate after this life; things which we never ſaw, nor did experience, nor ever ſpoke with any body that did; now it ſeems to argue too great a facility and eaſineſs of belief, to aſſent to any thing upon inſufficient grounds.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if there be ſuch a Being as a God, and ſuch a thing as a future ſtate, it cannot (as I ſaid before) in reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that we ſhould have the evidence of ſenſe for ſuch things: For, he that believes a God, believes ſuch a Being as hath all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51554:22"/>
perfections, among which this is one, that he is a Spirit, and conſequently, inviſible, and cannot be ſeen: He that believes another Life after this, profeſſeth to believe a ſtate of which in this life we can have no trial and experience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the beſt Evidence for theſe things which they are capable of at preſent, ſuppoſing they were.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe who deny theſe Principles muſt be much more <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,</hi> (that is) believe things upon incomparably leſs evidence of Reaſon. The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> looks upon all that are Religious as a <hi>Company of credulous Fools well met;</hi> But <hi>he,</hi> for his part, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be wiſer then to believe any thing for Company; he cannot entertain things upon thoſe ſlight grounds which move other men; if you would win his aſſent to any thing, you muſt give him a clear Demonſtration for it. Now there's no way to deal with this <hi>Man of Reaſon,</hi> this rigid exactor of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for things which are not capable of it, but by ſhewing him that he is an hundred times more credulous; that he begs more Principles, takes more things for granted without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove them, and aſſents to more ſtrange Concluſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weaker grounds, then thoſe whom he ſo much accuſeth of <hi>Credulity.</hi> And to evidence this, I ſhall briefly give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Atheiſts <hi>Creed,</hi> and preſent you with a Catalogue of the <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> of his Faith, or rather <hi>Unbelief. He believes,</hi> That there is no God, nor poſſibly can be, and conſequently that the <hi>wiſe</hi> as well as <hi>unwiſe</hi> of all ages have been miſtaken, except himſelf and a few more. <hi>He</hi> believes, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the world have been frighted with an <hi>apparition</hi> of their own Fancy, or that they have moſt unnaturally conſpired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cozen themſelves; Or that this Notion of a God is a <hi>Trick</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> though the greateſt <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Politicians</hi> do not at this day know ſo much, nor have done time out of mind: <hi>He</hi> believes, either, that the Heavens and the Earth and all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51554:22"/>
things in them had no original Cauſe of their Being, or elſe that they were made by Chance, and happened he knows not how to be as they are; and that in this laſt ſhuffling of Matter, all things have by great good Fortune fallen out as happily, and as regularly, as if the greateſt Wiſdom had contrived them; but yet he believes that there was no Wiſdom in the contrivance of them. <hi>He</hi> Believes, That that which is poſſible is impoſſible, and that that is not, which cannot but be. <hi>He</hi> believes, That <hi>meer Matter</hi> can <hi>Underſtand</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and moſt dextrouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all thoſe <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>free operations</hi> which the Ignorant attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Spirits, and conſequently, that there are no ſuch things as <hi>immortal Spirits,</hi> or a <hi>Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting Life.</hi> This is his Creed. And ſeriouſly it is a wonder that there ſhould be found any perſon pretending to <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi> that can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch a heap of abſurdities, which are ſo groſs and palpable that they may be felt, So that I think it will fall to the Atheiſts ſhare to be the moſt credulous perſon; that is, to believe things upon the ſleighteſt Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Second Imputation</hi> is <hi>Singularity;</hi> the affectation whereof is unbecoming a Wiſe man: To this charge I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If by <hi>Religion</hi> be meant the <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion, that there is a God, and a Providence, that our Souls are Immortal, and that there are Rewards to be expected after this life; theſe are ſo far from being <hi>ſingular</hi> Opinions, that they are the <hi>general</hi> Opinion of Mankind, even of the moſt <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Nations; as <hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> and others teſtifie; inſomuch, that the Hiſtories of ancient times do not furniſh us with the names of above <hi>three or four</hi> at moſt who denied a God; And <hi>Lucretius</hi> acknowledgeth, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was the firſt who did oppoſe thoſe great <hi>Foundations</hi> of Religion, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, and the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the Soul. <hi>Primùm Grajus homo,</hi> &amp;c. meaning <hi>Epicurus.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51554:23"/>
2. If by <hi>Religion</hi> be meant a <hi>living up</hi> to thoſe <hi>Principles,</hi> (that is) to act conformably to our beſt Reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and to <hi>live</hi> as it does become thoſe who do <hi>believe</hi> a God, and a future State; this is acknowledged even by thoſe who live otherwiſe, to be the part of every wiſe man, and the contrary to be the very <hi>madneſs of folly,</hi> and height of diſtraction: Nothing being more ordinary then for men who live wickedly, to acknowledg that they ought to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though according to the common courſe and practice of the World it be ſomewhat <hi>ſingular</hi> for men <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> to <hi>live up</hi> to the <hi>Principles</hi> of their <hi>Religion;</hi> yet <hi>ſingularity</hi> in this matter is ſo far from being a <hi>Reflection</hi> upon any mans pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it is a <hi>ſingular commendation</hi> of it. In two Caſes <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> is very commendable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When there is a neceſſity of it in order to a mans great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>happineſs.</hi> I think it to be a reaſonable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for any man to give, why he does not <hi>live</hi> as the greateſt part of the world do, that he has no mind to <hi>die</hi> as they do, and to periſh with them; he is not diſpoſed to be a fool, and to be miſerable for company; he has no inclination to have his laſt end like theirs <hi>who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of his Son, and ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is very commendable to be <hi>ſingular</hi> in any <hi>Excellency,</hi> and I have ſhewn that <hi>Religion</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Excellency:</hi> to be <hi>ſingular</hi> in any thing that is <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>worthy,</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> is not a <hi>diſparagement,</hi> but a <hi>praiſe:</hi> every man would chooſe to be thus <hi>ſingular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Third Imputation</hi> is, that <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>a fooliſh bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> becauſe they who are <hi>Religious</hi> hazard the parting with a <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>certain happineſs</hi> for that which is <hi>future</hi> and <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> To this I <hi>anſwer,</hi>

1. Let it be granted, that the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> which we have of future Rewards falls ſhort of the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>ſenſe;</hi> for I doubt not but that that <hi>ſaying</hi> of our <hi>Saviour, Bleſſed is he who hath believed and not ſeen;</hi> and thoſe <hi>expreſſions</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle, We walk by faith and not by ſight; and faith is the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> are intended by way of <hi>abatement</hi> and <hi>diminution</hi> to the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and do ſignifie, that the <hi>report</hi> and <hi>teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> is not ſo great <hi>evidence</hi> as that of <hi>our own ſenſes:</hi> And though we have ſufficient aſſurance of another ſtate, yet not ſo great evidence as if we our ſelves had been in the other World, and ſeen how all things are there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have <hi>ſufficient aſſurance</hi> of theſe things, and ſuch as may beget in us a well grounded confidence, and free us from all doubts of the contrary, and perſwade a reaſonable man to venture his greateſt <hi>Intereſts</hi> in <hi>this World</hi> upon the ſecurity that we have of <hi>another World:</hi> for</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. We have as much as is <hi>abundantly ſufficient</hi> to juſtifie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans diſcretion, who for the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> things of <hi>another World,</hi> hazards or parts with the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>tranſitory</hi> things of <hi>this Life.</hi> And for the clearing of this, it will be worth our conſidering, that the greateſt affairs of this world, and the moſt important concernments of this life, are all conducted onely by <hi>Moral Demonſtrations:</hi> Men every day venture their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>eſtates onely</hi> upon <hi>Moral</hi> aſſurance. <hi>For inſtance,</hi> Men who never were at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> or in <hi>Turky,</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> yet do venture their whole Eſtates in Traffick thither, though

            <p>He that obſerves the lives and actions of the greateſt part of men, would verily think that they underſtood nothing of all this; therefore we find in Scripture that when God looks

down upon the wickedneſs of men, he pronounces them to be without underſtanding, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 28. when God had reckoned up the rebellions and perverſneſſes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he concludes, <hi>It is a nation void of counſel, neither is there any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in them.</hi> In the 14 <hi>Pſalm</hi> at the beginning, the Pſalmiſt repreſents God as looking down from heaven upon the children of men; and when he ſaw how they had corrupted themſelves, and what abominable works they did, crying out, <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?</hi> Not that wicked men are deſtitute of the <hi>natural faculty</hi> of Underſtanding, but they have it as if they had it not; they <hi>have</hi> Underſtandings, but they do not <hi>uſe</hi> them, which in effect and by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is all one as if they had none; Nay, happy were it for them if they had them not, for then they would not be liable to the Judgment of God, nor accountable to Him as reaſonable creatures; but this ignorance is wilfull and affected; men are not <hi>blind,</hi> but they <hi>wink,</hi> and ſhut their eyes; they <hi>can</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and <hi>will not;</hi> or if they do underſtand any thing, they impriſon the <hi>Truths of God,</hi> and <hi>detain them in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> they thruſt light into a dungeon, and hide <hi>the candle of the Lord</hi> that is in them <hi>under a buſhel,</hi> they do not ſuffer thoſe things that they know to have a due power and influence upon their hearts and lives: And this is an Ignorance that will be ſo far from <hi>excuſing</hi> men, that it will <hi>aggravate</hi> their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore <hi>Irreligion</hi> is not onely an argument of the greateſt <hi>Ignorance,</hi> but of the greateſt <hi>Folly.</hi> I know there are great pretenſions in the world to Knowledge and Wiſdom, but upon a true and juſt account of things, there's nothing more familiar and ordinary then Ignorance and Folly; theſe ill weeds are of a forward and plentifull growth in the nature of man; <hi>Nihil tam valde vulgare quam nihil ſapere,</hi> Nothing is more common then for men not to be wiſe.

Men generally ſtand upon the credit and reputation of their Underſtandings, and of all things hate to be accounted Fools, becauſe Folly is ſo great a reproach to the Underſtanding of a man, and ſo high a reflection upon his diſcretion: But I know no way for men to avoid this imputation, and to bring off the credit of their Underſtandings, but by being truly Religious, by fearing God, and departing from evil: For certainly, there is no ſuch imprudent perſon as he that neglects God and his Soul, and is careleſs and ſlothful about his everlaſting concernments, becauſe this man acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his trueſt Reaſon and beſt Intereſt; he neglects his own ſafety, and is active to procure his own ruine: He flies from happineſs; and runs away from it as faſt as he can; but purſues miſery, and makes haſte to be undone. Hence it is that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> does all along in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> give the title of <hi>Fool</hi> to a wicked man, as if it were his proper name, and the fitteſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for him, becauſe he is eminently ſuch; There is no ſuch fool as the ſinning fool, who every time he ſins ventures his Soul, and layes his everlaſting Intereſt at the ſtake; every time a man provokes God, he does the greateſt miſchief to himſelf that can be imagined. A mad man that cuts himſelf, and tears his own fleſh, and daſhes his head againſt the ſtones does not act ſo unreaſonably as a ſinner, becauſe he is not ſo ſenſible of what he does; wickedneſs is a kind of <hi>voluntary</hi> frenzy, and a <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> diſtraction, and every ſinner does wilder and more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant things, then any man can do that is craz'd and beſide
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51554:26"/>
himſelf, and out of his wits; onely with this ſad difference, that he knows better what he does. And that wicked men are many of them wiſe as to the things of this world, is no vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them any more then the more innocent actions of mad men, (as catching at ſhadows, and purſuing butter-flyes) about which poſſibly they may uſe as great an activity and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as any man can do about the moſt weighty affairs; but this does not vindicate them from being mad, for becauſe ſuch actions are trifling and impertinent to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of life, we account ſuch men diſtracted for all that. I know the world applaud themſelves much in this wiſdom, and cry it up as the onely prudence; but infinite Wiſdom, which is the beſt Judge of wiſdom, calls it folly. <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. when he brings in the <hi>Sages</hi> and <hi>Politicians</hi> of the world conſulting about a wicked deſign againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he tells us, that as wiſe as they took themſelves to be, <hi>He that ſits in heaven laughs at them, and the Lord hath them in deriſion;</hi> and ſhall we account them <hi>wiſe</hi> at whom <hi>God laughs?</hi> Can we reckon that to be <hi>prudence</hi> which <hi>the Lord hath in deriſion?</hi> The Rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. who had <hi>enlarged his barns, and laid up goods for many years,</hi> no doubt took himſelf for a very prudent man; but God who calls things as they are, and does not call any body out of his name, calls this man <hi>fool,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the midſt of all this care, he had neglected his ſoul; <hi>Thou fool,</hi> &amp;c. To them who believe another life after this, an eternal ſtate of happineſs or miſery in another world, (which is but a reaſonable <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> or demand among <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> there is nothing in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> more demonſtrable then the folly of wicked men; for it is not a clearer and more evident principle that the whole world is greater then a part, then that <hi>Eternity</hi> and the concernments of it are to be preferred before <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not my work to revile ſinners, and to call them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51554:26"/>
names, but to convince them if it be poſſible, and to reclaim them. I will therefore put the matter into a <hi>temporal Caſe,</hi> that wicked men who underſtand any thing of the Rules and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of worldly wiſdom, may ſee the imprudence of a ſinfull courſe, and be convinced <hi>that this their way is their folly,</hi> even themſelves being judges.</p>
            <p>Let me then propound ſome <hi>Caſes</hi> to ſinners, and ask them a few <hi>Queſtions.</hi> Is that man <hi>wiſe,</hi> as to his <hi>body</hi> and his <hi>health,</hi> who onely cloaths his hands, but leaves his whole body naked? who provides onely againſt the Tooth-ach, and neglects whole troops of mortal diſeaſes that are ready to ruſh in upon him? Juſt thus does he who takes care only for this vile body, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects his precious and immortal Soul; who is very ſolicitous to prevent ſmall and temporal inconveniencies, but takes no care <hi>to eſcape the damnation of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is he a wiſe man, as to his temporal <hi>Eſtate,</hi> that lays deſigns onely for a day, without any proſpect to, or proviſion for the remaining part of his life? Juſt thus does he that provides for the <hi>ſhort time</hi> of this life, but takes no care for all <hi>Eternity;</hi> which is <hi>to be wiſe for a moment, but a fool for ever,</hi> and to act as unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and as croſly to the reaſon of things as can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; to regard <hi>Time</hi> as if it were <hi>Eternity,</hi> and to neglect <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> as if it were but a <hi>ſhort time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you think him a wiſe man, who is ſerious about trifles, but trifles about the moſt ſerious matters? Juſt ſo is he who purſues the World and the petty intereſts of it with all his might, but minds Religion and the weighty concernments of Eternity, as if he minded them not.</p>
            <p>Do you count him prudent, who throws himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to ſave his goods? Juſt ſo doth he who to ſecure any thing in this world makes ſhip-wrack of his Conſcience, and caſts away his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:51554:27"/>
Is he wiſe, who is wiſe in any thing but in his proper <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and imployment? wiſe for every body but himſelf? who is ingenious to contrive his own miſery, and to do himſelf a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but is dull and ſtupid as to the deſigning of any real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage to himſelf? Juſt ſuch a one is he who is a good <hi>Tradeſ-man,</hi> but a bad Chriſtian; for <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is more our proper <hi>Calling</hi> and profeſſion then the very <hi>Trades</hi> we live upon; and juſt ſuch is every Sinner, who is <hi>wiſe to do evil, but to do good hath no underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is he wiſe, who neglects and diſobliges him who is his beſt <hi>friend,</hi> and can be his ſhrewdeſt <hi>Enemy?</hi> who with one weak <hi>Troop</hi> goes out to meet him that comes againſt him with <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thouſands?</hi> who ſhes a ſmall danger, and runs upon a greater? Juſt ſo does every wicked man who neglects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns God, <hi>who can ſave or deſtroy him;</hi> who ſtrives with his <hi>Maker,</hi> and <hi>provoketh the Lord to jealouſie;</hi> and with the ſmall and inconſiderable <hi>Forces of a Man</hi> takes the Field againſt the <hi>mighty God the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> who <hi>fears them that can kill the body, but after that have no more that they can do; but fears not him who after he hath kill'd can deſtroy both body and ſoul in Hell;</hi> and juſt ſuch is he who for fear of any thing in this world ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to grieve God; for in ſo doing he runs away from <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>falls into the hands of the living God;</hi> he flies from a <hi>temporal danger,</hi> and leaps into <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is he wiſe, who in matters of greateſt moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neglects opportunities never to be retriv'd? who ſtanding upon the <hi>Shore,</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Tide</hi> making haſte towards him apace, and that he hath but a few minutes to ſave himſelf, yet will lay himſelf to ſleep there, till the <hi>cruel Sea</hi> ruſh in upon him, and overwhelm him? Juſt ſo does he who trifles away this day of Gods grace and patience, and fooliſhly adjourns the work of Repentance &amp; the buſineſs of Religion to a dying hour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51554:27"/>
And, to put an end to theſe Queſtions, Is he wiſe, who hopes to attain the end without the means? nay, by means that are quite contrary to the end? Juſt ſuch is every wicked man who hopes for <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> hereafter without <hi>Holineſs</hi> here; to gain the favour of God by offending him, and to come to the ſight of him by ſinning againſt him; and to be <hi>happy</hi> (that is) to find a pleaſure in the enjoyment of God, and in the company of holy Spirits, by rendring himſelf as unſuitable and unlike to them as he can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> II. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Uſe is to perſwade men to be throughly and ſeriouſly Religious, as ever they would acquit themſelves to be truly knowing and wiſe. <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Excellencies among men, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Wiſdom excels Folly as much as light doth darkneſs.</hi> There are ſome <hi>Vertues</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that gain <hi>affection</hi> from men, as <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs;</hi> but there are others that cauſe <hi>admiration</hi> and raiſe wonder, among theſe are <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which if they be in any eminent degree, will caſt a great luſtre and glory upon a man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>The Wiſdom of a man maketh his face to ſhine.</hi> Now even the <hi>ſhadows</hi> of theſe latter ſort of Excellencies hit the vain-glorious nature of man more then the <hi>realities</hi> of the former, becauſe <hi>proud Man had rather be admir'd then lov'd.</hi> And that Knowledg and Wiſdom are generally acknowledged to be great Excellencies appears, in that men do ſo generally affect the reputation of Knowledg, and are ſo ambitious to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wiſe. There is not any thing that men value themſelves more upon then their <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion:</hi> and on the contrary, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> are reckoned among the greateſt defects of humane nature, ſo that they are accounted generally a greater reproach and diſgrace to a man then <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> and they have got ſo ill a report in the world, that there are not many but had rather be accounted <hi>Knaves</hi> then <hi>Fools;</hi> hence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51554:28"/>
it is that men generally pretend to theſe Excellencies of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Wiſdom, even ſuch as are moſt deſtitute of them, and rather then want theſe Perfections, they will call even their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Imperfections by this name: <hi>Craft,</hi> and <hi>Silence,</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,</hi> and <hi>Reſervedneſs,</hi> and <hi>Formality,</hi> and <hi>affected Gravity,</hi> all theſe put in for the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> ſo ambitious is the nature of man of the reputation of this Excellency. <hi>Job</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Vain man would be wiſe, though he be born like a wild aſſes colt.</hi> Now this very thing that men are ſo forward to counterfeit theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is an Argument of the Excellency of real Knowledg and Wiſdom; for (as I ſaid before) to counterfeit is nothing elſe but to put on the appearance of ſome real Excellency; <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> things are not counterfeited, but onely things of <hi>price</hi> and <hi>value,</hi> as <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> and <hi>precious Stones;</hi> And that men are ſo tenacious of theſe Excellencies, ſo loth to be ſtripp'd even of the ſhadow and appearance of them, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that men highly eſteem them. So that it ſeems that theſe Excellencies are in great dearneſs among men, becauſe we hold them ſo faſt, that when we cannot poſſeſs the <hi>reality</hi> of them, yet we love to enjoy the opinion of them, and rather then be wholly <hi>diſſeiſed</hi> of them, will hold them by that ſleight and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick <hi>tenure</hi> of <hi>Imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we account them ſuch excellencies, we ſhould labour to be poſſeſt of them in truth and reality, and not take up with any counterfeits of them, but uſe ſuch a care and niceneſs about them as men do about <hi>Jewels,</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> which becauſe they are of great value, all miſtakes about them are ſhameful and intollerable. I have ſhewed that Religion is the trueſt knowledg, and moſt real wiſdom, therefore every man that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues his underſtanding, and ſtands upon the reputation of his prudence and diſcretion, ought to be Religious, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Keep therefore my Statutes, for this is your wiſdom and underſtanding in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51554:28"/>
the ſight of the nations.</hi> Thoſe who underſtand and know how to manage the petty intereſts of this world, we account them ſhrewd, and cunning, and deſigning men; but if we would ſpeak truly and wiſely of things, the <hi>Religious</hi> man is the <hi>notable</hi> man; he that contrives to be everlaſtingly happy, and lays deſigns for all Eternity, he is a man of the deepeſt reach; he that takes care of his Soul, and ſecures his Eternal intereſt, he is a <hi>ſhrewd</hi> man. That man who by the aſſiſtance of Gods grace can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach his own deceitful heart, and defeat all the arts and wiles of the Devil, and eſcape thoſe pollutions that are in the world, and ſave himſelf from the ſins, and ſnares, and temptations of an untoward Generation; he is a <hi>cunning</hi> man indeed. Wouldſt thou then be truly knowing? labour to know <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> thy <hi>intereſt,</hi> and <hi>thy end,</hi> and <hi>thy happineſs,</hi> and <hi>the way of attaining it.</hi> Wouldſt thou be truly wiſe? be wiſe for thy <hi>ſelf,</hi> wiſe for thy <hi>Soul,</hi> wiſe for <hi>Eternity;</hi> Reſolve upon a Religious courſe of life; <hi>Fear God and depart from evil;</hi> look beyond things preſent and ſenſible, unto things which are not ſeen, and are eternal; labour to ſecure the great intereſts of another world, and refer all the actions of this ſhort and dying life, to that ſtate which will ſhortly begin, but never have an end; and this will approve it ſelf to be <hi>Wiſdom</hi> at the laſt, what-ever the world judge of it now; for, not that which is approved of men <hi>now,</hi> but what ſhall <hi>finally</hi> be approved by God, is true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that which is eſteemed ſo by him who is the <hi>fountain</hi> and <hi>original</hi> of all wiſdom, the firſt <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of it, the beſt and moſt competent <hi>Judge</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>I deny not but many that are wicked, and neglect Religion, may think themſelves wiſe, and may enjoy this their deluſion for a while, but there is a time a coming, when the moſt profane and Atheiſtical, who now account it <hi>a piece of gallantry,</hi> and an argument of <hi>a great ſpirit,</hi> and of a more then common <hi>wit</hi> and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51554:29"/>
               <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to ſlight God, and baffle Religion, and to level all the diſcourſes of another world, with the <hi>Poetical deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Fairy Land:</hi> I ſay, there is a day a coming, when all theſe <hi>witty fools</hi> ſhall be unhappily undeceived, and not being able to enjoy their deluſion any longer, ſhall call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fools for ever.</p>
            <p>But why do I uſe arguments to perſwade men to that which is ſo <hi>excellent,</hi> ſo <hi>uſeful,</hi> and ſo <hi>neceſſary?</hi> The thing it ſelf I am preſſing you to, hath allurements in it beyond all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For, if Religion be the beſt knowledg and wiſdom, I cannot offer any thing beyond this to your underſtandings to raiſe your eſteem of it; I can preſent nothing beyond this to your Affections that may be attractive of your love and deſire. All that can be done, is to ſet the thing before men, and to offer it to their choice; and if mens natural deſire of wiſdom and knowledg and happineſs will not perſwade them to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, 'tis in vain to uſe Arguments: if the ſight of theſe Beauties will not charm mens Affections, 'tis to no purpoſe to go about to compel a liking, and to urge and puſh forward a a <hi>match</hi> to the making whereof <hi>conſent</hi> is neceſſary. <hi>Religion</hi> is matter of our freeſt choiſe; and if men will obſtinately and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet themſelves againſt it, there is no remedy, <hi>Pertinatiae nullum remedium poſuit Deus;</hi> If men will chooſe to befools, and to be miſerable, all that can be ſaid is this, God will leave ſuch perſons <hi>to in herit their own choice, to enjoy the portion of ſinners.</hi>
