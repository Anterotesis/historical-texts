            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Names</hi> to the Dedication. As firſt it may be looked upon as a very unhandſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt (to give it no worſe a word) in me to be <hi>unſeaſonably</hi> ripping up old ſores, and out of ſome private <hi>animoſity,</hi> to be blowing up thoſe coals which I ſhould cover, &amp; kindling that fire which I ſhould quench, at ſuch a time, when as <hi>all men</hi> ſhould <hi>contend</hi> for unity and concord; and <hi>ſtrive</hi> who ſhould be the forwardeſt to forget and forgive injuries, from the Command and Example of both our <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>King.</hi> As 2. it may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a very great (if not an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable) preſumption in me, to preſent a diſcourſe of ſuch a Subject as this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your <hi>Honored ſelves,</hi> whoſe utmoſt and unwearyed care hath been (and may it ſtill continue to be ſo) to <hi>compoſe</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate diviſions, and to cloſe up the even <hi>mortal</hi> wounds of our languiſhing both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be pleaſed therefore to hear my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> as well as my charge. For the firſt; I conceive it to be a <hi>duty incumbent</hi> upon <hi>every man,</hi> (and neceſſarily ſo) to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> (by wayes lawful and juſt) his own
<pb facs="tcp:57085:3"/>
               <hi>reputation,</hi> when it ſhall be groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, or notoriouſly ſlandered: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all infamous reports would be taken for truths; by our ſilence we confeſſing our own guilt, and acknowledging both the truth of the charge, and the juſtice of that power which hath rendred us as ſcandalous. This being (as I humbly conceive) rationally premiſed, will be I believe as eaſily condeſcended unto: and then I ſhall take the boldneſs to add, that pure <hi>Neceſsity</hi> enforced me to this <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> For ſo it was, that ſome of the <hi>Commiſsioners, Miniſters, witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> who have eaten my bread (bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke thinking, that they had not yet enough undone me) <hi>have,</hi> and ſtill <hi>do,</hi> upon all opportunities offered, or ſought, <hi>report</hi> me to the world for ſuch a one, ſo <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> ſo <hi>ignorant,</hi> as altogether unfit either to return to mine own living or to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any other: and that (whatever there might be wanting of <hi>power</hi> in them to <hi>inflict</hi> ſuch a ſentence on me, yet) there wanted not <hi>crime</hi> enough in me to <hi>deſerve</hi> it. In ſhort, they ſtand it out, in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own juſtice and godlineſs, and
<pb facs="tcp:57085:4"/>
would have the world believe, that I am altogether ſuch as they have laboured to repreſent me to the world. Now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this <hi>Narrative,</hi> is to let the world know, that theſe <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> whom I ſhall name by and by, have been as <hi>unjuſt</hi> towards me, as they were <hi>incompetent</hi> in <hi>Law.</hi> And (beſide, that their <hi>Commiſsion</hi> was derived from an uſurping power, and <hi>Tyrannical</hi>) that their Actings by that power were far more vile and odious, then their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> gave them licenſe unto.</p>
            <p>And for the 2. That I make my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to your <hi>honored ſelves:</hi> it was not only for this, becauſe you are the worthy <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of that <hi>County,</hi> where theſe things were tranſacted, and ſo no doubt would be moſt ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the behalf of any one whoſe truſt you have undertaken, ſo far forth as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity were on his ſide: But alſo for this reaſon; becauſe I have heard that ſome of thoſe who have not done me the leaſt wrong, have in a kind of menacing manner reported it, <hi>That they would acquaint your Honorable Court
<pb facs="tcp:57085:4"/>
with the Depoſitions which were taken againſt me</hi>: Which ſhould they have done, I could expect no other from them but that they ſhould act after their old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; and if ſo (conſidering the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe <hi>Commiſsioners, Miniſters, Clerks, Witneſſes,</hi> and how they had dealt with me before) they might have preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to the world, as a perſon notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly infamous. Had the <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> that were his Judges, or the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> that were the witneſſes againſt him, been the only reporters of the ſtory of <hi>Naboth</hi>; none would have ſaid that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> had been put to death unjuſtly. I have therefore preſum'd to publiſh to the world a report of their proceedings in my caſe, even as they were: tracing of them from day to day, from the firſt to the laſt; and all along keeping my ſelf ſo cloſe to that Copy of the <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> which I received from their <hi>Clerk,</hi> as that I have not willingly left out, altered or added ſo much as one word unto them. Beſide which (if you pleaſe to read this Narrative over, or but a few lines in my precautions to the Reader) you ſhall find
<pb facs="tcp:57085:5"/>
me charging them, both <hi>Commiſsioners, Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> with ſuch crimes which are not only odious in <hi>men</hi> as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; but with ſuch, which were looked, upon as vile and odious, by the more civil ſort of Heathens. And yet I have not charged them with a ſyllable which I am not able by proofs to make good upon them. And now let them publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh their Depoſitions, when, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to whom they pleaſe. I wiſh that they may preſent them to your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Court:</hi> having a confidence, that there we ſhall find ſuch Judges who are both wiſe and juſt. If they preſent the ſame which I here mention, (which were all I could get from their <hi>Clerk</hi>) you have here anſwers unto them. If they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent other Depoſitions, thoſe will be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of charge againſt none, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but wonder, that ſuch men as, theſe ſhould preſume ſo far as to talk of acquainting this <hi>honorable Court</hi> with their proceedings; or indeed dare to think of <hi>Parliaments</hi> but with trembling, or expect any thing from them
<pb facs="tcp:57085:5"/>
but puniſhment: ſince theſe very men (as to my buſineſs) then acted by that power, and were very zealous for that power, and were very bitter againſt thoſe that did not own that power, as they would have them. (One of their chiefeſt Articles againſt me, being this, <hi>That I was diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the preſent Government</hi>) when as it was by that preſent power (which they did then ſo much adore, and endeavoured ſo much to eſtabliſh) That our late gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>King</hi> was ſo barbarouſly <hi>murdered,</hi> and his <hi>Parliament ruined.</hi> And when I ſaid, I cannot but wonder at theſe men, my meaning is not only the <hi>Commiſsion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but <hi>Miniſters</hi> likewiſe: ſome whereof (if I have not been miſinformed) have had it in their thoughts, to Petition your <hi>Honorable Court,</hi> that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in thoſe Livings into which they unjuſtly intruded themſelves; and as unjuſtly diſpoſſeſt others of. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders having been their Judges, or elſe having had ſome other hand in eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and their crimes publiſhed abroad for <hi>infamous,</hi> and called by the names of <hi>Inſufficiency,</hi> or <hi>Scandal</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:57085:6"/>
when as the <hi>greateſt,</hi> if not the <hi>only ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> was, that they would not be <hi>Traitors,</hi> or <hi>ingage</hi> themſelves to <hi>break</hi> their Oaths, as many of them had done. What was this, but to Petition your <hi>High Court</hi> to confirm thoſe wrongs and grievances which you came to redreſs? Nay more, what was it but to beſeech your <hi>Honors</hi> to own and countenance that Power which had endeavoured the utter ruin of both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Heroick and matchleſs act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (for which our cheerful, although yet feeble Nation, doth honor and bleſs you) have I think, taken from ſome ſuch their hopes, and from others their fears. Go on <hi>Renowned Patriots,</hi> go on. And here let my humble lines addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>each Member</hi> of your Honorable Houſe: and not only ſo, but let me be pardoned my boldneſs, if I preſume to knock at the door of the <hi>other moſt Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Houſe likewiſe. My buſineſs is the ſame to both, it is but ſhort, and a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not <hi>To,</hi> but <hi>For</hi> you.

            <p>Although I ſee no matter of charge againſt me in this Depoſition, unleſs it were <hi>ſcandalous</hi> to be <hi>Loyal,</hi> yet let me add ſomething touching the perſon who thus depoſed, and with what affections he did it. I ſhall therefore here give thee to know, that this <hi>VVilliam Clement</hi> is Father in Law to <hi>VVilliam Pinchin,</hi> and that <hi>VVilliam Pinchin</hi> hath had a great hand over him, and hath <hi>frightned</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him to do that which

ſcarcely been acted ſince <hi>Cain,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> lived upon the Earth, (All which I could then, and at this preſent can eaſily prove) would never have taken him for a <hi>credible</hi> witneſſe, or have countenanced him as an <hi>Informer,</hi> or <hi>Solicitor,</hi> no nor ſo much as looked on him, unleſs it had been in <hi>deteſtation.</hi> But now none more forward to withſtand and oppoſe this then Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> who knew much of it to be true, but was not willing 'tis like, that it ſhould come to the knowledge of theſe <hi>Gent.</hi> for fear that he ſhould thereby have loſt ſo pretious a <hi>witneſs,</hi> or perhaps for fear that he ſhould have heard ſomething which would have neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>reflected</hi> on himſelf. This <hi>Doctor</hi> then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that there had been ſome ſmall <hi>differences</hi> between them, praying that no more words might be made of it; together with an intimation that all differences were now compoſed, or to ſome ſuch purpoſe: In order whereunto <hi>William Pinchin</hi> produces a large Paper which he had then in readineſs, written by himſelf, containing a large ſtory of his own making, acknowledging that there had been ſome <hi>ſmall differences among them</hi>; that he had 500 <hi>l.</hi> with his Wife; and that all was now compoſed and well; or to that purpoſe. This Paper (being ſolemnly delivered in) was deliberately read by Mr. <hi>Bliſſet</hi>: That Mr. <hi>Bliſſet</hi> which would not then allow of <hi>couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57085:45"/>
and <hi>Curſing,</hi> and <hi>Paricide</hi> to be ſufficient exceptions againſt him or any man in point of Teſtimony. Theſe 'tis like he looked on as Circumſtances; and to tell thee my mind, when I had obſerved the manner of their proceedings. I could not but think of thoſe <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> that condemned <hi>Naboth</hi>; who (notwithſtanding that they knew the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which appeared againſt him to be <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> notwithſtanding they knew them to be falſe Witneſſes of their <hi>own making,</hi> yet) paſſed ſentence according to that falſe evidence which they themſelves had put into the Witneſſes mouths. But to return to the Paper, of all other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I cannot forget this that he ſayes. <hi>That now all differences were compoſed</hi>; belike he means betwixt his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>himſelf.</hi> And ſuch another Certificate might <hi>Cain</hi> have framed and delivered in, and have ſaid, that All was now ſweetly compoſed, and there were new no differences remaining betwixt him and his <hi>Brother,</hi> for that he himſelf had <hi>murdered</hi> him ſome certain years before. That good old man <hi>William Pinchins</hi> Father was dead near three years before this time: and although I cannot but believe that <hi>God gathered him to his Grave in peace</hi>: (ſo knowing what I know) I cannot think otherwiſe but that this Son of his <hi>haſtened his fall</hi>; and ſo although the Father were

And although our Lawes repute none <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides</hi> but ſuch who lay violent hands on their <hi>Parents,</hi> and by ſome <hi>blows</hi> and <hi>wounds</hi> give them ſome <hi>viſible</hi> cauſe of <hi>death</hi>; yet I doubt not, but that <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> will look upon many for <hi>Paricides</hi> whom our Lawes do not reach; nor ſee I any cauſe to doubt of it, but that he who with <hi>Frights,</hi> with <hi>Threats,</hi> with <hi>Curſes</hi>

And I could adviſe Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> to admoniſh <hi>William Pinchin</hi> that he would ſadly conſider of it in <hi>this his day</hi>: And I am confident of it, that they had done better ſervice both to the <hi>Church of God</hi> and to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> if (in ſtead of <hi>incouraging</hi> him to ſwear <hi>falſly</hi> and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> himſelf, and <hi>inſtructing others</hi> to doe the like) they had ſpent ſome pains with him to have made him know,

            <p n="1">1. That the time when as <hi>John Travers</hi> came to <hi>Box,</hi> was in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1648. which is much more then <hi>four years before</hi> June, 1656. <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtance for Mr.</hi> Bliſſet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What other order he had I know not, but I am ſure that he then <hi>acted</hi> by <hi>vertue of: forged Warrant</hi> written as from Mr. <hi>Edward Stokes, his name</hi> likewiſe being <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> unto it; but <hi>diſavowed</hi> by that <hi>Gentleman,</hi> as neither

               <hi>written by him,</hi> or by his <hi>conſent</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be contrived by <hi>Thomas Webb, John Travers</hi> his Brother in law. That <hi>Webb</hi> who is ſo notorious for infamie with Mr. <hi>Henry Whites</hi> late wife; this <hi>Webb</hi> being at that time in the company, and a very buſie man among them. By which you may gueſs <hi>John Travers</hi> to have been a very unfitting man to be looked on as a <hi>credible witneſs,</hi> when as I could then, and can yet prove him guilty of ſuch <hi>Crimes</hi> which our <hi>Law</hi> puniſheth with <hi>Pillorie, loſs of Ears, ſlitting of noſtrils,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 14.</note> and <hi>ſcaring with an hot Iron,</hi> and it may be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally preſumed, that he who will for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage make one man ſay what he never thought of, will likewiſe for a like advantage make another man do, what he never did.</p>
            <p>And 3. whereas he adds that there were <hi>addreſſes</hi> made by me to him, I muſt tell thee that this is like the reſt. <hi>I make addreſſes to John Travers?</hi> I had known the fellow above <hi>thirty years</hi> before; yet cannot remember that he was ever ſo high, or my ſelf ſo low, as that I ſhould either need or fear him. And ſayes he, that I made <hi>Addreſſes</hi> unto him? And theſe <hi>ſeveral addreſſes</hi>; whereas I am ſure that I could have made him confeſs, that I was then never but once where he was; and then my buſineſs was to <hi>Colonel Eyre,</hi> and not to <hi>John Travers.</hi> And next he addes that <hi>Major Hunt</hi> and others came from my houſe.

And <hi>whereas he ſayes that they had there drank very hard,</hi> it muſt be replyed that it was more then <hi>John Travers</hi> knew whether they drank ſo much as a drop there, he ſaw it not, for he was not in the houſe, and therefore what he ſwears is either upon conjecture or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.

they <hi>turn</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> where there were ſome <hi>ringing</hi>; where this <hi>John Thrift</hi> takes a rope from one that was ringing, and ſoon after delivers it to him again, as you have it in <hi>Richard Cottles</hi> Depoſition, to which I refer you. Now ſoon after this he eſpying the <hi>Tower door open,</hi> ariſes from the ſeat to which he had retired himſelf after his ringing, and beckning to one to follow him, <hi>goes up the ſtairs,</hi> as 'tis thought, to <hi>ſee how they tol'd the great Bell in the Tower,</hi> and being (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) utterly unacquainted with the place, as he who followed him likewiſe was, going up a Ladder about 12 rounds, whether by <hi>a blow from the trap door,</hi> or from the <hi>Bell,</hi> or from the <hi>wheel,</hi> or by what other <hi>ſad accident</hi> it is not known, <hi>he fell from the Ladder as it is thought upon a piece of Timber lying in a nether loft, and was taken up dead.</hi> This as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death.

For thy further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this particular, I ſhall now acquaint thee with the <hi>falſe pretences</hi> and <hi>lies</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal <hi>Sanders,</hi> or ſuch as acted for him, got hands to that forementioned <hi>Certificate</hi> which Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> ſo tenderly delivered in.

paſt.</hi> Doubting (as it was informed) that otherwiſe his Teſtimony would not be taken, in regard of his former infamies, being both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and frequent. Such, as I have heard, was his relation; but I muſt tell thee that this relation was falſe in every particular. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sanders</hi> dreads an <hi>Aſſize</hi> or <hi>Seſſions</hi> as much or far more then he doth a <hi>Peſt-houſe</hi>; nor can you fright him worſe then to tell him that he muſt appear there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>Certificate</hi> pretended for the <hi>Aſſize</hi> at <hi>Sarum</hi> (where <hi>Sanders</hi> did not appear, nor had he any buſineſs there) was delivered in <hi>three weeks</hi> before at <hi>Marlborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This Certificate deſired to enable <hi>him to take an Oath,</hi> was framed and delivered in after <hi>the Oath</hi> was taken. So that <hi>Sanders</hi> or <hi>his agents</hi> have herein notoriouſly falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and impoſed upon his neighbours at <hi>Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penham,</hi> as ſome of them (if I have not been miſ-informed) have acknowledged: proteſting againſt it, and complaining that he hath groſly abuſed them, in <hi>procuring their hands with a lying pretence,</hi> &amp; <hi>afterward carrying them to ſuch a place, and uſing them to ſuch a purpoſe, which was contrary both to his pretence and their intention.</hi> So that we have here that old piece of <hi>Policy</hi> practiſed, <hi>Scelere velandum eſt ſcelus,</hi> one, a former wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs covered with a latter; falſe-ſwearing plaiſtered over with a lie; by <hi>lying</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures

Now I do not wonder that <hi>William Pinchin, Nicholas Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, William Sanders</hi> and <hi>Obadiah Cheltenham</hi> ſhould contrive and practiſe ſuch unworthy courſes; my wonder is, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſhould ſo <hi>demurely</hi> put to his helping hand for the promoting of them; nay that he ſhould be more forward then <hi>William Pinchin</hi>: and readier to call for it then <hi>William Pinchin</hi> was to deliver it in.

by a power which had murdered our <hi>King, The common Father of us all,</hi> and many of their <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> beſide.

            <p n="1">1. Sarah Rainalds <hi>who keeps the Alehouſe aforeſaid ſayes that Mr.</hi> Buſhnell <hi>ſeldom came to her houſe but in Pariſh buſineſs; nor hath he been there this half year, and the laſt time not to drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p>This is every word which we have as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them, when as 'tis well known that

their Depoſitions were very much longer.

I had it not at that time in my head, but now let me mind them of one thing more, of which I have ſome confidence, and it is this. That had theſe <hi>women</hi> by virtue of thoſe Oaths which they had then taken, been demanded, Whether they had never ſeen <hi>William Pinchin</hi> drinking to <hi>exceſſe</hi> in their houſes? they muſt have anſwered that (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much againſt their wils, when they knew not how to be rid of him) he hath been <hi>drinking,</hi> and <hi>ſmoking,</hi> and <hi>quarelling,</hi> and <hi>drivel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> ſo long, that he hath made himſelf worſe then a beaſt; yea and that (this would have been proved too) he hath there <hi>diſgorged</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſay not into his <hi>Hat,</hi> but as ſeemly as one that uttered his minde, having overcharged himſelf with <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Quince pie.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

               <hi>That none ſhould be in bearing but the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and their ſubordinates.</hi>

            <p>I have a conjecture, that Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> (if not the ſole Author, yet) was a main promoter of it, becauſe he was ſo zealous, that it ſhould be obſerv'd, and alſo gave ſome reaſons why it was made: for when ſome of the <hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,</hi> (I having expreſſed my ſelf, that it ſhould have been indifferent to me if the doors were thrown open, and that all that would might come in) urged that others might be admitted, Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> inſiſts upon the <hi>Order,</hi> adding ſomething by way of a ſeeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof for their inconſtancy, <hi>Nay if you will not ſtand to your Order Gentlemen</hi>; and then gives the reaſons which moved them to make and to keep it, and that was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if all were admitted, then would the whole Countrey know what Queſtions they propoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what if they had heard or known them? were your <hi>Queſtions</hi> ſuch that you were <hi>aſhamed</hi> that they ſhould be known? or was it for fear the <hi>Countrey</hi> ſhould (hearing your Queſtions and my Anſwers) think better of me then you were willing? and have been apt to diſcharge me whom you were reſolved
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57085:119"/>
to ruine? But it may be Mr. <hi>Byfields</hi> reaſon that <hi>all ſhould be excluded,</hi> was not that the Countrey might not know what Queſtions they propoſed, but that the Countrey might not take notice that Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> propoſed no Queſtion at all; for I remember not that by way of queſtion he ſaid ſo much as a word to me.

another <hi>Order</hi> which I would not deliver back again to him; this <hi>order</hi> I had then about me and a very wiſe one it was, for I was <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at my peril to deliver up poſſeſſion by ſuch a time; and yet no perſon named to whom I ſhould deliver it up,</hi> but this, as nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was waved <hi>likewiſe.</hi> Another exception which they took was, that I was worth 500 <hi>l.</hi> and this was managed by Mr. <hi>Stern,</hi> and <hi>W.
