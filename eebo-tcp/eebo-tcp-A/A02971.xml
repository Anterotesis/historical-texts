            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords and Maiſters, vvhen I call to mind that this foure yeares ſpace I haue bene the argument of the tragoedies of <hi>France,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke of my neighbours, the ſubiect of ciuile arms, &amp; by reaſon of theſe arms, of a world of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: when I doe conſider that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a caſualtie to come, ſeparated as far from the thoughts of Frenchmen as from my deſire, ſome men haue cauſed this realme to feele the preſence of infinite calamities, and that vpon the vaine &amp; imaginarie feare of my ſucceſſion to this eſtate, they haue framed and in a maner erected an vſurpation: when with theſe eies, which God hath principally giuen me to haue them alwaies open for the good of my countrie, beholding theſe continuall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, I am conſtrained to ſee my countrie on fire, hir prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pillers burnt, hir beſt townes conſumed to aſhes, and that in ſteed of bringing water to quench theſe flames, to endeuour to ſaue that which yet remaineth ſound (as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and willingly would haue done, in ſuch ſort that it might neuer burſt foorth againe) they do enforce me, in ſpight of my teeth, to caſt my ſelfe into the fire, and to make my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb facs="tcp:12917:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
almoſt as odious as the violences which thoſe men vſe that perſecute me: either I ſhould bee of all ſenceleſle men the moſt voide of ſence that euer was, or elſe it muſt needs bee, that vpon conſideration of the publike eſtate my ſoule bee tormented a thouſand times a daye with vexations and greefes, ſuch as no hell is able to affourd the like: eſpecially feeing I knowe that of all theſe misfortunes the malitious make me the authour, the ignorant the cauſe, and I my ſelfe (though I may be very well forborne and pardoned in this caſe) do terme my ſelfe the occaſion. But as touching my particular eſtate, ſince it is my hap to be born in ſuch an age) when I lay before mee that which God hath done for mee in the beginning, middle, and continuance of theſe laſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: howe many witneſſes he hath affourded me of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of my cauſe and mine innocencie, not onely in Fraunce, but alſo in forreigne nations, not within the hearts of my friends, but euen within the mouthes of thoſe which are none of my wel-willers: not within the opinion of vulgare conceits, but (God knoweth) within the ſoule and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of my king: how by many effects hee hath cauſed it to appeare that he hath care of me, hauing miraculouſly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaued, &amp; aſſured me from the forces againſt which there was no likelihood that I ſhould be able to make head: ſurely if I were of an other ſpirit than I am, I ſhould haue as much reaſon to pleaſe my ſelfe with the particular of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, as the publike is greeuous vnto me: My lords and maiſters, I cannot do it, I will neuer account baſely of my countrie, I wil alwaies prefer the welfare thereof before mine owne: and they ſhall alwaies ſee that my miſhaps, my hinderances, and mine afflictions, ſhall runne before thoſe of my countrie. But neuertheleſſe I cannot conceale the contentment which I receaue, in that by all the occaſions which haue beene offered, I haue cauſed it to bee made manifeſt both by my actions, by my words, and by my writings, howe it greeues mee at the very heart to ſee the miſeries wherein we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to imbarque our ſelues: were it not that the examples
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12917:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paſſed did make vs ſomewhat more circumſpect for that which is to come. This you know to be true, and <hi>I</hi> beleeue there is no man at this preſent ſo paſsionate, which can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie me this witneſſe which comforts me not a little, beeing fully perſuaded, that beſide the vprightneſſe of my cauſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath more aſſwaged the wrath of God towardes mee, nothing hath mooued him more to defend mee, than this. But if it had pleaſed God to haue put into the hearts of the King my ſouereign, and of you my Lords, that <hi>I</hi> might haue beene called to the aſſemblie, which ſome of your deputies held at <hi>Bloyes</hi> (as truely me ſeemeth I ought to haue beene) and that I had beene permitted freely to haue propounded that which I take to be for the profit of this eſtate, <hi>I</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it plainely to appeare, how I had not the deſire only in my heart, the words in my mouth, but the effects and deeds readie in my handes, how <hi>I</hi> ſeeke no ſtarting holes to ſhroud my ſelfe in, nor propoſitions coloured with faire words, to the which by no meanes I meane to tye my ſelfe. And to the contrary, that I haue a good reſolution, and earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the greatneſſe of the King and realme, as much as may be, yea though it were with the loſſe of mine owne, and that when all the reſt ſhall bee diſpoſed, hee ſhall not neede to treat nor to capitulate with me: my conſcience aſſuring mee that nothing hath euer made mee to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe, but the conſideration of him, and regard of mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But ſeeing this is not doone which might very well haue beene performed (and that France may count it for one of hir ouerſights, that ſhee harh had no better phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than thoſe which delighte to continue hir ſickneſſe) I meane to giue you to vnderſtande by this diſcourſe, both that which I thinke to bee my dutie, as alſo that which I eſteeme neceſſary for the ſeruice of God, and the King my liege, and for the good of this realme: to the ende that all the ſubiects of this crowne may be inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that all men may know for my diſcharge my intent and innocencie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:12917:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Firſt I will repreſent vnto you mine eſtate: not for to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie myſelfe (for let me make neuer ſo great reckoning of my ſelfe, God may abaſe me) nor for to tell you that I ſpeake a cock-horſſe and at much eaſe (the ſame God knoweth, wherein reſteth my contentment, wherein I truſt, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I principally rely) but to the end I may manifeſt vnto you two things: the one, The condition of theſe miſerable warres, the aduantage that mine enemies haue had againſt me, how mightily they haue aſſailed me, how greatly they haue bene furthered thereby: that at leaſt you may be forced to iudge without paſsion, that God hath not preſerued mee againſt ſuch huge forces without a miracle: and that this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhould not haue bene, if innocency and good right of iuſtice had not bene on my ſide. The other that I may make you iudges, whether that which I now ſay, I ſpeake of feare, whether I haue occaſion to vſe flattering words for dread of a more ſouere chaſtiſement, then that which I haue alreadie felt, whether it be the doubt of mine owne ruine that makes me complaine: or to the contrary whether it bee the true ſence and feeling of the miſeries of my countrie, the loue of peace, and greatneſſe of <hi>France,</hi> which wreſteth from mee this manner of ſpeech. I ſhould play the ſoldior, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould tell you in order what armies within theſe foure yeares haue purſued me, that would cauſe you to thinke that I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to recount vnto you my valure; No, that is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I would to God I had neuer bene a captaine, ſeing that my firſt training vp in arms muſt bee learned with ſo great loſſe. I ſhould do far better to demaund of you what chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are left in <hi>France,</hi> beſide thoſe which haue bene ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. I haue ſeene in foure yeares ten armies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ten lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the King, hauing attending them at their heeles the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

You take this for no glorie: it is ſo far from me to go about to withdraw you from this opinion, that my ſelfe doe tell you that of theſe ten armies, I haue had to doe in effect but with one, which I haue beaten and diſcomfited. And in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12917:4"/>
this God did perticularly vſe my meanes for their ruine: but in all the other I haue not beene put to any labour at all: they haue beene vtterlye conſumed before they haue ſeene me: and I haue aſſoone had intelligence of their diſperſing, as of their leuying. The Angell the ſcourge of God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them the power and meanes to annoy me. It is not to mee to whome the glorye heereof apperteineth: I haue ſhewed you almoſt nothing of mine owne: but in effect, you may vnderſtand of your deputies, which are in thoſe prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they of the religion haue had ſome places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, what ſucceſſe their exploits haue had. Conſider the eſtate wherein they ſtood before the warre, and that wherein they are at this houre: and iudge aduiſedly, to what end hath serued this foure yeares ſpace the loſſe of the liues of a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, the expences of a mine of golde, the ruine of the people of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> inſomuch as they had made a better market, and more eaſie to be compaſſed, if they had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the diſcomfiture of the <hi>Ottomanes,</hi> or to ioine all the realmes of Chriſtendome to our crowne?</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible but that theſe things ſhould mooue you, and that you ſhould note heereby that this is an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie worke and effect. Moreouer I ſay this vnto you, that as this ought wholy to cauſe you to lift your eyes and hands to heauen, acknowledging that if you fight againſt God, you fight in vaine: in like ſorte ought I to powre foorth my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before him, that hee will keepe mee from being puft vp with theſe proſperities, and to attribute the glory heereof to him alone: being moſt aſſured, that if I do otherwiſe, he will turne his louing countenance from me, and will in two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths giue more aduantage to my enemies againſt me, then I haue in foure yeare found fauour at his hands.</p>
            <p>I hope by his grace not to behaue my ſelfe otherwiſe then dutifullye. And therefore my meaning is that this diſcourſe ſhall proclaime throughout all the world in my name: That today <hi>I</hi> am as ready to requeſt of the King my Lorde, peace, the quiet of his realme, and mine owne reſt, as euer <hi>I</hi> was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12917:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heeretofore. I had at the beginning of theſe warres, regard of my conſcience and honour, which I alwaies haue, &amp; yet doe beſeech his Maieſtie to leane to me intier. The wars haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed nothing therefrom, neither haue they added any thing, that may make me vnwilling to giue care to a motion of peace <hi>I</hi> do therefore moſt humbly beſeech it. and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching you my lords &amp; maiſters, I thinke if you had loued the king, if you had loued his eſtate, if you had diſerned theſe euils and their remedies, you ſhould haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded your deputies which were at this aſſemblie to haue begun &amp; fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their concluſions for the obtaining thereof. I intreate &amp; admoniſh you to further it as much as you may.</p>
            <p>I know very well that in their pamphlets they haue inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this generall maxime, That there ought to be but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in one realme, and that the foundation of an eſtate is pietie which cannot be in that place, where God is diuerſly and by conſequence badly ſerued I affirme it is ſo: I ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people complaine thereof, few that will ſeeke to redreſſe it. But I haue alwaies ſubmitted my ſelfe to reaſon, and yet do offer, that if they will trie the vſuall and accuſtomed waye in theſe caſes, and if there be any extraordinarie waies that they will labour to ſearche them out: both I and all they of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will alwaies conforme our ſelues to that which a free generall counſell ſhall determine; this is the true way, this is the only way, which hath in all ages beene put in practiſe by this way we will ſuffer, and with pacience endure to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But to beleeue that by dinte of ſword this may be obteined of vs: I thinke (before God) that it is a thing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither impoſſible, and in trueth the ſucceſſe and euent dooth ſhew no leſſe.</p>
            <p>It were but ſuperfluous to diſcourſe at large of this matter, being already ſufficiently argued and diſputed. They haue often ſummoned me to change my religion: but after what manner? with the dagger at my throne. If <hi>I</hi> had had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto my conſcience, yet the regarde of mine honour would haue withheld mee from conſenting in that ſort. Was

there euer any of that opinion, that a man might kil a Turke, a naturall Pagan, kill him (I ſay) for his religion, before hee hath aſſared to conuert him? yet I ſuppoſe that my greateſt enemies, doe not thinke mee to be more eſtranged from the feare and knowledge of GOD, then a Turke, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are more cruell againſt mee, then againſt this infidell.</p>
            <p>What would the moſt affectionate vnto the Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion report of me, if hauing liued this thirty yeare after one ſort, they ſhould ſuddenly ſee me change my religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in hope of a kingdome? What would they report of mee, that haue ſeene and tried my courage, if ſhamfully I ſhould abandon for feare, the manner wherein I haue ſerued God from the very day of my natiuitie? Theſe be reaſons which touch the honour of this world. But to come to the maine point; What conſcience hauing beene nouriſhed, inſtructed, and trained vp in a profeſſion of faithe, would vnaduiſedly without anye ſpeech or reaſoning thereof, in a moment betake himſelfe to the contrary ſide? No (my lords and maſters) that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be the king of <hi>Nauarr,</hi> were there thirtie kingdomes to be gained thereby: ſo farre is it from him to goe againſt his conſcience for the hope of one alone. Teach me better, I am not ſelfe wild; take ſome courſe to inſtruct me, you ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereby at length; for if you ſhewe mee anye other trueth, then that which I now beleeue, I will ſubmit my ſelfe, and doo more then that; for I am ſure there is not any one of my partie, which will not likewiſe yeeld himſelfe together with me. You ſhall make a goodly gaine to GOD, and notable conqueſt of conſciences, in vanquiſhing mee alone. But to feede vs with wordes without reaſon, and to goe about to induce vs to bee perſwaded by the onelye countenance of ſome; iudge (my Lordes and Maiſters) if this bee reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>But to let this paſſe; if you ſimplie deſire my welfare, I thanke you, if you doe not long for my conuerſion, for feare leaſt one daye <hi>I</hi> ſhoulde by violence conſtrayne you

to alter your religion: you do me wrong to iudge ſo, ſeing I haue alwaies miſliked ſuch kinde of proceedings: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my liuing and behauiour, both with my freends and with mine enemies, at home and in the field, may giue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe of my diſpoſicion: the townes where <hi>I</hi> nowe am, and which of late I wonne, can beare me record thereof. Neither is it likely that a handfull of people of my religion, can enforſe an infinite number of catholikes to that paſſe, whereto this infinite number hath not beene able to reduce this handfull. And if I haue with ſo ſmall forces fought and ſuſteined this quarrell ſo long time: what may they then do who with ſuch and ſo great meanes may oppoſe themſelues moſt forciblie againſt my conſtraint, conſiſting of ſo ſmall ability? It were no wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e for me to take that courſe.

In the meane ſeaſon let vs not trouble our ſelues ſo much with a thing ſo long to come, that wee forget the preſent eſtate wherein conſiſteth our ſpeciall welfare.</p>
            <p>God hath cauſed this day the depth of their deſignements and endeuours which troubled this eſtate, to be diſcouered: hee hath alſo laid open my intents. None of you, none of <hi>Fraunce</hi> is ignorant heereof. Is it not a miſerable thing that there is not one from the leaſt to the greateſt in this realme, who ſeeth not this miſcheife, who exclaimeth not againſt theſe broiles, who termeth them not the continuall and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall feuer of this eſtate, and yet none openeth his mouth to find remedy therefore: That in all this aſſemblie of <hi>Bloyes,</hi> none dare pronounce this ſacred word, Peace, that worde, in whoſe effect conſiſteth the good of this realme?

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12917:6"/>
that God hath ſent a declining eſtate vnto this relme.</p>
            <p>Our eſtate is extreame ſicke, euerye one ſeeth it: by all ſignes and apparances it is iudged, that the cauſe of this euill is the ciuill warre; a malady almoſt incurable, of which no eſtate did euer yet recouer: or if it hath beene releeued, if this appoplexie hath not ſpred ouer all, it hath at leaſt beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into a palſey, to the ytter ſpoile of halfe of the bodye. What remedy then? no other then peace: which affourdeth comfort to the heart of this realme: which by orderly dyet expelleth the rebellious and noyſome humors, purgeth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and repleniſheth the body with pure blood, good humoures, and ſound mindes, which in ſumme, cauſeth it to flouriſh and liue. This is the operation which peace wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, which ought to be craued at Gods hands for the onely remedy, for the onely meanes of health: who ſo ſeeketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies in ſteed of curing will poiſon this realme.</p>
            <p>I then coniure you all by this writing, aſwell Catholikes ſeruitors of the King my Lorde, as thoſe which are not ſo: I appeale vnto you as <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> I ſummon you to take pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this eſtate: to take pittie of your ſelues, whoſe ſteps are vndermined in ſuch ſorte, that if you doo not looke to your ſelues betimes, ruine and deſtruction will ouertake you: to take pittie of me, whom you conſtraine perforce to beholde, to ſuffer, and to doo thoſe things, which were it not in the middeſt of theſe armes, I had rather dye a thouſand deaths then to behold, ſuffer, or doo. I coniure you to diſperſe and abandon all at once, the miſerable humors and effects of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and warres, which doe rente and diſmember this renouned eſtate, which doe withdrawe vs, ſome by force, others ouerwillingly from the obedience of our King: which cauſes vs to imbrue our ſelues with the blood one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: &amp; which hath already ſo often made vs the laughing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocke of ſtrangers, and in the end will make vs to bee theyr conqueſt.

and to poſſeſſe your ſelues with the ſpirit of concord: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſmalleſt eſtates haue become mightie Empires, and ours hath along time flouriſhed the moſt renowned king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of all Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>Although I haue a thouſand and a thouſand occaſions, particularlye to complaine of thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> of them (ſay I) for my kindred, and kindred ſo neere, that beſide thoſe of my name, I haue none neerer. And although that in generall, Fraunce hath more occaſion then I: yet God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what a greefe it was to me, to ſee them take that courſe which my heart alwaies gaue mee, would neuer ſorte vnto their honour. God is my witneſſe I tooke them to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and profitable for the Kings ſeruice: and (I may ſay) auadeable alſo for my ſelfe, ſeeing they had the honor to be of my kindred, &amp; that my degree was aboue &amp; before theirs. I was alwaies, and ſhould haue beene verye glad to haue ſcene them imploy thoſe meanes that God and nature had affourded them, for the good and faithfull ſeruice of them, whom they ought dutifully to haue ſerued: in ſteede whereof, when their wicked counſels did enforſe them to a contrary kind of dealing, there were in the worlde (though not my ſelfe) that did laugh at their miſfortune, and woulde haue bin ful wel apaid to haue ſcen the diſpleaſure, declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; armes of the king my Lord conuerted againſt them.</p>
            <p>Let vs not waxe proud, neither the one ſide nor the other: as for my part although I haue receiued more fauour of God in this warre, then in all the former: and that whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two factions (what hard hap is it that I am forced to terme them ſo?) haue we akened themſelues: mine in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance is ſtrengthened: yet I know very well that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and as often as I ſhall ſet aſide my dutie: God will leaue to bleſſe me any longer: and I ſhould wholye neglect it, if without reaſon; and of a iolitie of heart, I ſhould oppoſe my ſelfe againſt my king, and trouble the quiet of his countrie.</p>
            <p>As touching them, who during theſe foure laſt yeares haue loued armes better then peace: who haue firſt renued the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12917:7"/>
warre in this eſtate, &amp; haue erected the third faction, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the fidelitie of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and (to go a little further) vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the loialtie of their Grandfathers. Seeing God hath ſhewed them by his iudgements, that their dealings are not agreeable to his will: ſeeing naytheleſſe that he hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the heart of our King, to receaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his accuſtomed mildneſſe and clemencie (as himſelfe hath declared) let them yet at the laſt hould themſelues contented &amp; quiet. We haue all of vs offered and indured harmes inough, we haue bin this foure yeare togither continually beſotted, outragious, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtarkemad. Is not this enough, trow you? hath not God ſufficiently beaten and corrected vs, both the one part &amp; the other, to cauſe vs to awake from our careleſſe ſecuritie, to make vs wiſe in the end, and to ſuppreſſe our furies?</p>
            <p>But if after this it be lawfull that as a moſt humble &amp; loiall ſubiect of the King my Lord, <hi>I</hi> may giue ſome good aduiſe to thoſe which may counſell him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath euer heard it ſpoken, that that ſtate can endure, where there are two facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within it, alwaies vp in armes, and readye the one to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the other? what ſhall then become of ours, where there are three? how may a man perſwade the king to raiſe ciuill warre, and that againſt two parties all at one inſtant? There is no preſident, no hiſtorie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no reaſon that can aſſure him a good iſſue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and euent heereof.

            <p>Hauing ſpoken to all men in particular, I will yet ſaye this in generall. Bee it that God bleſſe the purpoſes of our King, and that he reduce all the mutinies of his realme to an end: it were a lamentable caſe that he ſhould cauſe all thoſe to be puniſhed which doo deſerue it. What? ſhall hee take reuenge of a great parte of his townes, of a great parte of his ſubiects? that were to much, that were a miſchiefe, that were a madneſſe, ſent by God into this realme for the puniſhment of our tranſgreſſions. Hee muſt beare no more diſpleaſure to our people, &amp; to our townes, then to a frantike fellow when hee fighteth, or to a mad man when he runneth about ſtarke naked.</p>
            <p>Bee it to the contrarye that thoſe of the league ſhall ſtrengthen themſelues in ſuch ſort, that they ſhall be able to reſiſt him (as ſurely there is ſome likelihood, &amp; I feare me that

            <p>My Lordes, and maiſters, I ſpeake alſo to you, whome I know to my vnſpeakeable ſorrow, not to be compoſed all of one humor.

            <p>If you haue neuer ſo ſmall iudgement, you cannot but beleeue with mee, that I am in great hazarde, that the Kinge is ſo, that the thirde partye is ſo, that your ſelues in generall and each one in particular are ſo.

            <p>And as touching thoſe which ſtill reteine the name and partie of the league, I coniure them as Frenchmen heerevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: I would willinglye commaund them, yet as thoſe which haue the honour to be of my kindred; whoſe Fathers (I am aſſured) would haue taken ſuch a commaundement for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great fauour.
