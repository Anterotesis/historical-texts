         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Dedicate This to your
Lordship, and if any
shall ask the <hi>Reason,</hi> I know
<pb facs="tcp:58008:3"/>
no other than what all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
knows as well as I, and
that is the place you hold
in the Church, and in the
Esteem of the Learned
World, your great and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
Worth, your Skill
in the profoundest Sciences,
of which your Excellent
Works of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> and
particularly your Praelecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

demonstration. Those
that know either your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

can be said, and for my part
I am not inclined to fawn
upon any Person.</p>

I cannot expect, my Lord,
you should approve of this

I persuade my self your
Lordship will not be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at the good meaning of
the Offerer. I need not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THou seest here that I
have sent a short Essay
into the World; and I doubt
not but it will be an evident
Conviction to all sober Minds
of the <hi>Presaging Nature</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:58008:5"/>
Comets. That which I have
to say in behalf of the Piece is
this, that I never met with so
much on this Theme in any
Writer, whether English or
Latin, or of any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
If I had, I protest to
Thee seriously I would not have
troubled Thee with this Essay
of mine. To be plain, if what
is here presented be not the
most rational and impartial,
the fullest and best Account
that hath hitherto been given
of the Doctrine of <hi>Comets,</hi>
and of <hi>Judiciary Astrology,</hi>
I am sure it is that which I
intended should look something
like it. Nor do I pronounce
this in Ostentation, for I have
<pb facs="tcp:58008:5"/>
considered the Point it self,
and I have likewise read other
Mens Accounts. I may say
with <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen.</hi> Nat-Qu. 1. 7. c. 29.</note> (in the Book
where he purposely treats of
Comets) That I have search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and enquired <hi>nec cum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducia
inveniendi, nec sine
Spe.</hi> I abandoned all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi>
and <hi>Presumption</hi> in
this present Inquisition, but
withall I <hi>Despaired not</hi> of
attaining to True Notions and
Sentiments in this matter. I
hope it will not be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as an unpardonable Crime,
that I have got out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Road sometimes, or when
I light into it, that I keep
not pace with other Travellers.
<pb facs="tcp:58008:6"/>
I declare I am for a free and
rational way of thinking and
discoursing. I have a great fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for Rabbi <hi>Achiva</hi>'s Advice,
<hi>Ne coquas in eadem olla in
qua socius tuus jam coxerit,</hi>
Do not blindly adhere to what
others have maintained. Brag
not of other Mens Inventions,
but shew something of thy own.</p>
            <p>I might tell the Reader that
I have endeavoured to proceed
with all Caution and Modesty,
and have avoided the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which generally lies upon
those who handle this Subject,
<hi>viz.</hi> their fond and idle way
of <hi>Pointing peremptorily at
such and such particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58008:6"/>
which shall <hi>certainly</hi>
follow the Appearance of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.
Besides, I have in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
things studied to deliver
my self with all <hi>Moderation,</hi>
which I am sure will not be
displeasing to those who are
Masters of Reason and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
I could have said much
more upon the Subject. The
Reader may perceive from the
numerous heap of particulars
here inserted, that I might
have spun this Discourse into a
far greater Length, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it into a larger Size. I
have <hi>hinted</hi> Arguments, and
<hi>contracted</hi> some Topicks,
which I could easily have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.
But I was unwilling
<pb facs="tcp:58008:7"/>
to be tedious, and I had a
mind the Reader should rise
with an Appetite. As for the
<hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>Envious,</hi> and such
who resolve that none shall see
any thing of theirs in Publick,
I expect that they should cavil
at my Endeavours. They that
<hi>sit still</hi> and <hi>cannot afford to
write,</hi> are the <hi>dreadfullest
Objectors,</hi> the <hi>sorest Criticks</hi>
of all. I have nothing to add
now, but to bid defiance to
Them, and to wish the Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Candid Reader to doe
so too.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
OF THE
Original, Substance, Place,
Time, Magnitude, Motion, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Colour, Figure, Kinds, Names,
and more especially the Prognosticks,
Significations and Presages
OF
COMETS.</head>
            <p>I Have observed that some of
late, who think they make
no inconsiderable figure in
the Age, have bore up very brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against that common and so
long received Opinion, That the
Appearance of Comets is ominous,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58008:9"/>
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> portends some calamitous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
to the World. They look
upon This as a mere vulgar Errour,
and will not be persuaded that it
hath any other Foundation than
the prejudicate Fancy and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the deluded People. I must
freely profess my self to be one that
hath other Notions of this matter;
and having satisfied my self about
it, I will try whether I can do the
same to others: For I take it to be
a laudable Endeavour, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
a seasonable one, (we having
so lately been allarmed by the sight
of such glaring Bodies in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens)
to propogate the Sentiments
which I have of this Doctrine, and
to reduce those that are mistaken
to right Apprehensions of it.</p>
            <p>Four things then I design:</p>
            <p>1. To enquire into the <hi>Nature</hi>
of Comets, that is, (as the Title of
this Treatise gave it you) their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58008:9"/>
Substance, Place, Motion,
Figure, (which last contains the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Species or Kinds) and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
other circumstances and Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
belong to them, and from
all these, and the different Disputes,
Controversies and clashing Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning them, to evince
them to be <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I will from the consideration
of the true Nature of <hi>Causes</hi> and
<hi>Signs</hi> prove them to be both <hi>Effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
and <hi>Significant,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they bode Calamities and
Evils to the World.</p>
            <p>3. I will add the numerous suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of sacred and prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
to back my Opinion; for
though I confess I never thought
the Cause of Truth was to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by majority of Votes, yet in
this Case I dare venture to put it to
the Poll.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I will answer the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are brought to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58008:10"/>
my Assertion, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
my Replies to other Cavils,
I will purposely encounter <hi>Iudicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Astrology,</hi> and soberly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
give my Notion of it; which if
it prove not to be exactly adjusted
to some Mens Measures, yet I hope
it will be found to answer to the
Standard of Reason, which I reckon
to be much better.</p>
            <p>In the first place I am to enquire
into the <hi>Nature</hi> of Comets: and
here I must begin with the <hi>Substance</hi>
or <hi>Matter</hi> of them. But behold!
(as an Eviction of what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
suggested, and what will
more evidently appear in the sequel,
<hi>viz.</hi> the dubious and uncertain Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of Philosophers and others
about these Bodies) there were some
of old who would by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them to have any <hi>Substance</hi> or
Consistency at all, but to be mere
Appearances: which is as much as
to say, There are no such things in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58008:10"/>
Reality. This Opinion is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
in that Book which I shall
have occasion often to cite,<note place="margin">Senec. <hi>Nat. Quaest.</hi> l. 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>Quidam
nullos esse Cometas existimant, sed
species illorum per repercussionem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinorum
siderum, aut per conjunctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
cohaerentium reddi.</hi> They held
that the Phaenomena which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Comets, are caused by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
or Refraction of the Beams
of the Sun, or Moon, or the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Stars, or by a conjunction
of many Stars together. They tell
us at other times, that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
is the same with that of the
Rain-bow, the Parelion, and Halo,
and that they are not distinct from
those luminous Bodies which they
are near to. But certainly it is a
great piece of Philosophick Folly
to think that they are mere shews,
and not of a real consistency. This
might be confuted from several To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
but especially from these
Two: namely,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58008:11"/>
First, Their <hi>Duration,</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and continued appearance for
so long a time: whereas, if they
were onely seeming and phantastick
Spectacles, they would not hold out
(as they do) so many days, nay
weeks, not to say months.</p>
            <p>Again, if they were Images they
would not be seen <hi>Alike,</hi> and in the
same Shape to all persons in what
situation soever; the Angles of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
must needs vary. But it is
well known that they appear with
the same Figure in divers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Countries to all spectatours:
whence it is proper to conclude
that they are real Physical Beings.
Well then, granting them to be
<hi>Substances,</hi> what <hi>Kind</hi> of ones are
they, <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>matter?</hi> Some have
had so high an esteem of Comets,
that they have ranked them among
Immaterial and Intellectual Spirits.
<hi>Pliny,</hi> the Elder, in the Second
Book of his <hi>Natural History,</hi> and
the Five and twentieth <hi>Chapter,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58008:11"/>
(which likewise I shall frequently
quote in the following Discourse)
acquaints us that the Comet which
was seen seven nights together after
the assassinating of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in
the Senate House, was believed by
the vulgar to be that Great Man's
Soul received up into Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the number of the Gods. <hi>Eo
sidere significari vulgus credidit Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saris
animam,</hi> &amp;c. The same is
testified by <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
in the Account which they give of
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Life and Death. Nay, this
was not onely the conceit of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Rabble, but the said <hi>Pliny</hi> tells
us, that <hi>Democritus,</hi> who one
would think should have laughed
at this among the other Follies of
Mankind, espoused this persuasion,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Comets are the Souls of
Deceased Heroes. And (to see how
taking such Dreams and Whimsies
are with some heads) <hi>Bodinus</hi> seems
to be hugely pleased with it,<note place="margin">Theatr. Natur. <hi>l.</hi> S 2.</note> and is
very inclinable to believe that those
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58008:12"/>
Blazing Lights are the Souls of brave
Men departed, and carried up to
Heaven, and there triumphing. I
might suggest here (as somewhat
relating to this purpose) that the
Transmigration of Souls into Stars
was an ancient Ethnick Dream, and
so might be the occasion to some of
thinking also that departed Spirits
(if very brisk and generous) mount
aloft, and presently turn into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in those fiery Mansions
display their pristine vigour and
mettle. Others, though they hold
them not to be Souls of Men, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Ghosts, yet they forsake not
the notion of their being <hi>Spirits:</hi>
that is, they maintain that they
are Spirits of a lower Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
near of kin to the finest and
subtilest matter: Thus I remember
the high-flown Chymist asserts
them to be a certain <hi>Compound of
Spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Paracels. <hi>Iid. de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor.</hi>
               </note> but what he means I am
not so skilfull an Adept as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
This only I apprehend, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58008:12"/>
He, and much more Those who
make them to be irradiated Souls
above, exalt the Nature of Comets
too high. It is enough that they
are of the order of <hi>Corporeal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
And being so, it will be asked
in the next place. What are the
Materials of these great Streaming
Bodies? Are they of Terrestrial or
Celestial Matter? Which of these
two are they, Earth or <hi>Aether?</hi>
Here likewise Philosophers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and cannot agree on their
Verdict. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Partisans
declare, that they are of <hi>Earthly</hi>
Extraction, and no other than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,
raised from great heaps of dry
and viscous Exhalations. Many of
the Stoicks are pleased to side with
the <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> and generally all
those that hold them to be bare
Meteors, and to be placed under
the Moon, say they are of a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
origine. But here again
they are subdivided,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meteor.</hi> l. 1. c. 7.</note> for some main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they are Earthly matter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58008:13"/>
               <hi>Inflamed:</hi> Thus the great <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
and some late Astrenomers, as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomontanus,</hi>
a groat Promoter of
all Mathematical and Astronomical
Studies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that learned French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Piso,</hi> and others, hold that
Comets are set on fire by the rays
of the Sun. Whereas others, as
<hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> of old, and
some of late will have them to be
subtile and Diaphanous matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled
from the Earth into the Air,
and there, by reason of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
which they receive into
them, <hi>Enlightened</hi> and made bright,
but not Enflamed. But that Comets
are of Earthly Original, though it
was credited of old, and by a few
of the Moderns, yet it will hardly
gain belief at this time of Day. It
is now generally asserted, that most
of them are above the Moon (of
which you shall hear more anon:)
and if their Seat be so high, it will
be difficult to persuade men that
they were exhaled from the Earth.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58008:13"/>
It is impossible so much Matter
should be amassed together as must
serve for a Comet, which is of so
great a bulk, and lasts so long as
some of them have done. It the
Diametre of some of them be four
times, nay, of the larger sort of
them, be ten times greater than the
Earth,<note place="margin">Snellius <hi>de Cometa anni</hi> 1618.</note> (as one who was Professor of
Mathematicks at <hi>Leyden</hi> hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
it, the Earth and Sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
afford Matter enough to make
One of them.</p>
            <p>This Opinion then being explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
another is to take place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which the Chaldeans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ancient Philosophers, and
the Moderns generally, as <hi>Cardan,
Tycho Brahe, Galilaeus, Des Cartes,</hi>
and many others, affirm that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets are constituted of <hi>Celestial
Matter.</hi> But alas! though they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in this in the general, yet in
the Particular Explication of it they
are found to dissent from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for it is hotly disputed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58008:14"/>
these unusual Lights are bred
from the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of all the Planets,
or from the Sun alone, or from the
other Stars.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cometo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</hi> l. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Hevelius</hi> the Learned
Professor of Mathematicks at <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick</hi>
undertakes to decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
by avowing that they are
made of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> and Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of both Erratick and Fixed
Stars, but especially of the Sun,
there being so great an Exhalation
of matter from this vast Body, that
it is able it self alone in one Year
to make innumerable Comets. So
that according to this Gentleman,
these uncommon sights in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are so far from being <hi>Wonders,</hi>
that it is rather a Wonder, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the course of Nature, that
they do not always and in number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Companies appear. An Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unworthy of so acute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
a Philosopher! for he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the most Glorious Luminary
of Heaven, and that which is the
Master-piece of all the Works of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58008:14"/>
the Creation, the most Irregular
and Monstrous Body in the World,
whilst he would offer this to our
belief, that whereas by its natural
Make, it ought to afford matter
for infinite Comets, yet it perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
acts contrary to its Frame and
Constitution, and produces not one
Comet sometimes in Twenty Years.
In my judgment this is but mean
Philosophy, and it can never prove
good Astronomy, though I have
otherwise a profound Respect for
that Worthy Person, who by his
excellent and elaborate Writings
hath both merited and purchased a
great Name and Repute among all
those who are addicted to Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Studies, and hath particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
obliged the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
by communicating his Notions to
them with so much freedom.</p>
            <p>Thus I have in some measure
shewed the <hi>Disagreement</hi> of the
Learned Tribe about that part of
the Doctrine of Comets which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58008:15"/>
their <hi>Original,</hi> whence I shall
afterwards prove them to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
and <hi>Presaging:</hi> but it is
little I have hitherto effected; I
must hasten to dispatch what is yet
behind of the same Argument. Let
us then ask these Men of Skill,
What were Comets <hi>before</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to us in this shape, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Name and Character?
Our great Mathematicians and
Philosophers are at odds, as to this
point. If you enquire of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Monsieur <hi>Renatus des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
(that man of <hi>France</hi> who was
as great a Reformer in Philosophy
as <hi>Calvin,</hi> his Country-man, was
in Divinity, he whose Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
was so Taking and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that a wise Queen quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her Crown to be at leisure to
study it,) this great Man tells you
they were <hi>Fixed Stars;</hi> for his
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> in brief is this, That
those fixed Lights have their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae,</hi>
or thick matter, which he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58008:15"/>
calls the Third Element; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freed from these, sometimes
some of them come into view, and
go for <hi>New Stars;</hi> but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
by them, they are absorped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another <hi>Vortex,</hi> and become
Comets. So that Comets are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Stars first Incrassated, and then
Apostatized. This is the Noble
Romantick Philosopher, who min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
Heaven and Earth together,
or rather, confounds one with the
other; and he that could imagine
this Earth of ours once to have
been a Sun, may be pardoned if he
presents us with such a notion of
Comets as you have heard. Others
are very vigorous in defending
them to be <hi>Planets,</hi> or <hi>Wandring
Stars,</hi> but distinct from the seven
celebrated ones, (for they hold
that there are more than those
which are ordinarily reckoned.)
The Dogmatists of this Persuasion
were the Pythagorean Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of the Italick Sect, the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58008:16"/>
(as <hi>Stobaeus</hi> relates, <hi>Ecolg.
Physic.</hi> c. 3.) <hi>Hippocrates, Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Phavorinus, Epicurus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius,</hi>
&amp;c. and of late <hi>Cardan,</hi>
the noted Physician of <hi>Milan, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castorius</hi>
an excellent Professor of
the same Faculty in <hi>Verona, Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Vallesius,</hi> (l. 1. <hi>de Philos. Sacr.</hi>)
and some others. These, I say,
contend that they are <hi>Planets,</hi>
that is, that they are Thick, Dark,
Opake Bodies in themselves, and
that they borrow all their Light
from the Sun. And herein the
learned <hi>Hevelius</hi> agrees with them,
who will not allow Comets to have
the least Light of their own, but
they receive it all, as other Planets
do, from the great Source of Light,
and propagate it to us by Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as is the guise of Planets: and
hence he gathers (and consistently
enough with his own <hi>Hypothesis</hi>)
that the Tails of Comets must
needs be made by the Sun, of
which I shall speak immediately.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58008:16"/>
And the French Philosoper before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
though otherwise a Dissenter,
strikes in here, and declares that they
receive all their Light from the Sun,
and in that resemble Planets. You
must know likewise, that, according
to the judgment of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Philosophers, these <hi>Planets</hi> or
<hi>Comets</hi> (call them which you please,
for it is come to that) have existed
always from the first Creation, but
have been hid in the Heavens for a
time, and at length come into view.
They seem to us to be New, but they
are really of the same date with the
first Origine of all things. <hi>Seneca</hi>
lets you know this was his Opinion,
<hi>Non existimo Cometen subitaneum
ignem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nat. Quaest. l. 7. c. 22.</note> 
               <hi>sed inter aeterna opera natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae</hi>
A Comet is a <hi>Temporary</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
in regard of the People to whom
it appears, but otherwise it is from
<hi>Eternity,</hi> supposing the World (as
that Philosopher doth, but falsly)
to be so. A Comet is a wandring
Star, that after a certain Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58008:17"/>
wheels about, and comes into
sight: after it hath lost it self a great
while, it finds its way into our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere.
It is a Planet that hath
gone <hi>Incognito</hi> a long time, and hath
been seen by none but the Sun, if
our natural Philosopher represents
it aright: <hi>Sunt qui haec sider a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua
esse credunt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 25.</note> suó<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ambitu ire,
sed non nisi à sole cerni.</hi> They come
into our sight after a long Circuit
and Risque, and then vanish, and
retire to those Remote places where
they were at first. And there I leave
them and proceed. According to
the Assertion last propounded, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
are <hi>single Planets</hi> not before
known, seen and observed by us.
Now in the next place you shall
see that another pack of Philiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
will not suffer them to be
<hi>single Stars:</hi> no, they must be <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Stars or Planets</hi> intermingling
their Lights. The Patrons of this
were <hi>Zeno, Anaxagoras, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
(even that <hi>Democritus</hi> who held
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58008:17"/>
they were the Souls of Heroes; for
you must take notice, that one Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
may hold two or more opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the same thing,) these would
needs have Comets to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a Coapparition of divers Errant

to touch one another by reason of

their Doctrine, <hi>l. 2. Meteor. c.</hi> 8. Or
as <hi>Seneca</hi> more briefly; Comets ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58008:18"/>
the sense of that Historian who gives
an account of a Comet of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
aspect which visited the Eastern
part of the World in the Year 383.
and he expresseth it thus,<note place="margin">Nicephor. Eccles. hist. l. 12. c. 37.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> A
great Company of Stars (saith he)
was gathered together, and the
Light which came from them all
with great violence made up one
huge Flame, which appeared in
the likeness of a Sword. Some
of the Moderns undertook to solve
the Phaenomenon of a Comet
after the same manner, as <hi>Cysatus</hi>
Professor of Mathematicks in the
University of <hi>Ingoldstadt,</hi> and
<hi>Licetus</hi> a Philosopher of <hi>Genua
lib. de Novis Astris &amp; Cometis.</hi>
After the rate of These Mens Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
a Comet is an Association or
Fellowship of Stars, which seem to
be but one Star, because they stick
so close to another. It is a <hi>Congeries</hi>
of Numberless Lights which loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mingle their Rays together, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58008:18"/>
so make as it were one long strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Star. This hath some affinity
with their Fancy who think a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
to be a kind of Galaxy, and
perhaps they might borrow their
conceit from Father of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristot.</hi> l. 1. Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. c. 10.</note>
who treats of the Milky
Circle and Comets in the same
Chapter, and seems to solve one by
the other. From what hath been
said it is evident that it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
among the knowing and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
whether Comets be fixed or
wandring Stars, and if they be of
this latter sort, whether they be
single, or several ones. That they
are not a <hi>Congeries</hi> or Heap of Stars
is excellently well proved by One
who treats on this Theme designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Senec.</hi> Nat. Quaest. l. 7. c. 12, 13, 14.</note>
and I am clearly of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that it may as substantially
be demonstrated that they are <hi>No
Stars</hi> at all. For weigh the nature
both of the Planets and fixed Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,
and you will find that
Comets have nothing of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58008:19"/>
and properties. It is not the
nature of either of those kind of
Stars to be greater at first, and then
to decay and dwindle, and at last
to be extinct, or (as some few Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
have been, as <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
report) to be little at sirst, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to grow greater, and at
length to lose both their greater and
lesser bulk. This never was of the
constitution of <hi>Stars:</hi> Nor have
Comets any thing of the Motion or
other Properties of Stars (as I shall
shew afterwards,) and therefore I
cannot discern how they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called, or thought to be
<hi>Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus far spoken of the
<hi>Original Matter</hi> whereof Comets
are thought, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>Genius</hi> and Sentiments of
Men, to consist, I come now to
consider their <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Situation,</hi>
though I have intimated something
already of <hi>These,</hi> and it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58008:19"/>
to doe so, because their <hi>Original</hi>
and <hi>Place</hi> are so nearly related and
depend upon each other. But I will
now treat of <hi>This</hi> more designedly,
and from the wondrous variety and
inconsistency of opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Comets I will advance to prove
that they really are and ought to
be reckoned as <hi>Prodigies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first let us attend to those
who place all Comets <hi>below the
Moon.</hi> These are the Peripateticks,
and many of the Stoicks; and they
are followed by Philosophers and
Mathematicians of later time, as
<hi>Regiomontanus, Iunctinus, Fracasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
Iulius Caesar, Scaliger, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramontius,</hi>
and several others, whose
persuasion is this, that Comets are
sublunary Meteors, <hi>i. e.</hi> Exhalations
mounted up to the upper and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Region of the Air, and that
there they hover, and at last are
set on fire and blaze. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we might be brought off from
imbracing such a Tenet as this, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58008:20"/>
considering, that if Comets were
Meteors, they would jump and
skip here and there, as other Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
are observed to doe; and they
must needs be subject to such a
Motion, both because they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
driven with the Wind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot but be set on run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and leaping by their own fire.
Such considerations as these have
mov'd divers great Philosophers and
Astronomers to reject the Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
way, and to enter upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more probable and rational.
They think it a degrading of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
to thrust them down into the
Elementary Region, and therefore
they have universally agreed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
them <hi>above the Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was practised before <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
by the old Chaldean and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean
Philosophers, by <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,
Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Zeno;</hi> and
after their time by the Judicious
<hi>Seneca,</hi> and since that by the acutest
and most discerning Moderns, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58008:20"/>
               <hi>Cardan, Tycho, Galilaeus, Keplar,
Longomontanus, Cartesius,</hi> and great
numbers of other Learned Men.
They prove their point by the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax,</hi>
which is the <hi>Diversity</hi> of sight,
or change of Aspect, or the <hi>Difference</hi>
between the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Seeming</hi> Place
of a Star or any other thing hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Region above us. This
in all the Comets that have been
observed by them was lesser than
that of the Moon; <hi>Ergò</hi> they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Moon: For it is certain
that that Body is by so much the
more elevated from the Earth, by
how much the lesser its Paralax is,
as the greater this is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thing seen
is the nearer; and on the other
side, the lesser this is, that is the
further off. And for this Reason
the ingenious French Philosopher
places Comets in the Liquid <hi>Aether,</hi>
between the Regions of the Planets
and the fixed Stars, because (saith
he) they have <hi>none,</hi> or an <hi>unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
small Paralax</hi> or Variation of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58008:21"/>
Sight to those divers spectators that
look on them at the greatest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>I know the greatest Astronomers
have differed about the Doctrine of
Paralaxes, whereof the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> and that noble
Italian Philosopher and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
<hi>Claramontius,</hi> are a famous
Instance. The renowned <hi>Galilaeus,
Iulius Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Bodinus</hi> laugh
at the proof which is brought from
the Paralax.<note place="margin">Ricciolus Almagest. <hi>lib. de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metis.</hi>
               </note> And a skilfull person
of late, who undertakes to be Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
between the Aristotelians and
Tychonists, concludes peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that there is no Mathematical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
for Comets being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
or below the Moon. But it
may be they mean no more than
this, that Paralaxes are uncertain,
or rather, that the taking of them
truly and exactly is extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
the instruments are not every
way good; and several Refractions
which happen may hinder the just
sight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58008:21"/>
And now one would imagine
there should be no farther disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than this, that some Comets
are above, and some below the
Moon, some in the Heavens, and
others in the Air. But we shall find
it otherwise; for a third sort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us, that the very same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
are <hi>sometimes</hi> below and at
<hi>other times</hi> above the Moon: So
<hi>Christopher Clavius, Libertus, Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus,
Licetus, Resta, Caboeus</hi>
Professor of Mathematicks at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua,
Bulialdus</hi> that eminent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Astronomer, and particularly
the sagacious <hi>Kepler</hi> asserts that a
Comet may come down from the
<hi>Aether</hi> into the Air.<note place="margin">In Cometar. Physiolog.</note> Though it was
generated above the Moon, yet
there is good reason to believe that
it may fall down; and such a one
was that which appeared <hi>A. D.</hi> 1450.<note place="margin">Phranza. Chronic. l. 3. c. 20.</note>
and eclipsed the whole body of the
Moon, as the Histories and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
of Comets inform us. Such
was that which was seen at <hi>Christ</hi>'s
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58008:22"/>
Nativity (if it were a Comet,) and
such was the famous Sword-Flame
which appeared over the City of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> a year together. We are
sure that two of these were Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Comets.</p>
            <p>Some Comets then are situated
as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith they are, and
whilst the Astronomers, that came
afterwards, endeavour to prove the
contrary, and that all the Comets
that ever appeared are Celestial,
This attempt of theirs is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as an extreme on the other
hand. It is enough to say that most
Comets have been high and lofty;
and indeed it was fit they should
be so, that the World might take
the greater notice of them.</p>
            <p>As I hope I convinced the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before, that the <hi>Generation</hi> and
<hi>Production</hi> of Comets is a difficult
search, so from what hath been
since delivered, I doubt not but their
<hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> appears to be of
the same quality. So perplexed are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58008:22"/>
these Points, that no less than a
douzen Opinions are reckoned up
by a modern Astronomer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.<note place="margin">Ricciol. Almagest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is still another great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to be considered, and that is
the <hi>Motion</hi> of Comets, which by
all Astronomers is look'd on as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
and unaccountable. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Bodies take their Journey
in a direct Line, or a circular one,
and arch-wise (as the Planets) is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by them; and at last it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moly
said, that the way they take
is transverse and oblique. You may
hear them cry out very despairing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they imitate neither the
motion of the Sun, nor other settled
Luminaries, but are perfectly <hi>sui
juris,</hi> they take their own course,
and that commonly is very unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
Some go on directly in the
true course of the Zodiack, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
run through it backward, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58008:23"/>
               <hi>Bodinus (Theatr. Nat. l.</hi> 2.) and
<hi>Hevelius (Prod. Comet)</hi> observe.
And not onely one Comet differs
from <hi>another</hi> in its Motion, but
oftentimes from <hi>it self:</hi> Nay,
sometimes it remains fixed in the
same place, and stirs not one way
or other; which our Naturalist so
often alledged takes notice of, when
he saith, <hi>Moventur autem alii Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantium
modo, alii Immobiles haerent,
Nat. Hist. l.</hi> 2. This onely is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
That though some at one
time or other have moved to all the
Points of the Heavens, yet they
generally and usually veer by their
own proper Motion towards the
Poles. But why they appear rather
without the Tropicks than within,
and why they make their passage
through <hi>Boötes,</hi> and the great Bear,
and for the most part are seen about
the Poles either Southern or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,
but especially the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,
and why they do not shew
themselves in the height of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58008:23"/>
These are all <hi>unaccountable,</hi>
that their <hi>Motion</hi> may be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all <hi>other things</hi> observed in
them, and that there may be some
proof made of what I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Comets are an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
and Anomalous sort of
Lights set up on purpose in the
Heavens to invite the Inhabitants
of the Earth to behold them, and
to bid them doe something more
than that, as I shall shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>But the main thing that puzzles
is the <hi>Figure</hi> which Comets appear
in, the affrightning <hi>Brush</hi> or <hi>Stream</hi>
which they shew.</p>
            <p>First, how came they to have any
such thing at all? And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, How comes it to pass
that this Stream or Blaze is always
opposite to the Sun? And after I
have examined this, I will speak of
the more <hi>particular Figures</hi> or <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Species</hi> of Comets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58008:24"/>
First then, what Philosophy can
give an account of the Flaming
Brush which issues from them?
But here, before I pass any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it must be remembred that
Astronomers speak of three sorts of
Comets:</p>
            <p>1. That which they call the
<hi>Hairy</hi> one, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Rays
are spread on all sides alike, and are
equally in a Circle expanded, like
the Hair of a mans Head.</p>
            <p>2. That with a <hi>Beard,</hi> which is
when a Comet emits its Rayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that part of the Heaven to
which it moves.</p>
            <p>3. That which appears with a
<hi>Tail, viz.</hi> when its Beams are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
towards that part of Heaven
from which it recedes: Or the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the <hi>Bearded</hi> and
<hi>Tailed</hi> Comet is onely from the
different aspect to the Sun: the one
shewing itself before the Sun riseth,
looks towards the West; the other
appearing after the Sun is down,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58008:24"/>
turns its Stream Eastward. I know
some make the distinction other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
namely, as to the <hi>Erection</hi> of
the Figure, it is like a Beard or
Mustaches; and as to the <hi>Depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it, or Hanging down, like a
Tail. But the old Dictatour of
Philosophy reduces those three
kinds into two,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristot.</hi> Meteor. l. 1. c. 9.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
A Comet (saith
he) is generated according to the
Figure and Shape of the Exhalation
which is drawn up by the Sun: if
this be set on fire on all sides alike,
and be exactly round, then it is
properly called a Comet, or <hi>Hairy
Star;</hi> but if it be extended in length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then 'tis a <hi>Bearded one:</hi> And this
comprehends under it all the blaze
and stream of Light which proceeds
from Comets, call it <hi>Beard,</hi> or <hi>Tail,</hi>
or what you please.</p>
            <p>The former of these (which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58008:25"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith is the <hi>True Comet</hi>)
is seldom seen, and I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that I ever read above two
or three Instances of it. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the more known and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
kind, and may, by that great
Philosopher's leave, be properly
called a Comet, according to the
true Etymology of it expressed by
the Poet,
<q>Flamma Comas imitata volat,<note place="margin">manilius</note> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuésque
Capillos.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now it may deservedly be asked,
What is the Reason of this strange
Figure? Why do not Comets ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us round, (be they flat or
disciform in themselves, as some
imagine, that is not much to the
purpose, but) why do not the
whole bodies of the Comets appear
to be Globous, as all other Stars,
both fixed and erratick, seem to be?
What makes those differ from these?
Why are the Rays and Splendour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58008:25"/>
of a Comet carried further than
that of other Stars? Why sends it
forth such stragling Beams? Since
the Figure of all Stars is Globular
or Sphaerical, what causes a Comet
(if it be a Star) to be of a long Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure?
Why do not all other Stars
shoot out such Streams as this? I
desire not to make difficulties, but
certainly these Questions have not
been solved to the satisfaction of
any diligent and curious Enquirer.
Such Reasons as the learned have
suggested I will set down, and I am
confident that it will be made clear
from them, as from all other things
appertaining to Comets, that they
are a sort of Phaenomena which
were made to puzzle the World,
and that their <hi>strange Nature</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
to us their <hi>more strange events.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am to let you know then, that,
according to the different Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses
taken up, some write, that
the Tail or Beard is <hi>part</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;
others on the contrary as stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58008:26"/>
maintain, that it is <hi>not part</hi> of
it, but is onely the Rays of the
Sun shot through the Comet's
Head.</p>
            <p>First, It is said, that the Tail is
part of the Comet, or (as <hi>Seneca</hi>
represents <hi>Apollonius</hi> his judgment)
the long Tail is the form of this
kind of Planet: The Body of the
Star is made of this Figure. But,
according to <hi>Aristotle, i. e.</hi> if it be
a Peripatetick Comet, the <hi>Head</hi> of
it is supposed to be troubled with
<hi>Fumes</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> and these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-heated by the Sun, are set
on fire, and so the <hi>Tail</hi> is no other
than the flame of the burning Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor.</p>
            <p>But seeing a Flame by its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lightness tends upwards, why
is not the Tail of every Comet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
erect? For they suppose Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
to be low, and their Flame to
be seen in its just proportion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the fixed Stars and others are not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58008:26"/>
supposed to appear Shaerical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their vast <hi>Distance</hi> from us,
which confoundeth all distinction
of Figures.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Piso</hi>'s Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul. Comet.</note> One very Astronimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
skill'd solves it thus:</p>
            <p>The Flame of the Comet (saith
he) doth not move directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and appear erect because of
the solid Orb above it; (for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
these Comets with Tails or
Beards are in the Concavity of the
Orb of the Moon:) hence the Flame
is forced downwards, just as the
Flame in an Oven or Fornace, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from above, strikes towards the
sides. But if it be so, how happens
it that the Flame is not seen on
both sides or ends, but onely on
the hinder part of the Comet?
How comes that part which is
next to the Sun to be always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Train or Stream? The Flame
of the Comet is driven by the <hi>Wind</hi>
towards one side, as we see plainly
in Torches when the Wind blows,
so the Peripateticks give an account
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58008:27"/>
of the Tail or Bush of a Comet.
But if it were caused by the Wind,
then there must be always a great
Wind stirring as long as Comets
appear, and the Blaze of these
would increase as that increases;
but I never read that any such
Observation was made, and we
know by experience that Calms
have accompanied the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Comets, whatever vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Weather happened after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Besides, if the long Train were
occasioned by the Wind, it would
also disappear when the Wind is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid.
Moreover, the Wind hath not
blown from the same Point of
Heaven all the time of the Comet's
appearing. And that it should doe
so to all Comets is yet stranger:
You may as well say, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, that the Wind is ever in
the same Corner. But, after all, if
I should add, that Comets are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Wind, as it is hugely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58008:27"/>
they are, then this way of
solving the Difficulty is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</p>
            <p>In short, according to the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian
Hypothesis of a Comet
being a heap of Inflamed Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I do not see how the Tail can
be made out; for this being a Flame,
and lighter and rarer Matter than
the head of the Comet, it should
tend upwards in the form of a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid,
as it fares with all other
Flames.</p>
            <p>Again, such a heap of viscous
Vapours must needs burn on all
sides, if it be equally kindled, and
then the long Train is spoiled: or
if the matter doth not burn equally,
then certainly <hi>There</hi> where the
Fuel is most capable; and how can
that be supposed to be always just
opposite to the Sun? But if the
<hi>Wind</hi> cannot solve the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
the <hi>Sun</hi> must: accordingly <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler,
Gassendus,</hi> and others say,
that the Tail, being of the same
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58008:28"/>
matter with the Head, onely more
rare and subtile, is driven and thrust
by that force of the Suns Rays to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that part of the Heavens
which is contrary to the Sun.</p>
            <p>It was soon seen that this thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shoving of Sun-beams was
a very precarious Notion; and
therefore the most judicious Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
go another way to work.
They abandon their Opinion who
think the Tail belongs to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Comet, and is a Flame
issuing from it, and in stead of that
they defend this for Truth, that
the Tail or Beard is no other than
the Beams of the Sun transmitted
through the Diaphanous Head of
the Comet. This is embraced by
<hi>Cardan, Longomontanus, Scaliger,</hi>
and that famous Triumvirate of
Astronomers, <hi>Tycho, Kepler, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeus.</hi>
If these say true, the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Body of the Comet is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the Solar Rays, and
the Sun, thus shining through it,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58008:28"/>
and causing a various Refraction
and Repercussion of Light, makes
that Splendour which we call the
Tail or Tresses of a Comet. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this they fancy the Body of
the Comet to be like a Globe or
Ball of Glass, which by its Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness
imbibes the Beams recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Sun, and those Beams
passing through it appear on the
Reverse of it. Such a kind of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
or striking of the Sun's Rays
through the Head or Body of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
is the cause of its Beard or
Tail. But this will not clear the
Point; for then the Tail should not
be of that Figure it appears, but of
a Comick one, as the Rays appear
behind a Glass-Ball, <hi>viz.</hi> broad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Glass, but narrower and
sharper the other way. But the
Trains of Comets appear otherwise,
they being large and wide at the
<hi>Cuspis,</hi> or end, but lesser and more
contracted towards the Head of the
Comet. Thus the Laws of Opticks
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58008:29"/>
and the Rules of Perspectives will
be indangered if we tie our selves
to this Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>Besides, This is attended with
other insuperable Difficulties; for
if the Comet be Diaphanous, where
are the Suns Rrays terminated, and
by that means reflected to us?
There ought to be some Opake
matter to stop the Rays, and so to
reverberate them to us. Say that
by the Transparency of the head of
the Comet the Sun's Rays are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and so the Train is in a
fair way to be made, yet there is
required moreover an Opacity to
receive and turn back those Rays
to our Eyes, that we may see them.
This is done, if <hi>Tycho Brache</hi>'s say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so will suffice:<note place="margin">Astronom. Instaur. Progym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasm.</note> The Rays of the
Sun (saith he) passing through the
Comets Head meet with some
matter in the Aethereal Region
which is darkish, and so reflects
them back to us: thus the blazing
Stream is produced. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58008:29"/>
First, This supposes Thick and
Opake Matter in the Aether, which
ever before passed for Pure, Subtile,
and Perspicuous.</p>
            <p>Then, Suppose there were such
Matter in the Aethereal Regions,
yet if this reflexion were from the
Aether, why are we so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Comets? for in that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Aether, which lies behind the
Comets, the beams are reflected
constantly.</p>
            <p>Likewise, if the Beard of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
had no other Production, it
would be spread not onely towards
that part of the Heavens which is
directly opposite to the Sun, but
on every side. And this also leads
me to enquire after an answer to
the <hi>Other Question</hi> I started, <hi>viz.</hi>
Why the Bush or Main of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
always turns it self from the
Sun, and consequently if it appears
before Sun-rising, it points towards
the West, and if it be seen in the
Evening it stretches itself towards
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58008:30"/>
the East, sometimes directly, at
other times with some Deviation
more or less, either Northward or
Southward?</p>
            <p>I having invalidated that Tenet
of the Suns Beams passing through
the Head of the Comet, and being
reflected to us from I know not
whence, there can no solid Reason
be given of their direct Opposition
to the Sun. And then as for those
who say the Comets propagate and
transmit such a glaring Light to us
by Reflection (as all the Planets
do) from the Sun, (for according
to <hi>Hevelius,</hi> and some others, the
Head and Tail of Comets are dark
Bodies,) it is certain that if they
borrow all their Light and Blaze
from the Sun, there is yet a more
desparate and forlorn account given
both of the Tail of a Comet, and
of its Opposition to the Sun, and
then also the Moon, and Saturn
and all the other Planets would be
Bearded or Tailed.</p>

I might now enquire into the
<hi>different Species,</hi> the various <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(as the Philosopher calls them)
of Comets. For this Stream which
I have been discoursing of is not
always of the same Configuration,
but hath appeared in divers Shapes
and Resemblances. These several
Species are set down by an Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Astronomical Poet in a very
Elegant manner,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Manilii</hi> Astronom. 1. l.</note> and by a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher

have occasion often to use) who
reckons up <hi>Twelve several Species</hi> of

it will be more proper to enlarge
on this particular when I come to
the next general Head of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
where I shall handle Comets
as real <hi>Signs.</hi> In the mean time I
will entertain the Reader with
some other matter which is Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to our business, and which
will give him a further Insight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

marvellous Appearances, and serve
to advance the knowledge of such
as are inquisitive Searchers into the
Works of God.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Number</hi> of Comets some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
may be said; I will give you
the Sum total of the Catalogue
which <hi>Baptista Ricciolus</hi> hath made,
and that is 154. for so many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
had appeared in the World
from 480 Years before Christ's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to the Year of our Lord 1618.
His Catalogue reaches no further
either backward or forward; but
<hi>Hevelius</hi> takes a wider compass,
for the Comets (saith he) recorded
by the Historians, or Philosophers,
or others, from the time of <hi>Noah</hi>'s
Floud (of what was before that, he
pretends not to give any account)
to this day (and he writ his <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tographia</hi>
in the Year 1668) are in
number 250. It is not unlikely
that some others have appeared,
and even from the beginning of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58008:32"/>
the World, as when God cast
<hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> (of which
anon,) but they have not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
and transmitted to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Posterity.</p>
            <p>That which I shall observe to
you is this, That many of these
Comets, and others that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
since, have fallen to our share
in a short time. We have seen five
or six of them in less space than
Twenty Years. For, not to go back
so far as the Year 1618. when four
Comets appeared one after another,
(some or all of which are discoursed
of in the Writings of the greatest
Astrologers of that time) we can
with ease remember the years 1664.
and 1665. both which are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
for the dreadfull appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
in each of them, but they
are the rather to be mentioned by
me now, because they are most
signal Instances of the <hi>Direfull E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi>
which insue Comets, if such
a Pestilence and Fire as presently
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58008:33"/>
after happened may be styled so.
Afterwards, in the Year 1672/3;, we
were visited with another Comet,
and again, in 1680; and lately, in
this present Year 1682. These in
so short a time, in less than the space
of Eighteen Years, are very Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
If I prove that these Strange
Lights are <hi>Boding,</hi> (which I am
hastning to) I cannot see but that
we shall be very much concerned.</p>
            <p>I might add one word of the
<hi>Time,</hi> which is another Apendage
or Circumstance of the Doctrine of
Comets. It hath been observed
that they appear indifferently at
all Times of the Year, the Spring
and Fall, Summer and Winter, as
is evident from the Tables of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
which are extant, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with that of <hi>Seneca, Non ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
certum est illis</hi> (i. e. <hi>Cometis)
Tempus quo appareant, quàm Locus
ullus ultra quem non exeant.</hi> cap. 12.
But the <hi>Autumn generally</hi> is the time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58008:33"/>
of their appearing, say the most
Astronomers: but if you demand a
Reason to be rendred of it, it will
be impossible to offer one that is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
especially if Comets be
acknowledged (as they have been
for a considerable time) to be situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above the Moon, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the highest Planets; for
earthly Exhalations cannot mount
in a short time to so high a place.
So that it is in vain to enquire into
the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Time,</hi> as well as
<hi>other circumstances,</hi> of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>I could say something also of
the <hi>Colour</hi> of Comets, for History
is full of Variety here, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some as pale and wan, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as darkish and cloudy: some
as golden or yellow, others, as silver
like, bright, clear, and so transparent
that Stars have been plainly seen
through them: some of a ruddy
complexion, and bloudy, and fiery,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58008:34"/>
others of a leaden and livid hue,
all differing according to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of more or less Light.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the <hi>Smell</hi> as well as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Comets hath been taken
notice of; and this hath happened
onely then when they have hung
hovering near the Earth; an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof Historians give us
in that Comet which was seen <hi>A. D.</hi>
396. in which they acquaint us
that a strong and Sulphureous Smell
was felt.</p>
            <p>And thus I have, in pursuance
of the first Task I set my self, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into the <hi>Nature</hi> of these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies: I have particularly
considered their Origine, Make,
Figure, Situation, Motion, and
the rest of the Phaenomena apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing
to them. And I may with
confidence aver in the close of
all, that he who sees not how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
if not impossible, it is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle
the Nature of Comets, sees
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58008:34"/>
nothing in Philosophy and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Things.</p>
            <p>What contrary Accounts do Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
give of them?</p>
            <p>Those that will not wholly grant
the Efficacy and Operation of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
must, whether they will or
no, confess their Influence in <hi>This,</hi>
that they have caused grievous
Wars and Feuds among Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
who (we see) are engaged
with great vigour against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in the conclusion pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
nothing but Obscurity and
Uncertainty. The variety of their
Opinions, and the interfering of
some of them with Themselves,
undeniably prove to us, that the
things they search into are rather
to be admired than explained.</p>
            <p>I think I have at one time or
other read a good round compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Authours that treat of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
and I could never yet find
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58008:35"/>
that the most knowing and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
among them are confident and
peremptory in the asserting of their
Hypothesis about them: no, they
unanimously acknowledge their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Shallowness, they own
themselves to be non-pluss'd, and
have no other Esteem and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of these strange Sights than
of things most wonderfull and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing.</p>
            <p>One of the greatest Natural (as
well as Moral) Philosophers that
ever the World bred,<note place="margin">Senec. <hi>Nat. Quaest. l. 7. c.</hi> 1.</note> speaketh in
the beginning of his Book of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
after this manner concerning
his intended Disposition of Comets:
<hi>Quae an vera sint Dii sciunt, quibus
est scientia veri. Nobis rimari illa
&amp; conjecturare in Occulto tantùm
licet.</hi> He pretends not to Science,
but contents himself with bare
guessing.<note place="margin">Cap. 30.</note> And (in the same book)
he gives this Reason of it, <hi>Quàm

Quota pars operis tanti nostris ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
committitur?</hi> The great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the World hath thought
fit to hide many things from us,
and amongst them the Account of
these Phaenomena is one. More
particularly he ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
that that of the Tail or Bush
must be attributed to the <hi>Nature
of Comets,</hi> (so he expresses it,)<note place="margin">Cap. 27.</note> and
(as he explains himself) <hi>to causes
which are occult to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though others have thought
they have been able to solve these
Phaenomena, yet our great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
was not ashamed to confess
his Inability, and therefore he chose
to resolve them into some secret
Virtue and wonderfull Power;
which also made him style a Comet

are rightly ranked in the number of
those secrets of Nature which are
kept close to this very day, and it
is very rational to believe, that
they are the Products of hidden
Causes. Both this excellent Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and another clebrated Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician,<note place="margin">Regio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanus.</note>
whom <hi>Germany</hi> boasts

notices they have of these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and, like true Philosophers and
Christians, confess, that the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Works of God surpass Man's
profoundest Knowledge.</p>
            <p>And hear the faint words of that

Since I cannot, by reason of
the difficulty of the performance,
make what Discoveries I would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58008:36"/>
about the nature of Comets, I will
sally out as far as I am able, though
I know (alas) my Attempts will
be very Feeble and Imperfect,
where the Subject I treat of is so
lofty and arduous.</p>
            <p>What saith that Modern Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orologist?<note place="margin">Fromon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note>

(saith he) what account I make of
Comets, I declare, that I rank them
among the greatest and most hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Miracles of Nature. And after
he had been rendring a Reason of
the Tails of Comets, and refuting
other mens Opinions, he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that he remains unsatisfied,
and that such Lank Accounts would
rather starve than satiate an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive

And speaking there of other
Phaenomena of the Beard or Tail,
he concludes at last most devoutly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58008:37"/>
and ingeniously in these words,

Neither this Hypothesis, nor any

me satisfaction. How then can ye,

the defects of Philosophy and
our Understandings.</p>
            <p>Another Writer,<note place="margin">Franc Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta <hi>Meteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol. l. 1. c.</hi> 5.</note> on the same

this way of explaining the Nature
of Cometh is not altogether impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
but in my mind there is no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58008:37"/>
man can directly tell us how things
really are, unless he had the Art of
Divining.</p>
            <p>A late Astronomer, in imitation
of the Great Men before cited,<note place="margin">Ricciol. Almagest. <hi>Tom. 1. pars poster.</hi>
               </note>
reckons Comets <hi>inter Arcana mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
&amp; abditissima naturae Miracula:</hi>
and in the same place he makes
bold (and yet with a great share of
Modesty) to say, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
this <hi>Splendidum Aenigma
nunquam solvendum:</hi> he puts this
Riddle to the World which no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
will be ever able to explain.
This subtile Jesuite, who had set
down and examined whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had writ concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a Comets Train, and its
turing it self constantly from the
Sun, as if he despaired of solving
the difficulty in a Philosophical
way, at length betakes himself to
this Freak, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ricciol. <hi>Tom. 1. de Cometis.</hi>
               </note> that the Face of
the Comet is turned towards the
Sun like an Heliotrope, or as one
Face of the Loadstone turns it self to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58008:38"/>
one of the Poles. Would not one
imagine that he might as well have
said, to solve all, that the Head
of the Comet had Brains, and knew
when it was to Face about?</p>
            <p>There is <hi>Another</hi> who refers the
business to a secret Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Rays of the Sun,<note place="margin">Fancisc. Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez.</note> and
those of a Comet, insomuch that
these latter are, as it were, afraid
of the former, and consequently
flie away from them. But the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
grows more sober afterwards,
and finding, after all his exquisitive
Searches, that the Doctrine of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
was obscure and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
at last he ascribes the Make
and whole <hi>Regimen</hi> of them to God,<note place="margin">Tom. 1. pars poster.</note>
or some Intelligences; and in the
close of his Learned Tractate of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
he ends thus, <hi>In re adeò in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa
liceat tandem nobis ex hoc
Labyrintho si non exire, at certè
evolare.</hi> It is impossible (saith he)
in such a perplexed Maze as this,
to find my way out fairly and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58008:38"/>
and therefore I hasten to get
out how I can.</p>
            <p>You hear in what humble and
despairing Language they utter
themselves. And it is certain, that
the Persons who speak after this
manner had great Insight into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and were the chief Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Confidents of Nature. It
had been an easie thing for them to
have pitched upon an Hypothesis,
and gone through with it against
all Opposers; and they had Credit
and Authority enough to back
what they had a mind to avow.
This was not the course they took,
but they suspended their Judgments,
and nothing but mighty Dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and Amazement appear in
their Writings; and instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
positive and decretory, they
confessed themselves Silenced and
Puzzled. These great Dictators in
Philosophy would not be found in
this odd posture, if the matter of
their disquisition were not some
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58008:39"/>
thing Extraordinary and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
nay, if every thing in these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were not Rare and Astonishing:
which is a demonstration that they
were set up in the Heavens on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to call our Eyes to them, that
they were designedly placed there
to create Wonder, and to be taken
notice of, and that they are the
Amazing Finger of God to the
World.</p>
            <p>But though the wisest and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilest
Heads were backward in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Account of the Natural
Philosophy of Comets, yet (as you
shall be convinced afterwards) they
are plain and peremptory in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
their Opinions concerning
the <hi>Effects, Ends</hi> and <hi>Events</hi> of
them, the consideration of <hi>which</hi> is
my next, and indeed my Main Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
            <p>Having then dispatch'd our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Matter, Figure, and
other Properties of Comets, I am
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58008:39"/>
to shew you in the <hi>Second Place,</hi>
that they carry in them the true
Nature of <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> or (as
others are pleased to word it) of
<hi>Operative</hi> and <hi>Indicative Signs.</hi>
Some have stifly denied both these,
but I doubt not but I shall make it
evident to any Considerative Man,
that they lie under a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</p>
            <p>I assert then that Comets signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both <hi>Naturally</hi> and <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi>
that is, in <hi>Themselves,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>by Divine Institution.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you consider them <hi>Physically</hi>
or <hi>Theologically,</hi> they are certain
Indications and Signs of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
            <p>To prove them to be <hi>Causes</hi> or
<hi>Operative Signs</hi> I will treat of them
first <hi>Physically,</hi> and here I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to you these two things;</p>
            <p>1. That they have a Connexion
with the Nature of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58008:40"/>
2. That they are plain Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
and Resemblances of the
things signified, as Signs ought to
be.</p>
            <p>First, I say, They have some
Agreement and Connexion with
the Nature of those things of which
they are said to be Omens. And it
is necessary that this be cleared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we will step directly into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
and Divination. The things
which lead us to the knowledge of
future Events must have a Natural
Connexion with the things they are
said to point at, or else they may
justly be reckoned to be vain and
Fantastick: as <hi>Tully</hi> excellently
proves the vanity of the Gentile Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination
from this, that those means
which they used, as the Bowels of
Animals, the Chattering of Birds,
and the like, had no cognation and
alliance with the fortuitous things,
the knowledge and foresight of
which they pretended was acquired
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58008:40"/>
by them. He shews that there is
not any Consent or Sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these things, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
they are Cheats and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
And so here, it may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asked, Are future Evils produced
by Comets as by their proper
Causes? What certain Connexion
is there between those Calamities
and these Apparitions, so as that
we should be able to gather from
these, that such effects will assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow? We are certain that the
Philosophers of old thought there
was some Affinity between them,
and that Comets were both <hi>Signs</hi>
and <hi>Causes.</hi> It is vouched by them
once and again, that great and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Winds, and excessive Drougth,
are the Physical Effects of these
Appearances. <gap reason="foreign">

if they be frequently seen, the

Our Philosopher in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Questions is of this persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and observeth, that after Comets
(and he gives particular Instances)
great and continued Tempests (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Earthquakes) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
as the Natural Effects of
them. And not onely the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
but <hi>Modern</hi> Sages aver the
same. Thus the Learned <hi>Kepler,</hi>
(<hi>lib. de Cometis)</hi> and <hi>Cardan (lib.
de rerum varietate, l. 1. c.</hi> 1.) prove
the <hi>Natural Effects</hi> of Comets, and
the latter of these is not confuted
by his acute Opposer, <hi>(Scalig. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.</hi> 79. &amp;c.) According to these
it is no uneasie thing to make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
how by the extraordinary
and hurtfull Heat which is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a Comet, both when it is
in Sight, and after its Extinction,
several other Evils are caused in a
Natural way. From the Air and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58008:41"/>
Earth being infected, how easie a
consequence is there of Barrenness
and unfruitfull Seasons! If it once be
admitted that Comets distemper
and inflame the Air, and exhaust
the <hi>Succus</hi> of the Earth, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow, that a barren Soil,
and the corrupting and blasting of
the fruits, must be the Products of
them: And from these will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ensue Dearth, Scarcity and
Famine. And, as the inevitable
Effect of both, we must expect
Sickness, Diseases, Mortality, and
more especially the sudden Death
of many Great Ones, because these
are sooner and more easily hurt than
others, for their delicate Feeding,
and Luxurious course of Life, and
sometimes their great Cares and
Watchings, which weaken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble
their Bodies, render them
more obnoxious than the vulgar
sort of People. Hence it is that
Comets may deservedly be said to
presage the Death of mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58008:42"/>
and Princes, to be Funeral
Torches to light Kings to their
Tombs. And because by their
noxious and infectious Irradiations,
Mens Bloud is apt to be heightned
into Fevers and Calentures, and all
malignant Distempers, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the most contagious Diseases,
the Consequence of a Raging Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
from a Comet is very easie
and natural, if not almost necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Thus it is plain, that the
greatest and most dreaded Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have a Dependence on these
Prodigies, and are the Real and
Physical Effects of them.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is Objected, That
the Effects of Comets (as they are
presented to us by those that treat
of them) are contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this is soon answered; for that
there should be <hi>Contrary Effects</hi>
from the <hi>same Cause</hi> is no unusual
thing in Philosophy; wherefore
<hi>great Inundations</hi> likewise (no less
than <hi>Drought</hi>) may be the Product
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58008:42"/>
of these Causes; for that intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Weather which the Flames of
Comets beget, causeth an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
heap of Vapours and Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be drawn up, which form
themselves Naturally into Clouds,
and those Clouds in a short time
must needs fall down in excessive
Showres and immoderate Rains.
And it might be shewed also that
great calms, as well as Storms and
Tempests, Cold and Frost, no less
than extreme Heat, may be the
Effects, <hi>i. e.</hi> secondary Effects of
the same Cause.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It is no hard Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
to shew how Comets are
the Causes of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political,</hi>
as well as <hi>Natural Events.</hi> For
from what hath been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>viz.</hi> that they portend the
Death of Princes, it follows, that
they probably Bode great Changes
and Vicissitudes in Kingdoms, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Religion and other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
for History abundantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58008:43"/>
us, that these are oftentimes
the Consequences of a new Prince's
succeeding in the Throne.</p>
            <p>Besides, from the inflamed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Men, caused by a distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Air, Wars and Tumults, Broils
and Seditions naturally proceed. So
that Comets have been the Causes
and Forerunners, not onely of great
Storms and Concussions in the Air,
but of Turbulent and Tempestuous
Seasons in the State, of Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Massacres, Slaughter, Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and Mischiefs of all Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
both at home and from foreign
Quarters. These have been thought,
by men of sober Philosophy, to
have been the significations and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Comets. I will sum up all
their Dire Effects in these plain
Verses which I lately met with:

            </p>
            <p>Such Effects as these may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from those Causes; and I do
not see why they may not be called
<hi>Physical Events,</hi> since they proceed
from those as from Natural Causes
and Agents. Nor doth the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58008:45"/>
knowing <hi>Kepler</hi> dissent from
this, though (when he speaks of
the Comets, that appeared in the
Years 1607, and 1618.) he holds
they are the <hi>Causes</hi> of Disorders and
Calamities here below, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
kind of <hi>Sympathy</hi> which the
Sublunary Elements have with the
Heavenly Bodies: for notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his expressing himself after
that manner, he means no other
than what <hi>Aristotle, Ptolemy, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
and others, did, <hi>viz.</hi> That
there is a Natural Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Comets and those Evils which
are seen to ensue them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it
must be granted that these Porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Sights are not <hi>Necessary Causes,
i. e.</hi> Those Dismall Effects do not
<hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>infallibly</hi> follow them:
one is not <hi>necessarily</hi> and <hi>always</hi> the
Product of the other, (of which
more hereafter.)</p>
            <p>But that which I say, and I think
I have proved, is this, that they are
commonly chained together like
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58008:45"/>
Natural Causes and Effects, and
that the Natural Power of those
Causes is able to produce, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
doth actually produce such
Effects; and this is enough to prove
them to be <hi>True Causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They are (as Signs
ought to be) <hi>Plain Representations</hi>
of the things signified. We may
learn from the very <hi>Make</hi> of Comets
what they are <hi>designed for.</hi> Their
<hi>Figure</hi> is representative of that
which is meant by them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they display themselves in the
shape of <hi>Besoms,</hi> as if they taught
us by that homely Embleme, what
we ought to doe, <hi>viz.</hi> to remove
our Defilements and Pollutions, not
to say, as if they were sent to tell a
Nation that they shall be <hi>swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
and destroyed for their Sins.
How often (without any help of
Fancy) doth this prodigious Light
appear in the likeness and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a <hi>Rod,</hi> to acquaint us that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58008:46"/>
it was designed to correct and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
a froward People, and that we
ought to submit to it's Pedagogy?
When we see it at another time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
it self like a <hi>Torch</hi> or <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note>
how can we think otherwise
than that it is sent to give more <hi>Light</hi>
to the dark World, or if it despise that,
to shew that it deserveth to be <hi>burnt
up?</hi> I know that all this will pass
with some for mere moral Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or divine Fancies. It will be said
that some devout Fools will make
things to be like any thing they
please. But then I desire to know
whether the old Pagan Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
were a sort of Religious Fools,
whether <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> (whom I
have often brought on the Stage,)
especially the latter of them, whose
Writings let us understand he was
one of <hi>Those Fools who say in their
Heart there is no God,</hi> whether
These, and all the profound Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
who have writ of the Figures
of Comets, and did it not to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58008:46"/>

their Judgments, whether These,
I say, were Religious and Fancifull

30 days in the Year 632,<note place="margin">Funccius Spondanus</note> or

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:58008:48"/>
but they were <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Substantial,</hi>
and no man need nourish any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Fancy to make out these Shapes
and Resemblances; from which
we may certainly infer that they
are <hi>truly Significant</hi> and <hi>Presaging.</hi>
I must confess that <hi>Gaffarel</hi> (in his
Book of Curiosities) and <hi>Cornelius
Gemma</hi> (<hi>de Nat. Charact. divin.</hi>)
are too Fantastical in their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Figures of Comets, and too
punctual in determining the effects
from such Likenesses and Shapes.
But, as I am no Slave of these Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocriticks,
so I must needs profess
that it is irrational and impious to
disregard the Finger of God in the
peculiar shape of some Comets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some idle Writers have indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Fancy and Humour, and
have shewed themselves conceited
in the account they give of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of Comets.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have considered these
Heavenly Bodies <hi>Naturally,</hi> and as
they are <hi>in themselves:</hi> Now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58008:49"/>
that I treat of them <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically,</hi>
as they are <hi>by Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi>
and <hi>Institution</hi> rendred
<hi>Significative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Pleasure of the great
Moderatour of all things, (and that
is sufficient) that these should be set
up as Signs. And <hi>This</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
even by those who will not
be brought to confess the <hi>former.</hi>

But I will make it plain, that <hi>Both
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58008:49"/>
these</hi> are very consistent, and that
the consideration of Comets in both
these respects is Rational and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.
We may treat of them
not onely as Natural Philosophers,
but as pious Men and Christians.
I know God sometimes speaketh to
the World by Supernatural Signs,
without making use of Second
Causes, and even against the course
and order of Nature. These are
<hi>Divine Signs onely;</hi> but now I am
speaking of such as are <hi>Natural
Signs and Causes, i. e.</hi> produced in
a Natural way wholly or partly,
and are Physical Causes of such and
such Effects, and yet are <hi>Divine
Signs likewise:</hi> For it may be worth
your observing, that the <hi>Same
things</hi> may be <hi>Natural Causes and
Effects,</hi> and yet <hi>Divine Tokens.</hi>
The Rainbow signifies the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between God and Man, and
therefore is styled the <hi>Token of the
Covenant,</hi> 9. Gen. 13. but withall
it is a Meteor that hath a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58008:50"/>
Production, and the Cause of
it is made out by Philosophy. Fire
and Brimstone from Heaven burnt
up the lewd Sinners of <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and yet when I reade in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 10. and in profane Writers,
that these Cities were near to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Pits of Slime, and fat and pitchy
Clay, I can well conceive also how
that dreadfull Conflagration was
carried on even by Natural Causes,
how the Fire broke out of the Earth
to meet that which rained from
Heaven, and consequently how
the Destruction of those places may
partly be attributed to the Nature
of the Soil, and the Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Matter it afforded. The Tower
of <hi>Babel</hi> was without doubt demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by the Signal Hand of the
Almighty;<note place="margin">Antiquit. l. 1. c. 15. De Praep. Evang. l. 9. c. 4.</note> yet it may be true
which <hi>Iosephus</hi> relates, and after

was thrown down by a Tempest
and extraordinary force of Wind.

In <hi>Elias</hi> his time the Drought
which happened in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi>
was a Calamity which is
wont to be produced by Natural
Causes, and from it Naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a Famine; but both these
were peculiar Signs of the Divine
Anger, and by these God shewed
his Wrath against the Sins of the
People. The Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which were procured by
<hi>Samuel</hi> were in Harvest Time,
(1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 16.) which is supposed
to be a warm Season, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according to the Natural course
of things a fit time for that sort of
Meteors; yet we know that they
were designed to be marks of God's
displeasure and Anger. And the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture informs us how at other
times God hath created Awe and
Terrour by them. The Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58008:51"/>
their Law in Thunder and
Lightning, and on other occasions
were affrighted into a remembrance
of their Duty by the same means.
The voice of Thunder rouzes some
stupid Souls into the serious belief
of a Divine Power. <hi>Coelo Tonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem

               <note place="margin">Horat.</note> Nothing in
Nature leaves such impressions of
Fear as loud and repeated Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclaps.
Some Emperours who
were in a manner <hi>Atheists,</hi> (and
notwithstanding that (which is
strange) made Themselves <hi>Gods</hi>)
yet used to Tremble at this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Allarm from Heaven, and to
confess a greater Power than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which is as much as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
their Self-Divinity. This made
<hi>Caligula</hi> get under his Bed. And
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> another of <hi>Iupiter's</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Fellow-Gods, was glad
of his Chaplet of Laurel to secure
him from Lightnings. These few
Instances above named are sufficient
to convince us, that the same things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58008:51"/>
are not onely <hi>Natural Causes or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi>
but that they <hi>signifie by God's
Appointment.</hi> And <hi>This</hi> may be
applied to <hi>Comets,</hi> which as they
are produced themselves in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
way, <hi>viz.</hi> from a Collection of
matter in the Heavens, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some uncertain and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
spaces of Time, so they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Effects in the same Natural
course: and yet God uses them as
Tokens of his Wrath, and appoints
them to be <hi>Divine Signs,</hi> and to
Bode extraordinary things to come.
Which was the sense of one of the
Writers of the Byzantine History.
<gap reason="foreign">

Comets (saith he) which are seen in

Deaths of Kings or other Illustrious

St. <hi>Basil</hi> the great. From which it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58008:52"/>
is evident that the same Things
may have certain and manifest
Causes in Nature, and are likewise
appointed by the Authour of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to presignifie future Events, so
that it is possible not onely to attain
to a <hi>Physical Knowledge</hi> of them, but
a kind of <hi>Divination.</hi> But my
main business at present is to make
good this Latter, and to prove that
Comets are Signs of future Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<hi>ex Instituto Divino,</hi> that it is
God's Will and Pleasure they should
signifie such things.</p>
            <p>In order to this I will onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
that God gives Notice before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
by evident Tokens what he
intends to doe afterwards, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
there be no Prevention by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of Mens Lives. This is
the meaning of the whole sixth
Chapter of the Book of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is an Account of the
<hi>Opening of the Seals,</hi> and sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us the <hi>Forerunners</hi> of the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
which were to <hi>follow.</hi> And
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58008:52"/>
though it is presented in the way of
a <hi>Vision,</hi> yet if Mens Eyes were
Open it would be seen to be the
<hi>usual Method</hi> of the Most High in
the World. Accordingly I aver,
that Comets are <hi>Warnings and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers</hi>
of <hi>God's Wrath and Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
against the Wickedness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and also of the <hi>Effects</hi> of that
Displeasure, which are some ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
calamities. They are undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Arguments that there is some
great Disorder in the World, and
that things are exceedingly amiss.
They are signal Testimonies that
Sin and Vice are predominant; for
these are the onely things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God to Anger. Now those
prodigious Appearances in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are fitted to this Purpose, (<hi>viz.</hi>
of allarming us, and giving Notice
of ensuing Evils) because they are
both <hi>unusual</hi> and <hi>affrighting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, As they are Rare and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual,
they are serviceable to this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58008:53"/>
purpose. For it happeneth, it seems,
by the Make, or rather the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Disposition of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that what is common and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
course of things, is slighted by
us, and thence it is necessary that
we should sometimes be surprized
and extraordinarily moved by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are rare and uncommon.

to admire what is Rare, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than what is Great.</p>
            <p>But the Appearances we are
speaking of are both Rare and Great,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58008:53"/>
and therefore doubly deserve to be
taken notice of, and to be made the
Subject of our deepest Admiration.
Worthily did our Philosopher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
his Book of Comets with those
excellent words, <hi>Nemo usque eò
tardus &amp; hebes &amp; demissus in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
est ut ad Divina non erigatur,
ac totâ mente consurgat, utique ubi
Novum aliquod è coelo Miraculum

sunk into the very Earth who doth
not lift up his Soul to God, and
what is Divine and Heavenly, as
soon as he beholds such a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Apparition as a Comet.</p>
            <p>Again, These great Bodies are
<hi>Affrighting,</hi> and that on a double
account.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Rarity</hi> of them (which
I before spoke of) makes them so.
For to what purpose are these <hi>unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Spectacles</hi> shewn by God to
the World? To what end are these
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58008:54"/>
strange <hi>Shapes</hi> set before us? There
are innumerable Lights of Heaven
of an entire round Figure which
we constantly behold, but what
mean these which appear but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
with fiery Scrolls or flaming
Labells issuing from them? It is
downright sottishness to think that
these are set up for vain shews and
useless sights. It is unworthy of
Providence to defend this. But it
is highly reasonable to think that
they are appointed by God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
and terrifie the World, to
denounce future Judgments, and
to forewarn Men of the Wrath to
come, and to let them expect the
emptying of the Vials of God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their <hi>Posture</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
(as hath been partly sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
already) render them <hi>Terrible.</hi>
They have such a Frame and Shape
given them by God as is apt to stir
up Fear and Dread. You have read
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58008:54"/>
in what Images they appear: And
though I know it may be said that
there are other Shapes (besides those
I mentioned) which are not danting
and affrighting, yet, as those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
themselves are <hi>Irregular</hi> and
<hi>Monstrous,</hi> and of a Figure diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from all the Luminaries of
Heaven, they are on that score
<hi>Terrible.</hi> And you may remember
that all the Phaenomena belonging
to Comets (of which I have given
a particular Narrative) breed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
amazement and Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Wherefore are these strange
Lights hung up so high in the great
and spatious Theatre of Heaven,
but that all Eyes should behold
them, and tremble at them? In
short, the Eternal Being looks an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily
upon the World in the Blaze
of a Comet.</p>
            <p>If it be asked <hi>Why</hi> God gives
Warning of future Calamities by
such Harbingers? I answer, He
doth it,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:58008:55"/>
1. That Men may <hi>Expect</hi> and
<hi>Provide</hi> in time against those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Events. And the mercifull
Governour of the Universe bids us
by such Monitors <hi>Prepare</hi> for his
Judgments, either by making our
selves ready to receive them with
Patience and contentment, or by
what wise Expedients we can to
guard and defend our selves against
them. Appositely whereunto saith
the Byzantine Annalist,<note place="margin">

               </gap>. God indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to men certain Signs by which
they may have a Prospect of what
shall be, and so by that means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
their Safety when the Storm
cometh: according to that remark
of the wisest Head, <hi>A prudent man
foreseeth the Evil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and hideth him
self.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p>2. We are admonished by these
Heavenly Nuncio's wholly to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58008:55"/>
and <hi>Divert</hi> the Evils which
are Threatned. And this is to be
effected by humble Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
by Repentance and Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto God. These Celestial
Prodigies are purposely set up by
the Omnipotent Creatour to fright
the wicked out of their sins. They
are Admonitions to them that they
should not indulge their Pride, Lust,
Oppression, Covetousness, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness,
and that they should not
think because of their greatness and
Riches to goe unpunished. As often
as a Comet appeareth, a solemn
Fast and Humiliation should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
Devout and Earnest Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
should be put up, to divert the
Storm from falling on our Heads,
and that utter Confusion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
may not be our portion.
Pope <hi>Calistus,</hi> above 200 Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,<note place="margin">Platina <hi>in vit.</hi> Calist.</note>
ordered the Litany and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers to be solemnly said se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Days together, merely upon
the appearance of these Signs. The
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58008:56"/>
nicest Protestant may safely follow
this Order, I mean, have recourse
to his Prayers upon the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
A Christian Divine cannot
have a better Text to preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
from then a Comet.
Hence he may with a becoming
Warmth and Zeal invite Men to
amend their ways, and to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to the Incensed Majesty of
Heaven, and so to flee from the
Wrath and Vengeance which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
would fall upon them.
This Finger of God beckoneth from
Heaven to call us thither. These
Signs Above are to make Us better
who are Below. They are sent for

Great Man's Astrological Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
is this, That the Appearance of
Comets, those Celestial Heralds

as these; namely, To remind

and unsetled duration of Life, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them that it is the design of

Tokens there, that we may be
invited to a Dread and Reverence
of the Divine Majesty, by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
such wonderfull and unusual
Signs, that we may daily expect
some great thing in our own and
other Countreys, and provide for
such Tidings; that we may, by the
Fear and Awe of God wrought in
us, betake our selves speedily to
Repentance and a holy Life: and
lastly, that hence we might have
some Representation and Specimen
(as it were) of the Sign of the Son
of Man, and of those terrible won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in Heaven and Earth, which
shall precede the Coming of Christ
to Judgment. Lo! what excellent
Divinity a Comet affords! How
devoutly do these Sons of <hi>Vrania</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:58008:58"/>
discourse! But you do not hear
them talk thus of the Sun, Moon
and Stars, the ordinary and leiger
Luminaries of Heaven. No: They
know there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Them and the other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Heralds that make their
Appearance to us. <hi>These</hi> are made
for other uses and purposes, and as
they are fatal in themselves, and in
their own Nature, so they are signs
set up by God <hi>ex Instituto,</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token
future Evils.</p>
            <p>But how can we certainly know
that Comets are Appointed for such
purposes? If they are Divine Signs,
where hath God told us so?</p>
            <p>I answer, God speaks to and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
Mankind not onely by his
written Laws, the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but by the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
by the course of Nature, and
by Acts of Providence. God speaks
by <hi>These</hi> as well as by his <hi>Word.</hi>
These are plain Intimations of his
Mind, and hereby he is used to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58008:58"/>
to us what he would have us
doe or forbear. I may know God's
Will and Pleasure by the Order and
Frame of things which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in the World, and by the
frequent Results and Consequences
of them.</p>
            <p>From the Consideration that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
are of a Peculiar Make and
Figure, and in all respects different
from the other Heavenly Bodies,
and also from the General and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Observation that they prove
Fatal to Countries and Kingdoms,
(as <hi>Kepler,</hi> and several other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
persons have observed, and
particularly set down the publick
Miseries and Calamities which have
insued in divers Nations soon after
the appearing of Comets: and the
History of all Ages hath given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
proof of it) from these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
I am sufficiently Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
to look upon them as God's
Hand. I am forced by this to take
notice of the Divine Pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:58008:59"/>
But if any one shall still urge the
Question, and ask me, Where are
we told that these Comets and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
are Divine Signs?</p>
            <p>I Answer, We are told so direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Infallible and Holy Book,
by one who was an accurate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of the Works of God; <hi>Thou
hast given</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Banner</hi> (or) <hi>a
Sign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Signum, Syr. Arab. Castal. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Seventy Interp.</hi> Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, Vulg. Lat.</note> 
               <hi>a Token unto them that fear
thee,</hi> Psal. 60. 4. Thou, O God,
who are mercifull to all Mankind,
but in a special manner to those
who fear and serve thee, art pleased
to give warning of approaching E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and as it were to hold up a
<hi>Signal,</hi> that thy Servants may be
admonished to avoid the impendent
Danger, even when hardned sinners
are overtaken and crushed with it.
Such a Banner was that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
presaging, as Victory to his Army,
so Confusion to that of his Enemies.
Such a <hi>Signal</hi> and <hi>Token</hi> is every
<hi>Bearded Light</hi> that sheweth it self
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58008:59"/>
in the Heavens, though 'tis difficult
to bring some prejudiced minds to
believe it.</p>
            <p>I answer again, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
expresly abetts this Doctrine
in the 28th of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where
<hi>Moses,</hi> or rather God, threatens the
People, that if they will not observe
to doe all his Commandments, all
these Curses shall come upon them,
<hi>viz.</hi> Scarcity, Famine, Drought,
Pestilence, Sword, Blasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Now these Calamities are the signs
of God's Wrath, for they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and threatned here as such:
whence it undeniably follows that
the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Procurers</hi> of them,
which I have proved Comets to
be, are no less the Signs and Marks
of the Divine Displeasure; for no
rational Man can deny, that the
Cause here must be of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the Effect: So then <hi>these
Menaces and Threatnings</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prove <hi>those Appearances</hi> to be
<hi>Significative,</hi> and that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58008:60"/>
by God to portend evil Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
to the World.</p>
            <p>You see then what it is I defend,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Comets are <hi>Signs</hi> of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Calamities, and <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
of God's Anger to Mankind.
If upon some difficulties which
might be alledged, I should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to wave the one, yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
my self the other is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
But I have proved both,
especially the latter, which I most
insist upon. And I may lawfully,
without being over-bold, conclude
from the Premisses, that these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Lamps of Heaven are
presages of future Evil, and that God
hath instituted and impowered
them for that end.</p>
            <p>I have now dispatched my <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Task,</hi> and in that I have <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
prevented my self as to the <hi>Third</hi>
which I propounded, which was
to shew what abundant Suffrage
my Assertion hath from all ranks of
Writers. But now I will <hi>purposely</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58008:60"/>
pursue that Undertaking, and I
will be the shorter in it because I
have done so much towards it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>That it may appear then that I
maintain no Paradox, and that I
dote not on an Opinion by my self,
I will let you see that what I have
offered concerning the Presages and
dreadfull Effects of Comets, is the
Sense of the Wise and Judicious;
and if Authority be an Argument,
we must needs close with the side I
have taken. Let the <hi>Poets</hi> stand forth
first, who were the Earliest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
Naturalists, Astronomers,
nay, the first Divines, and therefore
Competent Judges in the Case.</p>

            <p>But perhaps it will be said that
Poets are a fancyfull sort of People,
and for that Reason are not much
to be heeded. They talk of Men
and Women turn'd into Stars, and
indeed they have a gift of Extolling
persons to Heaven when they please.
They will make a <hi>Head of Hair a
Constellation,</hi> as they did <hi>Berenice</hi>'s,
and what will they not then doe
with the <hi>Shagged Locks</hi> of a <hi>Comet?</hi>
We know what they <hi>have done</hi> in
that Case: they have represented
them (as they ought) fierce and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
and though they cloath their
matter in verse, yet they are as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58008:65"/>
as any prose. If it be said that
they speak according to the sense of
the Vulgar, (whom it is their work
to please,) and therefore are the
less to be attended to, I answer for
them and my self together, that
though I do not find my self incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be led by Popular Humour
and Caprice, yet I see no reason to
reject and explode an Opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is Common, and hath had
the General Suffrage of Mankind
to vouch it. This should rather
prompt us to embrace it with the
greater Seriousness, and induce us
to believe, that what hath thus
gained the Universal Vogue of the
World, is certainly founded on
some clear Deductions of Reason
which are Common to the whole
Race of Men.</p>
            <p>But I will pass from the <hi>Poets</hi> to
<hi>Others</hi> who are thought to be of
Profounder Judgments. Expect
now no Fancies and Raptures, but
solid and judicious Determinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:58008:65"/>To begin with the great <hi>Oratour</hi>
and <hi>Philosopher,</hi> he backeth the
Prince of Poets, acquainting us
that in the Civil War between <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Augustus</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi>
it was observed that Comets were
the Harbingers of the Miseries that
then befell them: <hi>Stellae quas Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci
Cometas, nostri Cincinnatas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
nuper bello Octaviano magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
fuerunt Calamitatum praenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae.</hi>
Cicero. <hi>l. 2. de Nat. Deor.</hi> And
in the same place he leaveth this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Memoire for Posterity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of, That this is a Truth which
hath been confirmed by various Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
(many of which he instances
in) from All Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Next let us hear the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Natural Philosophers</hi> who
writ purposely of Comets (if I
may once again bring them in to
testifie in this Cause, after I have
done it so often.) A Comet (saith
<hi>Pliny, l. 2. c.</hi> 25.) is <hi>Terrificum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
ex parte sidus, ac non Leviter pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum.</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58008:66"/>
A Star (so he calleth it)
which in a huge manner terrifies
and astonishes the World, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes off without great Mischief.
And he sheweth the Truth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of this in the foregoing
Age and in his own. Take <hi>Seneca</hi>'s
Thoughts in those few but plain
words, <hi>Nat. Qu. l. 7. c. 17. Cruenti
quidam, Minaces, qui Omen post se
futuri sanguinis serunt. Some</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
(he would have said <hi>All,</hi> but
that his Master <hi>Nero</hi> was not to
be offended, as you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
afterwards) are very cruel,
and threaten us with the worst of
Mischiefs: they bring with them
and leave behind them the seeds of
Bloud and Slaughter.</p>
            <p>Next, let us look into a few <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi>
and see whether they were
of the same Mind. The Comet
which was seen in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time is
thus mentioned by one that writes
his Life, <hi>Stella Crinita,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in</hi> Nerone.</note> 
               <hi>quae summis

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58008:66"/>
putatur.</hi> But this being an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
onely of the vulgar Opinion,
let us hear him speak his ownsense;
which he doth in another place
thus: <hi>Praesagia mortis ejus praecipua
fuerunt exortus Crinitae stellae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in</hi> Claudio.</note>

the memorable Words of <hi>Anna

Emperour, whose Life she writ,

of a great Comet that was taken

This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
(saith she) by the usual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Providence in such
cases, for it was not fit that so great
and strange an Alteration of things
as was brought to pass by that
coming of theirs should be without
some previous Denunciation and
Admonishment from Heaven, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexiad.

               </gap>; What

What strange Tidings doth this
Messenger from above arrive with?
Let me adjoin the remarkable words
of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> that great Master of

speaks of Comets, <hi>Vt ut se res ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat,

            <p>Now I will produce professed
<hi>Mathematicians</hi> and <hi>Astronomers</hi>
who have maintained the <hi>Presage
of Comets.</hi> And not to name <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Ptolemaeus,</hi> the Prince of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
who flourished about 135
Years after Christ, and settled this
Doctrine in the 98, 99, and 100 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisms
of his <hi>Centiloquium;</hi> I will
onely make use of such as are
Enemies to the Judiciary part of
Astrology, and some of whom have
professedly, writ against it. Such a
one was the admirable <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi>
who yet denieth not the Presage of
Comets, It being irrational (saith
he) to think that God and Nature
shew these unusual Lights to no
purpose, and that they are of no
use to the World: and accordingly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58008:69"/>
he sets down his Conjectures and
Prognostications of the New Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
then in the Heavens.
Onely he condemns those who are
peremptory, and imagine their
Conjectures to be infallible, and in
the close of the first Tome of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymnasmata</hi>
(where he delivers this)
he laments the Weakness and Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness
of our Knowledge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Stars, much more of those
that are extraordinary Luminaries.</p>
            <p>I forbear to transcribe the words

but let there be, for all me, this
Opinion fixed in Mens Minds,
That there are portended by them
great Evils and Calamities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God (who hears and sees what

There is good ground for the usual

The Attestation of this person is
the more considerable, because he
was a Professed Enemy not onely
to Genethliacal Predictions, but to
all other Astrological Divinations,
which he undertakes to confute in
the 3d Tome of his <hi>Dogmata Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logica,</hi>
book 1. chap. 9. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his noble Testimony is no
other than this, that these rare and
unusual Bodies, which have no set
and periodical Time of Appearing,
are Certain Signs of Future Events.
It is no rash and groundless belief
that these are on purpose set up on
High to be as it were Beacons to
give notice of some imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and to be looked upon as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
of very dreadfull occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
This is confirmed by the
History of all Ages, and this is the

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58008:73"/>
and such as pretend to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination,
but of the most godly
and serious Heads, who certainly
make a considerable number in the
World: and no man in his right
Wits will say that <hi>All these</hi> (not to
speak now of the <hi>Vulgar</hi>) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and conspire in one grand
Errour.<note place="margin">

of a late Learned Italian Divine,
Professour of Ethicks in <hi>Padua;</hi> they
are these: It is assured (saith he)
from the known Experience of all
Times, that whensoever Comets
appear, they portend some Changes,
Slaughters and Calamities, but the
Cause of such things is not easily
assigned, nor hath it been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
searched into by any.<note place="margin">Dissertat. 22.</note> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when he had enumerated
several Comets which appeared in
divers foregoing ages, and had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the particular Fatal Accidents
which were portended by them and
presently broke out, he concludes
in such General words as These:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58008:73"/>
In every age of the World Comets
have been observed to give Notice
of Publick and Common Evils
which were forthwith to follow
them, nor is it necessary or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to quote the particular Annals
of all Times to make this farther
evident. And the Suffrage of this
Learned Church-man is the more
to be valued because the Design and
Aim of his whole Book is to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate
the Presages of all other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies; so that it was the
mere conviction of Reason and
Truth that made him <hi>Except these,</hi>
and declare that they are really <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you hear what Poets, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
Philosophers, Historians and
Politicians, Mathematicians and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
have said of this matter. I
have one Testimony more to add,
and it is of a Person, who was all
these, I had almost said, more
than these. For though he was no
Divine by Function and Profession,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58008:74"/>
yet how vastly accomplished he
was in the Study of Theology and
the Scripture, his Works have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
to the World. And it is
as well known how excellent a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
Oratour, Historian, Statesman,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how great a Master of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and all usefull Learning he was.
This man, who was <hi>Himself</hi> a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy;</hi>
thus gives us his Thoughts in

Comets, and Fiery Swords,
and such like Signs are wont to be
the Fore-runners of great Changes
in the world.</p>
            <p>I have done now with my Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and truly I am heartily
glad of it, for I affect not to mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
up the Writers, and to see Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
stand in Rank and File. I
know that good Sense will defend
itself without a Bead-roll of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58008:74"/>
Names. But it was <hi>Necessary</hi>
on this occasion to heap up Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
because those of the contrary
Opinion are pleased to brag of
their Authours. But I hope it will
now appear that all the World is
not of their side, and that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
which I maintain is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the sense of the Many, but of the
grave and wise, the sober and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious,
and those whose Sedate
Judgments over-rule their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
Men of all Studies agree
in this; Humanity and Divinity
concenter here; heathens and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the Popish and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and some of every Persuasion
are heard to declare that Comets
are supernatural Signs, and were
appointed to terrifie and admonish
this Inferiour World, and to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursors
of approaching Miseries.
But that which I most mind, is,
that we have on our side the ablest
Judges and best Advocates of this
Cause, for such I reckon the truly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58008:75"/>
Pious and Vertuous to be. I have
observed both in Mens studied Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and ordinary speakings, that
those who favour this Point are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
found to be Persons of a
greater Inclination to Piety and
Goodness than others are. They
seem to have minds more Divinely
enlightned, and more inwardly
touched with the sense of Religion
and the Providence of God in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the World. And who are
they that defend the contrary?
Commonly (I do not say always)
they are Men of greater Wit than
Conscience, they know how to
blanch a bad Cause, they delight
to shew their Skill in maintaining
an Argument and weathering a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.
They are likewise great
Flatterers and Parasites, and love to
humour the Age. They nourish
the sottishness of People, and give
Narcoticks and Opiates to those
that are of themselves drowsie and
stupid. And if this be done by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58008:75"/>
those who are of that holy Functio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which engages them to give
warning to their flock of imminent
Dangers, to discharge the Office
of Watchmen, and not to sow
Pillows under a soft and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Generation of Men; the
Crime is yet more Black and Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
They carry on the Plot of
Atheists and Epicures, to root out
the Notion of a God, to extirpate
Providence, to debauch Mens Lives
and Manners, and to blot out the
sense of another World.</p>
            <p>I am now to enter upon the Fourth
and Last General Part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which is to <hi>Answer</hi> the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi>
which are levelled against
the foresaid Doctrine. For so it is
that there are a sort of People who
in defiance of the Nature of things,
the clear Discoveries of Reason, the
Direction of Providence, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Testimony of Scripture, and
a Cloud of Humane Witnesses are
resolved to maintain their Post,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58008:76"/>
and in order to that they discharge
with great fury several severe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
against the opposite side, and
think thereby to fright others from
coming over to Us, and imbracing
our Assertion.</p>
            <p>First, It is Objected that our
Doctrine proceeds from Pride and
a haughty Spirit.<note place="margin">Gassend. <hi>Meteor.</hi>
               </note> These Men (say
they) have an over-fond conceipt of
themselves, as if God took especial
care of them in every thing that
happeneth. Can't a Star appear,
but it must be for their sakes?
What is the Reason they are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?
It proceeds from no other
bottom than this, <hi>viz.</hi> The unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
Vanity which some abound
with, who think themselves such
Persons to whom Prodigies (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
must be sent.</p>
            <p>I answer,</p>
            <p>1. That this is a gross mistake,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58008:76"/>
that Comets or the like Prodigies
appear for the sake of one sort of
Persons onely, or that any Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
man ever said so.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas it is said that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Pride and vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of Men, that Comets are thought
to signifie, I retort with undeniable
Truth, that it is the effect of Pride
and Arrogance to reckon them
as needless and Trivial, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the manifest Work of God.
Nay,</p>
            <p>3. This is an Argument of gross
Profaneness as well as Pride. This
is clear from the <hi>present Cavil</hi> that
the Patrons of that Cause carry on
(as I said) the Plot and Design of
Atheistical Spirits, who would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
God from the <hi>Government</hi> and
<hi>Care of the World.</hi> Whereas it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that all ranks of Beings, but
especially rational Creatures, are
under the Eye and Conduct of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58008:77"/>
The Stoicks said well, that
as Man was made for God, so all
things were made for Man. The
whole Mass of the Creation is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to this Darling and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the Almighty. Man <hi>is as
it were the Centre of the World in
respect of final Causes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Sapient. Ve<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er.</note> saith an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Person. The Celestial
Bodies as well as those of a lower
Order administer to his best Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.
When the Man after God's
own Heart had <hi>considered the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>the Work of God's Fingers,
the Moon and the Stars which he
had ordained,</hi> he cried out, (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
tells us) <hi>What is Man that thou
art mindfull of him? and the Son of
Man that thou visitest him?</hi> As if
there were no greater Argument
and Demonstration of the Divine
Care and Providence over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than what is to be observed
in the Heavenly Bodies. And if it
be said that those words speak of
the Natural and Regular Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58008:77"/>
in the Heavens, as the Sun,
and Moon, and ordinary Stars, I
reply that the Argument is the
stronger on our side; for if the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and ordinary Luminaries are a
proof of God's Mindfulness of the
Inhabitants of this Inferiour World,
then much more the strange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ones are such. And
this is sufficient ground to <hi>consider
the Heavens</hi> (as that Holy man
did,) to regard and take notice of
the Works of the Lord, and the
Operation of his Hands, especially
to observe and admire those Signs
in the Heavens which so seldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
To look up towards them,
and take an exact view of them, is
most suitable to the piercing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man's Soul, and to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Figure which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on his Body. It is so far
from savouring of Vanity and Pride
to think that those Prodigies are
sent for his sake, that it is his duty
to believe so, and to attend serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58008:78"/>
to the import of them. For by
Comets God is pleased as by new
Arguments to urge and inculcate
his presence in the World, that
when the ordinary course of Nature
and Providence doth not move
men, they may be rouzed by these
Wonderous and Rare Objects, and
have their Eyes effectually opened
to see and confess a God.</p>
            <p>A Second Cavil is of this nature,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it hath been observed that
great Advantages have been the
Events to some Persons and Places
after a Comet hath appeared, and
therefore there is no reason to
reckon it as a Sign of God's Anger,
but rather of his Favour. Doth not
the Philosopher thus speak of the
Comet which was seen at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes
in uno totius orbis loco colitur
in Templo Romae, admodum Faustus
Divo Augusto judicatus ab ipso.</hi> And
afterwards, <hi>Si verum fatemur, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutare
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58008:78"/>
id terris fuit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 25.</note> It was thought
to be so auspicious that it was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
by the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the Emperour himself judged it to
be a most happy Phaenomenon.</p>
            <p>I Answer,</p>
            <p>1. If any one hath maintained
that no good Effects or Advantages
have ever followed the appearance
of Comets, it is nothing to me, I
do not defend it, neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reason for it. It is my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the very Rise and Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in those parts of the
Heavenly Regions where they are
generated is to good and excellent
Purposes; for it is probable that the
acute <hi>Kepler</hi> is in the right, who
conceiveth a Comet to be a long
Collection of corrupt and filthy
matter, a kind of an Apostem in
the Heavens, that as in Man's Body
putrid Humours often gather into
one part, so they do in the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58008:79"/>
ones. And these superfluous and
excremental humours breaking out,
the Aether (like the Body of Man)
is thereby kept Sound and Hale,
the unwholsome matter is purged
and drained away by these Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
By this means the Heavens
exonerate themselves of Noxious
Qualities which had been long ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
and would in time corrupt
them. So that the evacuating of
this matter is for the Preservation
of the Heavens. The Sun and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Luminaries fare the better for
the expulsion of this gross stuff
which would otherwise over-run
them with Thick <hi>Maculae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the very Production of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
is advantageous to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
But that is not all; they are
so likewise to the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>I have in the foregoing Discourse
granted that Comets are sent out of
<hi>Kindness</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> to Mankind,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58008:79"/>
as well as to a <hi>Contrary End.</hi> They
are to call the offending World to
Repentance, and to remind them
of their greatest concern, which
things, if they be heartily pursued,
will produce unspeakable Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Blessings.</p>
            <p>2. I grant that Comets have not
been without good and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Consequences; and indeed it
cannot be otherwise. For the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which happen to some
prove beneficial to others. With e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Effects there are good ones al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
joined; such is the excellent
mixture of Providence in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the World. Blessings
then may follow Comets. As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Plague</hi> (which none will
deny to be a great evil) be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
issue of these Prodigies, yet by
this a City and whole Countrey
may receive great Advantage. A
sweeping Pestilence made way for
Queen Elizabeth to the Crown, by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58008:80"/>
removing those who were her most
Implacable and potent Enemies. By
this means a considerable number
of bad men may be carried off;
and some of those who remain and
are spared, may by that Mercy be
reduced to a better understanding
of themselves, and a thorough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of their Lives, which
are good and desirable Effects. Or
suppose <hi>War</hi> to be the consequence
of a Comet, who knows not that
if one party is vanquished, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
overcomes? Though Violence,
Death and Ruine be the allotment
of the former, yet Joy and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are the purchase of the latter.
Thus that portentous Apparition
which <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great beheld
in the Heavens, though it was aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
to him and his Army, as
the Inscription of it told, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
most Fatal to <hi>Maxentius</hi> and his
Forces. Or say that some great
Prince is cut off by the malign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of one of those Heavenly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58008:80"/>
Signs, then what follows but this,
that as he loses his Crown, so ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gets it? And as his being cut
off may prove a deplorable Loss and
Calamity if he were good, so it may
happen to administer the greatest
matter of Joy, and actually produce
the most Happy Consequences ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
if he were of a contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and much more, if he be succeeded
by a Person who wants none of the
Accomplishments belonging to the
Character of a King. So that those
who started the Objection have
gained no more than this, that what
is good to one is oftentimes of a
contrary Nature to another; those
very Events which some find
to be Fortunate, others experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be unlucky and Fatal.
Where there is the death of Princes
there will be the Succession of new
ones. And shew me any man that
hath the confidence to deny this.</p>
            <p>3. I grant also, that though Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58008:81"/>
portend and bring evil upon
Men, yet the All-wise Maker and
Disposer of the Universe can derive
the greatest good to them thence.
And on <hi>This</hi> Divine Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it must be acknowledged that
they are Heavenly Evangelists, and
Messengers of glad Tidings, they
are propitious Flames, and in a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
manner</hi> signs of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Good-will. But</p>
            <p>4. I Answer directly, that though
they may be followed with some
<hi>Good Events,</hi> yet This is merely
<hi>Accidental;</hi> because it is almost
impossible that any evil should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
without some good. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what was said before, <hi>viz.</hi>
That these Heavenly Preachers are
sent to give notice of God's Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for the sins of the World, we
cannot but acknowledge that their
<hi>Primary Token</hi> is the <hi>Evil</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
that they are Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Wrath and Vengeance, if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58008:81"/>
Men will not repent and amend.
<hi>Particularly,</hi> to reply to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
mentioned in the Objection.
It is no wonder that the Comet
which appeared after <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s
Death, was thought by <hi>Augustus</hi>
to be auspicious, since by his Death
he came to succeed in the Empire.
But he that shall reade the Relation
of the bloudy Wars and horrid
Commotions which the People of
<hi>Rome</hi> had experience of immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Rising of that Comet,
will be of another judgment, and
not call it (as <hi>Pliny</hi> flatteringly doth)
<hi>Salutary</hi> and <hi>Lucky.</hi> The grave Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
(whose Morality one would
imagine should not teach him to be
a Parasite) saith that the Comet
which shone in the beginning of
<hi>Nero</hi>'s joyfull and happy Reign,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Senec.</hi> Nat. Quaest. l. 7. cap. 17.</note>
               <hi>Neronis Principatu laetissimo Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
detraxit Infamiam,</hi> took away
from that sort of Prodigies the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
which they lay under. It
seems then they had before an ill
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58008:82"/>
name, they were thought till that
time to be unlucky and ominous.
Yes, and they were thought so
<hi>then,</hi> and <hi>ever after;</hi> onely <hi>Nero</hi>
it seems was to be flattered, and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
was to let him know that that
strange Spectacle in the Heavens
assured great Happiness to the whole
World by reason of his Reign. But
will not any one who hath read the
passages of that Emperour's Life ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
such rank flattery, and with
greater Reason conclude that that
Comet, and others that appeared
in his Time, (as no less than four
appeared, one whereof lasted six
months) presaged the monstrous
and unheard of Villanies committed
by him when he ruled? That as he
came into the World with his Feet
forward, which made his <hi>Birth
ominous,</hi> so the unusual Blazes in the
Heavens rendred his <hi>whole Life por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous?</hi>
Who will not say that they
fore told the World of his cruel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
and barbarous Exploits,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58008:82"/>
void of all Compassion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse?
<hi>viz.</hi> his setting <hi>Rome</hi> on
fire that he might better conceive
the Flames of <hi>Troy,</hi> and sing to
his Harp the Destruction of that
City: his killing his own Mother,
his putting his own Wife to Death,
his dispatching with a kick of his
foot his Mistress (or rather his Wife
afterwards) <hi>Poppaea,</hi> his slaying his
Aunt, his killing his Tutour and
Master <hi>Seneca,</hi> (the very man who
here flattereth him and his Comet,)
his bloudy Rage against all his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Friends, (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith
of him, <hi>Nullum adeò necessitudinis
genus est quod non scelere percule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>)
his Madness against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
on whom he maliciously laid
the firing of <hi>Rome,</hi> his implacable
Hatred of Christianity it self, which
he shewed in being the first that
ever made an Edict against it. It
was rightly therefore said of an
Historian,<note place="margin">

               </gap>. To
all his other Villanies he added this,
That he fought against Heaven,
and was the first Persecutor of the
Word of God. And, as notorious
Instances of this cursed and Hellish
Rage, Those two great Apostles
and Pillars of the Church, St. <hi>Paul</hi>

that had bid defiance to all Ranks

may be pronounced of all the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Flames that ever shone in the
World, nay even of the Star which
appeared at Christ's Nativity; for
though the Officious Sages who
came from the East rejoyced at its
Appearance, yet without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
when it appeared more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
and universally, (as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it did afterwards, as I may
have occasion to shew at another
time, and on another Subject,) it
threatned Woe and Misery to the
Unbelieving World, and likewise
presignified the bloudy Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Devil and his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would be Authours of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Followers of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>A Third Objection is formed
thus:<note place="margin">J. Scaliger. <hi>Exercitat. 79. sect.</hi> 2.</note> Many Comets have been seen
by us, but they have been followed
with no mischief throughout all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
Besides, many Eminent and
Illustrious Men have dyed, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58008:85"/>
and Principalities, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Families have been destroyed
without any Notice given by a
Comet.</p>
            <p>Here are two grievous Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
together of the Doctrine of
Comets. As to the former, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it hath been observed that no
Hurt hath followed Comets,</p>
            <p>I Answer,</p>
            <p>1. That notwithstanding what
this daring Objector suggests, you
have heard what others, and those
of great Credit and Fame, have
said and writ. The Renowned
<hi>Kepler</hi> hath set down the fatal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of many Comets. <hi>Ricciolus,</hi>
and <hi>Hevelius</hi> after him, give us a
Catalogue of all the Comets that
appeared before and since Christ's
Birth, with the remarkable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
that ensued upon them in the
World. And now judge whether
<hi>Scaliger</hi> (who was a man that would
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58008:86"/>
say any thing for his Cause) out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigheth
this Tripple Testimony
of Persons of so good Account: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that <hi>Others</hi> might be made use
of here to attest the ill effects of
Comets in the several Ages of the
World.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas some tell us that no
evils have been the Consequences
of the Comets which they have
seen, I have this to say to them,
that it is none of my fault that they
do not live to see those Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
They profess they behold
no hurtfull Effects of Comets, and
thence rashly infer there are none.
But I retort upon them with that
which is satisfactory to me, (and
may be so to them,) that the Hurt
and Evil are <hi>deferred,</hi> but may
<hi>come at last.</hi> This may happen
thus, because of the Nature of
Things themselves, Comets do not
always operate presently, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of some Indispositions and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58008:86"/>
in the Elements, and the
Dependence they often have on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Causes. For this Reason it
may be we feel at this very hour
part of the Effects of those Comets,
which visited us in 1664, and 1665.
And it may be we shall not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
the full Influence of the two
last which appeared, till some years
hence. Say not then, because you
see not the Effects of these strange
Shews, that they are vain Sights,
and because they are not followed
forthwith with notable Alterations,
that therefore there are no Evils
that issue from them. Moreover,
It is against the Nature of these
Prodigies that they should have a
speedy effect, for (as hath been said)
they are sent to warn Men of the
Judgments which their repeated
Crimes deserve, and to stir them
up effectually to be sensible of their
condition, and to mourn for their
Offences, and implore the Divine
Favour, and betake themselves to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58008:87"/>
Newness of Life. For the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of These the great Lover of
Mankind allots them some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time, and accordingly doth
not presently inflict the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he threatneth, but
expecteth and waiteth for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.
And if that happens,
He wholly <hi>Averteth</hi> his Wrath and
Indignation. Which directs me to
another Answer to the Objection,
and it is this,</p>
            <p>Suppose the Observation had
some Truth in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That fatal
Changes and calamitous Accidents
have not ever been seen to be the
consequences of Comets, who is
there that cannot dive into the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of it? Which is no other than
<hi>this,</hi> That the Divine Goodness
and Philanthropy, and Man's time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Repentance and Conversion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the inflicting of those Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which were portended by the
appearing of the Heavenly Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58008:87"/>
God <hi>sends not</hi> those Evils
which he <hi>Threatned.</hi> That is all
that can be gathered. How idly
and incoherently then do they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
who deny all Presage of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
because they do not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feel the Effects of them? Nay,
how impiously and blasphemously
do they talk who assert it <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
that God should intend these to
be Monitors of Repentance, and
yet not let us see the Fatal Events
produced by them?</p>
            <p>And thus I think the first part of
the Objection is pretty well clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and Men may sometimes look
for the Effects of Comets, and not
espie them, not because Comets are
not by God's Appointment Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Presaging, but because the
Infinite Compassion of Heaven <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth</hi>
or <hi>averteth</hi> the impendent
Judgments. Which agreeth with
what was maintained before, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Comets are not Presages whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Evil, but they are likewise
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58008:88"/>
Collaterally and Remotely Tokens
of Mercy to Mankind, <hi>i. e.</hi> if they
Repent: otherwise they denounce
nothing but Vengeance.</p>
            <p>These Bodies then do not <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily</hi>
and <hi>Vnalterably</hi> signifie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
but <hi>Conditionally, i. e.</hi> if it
shall seem good to God, and if the
Inhabitants of the Earth do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their sins. And indeed it
was rightly said by a celebrated
Jewish Doctor,<note place="margin">R. Kimchi <hi>in</hi> Jon.</note> All the Evils that God
threatneth to Men, are threatned
with this condition, If they do not
repent. So that Comets speak not
the <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>inevitable Futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of such Events, but let the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
know to whom they are shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what they are to <hi>expect,</hi> and
what shall certainly happen unless
God be pleased, for Reasons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
best known to himself,
to interpose between the Sign and
the Events. The great and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Drought in 1681. may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
looked upon as the Effect
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58008:88"/>
of the Comet in 1680. And we
may remember what was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of that unusual driness of
the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> The price of Hay
in a Months time, or a little more,
was risen from 15 <hi>s.</hi> a Load to 40 <hi>s.</hi>
and we were in expectation of more
dismal Effects of that Drought. But
the price of the aforesaid commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fell in few months to its ordinary
Rate, and we were delivered from
our other Fears. Thus the God of
Heaven shewed us what we <hi>deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
and then was pleased to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi>
it.</p>
            <p>Thus it is possible some expected
Events may be frustrated, and yet
Comets in their own Nature, and
by God's Appointment, are omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and prognostick.</p>
            <p>And as for the latter part of the
Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is observed
sometimes that God sends Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
where Comets have not been
the Forerunners, and therefore it is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58008:89"/>
likely no Calamities are caused or
signified by them.</p>
            <p>I have these two things to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:</p>
            <p>First, it doth not follow that,
because Comets foresignifie Wars,
Pestilence, Famine and the Death
of Princes, therefore a Comet must
necessarily appear as often as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
or Plague approach, or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Wars and Deaths of Princes
allarm the World; for it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
wholly on God's free Will and
Pleasure, whether there shall be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Signs</hi> or no: and as to the <hi>Time</hi>
of exhibiting them, that also is at
God's disposal. Besides, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is fallacious, for though
<hi>every Plague,</hi> or War, or Dearth
be not ushered in with a Comet,
yet it doth not follow thence that
<hi>none</hi> are, or may be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though all the great
and publick Calamities that happen
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58008:89"/>
be not presaged by Comets, (as I
readily grant) yet they may be,
and usually, if not always, are by
<hi>some other Forerunners and Signs,</hi>
if not in the Heavens, yet in the
Air, or Earth, or Waters; for there
are other Omens beside those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p>This then doth not in the least
disanul what I assert, that some
great and extraordinary Events
(and such are supposed to be rare
as Comets themselves are) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signified
and procured by those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that at what time soever
they appear, future Perils and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
of one kind or other, are
threatned to the World, and though
they are not seen or felt in one part
of it, yet they may be in another.</p>
            <p>And under this Head likewise,
and by virtue of what hath been
said here, the frivolous Objection
of those Men is removed, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
all Significancy of Comets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not such Signs as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58008:90"/>
and positively point at <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Evils and Events,</hi> because we
cannot learn from them what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Evil will befall the World.
Hence they are styled by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectours
<hi>Useless and Fallacious Signs,</hi>
and it is unbecoming God's Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(say they) to set up such in
the World.</p>
            <p>Thus they irreverently and
wickedly teach men to despise
God's Works. And (which is the
more to be lamented) such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
falls from the Pens of great
Pretenders to Divinity and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is Objected that
some Comets travell many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and pass over the Heads of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
People, as particularly the
Dreadfull Comet in 1680. was
seen not onely all over <hi>Europe,</hi> but
in the most remote parts of the
World: How then can it be known
what particular place it was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58008:90"/>
for? Who can tell where its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
is to light? Is there any
Reason why we of this Island should
be concerned? Many things may
be said to silence this Cavil:</p>
            <p>1. If a Comet be universal (as is
supposed in the Objection) then its
<hi>Influence</hi> is such likewise, and then
we are certain that we, as well as
other Countries, are concerned
But,</p>
            <p>2. Suppose we cannot tell to
what place a Comet hath a special
Respect, and at which Nation it
doth as it were levell its malign
Rays, yet the <hi>Appearance it self</hi>
ought to make us carefull, and to
provide against such Events as may
happen, because we may be (for
ought we know) particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
And this is the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of this Treatise. Yet let it be
remembred,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:58008:91"/>
3. That though a Comet travells
through several Countries, and
sheweth its flaming Train among
many People, yet they are not all
equally under its Influence. For
though it may be seen by several
Countries, yet it is not directly
and vertically placed over them all,
but darts its Beams Perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on one or some onely. And
whereas some curiously observe
<hi>which way</hi> these blazing Lights <hi>cast
their Rays and spread their Train,</hi>
I look on it as the product of vulgar
Errour and Mistake, (though I
know too that some of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are pleased with it) for this sort
of Bodies always turn their Faces
to the Sun, and their Tails from it:
so that there can be no ground to
make any Judgment of their look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards this or that Countrey
or Kingdom. But it is reasonable to
observe how high they mount, and
whether they hang perpendicularly
over our Heads; for the farther they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58008:91"/>
climb in our Hemisphere, the more
powerfull are their Rays, and their
Influence the more pregnant. This
too is to be considered that the <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Time</hi> they stay with us, and
the <hi>oftner</hi> they appear, the greater
undoubtedly is the Presage which
we may expect from them. And
we are to consider the <hi>Magnitude</hi>
of a Comet as well as the time of
its Duration; for the greater it is,
the Effects of it are proportionably
so too, and they continue the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
All these things must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, and then we shall easily
be induced to grant that the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Comets is not <hi>alike</hi> as to all
Countries and People. To instance
in the Comet in 1680. whatever
Influence and Aspect it had on other
Regions and Inhabitants, We of
this Island may be convinced from
the Premisses that it nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us: for its <hi>apparent Greatness,
height of Ascension,</hi> and <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
are so many Demonstrations
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58008:92"/>
of it. How <hi>large</hi> must it needs be
when, being situated not far from the
Horizon, it almost reached with its
Tail to the Zenith, or Mid-Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
How great think you was it
when it was seen to extend it self
in length about 50, nay, sometimes
60 Degrees of our Hemisphere?
And the <hi>time of its stay</hi> also was
very considerable, and made it the
more portentous and terrible: for
it appeared two whole months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
unless when the Clouds
hindred it from being seen; and it
was three months visible in one
place or other, which is the utmost
and longest Duration generally of
a Comet. I have read but of two
that attained to this, <hi>viz.</hi> That
Sword-Comet which hung over
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that which was
seen in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s
Reign, which lasted six months, if
<hi>Seneca</hi> may be credited (<hi>Nat. Qu.
l. 7. c.</hi> 21.) though <hi>Pliny,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at that time, tells us, (<hi>Nat.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58008:92"/>
Hist. l. 2. c.</hi> 25.) that Fourscore days
is the longest space of time any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
continueth, which wanteth a
hundred days of six months.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Continuance and Duration of
that late terrible spectacle, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the Events which were to
insue it should continue long. And
the <hi>last</hi> which appeared, <hi>viz.</hi> in
the Year 1682. made a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
stay, and tarried many weeks
with us, and though its <hi>Magnitude</hi>
was not to be compared with that
of the former, yet its <hi>Aspect</hi> and
<hi>Influence</hi> are to be accounted the
more significant, because it visited
us with such quick returns, <hi>i. e.</hi> not
onely in the Evenings, but in the
mornings.</p>
            <p>4. I add, that even all those
Countries and Nations which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
successively visit, may succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
and in due time, feel the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of them. The Influence may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58008:93"/>
reach every one of them at last:
for there is at the same time a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and periodical Motion in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Politick as well as Natural:
and Countreys by Sympathy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Evils to one another,
particularly we may gather that
that astonishing Comet in 1680.
which was visible to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and
other parts of the World, shall be
of universal Influence, and many
Nations shall share in the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Occurrences which it
shall produce. Common Artists
take occasion to speak of the Signs
it passed through, and there they
are full of roving Conjectures and
Uncertainties; but we may safely
infer this from its passing through
so <hi>Many, viz.</hi> Seven Signs and an
half, that it is probable a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of the World is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Effects and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of it. General Distresses
and Troubles shall be complained
of, there shall happen Catholick
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58008:93"/>
and spreading Calamities, and
(which is always to be implied, if
God or Man do not interpose, the
one by infinite Clemency and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
or the other by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Amendment) Evils of a
very vast Circumference shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
the World.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Objection is plausibly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from 10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. Thus faith the
Lord, <hi>Learn not the way of the
Heathen, and be not dismayed at
the Signs of Heaven, for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
are dismayed at them.</hi> Whence
it may be inferred that it is wicked
and Paganish to imagine any Signs
or Tokens in the Heavens, and
that it is the guise onely of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Gentile World to be afraid
of them, and therefore the Presage
of Comets is hereby cashiered.</p>
            <p>I Reply,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:58008:94"/>
1. It is Nonsense to argue from
this place that there are no Signs in
the Heavens, when the very Text
supposes and grants it, expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them the <hi>Signs of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. These <hi>Signs</hi> are the ordinary
Heavenly Bodies, called in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Style the <hi>Host of Heaven,</hi> the Sun,
Moon and Stars; and to these may
be adjoined the extraordinary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which are seen in the Heavens,
as Comets. Now God commands
his own People not to be <hi>dismayed</hi>
at any of these, as the <hi>Heathens</hi>
were wont to be, who believed
these Heavenly Bodies to be alive,
and that they governed all things
here below by their great Power:
they thought that all their affairs
depended wholly on these, and
therefore they were put into great
Disorders by such Notions, and
were struck with strange Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Astonishment. Their
fearing of them put them upon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58008:94"/>
them as Gods, and as if
they had Divine Power. Thus the
<hi>Heathens</hi> thought and practised, but
God's <hi>Chosen People</hi> are forbid the
superstitious reverencing and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of these. And not onely an
Idolatrous Fear is disallowed them
but any other that is unbecoming
and disorderly: they must not be
troubled and cast down, <hi>dismayed</hi>
and dejected at any unusual Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Heavens, so as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
God's Providence, and act
things unworthy of their Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
The Heavenly Bodies are
<hi>Signs,</hi> and some of them very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ones, but they must by no
means fright good men out of their
Duty, or into a disesteem of God's
governing the World. Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
<hi>Iacia est alea,</hi> was very
brave and becoming upon occasion
of one of her Courtiers dissuading
her from looking on a Comet which
appeared when the lay at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
But she commanded the Windows
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58008:95"/>
to be set open, and uttered those
gallant words, <hi>Iacta est alea,</hi> The
Die is cast (saith she) by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Hand; as we cannot disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
so neither ought we to be
unchristianly afraid of it.</p>
            <p>Comets being <hi>Signs,</hi> they must
be taken notice of, for they were
set up for that end, or rather not
they, but the Hand and Voice of
God in them are to be observed and
dreaded. Most apposite to which
purpose is that which I have read
in the Life of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.<note place="margin">Eginhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus <hi>in vit.</hi> Car. Mag.</note>
A vast and dreadfull Comet shone
in the close of this great Monarch's
Reign: Upon the rising of which
new Light in the Heavens, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
what it foretold? Imagining
(what indeed happened, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
foresignified by such Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
that his Death was near at
hand. <hi>Eginardus,</hi> with whom he
held conference at that time, (a
great Philosopher and his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who writ this Prince's Life)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58008:95"/>
answered him more like a Divine
than a Philosopher, in those words
of Scripture which I just now des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted
upon, <hi>Be not dismayed at the
Signs of Heaven.</hi> To which the
Emperour replied, that he was not
dismayed at such kind of Signs,
but feared and reverenced the
Powerfull Cause and Divine Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of them, who being incensed
with Anger against a People or
Prince, is wont by these to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them of his Wrath, and to call
them to Repentance that they may
avoid it. And this is the sum of all
that I have said concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Comets.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, and Lastly, It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
that if Comets be significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and portentous, then there is
as much Reason to believe that the
other Heavenly Bodies, as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and the fixed Luminaries, and
their several Motions and Aspects
are so too, and by this means we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58008:96"/>
open a door to all the superstitious
Observations, and groundless Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostications
of <hi>Iudiciary Astrology,</hi>
whereby some men pretend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
the greatest Events that shall
happen, and to foretell the Fate of
Kingdoms and Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>Having delivered my Sentiments
freely and impartially concerning
those great and glaring Lights and
their Presages, which I undertook
chiefly to treat of, it remaineth
now that in Answer to this Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I do with the same freedom
present you with my thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Iudiciary part</hi> of that
Noble Science of <hi>Astrology,</hi> and
that I enquire whether there can be
any real Presaging from the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bodies of Heaven, as the Sun,
Moon and Stars, and what insight
into futurities any man of Reading,
Study and Observation may gain
by being acquainted with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:58008:96"/>
I know very well that it is the
humour of Writers to oppose and
flatly deny all that their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
say, and to run counter with
every Proposition they lay down,
and for no other Reason oftentimes
than because they are theirs. And
the main and onely design of these
Persons being this, to be victours;
it is not to be wondred at, that they
behave themselves after this rate.
But I (having no other design than
that <hi>Truth onely</hi> may have the <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>)
will not tread in their steps.
And indeed it is fond and absurd
Custome, and such as is unbecoming
Rational Minds, to hold all or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of an Opinion about which
the Dispute is raised. I am sure
if this had not been wilfully kept
up, there had been an end e'er this
of most of the Controversies that
trouble the World. I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
therefore to silence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Quarrel which I am now
entring upon by going another
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58008:97"/>
way to work, namely, by fairly
granting something, that I may
more impregnably hold the rest.</p>
            <p>How zealous are some in discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the whole Host of Heaven
from influencing in the least on
things here below, even the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Occurrences of Man's Life?
They think they are bound to run
down all the orders of Heavenly
Bodies at once. The Sun (say they)
which is the greatest Luminary,
hath no way to act but by its Light
and Heat, and its business is onely
with the Earth, Minerals, Plants,
and mere Animals. The Moon
and the rest of the Planets are
heavy, dull things; they cannot
doe more than the Earth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as good a Planet as any of them,
and the Earth influenceth as much
on them as they upon it. The fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Stars are too far off, besides that
the Situation of them is ever the
same. And thus they are all unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of doing any feats in this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58008:97"/>
lower World wherein we live. But
I must declare for my part, that
I look upon this as too high and
ranting. I am willing to grant
that the Heavenly Bodies <hi>Act</hi> on
Things and Persons on Earth, and
that they are likewise <hi>Signs:</hi> and
yet this is no prejudice to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>established
Doctrine. To prove
this let us look into the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Institution of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies: and there it is most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we shall find the <hi>true Ends</hi> and
<hi>Vses</hi> of them. And these are no
less than five, according to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
and Canonical Account
which is given of them in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.
14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not set them down
in the order they are in there, yet
I will be exact in the enumerating
of them.</p>
            <p>The First End of them is <hi>to give
Light upon the Earth,</hi> (v. 15.) that
Men may see how to dispatch their
Affairs with Ease and Chearfulness.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58008:98"/>
An ineffable Blessing certainly!
and such as the wisest man takes
particular notice of, when he saith,
<hi>Truly the Light is sweet, and a
pleasant thing it is for the Eyes to
behold the Sun,</hi> Eccl. 11. 7. Of this
the Learned Jew speaks,<note place="margin">Philo <hi>de</hi> Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
What
were these glittering Lights set up
for, unless it were for the service of
the Eyes, to see by them?</p>
            <p>A Second Use of these Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
is to be <hi>for Seasons,</hi> (v. 14.)
Those Commentatours that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it of the Season of <hi>Weather,</hi>
shew that they attend not to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
sense of the Original Word,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But the true meaning is,
That those Heavenly Luminaries
were appointed for distinction of
Times and Seasons, whether they
be for Natural, Civil or Religious
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58008:98"/>
Affairs Thus among the Jews the
Feasts of the New-moons, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
and other sacred Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
depended on the Returns and
Courses of these Bodies. And still
the orderly Service of God is kept
up by observing the First Day of
the Week, and other Periods of
Time, either expressed by the first
Founder of the Christian Religion,
or laudably constituted by the
Church.</p>

to be <hi>for Seasons. Hippocrates</hi> and

They acquaint us that Diseases are

observing and due attending of
the Times of the Heavenly Aspects
and Influences are very usefull in

            <p>A Third End of these Lights in
the Heavens is to be <hi>for Days and
Years.</hi> v. 14. that is, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Motion of these Bodies Time
is measured and numbred, by these
Time is divided and distinguished
into greater and lesser portions, as
Years, Months, Weeks, Days,
Hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By these we keep an
account of our Actions, we call to
mind, reckon, compute, forecast:
we understand the duration of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the certain Intervalls and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of things, the Ages and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
of the World, which is
of singular Use in Man's Life.</p>
            <p>Their Fourth Use is <hi>to divide
the Day from the Night,</hi> v. 14. or
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58008:100"/>
(as it is said afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 18.) <hi>to
divide the Light from the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to rule over the Day and
over the Night.</hi> These Heavenly
Bodies by their Setting and Rising,
cause Light and Darkness, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
are the Authours of the
successive Returns of Day and Night
to us. This is set them as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
and never failing consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and therefore is styled <hi>the
Covenant</hi> of the Day and Night,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 33. 20. and the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of
Heaven, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 35, 36. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>This Vse</hi> of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is comprehended their <hi>Warming</hi>
and <hi>Chearing Virtue,</hi> (especially of
the Sun, which brings to us <hi>Day</hi>
and <hi>This</hi> together, and of which the
great Observer of God's Works
thus speaketh, <hi>There is nothing bid
from the heat thereof,</hi>) and also
their <hi>fructifying, generative</hi> and
<hi>prolifick Faculty,</hi> whereby they may
justly be said to <hi>Rule,</hi> and bear sway
in the World.</p>

               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:58008:100"/>
The Fifth and Last Use of these
glorious Lights in the firmament of
Heaven (and which is the use of
them wherein we are most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at present) is to signifie some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the World: <hi>Let them be
for Signs,</hi> v. 14. And in the place
before commented upon they are
called the <hi>Signs of Heaven.</hi> Which
an Astronomical Poet expresseth
thus,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here then may Business is to
shew <hi>how</hi> they are said to be <hi>for
Signs,</hi> or <hi>What</hi> it is that they <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi>
to the World. Accordingly
I assert that they signifie three forts
of Occurrences, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Divine.</p>
            <p>First, They give notice to us of
<hi>Natural</hi> things, as Rain or Drought,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58008:101"/>
Storms or Calms, Heat or Cold,
Winter or Summer, with the other
Seasons of the Year, the Ebbing and
Flowing of the Sea, Plenty or Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Fruits of the Earth; in
short, the Change of Weather, and
Alteration of the temper of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.
These are signified by
the Sun's Rising or Setting with
such and such Stars or Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by the Access or Recess of the
Planets to and form the Sun, and
among themselves. This, it seems,
is a thing which was thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be mentioned by a Divine
Pen-man, for he biddeth the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Jews seek <hi>him that maketh the
Seven Stars and Orion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> God,
who by the Appearing of these,
and other Constellations at certain
times, gives notice of the different
Seasons of the Year. And this was
a way of speaking which well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Amos the Herdsman,</hi> who
had been used to keep his Cattel,
and watch in the Fields all Night,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58008:101"/>
and there had leisure and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to observe how the several
Seasons were ushered in by these
Lamps of Heaven. But hear what
another inspired Searcher into the
Heavenly Bodies saith of the great
Creatour, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>He maketh
Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 9. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and
the Chambers of the South.</hi> That is,
he maketh the Year, the Parts of
which are <hi>signified</hi> and known by
the rising of these Constellations;
for <hi>Arcturus,</hi> or the Bear's Tail, a
Star of the first Magnitude in the
Northern Hemisphere, is said to
arise in <hi>Autumn. Orion,</hi> a Southern
Constellation, made up of many
splendent Stars, arises in <hi>Winter.</hi>
It is called <hi>Nimbosus Orion</hi> by <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
and is accordingly deemed by
Astrologers to be the Cause of great
Storms and Tempests. Its name
in Hebrew is <hi>Kesil,</hi> whence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Month <hi>Kisleu</hi> among the
Jews (which answers to <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>)
had its denomination, this
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58008:102"/>
Constellation rising in that Month.
And by the bye let me shove in this
Criticism, when we reade that the
same word <hi>Kesil</hi> signifies a <hi>Fool,</hi>
(as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Proverbs and other
places) we need not wonder that a
Constellation which causes <hi>Change</hi>
of Weather, gives name to a <hi>foolish,
light,</hi> and <hi>unconstant Person.</hi> The
<hi>Pleiades,</hi> or Seven Stars, arise in
the <hi>Spring.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Chambers of the South,</hi>
which perhaps are the Stars which
arise in the <hi>Summer:</hi> and so the
four several Quarters of the Year
are set down. <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Hygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and other Ancients, discourse
of this kind of Prognosticks. Of
these <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.<note place="margin">L. de mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Opificio.</note>
The Stars
were made not onely to enlighten
the Earth, but to be signs of future
Accidents, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as he there explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
himself) of different Seasons
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58008:102"/>
of Weather. Which is his meaning
in another Treatise, where he saith,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <note place="margin">Lib. de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchia.</note> The Signs of all
these things that you see upon
Earth, are set up and erected in
the Heavens. And I am mistaken
if the Learned Father speaketh not
of these Prognosticks when he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>mer.</note> The
Observation of the Luminaries of
Heaven is usefull and even necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Man's Life, unless People
will beyond measure, and with an
unlawfull curiosity, search into the
Signs which those Bodies afford
us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, These Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were created not onely to <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Natural things,</hi> but <hi>Humane
and Civil Occurrences,</hi> and these ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Private or Publick, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58008:103"/>
of Families or Kingdoms. All
sorts of Actions and Events, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good, or evil, or indifferent,
may (at one time or other) be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned from the Observation
of the Natural and usual Motions of
the Host of Heaven. For though
I cannot <hi>make out</hi> the dependence
and affinity between them and
these, as of Effects and Causes, and
though the Knowledge which is
gained thence is usually uncertain;
yet I cannot assert with the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which I see others do, that
there are no Natural Effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
from such Positions and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations
of the Stars, but I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe on the contrary, that
their various Motions and Aspects
are in some measure Significant.</p>
            <p>Let us consider then that the
Seven Planets are always in one or
other of the Twelve Signs, or (which
is the same thing) they are directly
under some part of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi>
(which is divided into 12 parts in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58008:103"/>
all,) or (to speak plainer yet) the
Wandring Stars move under some
particular fixed ones, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Habitude which those have to
one another as they are placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these (or, as Artists speak, as
they move through these Signs)
causeth several <hi>Aspects.</hi> And these
Aspects are either <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Right Aspect is when one Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
hath a Relation to another in a
Right Line. And this is either
<hi>Conjunction</hi> or <hi>Opposition.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
is when two Planets meet
together in the same Sign of the
Zodiack: Its mark is this, ☌. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
(marked thus, ☍) is when
Planets are in Diametrical or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Signs, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from one another half the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Heavens, <hi>i. e.</hi> Six Signs,
or 180 Degrees.</p>
            <p>A Collateral Aspect is when Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
look on one another in Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
and Oblique Lines; and this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58008:104"/>
is Threefold, namely, <hi>Sextile</hi> ⚹,
when they are distant from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
a Sixth part of the Zodiack,
<hi>i. e.</hi> two Signs, or 60 Degrees. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate</hi> 
               <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>,
when Planets are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from one another 90 Degrees of
the Zodiack, or 3 Signs, which is
a fourth part of the Circle. <hi>Trine,</hi>
or Triangular <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, when one Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
is distant from another a
Third part of the Zodiack, which
contains 40 Signs, or 120 Degrees.
These Configurations, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
Aspects (no less than five in all)
happen according to the different
parts of the Zodiack which the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
are in, or move under. Hence
arise the <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Infirmities,</hi>
the <hi>Fortitudes</hi> and <hi>Debilities</hi> of the
Planets, for they are supposed to
help or hinder, to promote or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage
one another, according to
their various Situation, Aspects
and Agreements with other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
And among the forenamed
Aspects, Opposition and Quadrate
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58008:104"/>
are reckoned as malign: the rest
are thought to be favourable and
benign. And among these latter,
Conjunction is the most effectual of
all the Radiations of the Planets,
and <hi>Sextile</hi> is the weakest and
Faintest.</p>
            <p>Now I propound it fairly and
peaceably to any considerative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whether he can imagine that
the Heavens ring all these Changes
to no purpose, and shift their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
so often without some effect?</p>
            <p>I might add, That the Planets in
regard of their Motion are <hi>Direct,
Retrograde</hi> and <hi>Stationary;</hi> whence
must arise different Sites and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of them, and from these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Effects and Consequences.
And particularly, as for the Aspects
and Phases of the <hi>Moon,</hi> there are
more of them, and those likewise
more observable and lasting, than
of all the other Stars. Mark how
often this <hi>Proteus</hi> changeth Shapes,
and according to its various Access
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58008:105"/>
unto and Recess from the Sun, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in divers Figures and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances.</p>
            <p>Let us recount the several Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoses
of this Fickle Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>When she is in Conjunction with
the Sun, <hi>i. e.</hi> when she is exactly
between us and the Sun, her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Part (which is more than
half the Moon always, the Sun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
her in magnitude) is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sun altogether, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that no part of her is seen by
us. This is <hi>New-moon,</hi> which lasts
three days, all which time it shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not to us. Soon after its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
<hi>viz.</hi> on the fourth day,
and when it is about 60 degrees
distant from the Sun, it is <hi>Horned,</hi>
and it sets soon after Night cometh.
On the seventh or Eighth day a
<hi>Moiety</hi> of her appeareth, and she is
called <hi>Bisect,</hi> or a <hi>Half-Moon:</hi> she
now riseth about 10 a Clock in the
morning, and she is distant from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58008:105"/>
the Sun about 90 Degrees. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
is her First Quarter.</p>
            <p>Then tending to her <hi>Opposition</hi> to
the Sun, she sheweth a <hi>little more
than half</hi> of her Enlightned Body,
and on the 11th day is <hi>Bunched,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
120 degrees from the Sun. Then
on the 14th or 15th day it comes
to its <hi>Opposition</hi> to the Sun, <hi>viz.</hi>
when it is 180 degrees distant from
it, and when we are just between
the Sun and it. This is <hi>Full-Moon,</hi>
and is called her Second Quarter.</p>
            <p>These are the shapes she hath in
her <hi>Increase;</hi> and she hath the very
same in her <hi>Decrease,</hi> according to
her various Aspects to the Sun. She
appeareth <hi>Bunched</hi> on the 4th day
after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Full-moon, <hi>Bisect</hi> on the 7th,
<hi>Horned</hi> on the 11th, till at last she
comes to turn her self wholly to the
Sun, and to shew no Light to us,
and then it is <hi>New-moon.</hi> Onely
this difference is to be observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Aspects of the Moon in
her Increase, and those in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58008:106"/>
that her Horns are turned
towards the West in the latter, but
Eastward in the former, because
that that part of the Moon which
is enlightned is always towards the
Sun.</p>
            <p>These are the usual Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Moon; and what wise
Man can think that all these Changes
and Shiftings throughout the whole
Year, have no Influence upon things
below, and work not considerable
Alterations and Changes on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Minds of Men? Their
Operation as to <hi>Weather,</hi> and as to
some <hi>Inferiour Animals</hi> is freely
confessed by all, long Observation
and Experience having extorted
that Acknowledgment. And there
is as good ground to own their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the Tempers and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Reasonable and Humane
Creatures, for the Returns of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and a Distempered Mind are
observed by the exact Practitioners
in Medicks, to be according to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58008:106"/>
Revolutions of this Planet. And
what reason can be rendred why
the sober and well-ordered Actions
of Man's Life, which are more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and easie to be governed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not some Impressions from
the same Mover? Say not that the
several Phases of the Moon, though
they seem to be different Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet are but accidental Changes,
and the Moon is always the same,
notwithstanding all her change of
Apparel, and consequently that no
real Effects ought to be expected
from onely seeming Revolutions.</p>
            <p>This plausible Cavil is easily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off by replying that the Moon
in going her monthly Circuit about
the Earth, turns her self variously
to the Sun, and <hi>really changes</hi> her
situation, and there are different
Transmissions of the Solar Rays
from her, and we receive new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
and Refractions of Light
thence, And let it be considered
both in respect of the Aspects of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58008:107"/>
the Moon, and those which are
common to the other Planets (of
which I spoke before) that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Effects in the World are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the frequent changing of
a few things. Though I am not of
the Philosopher's Mind, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
that Matter and Motion solve
All Phaenomena, yet thus far I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with him, (and I have the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of all Intelligent Men) that
new Modifications, as change of
Place, Figure, Motion, and the
like, effect most of the considerable
things that happen in the World.
Upon which account it must needs
be that the different Situations,
new Configurations, mutual Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and repeated Vicissitudes of
the Heavenly Bodies prove some
ways effectual and operative.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Eclipses</hi> (which may
be reckoned here) I cannot but say
in behalf of this part of Astrology,
that these and the foresaid Aspects
are in a Natural way <hi>Signs</hi> of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58008:107"/>
things, and productive of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Events; <hi>and upon long and
faithfull Observation,</hi> we may find
out <hi>what kind</hi> of accidents happen
in the several quarters of the World
where they are seen.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Head with the
memorable words of a foreign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
(a Person of great Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Judgment,) <hi>Hic ergo est
usus verae Astrologiae, ut multorum
effectuum qui in terris fiunt causas
quae in coelo sunt cognoscant; aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
etiam antequam fiunt, ipsos effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
in suis causis praevideat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zanchius <hi>de Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom.</hi>
               </note> This
is the use of true Astrology to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
from it the Causes which
are in the Heavens of many Effects
that are on Earth; and sometimes
to foresee those Effects in their
Causes before they come to pass.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The heavenly Bodies
are Signs (as of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Affairs,</hi> so) of <hi>things Divine,
and above Nature's Order.</hi> And as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58008:108"/>
the two former are signified by the
<hi>Ordinary Motions</hi> of these Bodies,
so the last are discovered by the
<hi>extraordinary and unusual aspect</hi> of
them. When those great Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are <hi>disturbed and out of Order,</hi>
then, and onely then they, as well as
those extraordinary Bodies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which this discourse hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
treated of, are certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications
of the exerting of some
Divine Power, and the bringing to
pass some strange things in the
World. For this I take to be an
unquestionable Maxim, that those
Accidents which exceed the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
course of Nature, and are above
the usual Laws and Power of it, are
the particular Finger of God, and
are for extraordinary ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
From whence I gather, that
the <hi>constant Courses</hi> of the Celestial
Luminaries portend not evil and
hurt to Mankind; but they are the
<hi>unnatural Motions,</hi> Alterations and
Appearances of them, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58008:108"/>
them <hi>prodigious.</hi> As when the
Sun hath been extraordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
as at that darkness which
was one of the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
when the Sun and Moon have
stood still, as when <hi>Ioshuah</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vengeance on his Enemies:
when the Stars fought against the
Host of <hi>Sisera:</hi> when the Sun
went back in King <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s days.
Not onely Poets but Historians
take notice of, and transmit to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
the remarkable Obscuring of
the Sun which was observed almost
that whole year in which <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> was unfortunately killed.</p>

The Eclipse at Christ's Passion was
a miraculous darkning of the Sun's
Body; for against the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it was obscured in Full-moon.
Great <hi>Signs from Heaven</hi> (as it was
prophesied by our Saviour) were
the forerunners of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 11. There was
an Example of an extraordinary
Defect in the Sun about an hundred
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58008:109"/>
years after,<note place="margin">Tertullian <hi>ad</hi> Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> saith a Learned Father.
Seventeen days darkness was the
attendant of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Death,
who had his Eyes put out by his
Mother <hi>Irene,</hi> if some Historians
may be believed. We have it from
the Testimony of him who is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
and Truth it self, That
<hi>there stall be signs in the Sun, and
in the Moon, and in the Stars,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his last coming, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 25.
<hi>The Sun shall be darkned, and the
Moon shall not give her light, and
the Stars shall fall from Heaven,
and the powers of the Heaven shall
be shaken,</hi> Mat. 24. 29. We see
then <hi>what</hi> it is that makes the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Heavenly Bodies <hi>Prodigious</hi>
and <hi>Presaging, viz.</hi> Their being
disordered, and going against their
natural course. When they are
thus, they are of the nature of
those extraordinary and preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Lights which I have before
discoursed of, whose very Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is Ominous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:58008:110"/>
By this we may know what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to frame of the <hi>Aspects of the
Stars,</hi> the particular <hi>Phases of the
Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Eclipses of the Sun
and Moon,</hi> before spoken of. It is
certain that these, although they
may signifie in General, and cause
several Events, yet contain not any
thing in them, <hi>i. e.</hi> in their own
Nature, which is Boding and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.
Nor are they <hi>designed</hi>
(as Comets are) to be Signs of some
remarkable Evils and Calamities.
For I build on this ground, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Events are not foresig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by ordinary and natural Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents:
but such are the <hi>Aspects of
the Planets,</hi> and particularly the
Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi>
this year, so much talked of by the
common Prognosticatours. These
are made and come to pass by the
usual and Fixed Motion of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
They fall of themselves into
these Figures. These are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Shiftings of the Stars. And
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58008:110"/>
(as a demonstration of it) these, like
the rising and setting of the Sun,
and the entry of it into the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
and Solstitial Points, and the
Phaenomena of that nature are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
discerned, and may be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
many hundred years before
hand. And therefore they are not
in themselves portentous, they are
no tokens of God's Wrath, there is
nothing signified of the Divine Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
by them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>this</hi> cannot be said of <hi>Comets,</hi>
because they are Preternatural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
and being such cannot
possibly be foreknown by Art. I
never read that any Astrologer put
out Ephemerides of them. Nor can
<hi>the Shiftings of the Moon</hi> be said to
be <hi>Presaging,</hi> and in themselves
Ominous, and that for the foresaid
Reason. For though I deny not her
Influence on the Bodies and Minds
of Men, and as to her producing of
Changes in the World, yet it is
plain that she was not set up in the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58008:111"/>
Firmament to portend approaching
Distresses by her various Figures
and Faces which she sheweth, for
all these are Natural, and of course.
She is constant and unvariable in her
Changes: they may be all known
and told long before. Besides, any
man of common sense will grant
me this, that what is usual and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
cannot be prodigious.</p>
            <p>I might here say something of
<hi>Eclipses,</hi> and it is this; I declare
against the Doctrine of those well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers
to the Mathematicks, who
generally reckon these as ominous.</p>
            <p>From what hath been said it may
be gathered, that they are not to
be judged as such; for they are not
contrary to the usual course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and what is not so, cannot
carry any ill Omen with it. If an
Eclipse (particularly that of the Sun)
be portentous in it self, then every
Night, which is no other than the
Interposition of the Earth between
the Sun and us, is of that Nature
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58008:111"/>
also, and consequently we have an
unlucky time of it all our Lives.
It was the Ignorance of the <hi>Cause</hi> of
Eclipses which first gave occasion to
People to think they presignified
some Evil; and hereupon the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Pagans were mightily distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
at this Sight; and as for the
Moon, they imagined she was in
Labour, and accordingly came
with great Noise and Officiousness
(no other than the Midwifery of
Pans and Kettles) to relieve the
teeming Lady. But we know that
the Sun and Moon come naturally
to this Situation and Posture; and
the time of their Eclipses may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be foreknown, for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the determined and uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Motions of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
they must happen at such
times, and no others. The Eclipse
of the Sun can onely be in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon,
<hi>i. e.</hi> when the Sun and Moon
are together in either of the two
Points, <hi>Caput</hi> or <hi>Cauda Draconis,</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:58008:112"/>
for the Moon cuts or crosses the
Ecliptick but in these two Nodes.
The Moons Eclipse is onely when
she is at the Full, <hi>viz.</hi> when the
Earth is exactly interposed between
the Sun and her, which is called
<hi>Opposition.</hi> If I were purposely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and had all the Implements
of the Art about me, I could Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
foretell and set down all the
Eclipses that shall happen from this
day to the end of the World. The
<hi>ordinary defections</hi> then of these Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,
being Natural and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Events, are not <hi>Prodigious
and Fatal.</hi> And though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Astrologers reckon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Presages,</hi> yet I am well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that they doe it onely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
the People, and to make
themselves and their Art more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.</p>
            <p>Thus we see there is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the ordinary Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
of Heaven, and those that are
extraordinary, as Comets. Though
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58008:112"/>
the former are not divine Presages
(unless when they are disordered,
and extraordinarily obscured,) yet
the latter always are so in their own
Nature, and by the Appointment of
Heaven.</p>
            <p>I presume this is a satisfactory
Answer to the Objection, and gives
a true and impartial account of the
Nature of <hi>both</hi> sorts of Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
The ordinary Luminaries
may sometimes be put out of their
Courses, to be Signs to the World
of what the great Ruler of it is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but <hi>Comets</hi> are the <hi>Onely hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies</hi> which, as to their
Make, and Original, and all other
Considerations whatsoever, discover
themselves to be portentous. For
as for the strange Apparitions of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and Skirmishes seen in the Air,
I rank them not among the Bodies
of Heaven, because they are placed
in a lower Region. And as for those
Appearances which are called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia,</hi>
and <hi>Paraselene's, i. e.</hi> Mock-Suns,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58008:113"/>
and Mock-Moons, <hi>Halo's,</hi> &amp;c.
they are onely Reflexions of the
Clouds, and are not real things,
but mere Images.</p>
            <p>You have heard then at large the
<hi>Ends</hi> of God's creating the <hi>ordinary
Luminaries</hi> of Heaven. I have set
down both the Natural and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
the Common and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Uses of them. One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Use (and that is it wherein
Astrology is concerned chiefly) is
to be Signs of Natural and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions of all kinds, to Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by their Motion and Aspects
on this Inferiour World. They are
deservedly styled the <hi>Host</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
not onely because of their <hi>great
Multitude,</hi> and their <hi>exact Order,</hi>
but for their <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> Shall
every creeping Plant and Drug, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
fading Herb and Flower, have
their certain Virtues, and proper
Offices, and shall we deny the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and exalted Stars of Heaven a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58008:113"/>
peculiar Power to be serviceable to
the World? Have we not equal
Reason to persuade us that every
Planet hath its<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particular Property,
and all the Fixed Lights have their
several faculties and distinct powers?
I must needs profess I am of that
Wise Man's Opinion,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>W. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>'s Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says.</note> who said,
The Stars are of far greater Use
than to yield an obscure Light, and
for men to gaze on them after the
Sun is set. Yes certainly, God
makes use of the Ministery of the
Heavenly Bodies in the Oeconomy
of the lower World. We are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Stars, shut up within
the Heavenly Circle. All things
that happen in this World have a
near affinity with that other. So
thought the great Soul of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Aristot. <hi>Meteor. l.</hi> 1.</note>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
This inferiour World is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
necessarily tied to the Motions
of the upper one, in so much that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58008:114"/>
all its Powers are governed by it.
And therefore it is not to be denied
that the glorious Lights of Heaven
were constituted by the first Framer
of them, to act and influence upon
humane Bodies as well as others.</p>
            <p>There is then a lawfull Natural
Knowledge of the Influence of the
Stars, and of the position of the
Heavens, which is serviceable to it.
<hi>Astrology</hi> is a part of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
which from the knowledge
of Celestial Bodies prognosticateth
of Events in the Sublunary Bodies
below: and consequently the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men, who are partly made
of those, depend in some manner
on their Influences. But <hi>Iudiciary
Astrology</hi> hath heard ill, because by
it some make a Judgment of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi>
of <hi>Mens Wills,</hi> on which
depend the chief Events of Humane
Life, and all the remarkable Affairs
of States and Kingdoms. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Heavenly Bodies have an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58008:114"/>
Influence on the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi>
the <hi>Free-will</hi> and <hi>Determinations</hi> of
Men? In satisfaction to this main
Demand I assert, That the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies act upon the Bodies of
Men, and <hi>these</hi> influence upon their
<hi>Minds.</hi> I do not say that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Luminaries act <hi>immediately</hi>
and <hi>directly</hi> on the Soul of Man;
for after that manner onely they
work on his Body: but this is it
which I maintain, That the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Aspects of the Heavens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Mind and Will by Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sensitive Appetite, which
is stirred by the constitution of the
Body. For I take it to be an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
Truth, that Bodies strong
in humours, and weak in Vertue
or Grace, draw and incline the Mind
and Affections: and therefore those
Creatures that are guided by their
Natural and Sensual Appetites, as
Brutes and wicked Men, do most
of all feel the force of the Heavenly
Bodies. And for this Reason the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58008:115"/>
Astrologers of this degenerate Age,
these dreggs of Time, have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of most of those who have been
their Predecessors. Now they may
come the nearest to Certainty in
their Prognosticks. They may the
more easily tell true, because so few
resist their own vitious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
One would think on this
score that Judiciary Astrology were
now at its height and utmost cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
It must needs prove suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull
now or never, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Lives of Men acquaint us,
that they follow their own Natural
<hi>Genius</hi> and pronity of Mind, they
are led wholly by their depraved
Wills and Affections. Wicked and
dissolute Men, whom an inspired
Writer calleth <hi>Wandring Stars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> Jude, 13. <hi>v.</hi>
               </note>
know no other conduct but their
extravagant Lusts, and those inbred
Inclinations and Propensions which
they derive from their Fleshly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
and Bodily Tempers: and
thus the Stars may be said to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58008:115"/>
on the Natural <hi>Inclinations</hi> of
Men, and consequently such <hi>Acts</hi>
as proceed from them: for they act
on the Body, and the Body work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on the weak and ungoverned
Mind, and so Evil Actions are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>From what hath been hitherto
discoursed, we may in some part
understand the <hi>true Vse</hi> of Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and likewise the <hi>Abuse</hi> of it,
which is no other than this, <hi>viz.</hi>
Attributing too little or too much
to the Stars: We may frequently
see men running into these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
either of Defect or Excess.
The Abuse of Astrology on one
hand is depriving the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of all Influence and Operation
on the Sons of Men: and this I
have spoken of already. On the
other hand this Science is abused
whilst too great a Power and too
exorbitant a Regency is ascribed to
those Bodies. This is done when
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58008:116"/>
such an Agency and Virtue is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them by us, as is prejudicial
and derogatory,</p>
            <p>1. To God's universal Power
and Government.</p>
            <p>2. To the Agency of Man's
Will: And,</p>
            <p>3. To the Concurrence of other
Causes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>these Three</hi> the Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will find the whole <hi>Abuse</hi> of
Astrology (as to this latter extreme
of it) summ'd up. For they who
immeasurably and proudly brag of
this Science, defend the Stars to be,
as it were, Divine Agents, or that
they are instead of God: and they
go so far as to destroy the native or
acquired Freedom of Man's Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and they exclude all other
Causes (but the Stars) from having
a share in mens Actions. On the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
if we would avoid the excess
and Extravagancy of Astrology, if
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58008:116"/>
we would correct so wild a Folly
we must let <hi>God, Man's Will,</hi> and
<hi>Ioynt Causes</hi> have their due place.</p>
            <p>First, I say, Astrology is shame
fully abused when Men attribute
such a Power to the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as to deny God's Government
and Superintendency, or, (which
is all one) when they deprive God
of his Sovereign Power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to give it to the Stars. Some
of the High-flown of this Faculty
have been guilty of excluding the
Divine Providence and Concourse,
whilst they have defended the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or rather Efficiency of the
Celestial Powers. This is a kin to
that Pagan Persuasion, That these
Bodies have a certain Divinity in
them, and that they fatally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
act upon us. Hence the
<hi>Chaldeans</hi> and others offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Stars, and expected all
good or evil from them (which is
making them <hi>Gods.</hi>) The <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:58008:117"/>
held that every one had his
proper Star,<note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Nat. Hist. l. 2. c.</hi> 8.</note> as a peculiar Daemon
or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Numen. And not onely the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> but <hi>Iews</hi> polluted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Worship of the Host
of Heaven, <hi>Manasses</hi> being their chief
Perverter herein, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 3.
But if some who pretend to Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Studies are not directly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this, (as I cannot prove they
are) yet they act almost as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely,
whilst they extravagantly
and impiously extoll the Power of
those Bodies above, even so far as
to deny God to be the principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour
and Disposer of all Affairs;
and whilst they assert that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and preternatural Events,
and such as depend wholly on God's
mere Pleasure, and have no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all to natural and common
Causes, are the Effects of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Aspects of the Stars, and
might have been foretold and prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticated
by them. A most Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Arrogance and Blasphemy!
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58008:117"/>
For though I have above granted
(and am always ready to grant what
is Reason and good Sense) that God
may and doth make use even of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Instruments in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of supernatural Effects, yet this
is a thing that is exceeding rare;
and then also it is impossible that
these Arbitrary Effects should be
foretold by any Knowledge that
Men have of the Stars. But there
are <hi>some</hi> supernatural Effects and
Productions which depend not in
the least on second Causes, but are
wrought by God himself, without
the assistence of Instruments or any
Means, nay, even in defiance of
all Secondary Causes, as most of
the Miracles of the Old and New
Testament, and these could never
be prognosticated by the Stars. And
therefore the Insolency and Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of those is to be abhorred,<note place="margin">Albuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponatius, Cardan, Vaninus.</note> who
have told the World in Print, that
the Judgment of God in the Deluge
of old, and all the Appearances
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58008:118"/>
of Angels afterwards,<note place="margin">Albertus Magnus, Lucas Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</hi> Petrus de Aliaco, Cusanus, <hi>Cardinals.</hi>
               </note> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
and Wondrous Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Jewish People were from
the particular Influence and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Stars at those Times;
and that all Christ's Actions, Life
and Death, and consequently our
Redemption, depended on the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Heavens at his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
in short, that Christianity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was beholding to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations,
that the Gospel was
indebted to the Aspects of the
Stars, and that all things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
are from the Position of the
Heavens.</p>
            <p>If the Reader pleaseth to cast his
Eye on the Margent, he will see
that this cursed Doctrine was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized
not onely by professed
Atheists, but by great Divines and
Church-men; but let not that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, for they were such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to that Church which is
said by some to be the Nurse of
Atheism and Profaneness, witness
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58008:118"/>
the swarms of Atheists in <hi>Italy</hi> and
the adjacent Countries. But sober
Reason as well as Religion will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, that the things before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
are above the power of Nature,
and therefore out of the reach of
<hi>Astrology.</hi> This Art hath nothing
to doe with supernatural Events,
with the Divine Oeconomy, and
God's immediate Will and Pleasure.
And though in respect of things of
another Nature I grant the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies to have an Influence,
yet this must be remembred, that
they cannot Act without the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
Order. <hi>He telleth the
number of the Stars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 147. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and calleth
them all by their Names, i. e.</hi> He
hath the full Command and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of them. It is no <hi>Dream,</hi> but a
<hi>Reality,</hi> that the <hi>Sun, Moon and
Stars come, and bow down, and make
Obeysance to Him.</hi> Which indeed
is after the rate of the sober Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
of the Stoicks, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
First Cause is not tied to the Stars.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58008:119"/>
These are subject to the Prime and
Omnipotent Being, who can sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
their Influences whensoever
He pleaseth. This I suppose is the
meaning of what the Hebrew Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
tell us God said to <hi>Abraham</hi> in
<hi>Chaldaea,</hi> when he studied Judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Astrology there, <hi>Abraham, egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
de Astrologia tua, nullum enim
est sidus Israeli:</hi> Trouble not thy
self about the Stars, for there is not
one of them can be unlucky to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
And on this consideration it
might be made evident, that no
man can be Positive in foretelling
future Events by the Stars.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Astrology is abused
and perverted by those who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
such a Power and Sovereignty
to the Heavenly Bodies, as whereby
they destroy the liberty of mans Will,
and introduce a kind of fatal Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whereupon they ground the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of their Prognostications. For
these men fondly hold, that we are all
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58008:119"/>
fatally tied to the Stars: whereas,
Man being a free Agent, it is folly
to imagine that his Will can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained.
This faculty remaineth
Arbitrary and Unconsined, and
therefore no Artist can Divine what
the Acts and Exertments of it shall
be. It is true that Reason and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have the Dominion but in
few Men. The Generality are led
by their sensitive and brutish part,
which is immediately Subject to
the Influence of the Heavens. But
it is not impossible, nay, it is easie
by the aid of Divine Grace, and by
a resolute Resisting, to avoid their
Operation upon us. Prayers and
Endeavours frustrate the Stars, for
their Influence is not inevitable, so
as to force any Man's Will: and
hereupon it is undeniably conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
that voluntary Actions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Infallibly foretold. I have
shewed already that <hi>Supernatural
Actions</hi> cannot be predicted by the
Stars: Now I believe it will as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58008:120"/>
palpably appear, that <hi>Free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
ones</hi> cannot. As the things
which depend on the <hi>mere Power
and Pleasure of God,</hi> so those that
issue from the <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Man</hi> are beyond the reach, and
out of the ken of Astrological Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
Mens <hi>Wills</hi> are the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
that guide them, and make
them <hi>Erratical.</hi> It is not in the
power of Astrologers to fix these,
and to bring them within the sphere
of their Knowledge. We see and
observe that their Conjectures are
uncertain concerning the change of
Weather. How often may they be
confuted in their Predictions of
Rain, Snow, Frost, Winds, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
Some have writ down the weather
quite contrary to their Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
(as <hi>Buchanan</hi> dealt with his
Almanack above fifty Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and as the Earl of <hi>Mirandula</hi>
hath observed) and have found that
what they set down came nearest
to the truth. If an Astrologer then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58008:120"/>
faileth so mnch in telling the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how much more in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to determine those Events
which depend on the Will and
choice of Man? If he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
foretell the Changes of the
Clouds and Elements, how will he
be able to acquaint us before-hand
with the Alterations in Families
and Kingdoms, which are more
uncertain? It is by reason of such
bold Pretenders and Undertakers,
that Astrology is rendred vile and
scandalous, and the Professours
of it looked upon as Lyars and
Impostours. For what can be more
like cheating, than for a man to
take upon him to determine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
of future Contingencies,
when the Objects of his Predictions
are every minute alterable by the
interposal of free Agents, who have
power to interrupt the Causality of
the Stars? For though men may be
thus and thus <hi>Disposed</hi> and <hi>Inclined,</hi>
according to the different Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58008:121"/>
and their Aspects, yet they
are <hi>left free,</hi> and are not constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and forced to doe this or that.
And if this be true, the most saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Artist on Earth cannot punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
determine their Actions, this
being an impregnable Proposition,
That nothing can be certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by Man, which is in the power
of a free Agent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Astrology is abused not
onely when the free Agency of God
and Man are infringed, but when
the <hi>Concurrence of those other Causes</hi>
which are requisite in the life of
Man is wholly neglected.</p>
            <p>This then must be laid down as a
necessary Proposition,</p>
            <p>That the Tempers and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of Men, and consequently
their Dispositions and Actions, and
all humane Affairs which are the
issue of them, depend upon several
conjoyned Causes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:58008:121"/>
It is true that we receive our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
and Temperature from the
quality of the Heavenly Bodies, but
not from them only, but from other
Causes and Authours. I have granted
once and again, that there is a great
consent and intercourse between the
upper and lower World. Heaven
and Earth are confederate. Many
things are derived to our Natures
from above, many of our Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are received from thence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Events and Accidents are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Astral Revolutions,
but they do not derive their force
from them alone. There are other
Causes besides the Prime Efficiency
of God, and the free Agency of
Men, which powerfully influence
on Humane Actions. Say then
that the Stars act on the Body of
Man, and say that the Complexion
of the Body swayeth the Mind, (as
is acknowledged,) yet this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
depends on the Temper of
the Parents, and the quality of their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58008:122"/>
Seed; on the temper of the Air of
that Countrey which he was born
in, and afterwards lived in; on his
Diet and Food he constantly takes;
on his Education and manner of
Life. All these, and several other
things make a great difference in
men: and the influence of the Stars
may be hindred by any of them,
much more by all of them together.
Though the Heavens dispose to
such and such Temperatures of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet they are easily changed and
over-ruled by the Concurrence of
these. To speak freely, the Stars act,
as all other natural Causes do, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Capacity and Disposition
of the matter they work upon. Now
the Disposition of Inferiour Bodies is
very different, and on that account
they receive not the Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
alike. Just as we see the
Effects of Diseases are according to
the Diversities of Mens Bodies, and
therefore no certain Judgment can
be made of the issue of one Man's
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58008:122"/>
Distemper, from what is observed
in another. For Example, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
sees such and such Signs of
Death in two persons who have
high Fevers, but though the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks
are equal in both, yet
the Natural Temper of one may be
stronger than the others, and so be
too hard for the Disease and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it: but it was not possible for
the Master of Medicks to foresee
this. The Case is the same here,
and it is confirmed by Experience.
All persons who were born under
the same Planets are not of the same
condition and Fortune in the World,
and on the contrary, the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Fates of Men are alike (as
when many thousands fall in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
in one day) though different
Stars reigned at their Births: and
the Reason is, because all men are
not alike capable of the Influence of
Heaven, for there may be wanting
a <hi>Concurrence of several Causes</hi>
(which I have before named) to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58008:123"/>
make them equal: and it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
true, that the Heavens are
not the Integral Causes of Mens
Conditions and Actions. I infer
then irrefragably, That no Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can certainly foretell future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
which depend upon so many
Causes, whilst he is carefull onely
to be acquainted with one sort of
them. And from all the premised
Heads it is easie to conclude how
shallow and imperfect the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of common Astrologers are,
and what little reason they have to
be absolute and peremptory in their
Predictions. For the Actions of
Mens Lives, and the different E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
that happen to them, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from several Springs and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
besides the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
A Judgment cannot be made
of a Man's Life from one of these
onely, but from all. The Prime
Source and Fountain of all is God,
or the Divine Providence, which
<hi>Commandeth the Sun, and it riseth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58008:123"/>
not, and sealeth up the Stars,</hi> Job 9. 7.
which can countermand the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
course of Nature, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that of the Celestial Bodies.
Or, the same infinite Power can
change the Temper which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Stars, and cause
his Grace to check and controll the
Influence of their Aspects, so that
it shall be out of the reach of any
humane Science, to make a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Judgment of any Actions or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
that belong to such Persons.
And as for that other Spring of
Mens Actions, their Wills, these
being Free and Arbitrary cannot be
confined by Art; and whatever
Actions depend on voluntary choice
and determination, cannot be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
unless they be revealed by
him who is the onely knower and
Searcher of Hearts. It is His sole
Pretogative to foresee future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
which depend on free
Causes: Though it is true the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
hath claimed This in all Ages,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58008:124"/>
(witness the many ways of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Oracles, Auguries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
and for this he hath been consulted
and adored by the Gentile World.
Besides, it is above humane Art to
foretell certainly future Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
because the Actions of Men,
and the Events which follow them
are not always, or for the most
part according to their Wills and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations:
for they may be sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and over-ruled by Providence,
they may act against their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Resolves. Not to mention
this also, that Hypocrisie often puts
a veil and disguise on mens doings.
Lastly, those <hi>other associate Causes
and Springs</hi> of Actions and Events
in the Life of Man, as the first
Principle of Generation derived
from the Parents, and the like, may
prove too strong for the Influence
of the Heavens, and so make all
Prognosticks uncertain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:58008:124"/>
But it will be said, that those
who divine by the Stars are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
frequently, and it is known
that they sometimes exactly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
what shall come to pass.</p>
            <p>I answer, I am not unwilling to
grant that they doe so, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their Art. For I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
before, that I am none of
those who cut down a whole Art
right or wrong, who admit of no
Limitations and Cautions in the
Subject they treat of, and in the
cause they undertake, a sort of
men that spoil all Sciences, and
have done as much harm in <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
as in any thing whatsoever. I
make no question but the Stars
point out some Futurities to us, but
it seldom happens that we know
what they are, because the persons
who are truly skilfull and can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us, are very few and scarce:
because the Art is intricate, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
up much time, and requireth
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58008:125"/>
a singular <hi>Honesty</hi> joyned with an
exquisite <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For it is not
every Well-willer to the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
can set up for Prognosticks.
An Astrologer must not onely be
skilled in the Starry Revolutions,
but ought to be a profound Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
Politician, Historian, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
Divine, and in a word, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
instructed; for he is to
look into, and be acquainted with
other Causes and Springs of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
besides those above; he is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to divers things, and not to
pronounce rashly: Hear what a

The Study
of the Heavenly Bodies is not the
employment of a rude and barren
Mind, but of one that is extremely
ingenious and docile, and pregnant
with the most complete and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
Notions. An Astrologer
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58008:125"/>
must be a man of great thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Study, of mighty Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Sagacity, of long Trial
and Experience, of exact and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Observation, and in order to
this latter he should constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
in a place proper for his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
a plain champain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
a clear and uncloudy Skie,
fit to promote the Observations of
the Heavens: and on this account
I question whether the accurate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Stars can be attained to
in Islands and such like places.
When the Person is rightly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
for his work, and when all
things belonging to the Art favour
and befriend him, (which is very
rare) his Astrological Judgments
may prove successfull. But even
then he cannot promise and assure
any man of the certainty and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of what he saith, but must
desire People to be contented with
Likelihood and Probability. This
is the true scale of Astrology, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58008:126"/>
he that takes its height otherwise
deceiveth the World.</p>
            <p>I Answer again, It is no wonder
that they seem sometimes to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
aright things to come, for this
they may doe merely by chance.
It will happen so at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But then how often do they
feed those who consult them with
Lies? Though the Art be fallacious,
yet it may hit sometimes, and so
Events may answer to the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Why may they not light on
truth by chance? Of so many
things foretold some one will come
to pass. But if the number of the
things which happen, and of those
which do not, be compared, for
one Truth you will find a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Falshoods.</p>
            <p>This also I have to Answer, That
sometimes they are thought to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
because they speak ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
and fond People are prone
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58008:126"/>
to interpret in favour of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller.
Thus <hi>Nostrodamus</hi> (who
was Physician to three Kings of
<hi>France</hi> successively) his Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are so obscure and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
that some of them have been
thought to be fulfilled when they
were not, and that merely because
they are so shaped, that they may
be understood and applied divers
ways. Moreover, there is Reason
to believe, that they sometimes
foretell things from a Confederacy
and Compact with Spirits. I am
confident I am not uncharitable in
thinking that some of those who
take upon them to predict future
Events by Judiciary Astrology,
step beyond the bounds of their
Art, and hold Correspondence with
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> that great fallen Star. By
his means they may shrewdly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
(as some of them have done) the
exact time and manner of their
own and others Deaths. As <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
in the Life of <hi>Domitian,</hi> tells
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58008:127"/>
of an Astrologer, who having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
the Emperour's Fortune, which
it seems was not pleasing to him,
and being asked by the Emperour
what should be his own, he said he
was to be devoured by Dogs. To
frustrate his Prediction the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
ordered he should presently be
killed and buried: but whilst they
were burying him a great storm
arose, and made them relinquish
the Corps, and by that means it
was left to the Dogs, who came
and tore it in pieces and devoured
it. <hi>Cardan</hi> foretold the Year and
Day of his own Death. One warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March,</hi>
which were approaching, and it is
well known that they proved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to him. <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> who
by his Writings shewed himself <hi>the
greatest Adversary that ever Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
had,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoph. Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Def. of Iud. Astrol. p.</hi> 193.</note> (as one who was the greatest
Patron, and learnedst Defender of
Judiciary Astrology, styleth him)
was told by <hi>Lucius Bellantius,</hi> and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58008:127"/>
two other Astrologers, that he
should die in the three and thirtieth
Year of his Age, and he did so.
This might fall out by <hi>Chance,</hi> as
I have said: or, as I am now sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting,
by the <hi>Devil's help,</hi> for he
is ready to assist in Predictions those
that too narrowly prie into such
Mysteries, and thereby he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
his Kingdom and Interest.
And that some Futurities of great
moment may be discovered by his
Assistence is evident, because he is
(as the sacred Writ calleth him) the
<hi>God of this World,</hi> and <hi>ruleth in
the Children of Disobedience,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is engaged in all the black
Crimes men are guilty of, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them up to the commission of
those horrid Villanies which are
acted: he may in a manner be said
to doe them, and therefore can tell
that they are to be done. Or, he
being prosent at the Clubs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of the Wicked, heareth such
and such things from the Mouths
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58008:128"/>
of those who design to act them,
Or, evil Spirits can guess futurities
by what is past or present. They
can partly see the things to come
in those that have been already.
These subtile Creatures ponder the
Nature and Effects of all things,
and by their long continuance and
experience are skilled in the temper
of the Elements, and of Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the Inclinations proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thence, insomuch that they can
foresee Famine, Pestilence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diseases, Wars and Deaths.
Or God may permit evil Spirits to
foretell Events, Suffering them
thereby to seduce the Wicked, and
to punish them, or for other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which are hid to us. From
such Considerations as these it is
not unreasonable to gather. That
the consulting of Ghosts and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Spirits, in plain terms, <hi>Devils,</hi>
is too often palliated under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Astrology. I have it from
the Pen of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sagiis.</note> (who some
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58008:128"/>
think was a competent Judge in
this case,) That <hi>the Devil often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth
himself into Astrologers.</hi>
Nor is it necessary that he should
formally and solemnly converse
with them, (though it is probable
he doth so with some:) it is enough
for their purpose, and the Devil's
too, that they tacitly hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with him: an implicit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
may suffice sometimes. And
thus the <hi>Daemon,</hi> or evil Spirit, who
actuateth them, keeps them in pay
with constant Intelligence, till at
last he gives them the full Reward
of their serving him in the Regions
of Darkness forever.</p>
            <p>I hope I have by this time made
it manifest, that future Events may
be predicted in some measure, or
seem to be so, and yet that this is
not to be attributed to Astrological
Skill. No: This Art, as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged;
seldom reacheth so far. If
it had light into the hands of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who were both <hi>knowing and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58008:129"/>
good,</hi> it might have come to some
thing: but as it hath been used, or
rather abused and perverted, no
great matter can be expected from
it. And to offer yet a farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of this, and to prove that
it is not in the power of Astrology,
as it is now framed, to foretell fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Contingencies, nay, not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Occurrences with any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I will lead you to a clear Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of it by these following
Steps:</p>
            <p>1. The Hypotheses they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
go upon, are not the same
that we reade of heretofore.</p>
            <p>2. They proceed upon seigned
and precarious Principles.</p>
            <p>3. And more particularly, Their
Doctrine of Genitures is fond and
groundless.</p>
            <p>4. They go beyond the Rules of
the wisest in the Art.</p>
            <p>5. They pretend to tell others
of their affairs, but in the mean time
know not their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:58008:129"/>
In the First place, I tender this to
be considered, That the <hi>Hypotheses</hi>
which the old Astrologers and the
new ones proceed upon, are not
the same, but differ <hi>toto coelo,</hi> and
therefore it is impossible that the
Astrological Judgments made from
them should be true, or at least, if
they be true on one side, they are
false on the other. <hi>Ricciolus</hi> in his
<hi>Astronomia Reformata,</hi> hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
shewed the variety of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical
Hypotheses, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of them; and from thence
he moves for a Reformation in the
Principles of Astronomy and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
That excellent Writer will
inform us, that the ancient Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
was false and frivolous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was grounded on gross mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
in Philosophy, on palpable
Errours concerning the Systeme of
the World, as the Ptolemaick Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
which is now laughed at.
The Moderns will tell you that the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58008:130"/>
fixed Stars have altered their places,
and do not set and rise at the same
time they did of old, but a Month
later. For Example, the <hi>Dog Star</hi>
arose about the middle of <hi>Iuly</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
but now in the middle of
<hi>August.</hi> The fixed Stars of <hi>Scorpio</hi>
and <hi>Taurus</hi> have changed their
Site. The Star in the Tail of the
lester Bear, called the Pole Star,
hath insensibly crept nearer the
Pole. It was heretofore the most
Southerly Star in that Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but is now the most Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hackwell</hi>'s Apol. l. 2. Sect. 4.</note>
               <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> a famous Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean
Philosopher, who lived in
<hi>Egypt</hi> in the reign of <hi>Ptolemaeus
Philadelphus,</hi> saith it was 12 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
from the Pole in his days:
but now it is not above 3 or 4. And
the <hi>Planets</hi> are altered as well as the
<hi>fixed Lights.</hi> The Entrance of the
Sun into the Cardinal Points (a
mighty considerable thing in Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
and whence the Judgments
of Artists concerning the Quarters
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58008:130"/>
of the Year take their measures) is
determined by some otherwise than
it was heretofore. Nay, it is known
that the Moderns do not agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the punctual Time of the Sun's
Entrance, <hi>Copernicus</hi> and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
say the Sun is come
nearer to the Earth than it was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
by vast proportions; some
say Ten Thousand Miles. The
Centre of the Sun was distant from
the Centre of the Earth 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Earth in <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s time:
now it is distant 18. The Sun's
<hi>Apogaeum</hi> in <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s days was in
the 5th Degree of <hi>Gemini,</hi> now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Tycho</hi> it is in the 6th
Degree of <hi>Cancer.</hi> Some likewise
are of Opinion, that the Reason
why so many Eclipses appear, is
because the Equinoxes are transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and remain not what they
were at first. Now this I say, If
there, be not the same distance of
the Earth from the Heavens that
was heretofore, and if the Stars are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58008:131"/>
displaced, there will follow thence
an Increase or Abatement of their
Influences: or, though they be not
altered (as I cannot tell whether
my Authours fail me or no in their
Accounts) yet if some modern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
have thought so, and have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
their Conclusions accordingly,
there must needs be some alteration
in Judgments made thence. And
yet these Moderns (which is very
strange) adhere to the Aphorisms
of the Ancients in the Judiciary
part of Astrology. The old Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses
are exploded, and yet no
new Rules and Maxims are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
The antiquated Aphorisms
must hold on still, though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are not now conformable to the
old Systeme of them. Who would
not think that the new discoveries in
the Heavens must needs make some
Alteration in the Judgments made
from them? Since many things
concerning the Stars are known
and acknowledged now which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58008:131"/>
times were ignorant of, how
can it otherwise happen than that
there should be sometimes <hi>different,</hi>
if not <hi>contrary Observations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, their Art is founded,
as on suspected Hypotheses, so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>false and feigned Principles.</hi> As
to Instance, they build upon the
<hi>groundless Suppositions</hi> of the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi>
that great and spatious Circle
which containeth the several Roads
and Inns which the Sun turns into
in his travelling round the World.
Having named <hi>this,</hi> perhaps it will
be expected I should declame against
the <hi>imaginary Signs</hi> in that Circle,
for they confess themselves that
there is not the least Similitude of
a Lion, a Scorpion, or a Crab in
the Heavens. If it had pleased the
first Nomenclators, the Lion might
have been a Jaccal, the Scorpion
a Crocodile, and the Crab a Whale.
One of the Constellations in this
Circle is called <hi>Libra,</hi> but it is no
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58008:132"/>
more like a Balance than a pair of
Bellows, nor so much neither. But
<hi>Libra</hi> is a Symbol of Justice, <hi>Ergò</hi>
They that are born under this Sign
shall prove Just and Even Men.
This it is to argue from arbitrary
and fictitious things, as if real Effects
were like to be produced from Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera's.
Those that remonstrate
against Judiciary Astrology, use to
be very brisk here, and fly with
great Zeal at these Imaginary and
feigned Signs in the Heavens. But
I have premised before, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
not Conquest but Truth in
this short Essay. My work is not
to run at all adventures against an
Opinion, but to strike at so much
of it onely as ought to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
I hold therefore, That though
those Constellations have imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Names, yet they may be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a real Influence. And the
Reason why they call them by such
Names, is because it is likely those
Figures from whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58008:132"/>
(as a Ram, a Bull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
express something of the Nature
and Effects, the Power and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Stars on the Body of
Man. However, these Names and
Figures were appropriated to them
to distinguish them from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Waving then these, let us
consider the <hi>Distribution</hi> of the
Signs of the Zodiack, and here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we shall find mere Fictions
and Delusions. Take this convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
demonstration of it: Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
teach, that the several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Regions of the World are
under their particular and proper
Signs, that they are all provided
and served with their different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations:
and so their way is,
when there are Conjunctions, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipses,
and the like in these Signs,
to see what Countreys and Cities
are liable to the Dominion of these
Constellations. But you must note
that when the Astrologers made
the <hi>Distribution</hi> of the Signs, there
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58008:133"/>
were but three parts, or rather half
of the World known, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of that known World shared
all the Signs among them; so that
if any other parts should be found
out afterwards, they were to shift
for themselves, and be contented
without Signs. Now it happened
that <hi>America</hi> was discovered since,
and this is as large as the other
Three Parts of the World, and hath
not one Sign allotted it. An Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
still proceeds as if there were
no such place in Nature; for if he
should allow it any Signs then this
new World must rob the old one of
half its Constellations, and by this
means the ancient Rules of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
(on which they still proceed)
are baffled and cashier'd. It is clear
then that the <hi>Dividing</hi> of these
Signs was an idle and foolish Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Or, to couch the matter in
short thus, The old Division of the
Signs among the Nations of the
Earth was either right or wrong. If
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58008:133"/>
it was right, then one half of the
World hath engrossed all the Signs,
which is as ridiculous and absurd as
can be, and the poor People of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
though they be a Moiety
of the World, can have no Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks
made upon them. Or if
the ancient way of Dividing the
Signs was wrong, then all the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Judgments of Places of the
World before Two Hundred Years
agoe, were mere Shams: and as
for the Modern Astrologers, if they
follow <hi>that Division,</hi> they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
and if they make a <hi>new one,</hi>
they thereby disgrace and abuse
the greatest Patrons of their Art,
and they may as well renounce
their <hi>other</hi> Hypotheses and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as this, and so the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of Astrology will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of tumbling down. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Regimen of the Twelve
Signs, in respect of Man's Body,
will be call'd in question, <hi>viz.</hi> why
the Head is governed by this Sign,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58008:134"/>
and the Neck by that? why such
Members are under the Dominion
of such particular Constellations,
and not others? And the Division
of these Signs into Hot and Cold,
Dry and Moist, according to the
Qualities of the Four Elements, or,
which is the same, the Division of
them into Four Trigons, the Fiery
Trigon (<hi>Aries, Leo, Sagittarius,</hi>)
the Earthly <hi>(Taurus, Virgo, Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi>)
the Aerial <hi>(Gemini, Libra,
Aquarius,</hi>) and the Watry <hi>(Cancer,
Scorpio, Pisces,</hi>) may be looked on
as groundless and Precarious.</p>
            <p>Next, I am not satisfied about
their <hi>Distribution of the Heavens</hi>
into the <hi>Twelve Houses,</hi> which
they talk much of, and of which
they make as much use in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of their Schemes. When
they are to judge of the Events that
appertain to any Person they fly to
these Houses presently, to see what
Planets, or other Stars, were situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in any of these at the Birth of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58008:134"/>
him they enquire about. The first
House begins at the East-Horizon,
and is to be numbred according
to the Series of the Signs Eastward.
In Nativities it is called the Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
and the House of Life. It
is also named the Ascendent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Sun ascends there in this
first House: and according to the
quality of any Man's Ascendent
they tell you what his Fortunes
shall be. This and the other Eleven
Houses with their Virtues and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
are represented in order in
the following Distich,
<q>
                  <l>Vita, Lucrum, Fratres, Genitor, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
Valetudo,</l>
                  <l>Vxor, Mors, Pietas, Regnum, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factá<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
Carcer,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These Houses (say they) have
their particular and distinct Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all things that can happen
to Man, and according to these the
various Events of Life and Death
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58008:135"/>
are to be Judged of. But what can
be more imaginary and fancyfull?
It is a mere Arbitrary Invention
that there should be just Twelve
Houses, and no more or less. And
what is there in one of these Houses
more than in another that signifies
these distinct Natures and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
What Reason can be given
why the first House should be the
Horoscope, and why Judgment
must be made there of the Birth of
the Child? And not onely in this,
but in every one of these Houses
there are many things wholly feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
fabulous and precarious. When
you come to take an account of
them from the Artist, you hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a mere Jargon and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
Gibberish. But this is
plain English, and easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that from consulting of
imaginary and fictitious Houses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be expected but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Predictions. And so for the
<hi>Planetary Hours,</hi> which are the 12
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58008:135"/>
equal parts which Astrologers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the artificial Day and Night
into, be it long or short. There
are 6 Planetary Hours constantly
in a day before Noon, and 6 after;
and in these a Planet is said to reign
or rule, and the Hours take their
Denomination from the 7 Planets,
beginning with <hi>Luna,</hi> and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
again with <hi>Luna,</hi> &amp;c. This,
no less than the position of the
Twelve Houses, seemeth to be
wholly Arbitrary, and founded on
no solid Bottom; and I could never
find that the stoutest Champion
that the Stars ever had, could keep
his ground here.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and more particularly,
Their Doctrine of <hi>Genitures</hi> is fond
and ridiculous. But here first I
will (according to the Method I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
prescribed my self) grant
what is to be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That
as the Heavenly Bodies, which are
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58008:136"/>
so great and vast, and always sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
and incircle us, shed their
Influence and Efficacy continually
upon us, so they do it especially at
our first entring into the World,
when our Bodies are moist, soft and
tender. Then chiefly they receive
Impressions from the Heavens, and
so the Temperament is partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from above, and if long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of acting be added to the
Natural Temper and Complexion,
here is some ground for Astrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Judgments in a sober manner.
But the common Doctrine of the
<hi>Genethliaci,</hi> and their Boasts and
Undertakings are vain upon these
following Accounts; because,</p>
            <p>1. The Judgment concerning
the Complexion and Inclination of
Men should be made not onely from
their <hi>Nativity,</hi> but from the Time
of their <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Conception,</hi>
when the first Lineaments of their
Temper were drawn, and the
Ground work of Nature was laid.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58008:136"/>
If any thing be impressed on Men
by the Stars, it is rather done upon
the Seed in Conception, than on
the <hi>Foetus</hi> at the Birth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judgment should rather be
taken from that Principle, and from
the time of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when the
Infant first of all moveth and liveth,
than from the hour of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And yet I could never observe
that these Diviners trouble their
Heads about this, which is the
Foundation of all.</p>
            <p>2. The Knowledge of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the Stars, as to the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Persons, is very hard to come
by, for the exact time of Birth is
seldom known and set down. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
can assign the Day or Night,
the Forenoon or Afternoon, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Hour in any of these, but
not one in a million directly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>just and precise time</hi> when
he was born. And yet many of
those who maintain the Judgment
of Genitures say, that the Day or
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58008:137"/>
Hour are not enough, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to know the true Minute of
the Nativity, for on that depends
the exact Judgment of the Person
and his Actions. Thus we see (say
they) that the little distance between
the Birth of Twins causeth a vast
difference in their respective For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and course of Life, as in the
Examples of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau, Remus</hi>
and <hi>Romulus,</hi> and others. These
Twins, though they may be said to
be born together, yet because they
came not into the World at the very
same moment, differed exceedingly
in their conditions, and all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of their Lives; for every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
minute the influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
altereth. So that according to
the concessions of Astrologers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
there is no accurate Judging
from the Nativity. If the Clocks
went false at the time of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery,
all is gone. The Hour (if
that would serve) cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
told, much less the Quarter
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58008:137"/>
and Minute: and yet if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
failing in the least portion of
Time, the Stars change their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Nor can they salve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(but rather give farther proof of
their groundless Confidence) by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if the just time of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
be forgot, or not known,
they can by a Rule of <hi>Hermes</hi>
(which Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> sets
down in his Defence of Judiciary
Astrology, <hi>p.</hi> 170.) help themselves
and supply the defect. But others,
who are not so punctual, say it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
that they have a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
account of the time of Birth.
And these men see they must be
forced to acknowledge this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is impossible sometimes that
the exact Minute of the Nativity
should be known, as when the Birth
is retarded by some accident or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Nay, every Child is born
by parts, he comes successively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World, so that there is a great
Latitude in the time of Nativity.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58008:138"/>
The Head may have received its
Impression from the heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
before the Breast or the Belly
have theirs, and these before the
Feet and lower Parts can come to
have their Doom.</p>
            <p>Thus the several Regions and
Members of the Body will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
affected by the Stars. If
<hi>Twins</hi> were not born under the
same Constellation, because not
born in the same moment, but one
after another, then for that Reason
no <hi>one Man</hi> is born under the same
Constellation, for he cometh not
all at once into the World.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It is against the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Astrology it self, to judge
of the course of Mens Lives from
their Nativity, because that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that a diversity of Aspects cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
divers Inclinations in humane
Bodies. Now it is known that the
Aspects of the Planets vary much
in one day in divers Countries. It
is vain then to judge of Persons of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58008:138"/>
divers Countries and Regions from
their Nativities. Though many
are born about the same time, yet
the places being different, there
must be a diversity of Position of
the Heavens, and what Star ariseth
in one place in such an instant, sets
in another; therefore the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Astrologers in this case
are uncertain.</p>
            <p>Farther, Though I cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what one hath related,<note place="margin">Valer. Max. <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
that two persons born at the same
time were observed afterwards to
be of the same <hi>Genius,</hi> they were
Philosophers of the same School
and Sect, and died both in the same
Moment; and it is known, that as
some Twins came into the World,
so they went out together, yet it is
as evident also, that those who had
the same Stars at their Births, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be of different Qualities and
Success in their Lives; and on the
contrary, they who were born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
different Stars met with the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58008:139"/>
same Fortunes. An Example of
this latter is given us by the great
Roman Pleader, and thus urged by
him, as a full Eviction of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Genethliack Divination,
<hi>Omnésne qui Cannensi pugnâ cecide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,<note place="margin">Cicero. <hi>l. 2. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinat.</hi>
                  </note>
uno Astro fuerunt? Exitus
quidem omnium unus &amp; idem fuit.</hi>
In some Battel (as suppose at <hi>Cannae</hi>)
there fell at the same time, and by the
same kind of Death, Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men. If this happened from the
Stars, then they were all born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same Constellation; but
none hath the impudence to say so:
and therefore to argue from the
Stars reigning at Mens Births to
their future adventures and success,
is irrational. It is absurd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that all which happeneth in
the whole Life, dependeth on that
moment in which the Child was
born, or that as the Stars stood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
at that time, so ever after he
should act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:58008:139"/>
Lastly, you may see how liable
the Doctrine of <hi>Genitures</hi> is to Fraud
and Deceit, from the general Use
that is made of it by those who
undertake to erect Astrological
Schemes: For a Person and his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being once known, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
make some Star, House, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or other, answer to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and make those to be certain
Arguments of these. <hi>Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
his Nativity is one of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and poorest that ever I saw,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Collectio Genitur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> saith
a Student in this Art; there is not
one Planet here essentially dignified.
Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> began his
March 1659. <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 10 h. 15. m.
towards the North, against General
<hi>Monk.</hi> The Position of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
was most sad, saith the same
Person; the Moon was in a <hi>Watry
Sign,</hi> therefore he had like to have
been drowned in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> riding
through a River towards his Army.
But you may take notice by the
bye, (from the same hand) that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58008:140"/>
those who are born under <hi>Pisces,</hi>
shall fall into a River some time
or other, but not be drowned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
forsooth <hi>Fishes swim. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Signs</hi> possessing the Angles of a
Nativity make the Person most
eminent and famous in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
saith the same Artist, (the
greatest Actions of the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Cardinal Points of
the Heavens, <hi>viz. Aries, Cancer,
Libra, Capricorn.</hi>) Thus <hi>Tullius
Cicero, Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> late
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi>
and <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> (are they not
well suited by him?) had the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Points upon the Angles of
their Nativities. <hi>Peter Gassendus,</hi>
poor Man, because he writ against
Judiciary Astrology, and checked
and confuted the Art of <hi>Genitures,</hi>
hath all things naught in his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
His ill habit of Body, and
worser (if this Censor is to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited)
of Mind, is plainly to be seen
in the Heavens. Never was wretch
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58008:140"/>
so bespattered by Man of Art. What
work would this man make with
the Nativity of the worthy Dr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
More,</hi> if he could get a sight of
it? He would reade his Life and all
his Writings in it at the first view.
He would make the Lord of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
plainly shew him to be a
Retired, Melancholick Collegian
all his days, a Philosopher, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of the Platonick Sect, and
(which is as ugly a thing as can be
in any Man's Geniture) a professed
Adversary of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and all its Corruptions. Thus, but
more grievously, he should smart
for writing against dear <hi>Vrania,</hi>
for daring to insert his Confutation
of Judiciary Astrology into the
<hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> and for Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it lately by it self. But look
you now, because <hi>Vincent Wing</hi>
published a piece against <hi>Gassendus,</hi>
(wherein this excellent Person's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against Astrology are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be answered)<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and was
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58008:141"/>
himself a <hi>Well-willer</hi> and <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Philomathemat.</hi> his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath all things good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in it. But then again he tells
us that <hi>William Lilly,</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
though Fellow Astrologer, had
the Moon in <hi>Pisces,</hi> a <hi>Wet</hi> and
<hi>Drinking Sign,</hi> which made him a
piece of a Good Fellow. But I am
weary of such light and ludicrous
Stuff, and have more serious and
weighty matter to set before the
Reader. Onely from this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that Astrological Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Genethliacal Judgments are
oftentimes the products of a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and fancifull, and (as you see
here) of a spightfull and malitious
Brain. And for this Reason, as
well as some Others, (particularly
because these Men have undertaken
to calculate the <hi>Nativity</hi> of <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi>
as well as of <hi>Humane Bodies,</hi>
of <hi>hard Stones</hi> no less than of <hi>soft
Flesh,</hi>) the most Learned and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Astrologers have not assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58008:141"/>
the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in other things they have
defended Astrological Judgments.</p>
            <p>Thus I have searched into those
feigned Hypothese and fallacious
Principles on which a great part of
Judiciary Astrology is founded.
And though I do not think the
Whole Art is rendred altogether
vain and useless by them, yet I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
my self that there can be no <hi>true
Predictions</hi> from any thing that is
<hi>false in any Art:</hi> and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Common Astrologers ought
not to be confident of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
and those that consult them
may justly suspect their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, These Pretenders to
Astrology go beyond the wisest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
and Founders of their Art:
they exceed the limits of their Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the Sentence is passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them by their own Judges.
I will name onely two of them,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58008:142"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:58008:142"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:58008:143"/>
but they are the chiefest, and of
the greatest Renown.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the Prince
of Astrology, whose first and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Aphorism is this,<note place="margin">Ptolem. <hi>Centiloq. Aph.</hi> 1.</note> That generals
onely can be foretold by this Art,
and that those alone who are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired are able to predict
particular Events. An Astrologer
may tell the Propension and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a Man from his Natural
Temperament, and this from the
Stars; but he cannot from that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Inclination tell what determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Effects will ensue. He ought
to content himself with a general
Judgment, and not to be definitive
in special Cases, in particular and
individual Accidents. This is the
Decision of the great Father of
Astrologers. What then becomes
of their <hi>Horary Questions,</hi> which
descend even to the most particular
and Personal Affairs? What Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is to be expected of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
about the Marriage of such an
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58008:143"/>
individual Couple, the particular
Events of this Seaman's Voyage,
that Counsellor's Cause, this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's
Adventure, that Soldier's
Engagement, the time of the Death
of any of these, and (rather than
they will stand out) the retrieving
of any Neighbour's Silver Spoon
lost or stollen?</p>
            <p>Again, it is confessed by the same
Master and Dictatour of Astrology,
that the Influence of the Stars is
not Necessary and Unavoidable,
but may be evaded by Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and Care.<note place="margin">Centiloq. ibid.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
A wise man (saith he) is able
to avert the Effects of the Stars
when he knoweth the Nature of
them: and he adjoineth <hi>Socrates</hi> as
an Example of this, who, when an
Astrologer had told him his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inclinations, confessed them
true, but these (saith he) are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by Prudence and vertuous
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58008:144"/>
Endeavours; my Soul hath got the
Mastery of my Body, Philosophy
and Moral Discipline have corrected
my Natural Propensions. A wise
Man hath Dominion over the Stars,
he subdueth those Motions which
come to him from thence, and they
are Fools onely who are led by
them.</p>
            <p>The second great Judge and Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
of this Art, is that noted Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>Iunctinus,</hi> an Authour that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary
Astrologers deal very much
in, and therefore I will alledge four
or five set Determinations of his,
wherein the vanity and (I may say)
Nullity of the common and Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
way of Astrologizing are
discovered and condemned. And
what he saith is the more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because I take it out of that
Treatise which is intituled, <hi>The
Defence of Astrologers. Those Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi>
(saith he there) <hi>who will needs
know and predict all kinds of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are Fools.</hi> And in the same
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58008:144"/>
place, <hi>An Astrologer can tell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
certainly as to such things as
concern Man's Will.</hi> This is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
by him. Excellently again
in the same Treatise, <hi>The Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Stars are not like the
Commands and Edicts of Praetors,
(i. e.</hi> necessary and indispensable,)
<hi>but are in Subjection to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Will of God.</hi> And what
the Sense of all sober Astrologers
is, we may learn from those words
of his, <hi>viz.</hi> Astrologers do not hold
that the Heavens are wholly and
altogether the Cause of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
or Misfortunes, but that they
act onely according to the Subject
Matter, which accordingly as it is
disposed, doth more or less receive
the Celestial Influence.</p>
            <p>It might be added that <hi>Iunctinus</hi>
ingenuously confesseth, That the
Wonders and Miracles of the Old
and new Testament, being works
brought to pass by God himself,
and not depending on second Causes,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58008:145"/>
cannot be foretold by Astrology.
This is the sense of the two great
Dictatours of Judiciary Astrology,
and all the sober of that Study ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in it. Thus though the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Rabbies (several of whom
were notable Students and Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
in Astrology, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> in
particular, the greatest Divine and
Astrologer the Jews ever had,) say
Proverbially, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> All
things depend on the Stars, yet it
is plain that they do not think
their Influence is necessary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
and such as carrieth force
and constraint along with it; for
none are more for Free-Will than
the Rabbies and the Jewish Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.
And <hi>this Adage</hi> of theirs
may be qualified with that <hi>other</hi>
which they make use of, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Stars neither make a Man poor nor
rich;<note place="margin">Alchish <hi>in 1. c.</hi> Job.</note> and with that <hi>known one</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
No Star shines with an evil Aspect
upon <hi>Israel,</hi> the felicity or infelicity
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58008:145"/>
of the Pious depend not on the Host
of Heaven. Those that are good
need not dread being Planet-struck.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Proof of the Uncertainty and
Vanity of Astrological Judgments
than this, That those Men who
profess to tell others what shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to them even in relation to
their secretest and most concealed
affairs, yet in the mean time know
not what shall befall themselves,
and are ignorant about their own
concerns. These bold Diviners have
not so much skill as to reade the
Destiny of their own Families, and
yet they will undertake to tell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whether they shall be rich or
poor, whether they shall be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd
or no. Whilst they soar alott,
and with a <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> pronounce
the fate of Kingdoms, they are blind
about their own little Affairs, of
which without doubt they might
have a better insight, than of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58008:146"/>
Intrigues that relate to the Publick;
for it is far easier to dive into their
own private Fortunes at home,
than those which relate to Princes
and States, and great Communities.
I may take leave then to collect,
that those who cannot foresee the
Evils which may befall themselves,
are unable to foretell contingent
Events to others. And this is the
Case of the Men I am speaking of,
and it appears from thence how
groundless their Predictions are.
Even the great <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who
had throughly studied this part of
Astrology, and in the very time
of War and Business, used to set
some hours apart for it, as he is

            <p>I Answer, That these Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were extraordinarily inspired
by God for the good of the World,
and the great purpose of Religion
in it. It was in order to this that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58008:147"/>
they were enabled to foretell Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities:
still they were like other
Men, as to their own private no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of things. But these Men who
started the Objection, pretend not
to be extraordinarily assisted, they
proceed according to their <hi>Art:</hi>
and if so, <hi>This</hi> would direct them
as certainly to a knowledge of their
own Affairs, as to that of others,
nay more certainly.</p>
            <p>Many other things might be
heaped up together, to evince the
Uncertainty of the Vulgar Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostications
of Astrologers, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if we consult several of
them, we shall be sure to hear our
Doom in a different, nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
manner: That those Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
who are subject to a bad Fate
(though their Skill may be good)
are apt to err in their Judgments:
(It is one of the Astrological Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms
in <hi>Gadbury:</hi> A ticklish busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
indeed! We had need first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
Mr. Astrologer's Nativity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58008:147"/>
we desire him to search into
our own:) That this sort of Men
generally are made up of vain Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and their Art is calculated
for Pride and Ostentation. Any
one that readeth <hi>Cardan,</hi> who was
the chiefest of their Order, will
find that he vaunted of more than
he did, or ever could doe. But it
happened that the Lies he telleth
in one place are confuted by him
(having forgotten them) in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as concerning several Cures
of Diseases, his Familiar Spirit, and
Astrological Achievements. And
This is the fault of all the Tribe, I
mean of those who are guilty of
Abusing the Astrological Science,
and there cannot be a greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of their Folly and Vanity.</p>

One of them especially, and he of as
great Learning as any, and (which
is yet more) who in his Youth
had been of the Tribe of Diviners
and Astrologers, being at length
converted took occasion often in
his Writings to condemn the Folly
and Impiety of their Practices;
though he was still willing to give
Astrology its due, as when he said,
<hi>In illa perspicuitate corporum Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium
non omnes omnino motus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
latere:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

what I have asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> That it
is possible to arrive to a Notice of
some Motions and Inclinations of
the Mind from the Astral Influences
on the Body. And thus it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that the indirect and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
course of Divining by the
Heavenly Bodies was disallowed by
the <hi>Church,</hi> forbid by <hi>Councils</hi> and
<hi>Synods,</hi> punished by the <hi>Imperial
Constitutions,</hi> confuted by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst
and most pious <hi>Fathers,</hi> it
being an impious and foolish Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58008:149"/>
directly against the Doctrine
of Divine Providence, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Christian Faith; it being
the Mother of Superstition, the
guide to distrusting in God, and in
some to downright Atheism. Nay,
<hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> hath shewed in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Citations, that even the great
Philosophers and Wits among the
<hi>Pagans</hi> despised the Follies of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
and Prediction from the Stars.
It is the joint Testimony of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<note place="margin">Liv. Tacitus. Valer. M. Dio.</note>
that the <hi>Mathematici</hi> were
often expelled the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>

If my business lay in this sort of
Studies, I would present the Reader
with the excellent Sense of those
Authours who have with equal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
and Acuteness, encountred
this Imposture. Such were <hi>Sextus

making an ingenious speech

and set before you the summ
of their several Topicks, but that it
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58008:150"/>
would seem to savour something of
the vanity of those I am confuting,
who are wont to boast of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
great Names and numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
But waving these, let it
satisfie the Religious Enquirer, that
the Astral Influences, in that Sense
which I have explained them, are
disallowed by the Infallible Test of
all verity, the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
When the Divine Law saith, <hi>There

Deut. 18. 10. the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
foretelling by the Stars is here
forbid among other ways of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And to this Prohibition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may allude that Jewish Saying,
(though I know it admits of another
sense) <hi>The Law is not found among
Astrologers and Genethliacks.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sepher. Hammus.</note> This

Abominations of the Gentiles in

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58008:150"/>
Where the Israelites who were short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be Captives among the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
are forbid, not onely to learn
their Idolatrous Astrology, and
worshipping the Heavenly Host,
but even to attend to their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by those ordinary Stars,
which being natural and usual can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ominous. This likewise is
condemned in <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 11, 12, 13.
where, after God by the Prophet
had told the Chaldeans (who were
hugely addicted to Astrology, and
first brought in the abuse of it) that
<hi>Evil should come upon them, and they
should not know from whence it riseth,</hi>
(whereas they pretended to spy
the Cause of all Events in the Stars)
<hi>and mischief should fall upon them,
and they should not be able to put it off:</hi>
(whereas the guise of the great Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazers
was to flatter those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
them with Promises and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of happy Occurrences) in an
Ironical and upbraiding manner he
addeth, <hi>Let now the Astrologers and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58008:151"/>
Star-gazers and monthly Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catours,
stand up and save thee from
these things that shall come upon thee.</hi>
In which bitter Sarcasm that Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
which ascribes all to the Stars
is exploded, and their folly is laid
open who trust not in God, but in
the Heavenly Bodies, or rather in
those who pretend to know by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
them when Kingdoms shall
be saved or destroyed.</p>
            <p>And thus I have largely set down
the <hi>true Vse</hi> of the Heavenly Bodies,
and also the too frequent <hi>Abuse</hi> of
the Knowledge of them. I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
rightly to state the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and to distinguish between
Art and Imposture, between True
Knowledge and Vain Pretences. And
if this were impartially done in all
Sciences, we should see an unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
advancement of all sorts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and Truth would have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable
Dominion in the World.
I have made it my business to <hi>fix
the true Limits and Boundaries of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58008:151"/>
Astrology</hi> (a thing which I saw was
very much neglected.) It hath also
offended me to see how some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
treat all the <hi>Sons of Vrania</hi> with
Contempt and Derision, and affect
jeering rather than arguing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have been carefull to carry
my self inoffensibly as to this. It
becomes sober persons to dispute
with Civility. It is best to confute
an Opinion without railing at them
that hold it. In short, I have been
so just and equal as to give Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
its due, and no more. It was
truly said by an observing Person,
<hi>Est Astronomiae nobilis &amp; gloriosa
Scientia,<note place="margin">

of the Stars is a noble and glorious
Science, if it keepeth its Retainers
within the bounds of Moderation;
but if it once leaps over those, and
runs into Vanity and Extravagancy,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58008:152"/>
it is no longer a part of Philosophy
but becomes a wicked Engine to
entrap Mankind. Here is the right
and the wrong side of the Art. Take
it in the former representation, and
it is worthy of our Thoughts and
Studies, as without doubt it was
of those who lived in the first and
best Times. It is not improbable
that <hi>Adam</hi> delivered it to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

And the <hi>Iewish Historian</hi> in
his <hi>Antiquities</hi> before quoted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteth
us that <hi>Abraham</hi> was
skilled in this Art, and was the first
that taught it to the Egyptians,<note place="margin">Joseph. <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 1. C. 9.</note> a
People rude and unlearned in that
and all Sciences, till he came among
them. This was the good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the natural and usefull Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
but it was soon abused and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58008:152"/>
corrupted, as Philosophy, Natural
Magick, and other Studies were.
The Devil at last stept in, and with
Superstition and Lies depraved the
Practice of it. And now many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to doe that by this Art which
it is utterly impossible to doe, either
by it, or any other. Especially the
Masters of Genethliacal Predictions
are rash and daring, and deliver
things false and absurd, having no
ground for their Principles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.
How often do these <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chocabs,</hi>
Sons of the Stars, prove
<hi>Barcoziba's,</hi> Sons of a Lye and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture?
How frequently do those
ignorant or inconsiderable People
who consult them, those who affect
to have their Purses emptied, so
their Heads may be filled with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Fancies, how frequently are
they heard to complain of these
cheating Oracles? Nor do I speak
this to disparage and blacken the
whole Science, for I know it is usual
with the Professours of an Art to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58008:153"/>
it farther than is fitting and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
The common Astrologers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
more than they know they
can give a fair account of: and they
are not the onely People that doe so.
Some Physicians and Lawyers will
put their Patients and Clients on
mad Adventures, and some that
pretend to Divinity will assert any
thing. It is unreasonable therefore
to condemn all, because Frauds and
Cheats may be espied in some. If
some Astrologers attribute more to
the Art than they should, that is no
disparagement to the Art it self. The
abuse of the Doctrine of the Stars
must not make us discard the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Though most of Judiciary
Astrology be vain, yet all may not
be so. Though I have offered Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which are able to diminish
Mens fond Opinions of that Study,
and to take off the certainty which
some pretend to in their Astrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Judgments, nay, though all the
Rules and Aphorisms of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58008:153"/>
the rest of the Astrologers were vain
and false, yet there may be some
Divination from the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that innocent and lawfull;
but this is such a one as is not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to Man's free acting: it doth
no more impair the liberty of Mens
Actions than the Prophecies in the
Old Testament of future things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed
the freedom of those who
were to act afterwards according to
those unerring Predictions. And
this I will add, that if God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Concourse are reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Man's free Actions, so may
the Influence of the Stars be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
If the <hi>Abuse</hi> then of Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
be taken away, and it keepeth
it self within its due Limits (which
I have set down) it may be made
serviceable to good and lawfull ends,
and may justly be recommended to
the World as the choicest Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of all Natural Philosophy.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer on this
Theme, because the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:58008:154"/>
of it is necessary, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for settling our Minds and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
about so celebrated a Problem
as this is, but principally for the full
and complete answering of the <hi>Last
Objection</hi> which was levelled against
the foregoing Discourse. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to shew the true difference
between the <hi>Ordinary Luminaries of
Heaven,</hi> and <hi>those Strange and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
Lamps</hi> which are lighted and
set up there sometimes, and to make
it evident, that the Prognosticks
which are made from the Aspects
and Configurations of the Stars, are
nothing allied to those which are
made from the Appearance of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.
In defiance then of all Cavils
and Objections, our Assertion stands
unshaken and immoveable, That
these rare and amazing Sights in the
Heavens portend some strange and
unusual thing to the Inhabitants of
the Earth. A Comet is the <hi>Prodro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
of some notable Calamity, and
is sent on purpose to give notice and
warning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:58008:154"/>
Take then the Conclusion of all
(which will chiefly relate to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Condition and Circumstances
in this Nation) in these following
Particulars,</p>
            <p>1. Let us remember that we have
felt the Effects of Comets, and upon
that Consideration let us not be
tempted to dis-believe what hath
been suggested in this Discourse. It
hath been proved to us experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
that Comets are denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God's Anger, and that the
Products of these Apparitions are
direfull and fatal, if <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
if <hi>bloudy Conspiracies</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine
Divisions</hi> and <hi>Separations</hi> be
any proofs. We have found that
these Monitors have not been sent
in vain, that they were no <hi>Bruta
Fulmina,</hi> no idle and insignificant
Flashes, but that they have really
done Execution. And if we are not
convinced of this, but still remain
incredulous and senseless, the wife
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58008:155"/>
Disposer of all things may hereafter
multiply these Prodigies, and cause
two or more of them to appear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
on purpose to upbraid our
incredulity and unbelief, and to
force our assent for the future.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoteles
tradit &amp; simul plures</hi> (<hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>)
<hi>cerni: nemini compertum alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
quod equidem sciam.</hi> Though a
certain Philosopher reporteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Comets, that more than
one of them have been seen at a
time, yet I cannot find (saith the
Natural Historian, who had made
a Collection out of all Histories that
were extant) that any one hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
this besides himself. But who
knoweth but that we (who boggle
at this Doctrine) may see a <hi>pair</hi> of
them <hi>at once,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream
(which was the Sign and Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a great Calamity that was to
ensue) was <hi>doubled,</hi> to render the
belief of the thing more firm and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?
I do the rather think this not
to be improbable, because both our
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58008:155"/>
               <hi>Sins</hi> and our <hi>Insensibleness</hi> exceed
those of former Ages, and therefore
the Divine Hand may shew that to
us which was never known before.</p>
            <p>2. Although we do not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
feel the sensible Effects of the
Comets which appeared last, yet
we have no Reason to be confident
that we shall not experience any.
The God we have to doe with is
long-suffering and slow to Wrath:
He threatneth before he striketh. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
a Comet may not visibly and
apparently opperate for a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time. The Evil which a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
portendeth seizeth oftentimes
by Degrees. It is a great mistake
to imagin that it shall Never come
because it hath not visited us alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Or, the Fatal Season of its
Operating may be just Entring,
but not yet Accomplished; as <hi>Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi>
replied to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who
merrily said the Ides of <hi>March</hi> were
<hi>Come,</hi> that they were not <hi>yet Past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:58008:156"/>
3. When I speak of black Events
which are the Consequents of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
it is to be known that it is
intolerable Folly and Presumption
to <hi>Determine peremptorily what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ones</hi> they shall be. Many
have Fondly and Rashly set down
before hand the <hi>Particular Events</hi>
of such and such Comets, but they
have thereby rendred themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the Censure of all sober
Persons. Strange Vicissitudes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
Perils and Mischiefs are
the Attendants of these Dreadfull
Spectacles, but it surpasseth all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Knowledge to define Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and absolutely of what Kind
they shall be. Great Distresses for
Mens Sins and Miscarriages are
threatned, but we know not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whether Pestilence, or War, or
Famine, or Which of the many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Judgments is to be Our Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All Comets are not Alike,
but of Different, and it may be
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58008:156"/>
Contrary Qualities, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Effects are so too. And though
one Comet may seem to be of the
same Nature with another as to Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Colour, Motion and Duration,
yet it may be very unlike in Figure,
Place, Time, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
And perhaps there never
were any two Comets of a like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as to all things. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no judging of the particular Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this or that Comet, because
we saw such Events follow another
of that likeness. Indeed by our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to specifie directly before
hand the individual Evils that shall
come, we are so far from making a
good use of these Signs from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that we rather provoke the
Divine Anger by our being so da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and presumptuous. Onely this
may be done by us; we may <hi>with
modesty guess</hi> (but go no farther)
that God will trie us with <hi>those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
which we have not very lately
experienced and groaned under,</hi> and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58008:157"/>
this not onely that we may feel <hi>all
kinds of Scourges</hi> for our Offences,
but that our <hi>new and unheard of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries</hi>
may be punished with
<hi>fresh Calamities.</hi> We may (without
limiting and confining God's Hand)
expect Famine and Scarcity after so
great Plenty, nay, not onely a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of Bread,</hi> but <hi>of hearing the
Word of the Lord.</hi> We may look for
<hi>Invasion from abroad,</hi> when we are
so <hi>divided and distracted at home,</hi>
and that under so Gracious a Prince.
And truly <hi>this</hi> seemeth to be the
<hi>Vniversal and Epidemick Plague</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for all <hi>Christendom.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan
Crescent</hi> may in time <hi>grow
to the Full.</hi> The <hi>Turkish Cymetar,</hi>
though often <hi>Blunted,</hi> may be so
<hi>Edged</hi> once and again, as at last to
doe <hi>fatal Execution</hi> over all those
spatious Territories where Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
is professed, and (which I am
loth to add) where the Professours
of it dishonour the Religion it self
by their Lives. To be brief, the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58008:157"/>
Age we live in hath been already
an Age of great and wonderfull Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
and we may expect that
the remainder of it will produce
great and tremendous Changes to
the World: so that if <hi>Diogenes</hi> were
alive, he might now more eagerly
desire than once he did to be buried
with his Face downward, and that
for the same Reason which he then
gave, <hi>viz.</hi> Because the World would
in a short time be turned upside
down. But lest I should be mistaken,
and some should think I am <hi>Positive</hi>
and <hi>Definitive</hi> in what I say,</p>
            <p>4. That which I have asserted
before must be called to mind here
in the close of all, <hi>viz.</hi> That though
Comets are <hi>certain Signs</hi> of God's
Displeasure, yet they are not <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Causes</hi> of the Evils they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
Our Doom, I hope, is not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reversible.
Nay, it is certain that
He who sheweth us the Tokens of
his Anger, can divert it when He
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58008:158"/>
pleaseth. How glad should I be if
all the Intimations I have given of
approaching Evils should be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted!
I shall not, like <hi>Ionas,</hi> be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
because <hi>Nineveh</hi> is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If all that hath been said
amounts not to a Demonstration,
(as I do not pretend it doth, and
above half the Subjects that are
treated of in the World, and that
have evident Truth on their sides,
never reached to <hi>That:</hi> If I have
not demonstrated) that Comets are
Signs of impendent Evils, yet this
ought to be remembred, that no
Man can be certain that they <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Nothing,</hi> and that they stand for
Cyphers in the Heavens. The rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
Determiners have not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it is impossible they should
be forerunners of Calamities, and
Messengers of Divine Vengeance.
Now if they prove to be so (as the
abundant Reasons and Arguments
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58008:158"/>
above produced solicite us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
it will be a heinous Offence
if we take no notice of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it will be best for us to look
upon them as <hi>such,</hi> and then, if we
are mistaken, it will be on the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
side,</hi> and we shall err with the
wisest and soberest Persons. At
least it becometh us to <hi>suspend our
Iudgments</hi> in a <hi>dubious Case.</hi> It is
inconsistent with the Wisedom and
Piety of a Christian Philosopher
peremptorily to deny what hath
some shew of Probability. Much
less will it become him to <hi>make a
Mock</hi> of that which may be a <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Truth,</hi> and the greatest Reality
in the World: as <hi>Vespasian</hi> (they
say) made himself merry with a
Comet that appeared in his days?
for being told by one that it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Ill to him, he jestingly said,
that that Star with long Hair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the <hi>Kings of</hi> Persia, <hi>who
wore long shaggy Hair,</hi> and not
<hi>Bald Emperours,</hi> such as he was.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58008:159"/>
Which is thus expressed by an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Xiphilinus Aurel.</hi> Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Although <hi>Dio</hi> relateth that
he spoke it of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Parthia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in</hi> Vespas. c. 23.</note>
yet it is most probable that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on the <hi>Persians,</hi> who were
known by their long Hair, and
thence were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by the
Father of History.<note place="margin">Herodot. l. 6. c. 19.</note> Far be it from
us, who are a Civilized People,
and (which is yet higher) a Nation
professing Christianity to jest with
Heaven, and exercise our Drolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on those rare and stupendious
Appearances which we have so
great Reason to be persuaded are
the <hi>Almighty's Messengers,</hi> a sort
of <hi>mute Prophets</hi> sent to instruct us
in our Duty, and to be forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to us of the Wrath to come.
Let us rather be directed by these
Heavenly Signs, as the <hi>Magi</hi> were
of old by an unusual Star that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to them, to seek our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58008:159"/>
Let us <hi>prepare</hi> for God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life, and by these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Preparatives let us endeavour,
if it be possible, to <hi>prevent</hi> them.
Let us abandon those <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi>
which we may justly believe are
pointed at by these Signs from
Heaven. <hi>Those, those</hi> are the <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Prodigies</hi> which threaten <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi>
at this day. Those are as
Ominous and Presaging as all the
Glaring Comets that have shaked
their fiery Trains over our Heads.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, as we are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
that God's Judgments may be
averted, and his Blessings conferred
upon us, as we are willing that
<hi>Christianity</hi> should thrive and get
ground in the World, as we ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Well-fare of the <hi>Church,</hi>
which is the Pillar and Ground of
Truth, as we hope to have the
<hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest Religion</hi> (derived
from Christ and his Apostles) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
amongst us to all succeeding
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58008:160"/>
Generations, and as we wish well
to our <hi>Countrey,</hi> the most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Happy Region under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
let us break off our Sins by
Repentance, and a speedy Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our Manners; which
was the principal thing <hi>Designed,</hi>
and I hope will partly be <hi>Effected</hi>
by this Discourse.</p>
