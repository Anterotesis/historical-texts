            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

them that hate peace, and breath out slaughters,

those foure generations of the last times, <hi>Prov.

the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 3. that men will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
sound doctrine;</hi> enquire out of these two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106425:5"/>
and the Epistle to the Romans, and wee
shall find what sound doctrine is. First, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of prayer for Kings, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1. I exhort first
of all that prayers be made for Kings,</hi> but certaine
Brownists of these times will not pray for the
King, but revile him in their prayers. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the doctrine against<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 12.</note> Women Preachers, I
suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurpe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but saith <hi>Isay,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Isay 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Women rule over you.</hi>
Thirdly, the doctrine of obedience to<note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
but now Servants run away from their
Masters without their consent, and rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them in the publick cause; doe these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
sound doctrine?<note place="margin">Rom 1.</note> Fourthly, the doctrine of
justification by faith, which Pelagians of old,
and the Papists now deny. Fifthly, sanctification,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. which Gnostikes and Nicolaitans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
now Familists and Antinomians deny.
Sixthly, the doctrine of predestination without
foresight, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. which Papists and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
oppose. Seventhly, the doctrine of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Kings, though they be Heathens and
Tyrants, which<note n="d" place="margin">Epiphan.</note> Gnostikes of old, and now Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
and Brownists oppose, they can live
without a King, though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.
13. 1. Let every soule be subject,</hi> but these men
thinke they have no soules, because they would
have no King in <hi>Israel, that they may do that which
is right in their owne eyes, Iudges 21. ult.</hi> The
Christians of <hi>Rome</hi> paid tribute and custome to
<hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> Tyrants, but these rob the King
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106425:5"/>
of his due, and yet they say <hi>pro Rege;</hi> they say
Kings of old were anoynted, therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was subject as to Gods ordinance, but now it
is not so: To which I answer<note n="e" place="margin">R. David. Kimchi.</note> with the Jew, no
King the sonne of a King was anoynted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in case of division about the right, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
when <hi>Adoniah</hi> would be King, but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
came by succession, as every mans inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
descends from his fathers. Againe they say,
The Kings of <hi>Jury</hi> made no such covenant as our
Kings do; I answer with the same Jew, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
appears in the example of <hi>Ioash</hi> and <hi>Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
who made a covenant betweene the King and
the people, and though <hi>Ioash</hi> were an Apostate
and a Tyrant, yet the Traitours and murderers of
the King were cut off by his sonne that reigned
after him; the King and Kings sonne will never
forget to punish Traytours, as appeares in the
example of <hi>David</hi>

he would, but could not punish these two great

lastly, they are too hasty in their hostility; have
they not read that Israel<note n="f" place="margin">Iudges 20.</note> lost forty thousand in
