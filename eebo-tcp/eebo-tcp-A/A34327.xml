            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable RALPH Earl of <hi>MOUNTAGUE,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>My LORD,</p>
            <p>WHether the World will arraign me of Vanity, or not, that I have presum'd to Dedicate this Comedy to your Lordship, I am yet in doubt: Tho' it may be it is some degree of Vanity even to doubt of it. One who has at any time had the Honour of your Lordship's Conversation, cannot be suppos'd to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to your Perusal: Yet it were to incur the Imputation of too much Sufficiency, to pretend to such a Merit as might abide the Test of your Lordship's Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52714:4"/>
Whatever Value may be wanting to this Play while yet it is mine, will be sufficiently made up to it, when it is once become your Lordship's; and it is my Security, that I cannot have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it more by my Dedication, than your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship will dignifie it by your Patronage.</p>
            <p>That it succeeded on the Stage, was almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Expectation; for but little of it was prepar'd for that general Taste which seems now to be predominant in the Pallats of our Audience.</p>
            <p>Those Characters which are meant to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous in most of our Comedies, are of Fools so gross, that in my humble Opinion, they should rather disturb than divert the well-natur'd and reflecting part of an Audience; they are rather Objects of Charity than Contempt; and instead of moving our Mirth, they ought very often to excite our Compassion.</p>
            <p>This Reflection mov'd me to design some Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which should appear ridiculous not so much thro' a natural Folly (which is incorrigible, and therefore not proper for the Stage) as thro' an affected Wit; a Wit, which at the same time that it is affected, is also false. As there is some Difficulty in the formation of a Character of this Nature, so there is some Hazard which attends the progress of its Success, upon the Stage: For many come to a Play, so over-charg'd with Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism, that they very often let fly their Censure, when through their rashness they have mistaken
<pb facs="tcp:52714:4"/>
their Aim. This I had occasion lately to observe: For this Play had been Acted two or three Days, before some of these hasty Judges cou'd find the leisure to distinguish betwixt the Character of a <hi>Witwoud</hi> and a <hi>Truewit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must beg your Lordship's Pardon for this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression from the true Course of this Epistle; but that it may not seem altogether impertinent, I beg, that I may plead the occasion of it, in part of that Excuse of which I stand in need, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending this Comedy to your Protection. It is only by the Countenance of your Lordship, and the <hi>Few</hi> so qualified, that such who write with Care and Pains can hope to be distinguish'd: For the Prostituted Name of <hi>Poet</hi> promiscuously levels all that bear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Terence,</hi> the most correct Writer in the World, had a <hi>Scipio</hi> and a <hi>Lelius</hi> if not to assist him, at least to support him in his Reputation: And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his extraordinary Merit, it may be, their Countenance was not more than necessary.</p>
            <p>The Purity of his Stile, the Delicacy of his Turns, and the Justness of his Characters, were all of them Beauties, which the greater part of his Audience were incapable of Tasting: Some of the coursest Strokes of <hi>Plautus,</hi> so severely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by <hi>Horace,</hi> were more likely to affect the Multitude; such, who come with expectation to Laugh out the last Act of a Play, and are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertained with two or three unseasonable
<pb facs="tcp:52714:5"/>
Jests, than with the artful Solution of the <hi>Fable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Terence</hi> excell'd in his Performances, so had he great Advantages to encourage his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; for he built most on the Foundations of <hi>Menander:</hi> His Plots were generally modell'd, and his Characters ready drawn to his Hand. He, copied <hi>Menander;</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi> had no less Light in the Formation of his Characters, from the Observations of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> of whom he was a Disciple; and <hi>Theopbrastus</hi> it is known was not only the Disciple, but the immediate Successor of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the first and greatest Judge of Poetry. These were great Models to design by; and the further Advantage which <hi>Terence</hi> possess'd, towards giving his Plays the due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Purity of Stile, and Justness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, was not less considerable, from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conversation, which was permitted him with <hi>Lelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> two of the greatest and most polite Men of his Age. And indeed, the Privilege of such a Conversation, is the only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Means of attaining to the Perfection of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
            <p>If it has hapned in any part of this Comedy, that I have gain'd a Turn of Stile, or Expression more Correct, or at least more Corrigible than in those which I have formerly written, I must, with equal Pride and Gratitude, ascribe it to the Honour of your Lordship's admitting me into
<pb facs="tcp:52714:5"/>
your Conversation, and that of a Society where every-body else was so well worthy of you, in your Retirement last Summer from the Town: For it was immediately after, that this Comedy was written. If I have fail'd in my Performance, it is only to be regretted, where there were so many, not inferiour either to a <hi>Scipio</hi> or a <hi>Lelius,</hi> that there should be one wanting equal to the Capacity of a <hi>Terence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I am not mistaken, Poetry is almost the only Art, which has not yet laid claim to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Patronage. Architecture, and Painting, to the great Honour of our Country, have flourish'd under your Influence and Protection. In the mean time, Poetry, the eldest Sister of all Arts, and Parent of most, seems to have resign'd her Birth-right, by having neglected to pay her Duty to your Lordship; and by permitting others of a later Extraction, to prepossess that Place in your Esteem, to which none can pretend a better Title. Poetry, in its Nature, is sacred to the Good and Great; the relation between them is reciprocal, and they are ever propitious to it. It is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Poetry to address to them, and it is their Prerogative alone to give it Protection.</p>
            <p>This receiv'd Maxim, is a general Apology for all Writers who Confecrate their Labours to great Men: But I could wish at this time, that this Address were exempted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pretence of all Dedications; and that as I
<pb facs="tcp:52714:6"/>
can distinguish your Lordship even among the most Deserving, so this Offering might become remarkable by some particular Instance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, which shou'd assure your Lordship, that I am, with all due Sense of your extream Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Humanity,</p>

            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>OF those few Fools, who with ill Stars are curs'd,</l>
               <l>Sure scribbling Fools, call'd Poets, fare the worst.</l>
               <l>For they're a sort of Fools which <hi>Fortune</hi> makes,</l>
               <l>And after she has made 'em Fools, forsakes.</l>
               <l>With <hi>Nature</hi>'s Oafs 'tis quite a diff'rent Case,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Fortune</hi> favours all her <hi>Idiot-Race:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In her own Nest the <hi>Cuckow-Eggs</hi> we find,</l>
               <l>O'er which she broods to hatch the <hi>Changling-Kind.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No Portion for her own she has to spare,</l>
               <l>So much she doats on her adopted Care.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Poets are Bubbles, by the Town drawn in,</l>
               <l>Suffer'd at first some tristing Stakes to win:</l>
               <l>But what unequal Hazards do they run!</l>
               <l>Each time they write, they venture all they've won:</l>
               <l>The 'Squire that's butter'd still, is sure to be undone.</l>
               <l>This Author, heretofore, has found your Favour,</l>
               <l>But pleads no Merit from his past Behaviour.</l>
               <l>To build on that might prove a vain Presumption,</l>
               <l>Should Grants to Poets made, admit Resumption:</l>
               <l>And in <hi>Parnassus</hi> he must lose his Seat,</l>
               <l>If that be found a forfeited Estate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He owns, with Toil, he wrought the following Scenes,</l>
               <l>But if they're naught ne're spare him for his Pains:</l>
               <l>Damn him the more; have no Commiseration</l>
               <l>For Dulness on mature Deliberation.</l>
               <l>He swears he'll not resent one hiss'd-off Scene,</l>
               <l>Nor, like those peevish Wits, his Play maintain,</l>
               <l>Who, to assert their Sense, your Taste arraign.</l>
               <l>Some Plot we think he has, and some new Thought;</l>
               <l>Some Humour too, no Farce; but that's a Fault.</l>
               <l>Satire, he thinks, you ought not to expect,</l>
               <l>For so Reform'd a Town, who dares Correct?</l>
               <l>To please, this time, has been his sole Pretence,</l>
               <l>He'll not instruct least it should give Offence.</l>
               <l>Should he by chance a Knave or Fool expose,</l>
               <l>That hurts none here, sure here are none of those.</l>
               <l>In short, our Play, shall (with your leave to shew it)</l>
               <l>Give you one Instance of a Passive Poet.</l>

                     <p>Confess, <hi>Millamant</hi> and you quarrell'd last Night, after I left you; my fair Cousin has some Humours, that would tempt the patience of a Stoick. What, some Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb came in, and was well receiv'd by her, while you were by.</p>

                     <p>Yes, and Mrs. <hi>Marwood</hi> and three or four more, whom I never saw before; seeing me, they all put on their grave Faces, whisper'd one another; then complain'd aloud of the Vapours, and after fell into a profound Silence.</p>

                     <p>For which Reason I resolv'd not to stir. At last the good old Lady broke thro' her painful Taciturnity, with an Invective against long Visits. I would not have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood her, but <hi>Millamant</hi> joining in the Argument, I rose and with a constrain'd Smile told her, I thought nothing was so easie as to know when a Visit began to be troublesome; she redned and I withdrew, without expecting her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>

                     <speaker>Fain.</speaker>

                     <p>The discovery of your sham Addresses to her, to conceal your Love to her Niece, has provok'd this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Had you dissembl'd better, Things might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in the state of Nature.</p>

                     <p>I did as much as Man cou'd, with any reasonable Conscience; I proceeded to the very last Act of Flattery with her, and was guilty of a Song in her Commendation: Nay, I got a Friend to put her into a Lampoon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement her with the Imputation of an Affair with a young Fellow, which I carry'd so far, that I told her the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Town took notice that she was grown fat of a suddain; and when she lay in of a Dropsie, persuaded her she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be in Labour. The Devil's in't, if an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to be flatter'd further, unless a Man shou'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour downright personally to debauch her; and that my Virtue forbad me.

I'll tell thee, <hi>Fainall,</hi> she once us'd me with that Insolence, that in Revenge I took her to pieces; sisted her and separated her Failings; I study'd 'em, and got 'em by rote. The Catalogue was so large, that I was not without hopes, one Day or other to hate her heartily: To which end I so us'd my self to think of 'em, that at length, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Design and Expectation, they gave me every Hour less and less disturbance; 'till in a few Days it became habitual to me, to remember 'em without being displeas'd.

While they are Lovers, if they have Fire and Sense, their Jealousies are insupportable: And when they cease to Love, (we ought to think at least) they loath; they look upon us with Horror and Distaste; they meet us like the Ghosts of what we were, and as such fly from us.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. <hi>Mar.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>True, 'tis an unhappy Circumstance of Life, that Love shou'd ever die before us; and that the Man so often shou'd out-live the Lover. But say what you will, 'tis better to be left, than never to have been lov'd. To pass our Youth in dull Indifference, to refuse the Sweets of Life because they once must leave us; is as preposterous, as to wish to have been born Old, because we one Day must be Old. For my part, my Youth may wear and waste, but it shall never rust in my Possession.</p>

                     <l>Then it seems you dissemble an Aversion to</l>
                     <l>Mankind, only in compliance with my Mothers Humour.</l>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Certainly. To be free; I have no Taste of those insipid dry Discourses, with which our Sex of force must entertain themselves, apart from Men. We may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Endearments to each other, profess eternal Friendships, and seem to doat like Lovers; but 'tis not in our Natures long to persevere. Love will resume his Empire in our Breasts, and every Heart, or soon or late, receive and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him as its lawful Tyrant.</p>

                     <p>Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Actions? To save that Idol Reputation. If the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities of our Loves had produc'd that Consequence, of which you were aprehensive, Where could you have fix'd a Father's Name with Credit, but on a Husband? I knew <hi>Fainall</hi> to be a Man lavish of his Morals, an interested and professing Friend, a false and a designing Lover; yet one whose Wit and outward fair Behaviour, have gain'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with the Town, enough to make that Woman stand excus'd, who has suffer'd herself to be won by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses. A better Man ought not to have been sacrific'd to the Occasion; a worse had not answer'd to the Purpose. When you are weary of him, you know your Remedy.</p>

                     <speaker>Mira.</speaker>
                     <p>You wou'd affect a Cruelty which is not in your</p>
                     <l>Nature; your true Vanity is in the power of pleasing.</l>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Milla.</speaker>
                     <p>O I ask your Pardon for that—One's Cruelty is one's Power, and when one parts with one's Cruelty, one parts with one's Power; and when one has parted with that, I fancy one's Old and Ugly.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mira.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, ay, suffer your Cruelty to ruin the object of your Power, to destroy your Lover—And then how vain how lost a Thing you'll be! Nay, 'tis true: You are no longer handsome when you've lost your Lover; your Beauty dies upon the Instant: For Beauty is the Lovers Gift; 'tis he bestows your Charms—Your Glass is all a Cheat. The Ugly and the Old, whom the Looking-glass mortifies, yet after Commendation can be flatter'd by it, and discover Beauties in it: For that reflects our Praises, rather than your Face.</p>

                     <p>O the Vanity of these Men! <hi>Fainall,</hi> dee hear him? If they did not commend us, we were not handsome! Now you must know they could not commend one, if one was not handsome. Beauty the Lover's Gift—Lord, what is a Lover, that it can give? Why one makes Lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as one pleases, and they die as soon as one pleases: And then if one pleases, one makes more.</p>

                     <p>One no more owes one's Beauty to a Lover, than ones Wit to an Eccho: They can but reflect what we look and say; vain empty Things if we are silent or unseen, and want a being.</p>

No, I hope Sir <hi>Rowland</hi> is better bred, than to put a Lady to the necessity of breaking her Forms. I won't be too coy neither.—I won't give him despair—But a little Disdain is not amiss; a little Scorn is alluring.</p>

Weary of her, I am, and shall be—No, there's no end of that; No, no, that were too much to hope. Thus far concerning my repose. Now for my Reputation,—As to my own, I married not for it; so that's out of the Question,—And as to my part in my Wife's—Why she had parted with hers before; so bringing none to me, she can take none from me, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all rule of Play, that I should lose to one, who has not wherewithal to stake.</p>

No Decoy-Duck to wheadle you a <hi>fop—scrambling</hi> to the Play in a Mask—then bring you home in a pretended fright, when you think you shall be found out.—And rail at me for missing the Play, and disappointing the Frolick which you had to pick me up and prove my Constancy.</p>

To which end, together with all Vizards for the day, I prohibit all Masks for the Night, made of oil'd-skins and I know not what—Hog's-bones, Hare's-gall, Pig-water, and the marrow of a roasted Cat. In short, I forbid all Commerce with the Gentlewoman in <hi>what-call-all-it-Court.
