            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AS the worme which in the timber is bred,</l>
               <l>The selfe same timber doth consume and eate:</l>
               <l>And as the moth which is commonly fed,</l>
               <l>In the cloth with her bred, and the same doth frete.</l>
               <l>So many persons are a damage great,</l>
               <l>To their own countrey, which hath them relieued,</l>
               <l>And by them their own countrey ofte times is gréeued.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶So many citties and townes are defamed,</l>
               <l>By reason that some inhabitauntes is ill:</l>
               <l>So that for ones facte, the whole towne is blamed,</l>
               <l>Although the residue to good doe their will.</l>
               <l>Yet the fact of this one, the others good name doth spill,</l>
               <l>And thus a reproch to his own towne ingendreth,</l>
               <l>And the good name of the whole town he hindereth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶To what ende these wordes we haue spoken,</l>
               <l>In our matter shalbe more playnely exprest,</l>
               <l>Which the Tide tarieth no man, to name hath token,</l>
               <l>For that it is moste agréeable and best.</l>
               <l>Because that no man from his pleasure will rest,</l>
               <l>But ech man doth take the time of his gayne,</l>
               <l>Although the same be to others great payne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶For so gréedy is the person auaricious,</l>
               <l>Whome Saint <hi>Austen</hi> doth well liken to hell,</l>
               <l>For that they both are so much insacious,</l>
               <l>That neyther of them know when they are well.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Ambrosius</hi> doth verify and tell,</l>
               <l>How that couetous persons do lack that they haue,</l>
               <l>And therefore not satisfyed till they are in graue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶But where such people are, small loue there doth rest,</l>
               <l>But gréedy desyre supplieth the place:</l>
               <l>The symple ones commonly, by such are opprest,</l>
               <l>For they nothing way, any néedy mans case.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11883:4"/>But with gréedy grype, their gayne they imbrace,</l>
               <l>No kind of degrée that they will forbeare,</l>
               <l>Neyther any time they will let slip or spare.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶And although that here a Courtyer is named,</l>
               <l>Yet thereby is not ment the Courtyer alone:</l>
               <l>But all kindes of persons, who their suites haue framed,</l>
               <l>Or to any such gréedy guttes, haue made their mone.</l>
               <l>Being driuen to their shiftes, to haue ought by lone,</l>
               <l>How gréedinesse at such times, doth get what he can,</l>
               <l>And therefore still cryeth, Tyde tarieth no man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Which prouerbe right well might be applyed,</l>
               <l>To a better sence then it is vsed:</l>
               <l>There is time to aske grace, this may not be denyed,</l>
               <l>Of thy sinfull life so greatly abused.</l>
               <l>Let not that time then be refused,</l>
               <l>For that tyde most certayne will tarry no man,</l>
               <l>Thus taking the prouerbe, we rightly do scan.</l>

               <l>Committing himselfe to your discretions graue,</l>

               <l>I meane a friend, so worthy to trust,</l>

               <l>Where two such neighboures dye out of one towne,</l>
               <l>The Deuill shall be sure, to haue one black Gowne.</l>
               <l>As well he is worthy, if I might be iudge,</l>
               <l>For in their affayres, he dayly doth trudge.</l>

               <l>He teacheth them how, to pill and to poule,</l>

               <l>¶Oh so my hart is filled with doubt,</l>
               <l>Which way I may worke, my worship to win:</l>
               <l>Shall I leaue of Courtyers, so iolly a rout,</l>
               <l>And eke of Ladies a company so trim.</l>
               <l>And shall I home to my cottage rude,</l>
               <l>There to liue like a countrey clowne:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11883:11"/>Truely I know not which way to conclude,</l>

               <l>To win worship I would be right glad,</l>
               <l>Therefore (willing to win worship) is my name:</l>
               <l>In the countrey there is none such to be had,</l>
               <l>And the Court doth aske, great cost for the same.</l>
               <l>So that what I shall doe, I know not yet,</l>
               <l>I consider it is toward a good time:</l>
               <l>Wherein tryumphing is vsed, as is moste fit,</l>
               <l>And where Courtyers must shew themselues, braue and sine.</l>
               <l>But this I conclude, as forced I am,</l>
               <l>The Court for to leaue, and homeward to packe:</l>
               <l>For where is the money? here is the man.</l>

               <l>And how he can encorage, both to good and bad:</l>
               <l>The Marchaunt is incouraged, in gréedinesse to lurke,</l>
               <l>And the Courtyer to win worship, by Corage is glad.</l>
               <l>The one is good, no man will denay,</l>
               <l>I meane corage to win worship and fame:</l>
               <l>So that the other is ill, all men will say,</l>
               <l>That is corage to gréedinesse, which getteth ill name.</l>
               <l>Thus may you sée Corage contagious,</l>
               <l>And eake contrarious, both in me do rest:</l>
               <l>For I of kind, am alwayes various,</l>
               <l>And chaunge, as to my mind séemeth best.</l>
               <l>Betwéene man and wife, sometimes I doe showe,</l>
               <l>Both my kindnesse, when my pleasure it is:</l>
               <l>The goodwife giueth her husband a blow,</l>
               <l>And he for reward, doth giue her a kisse.</l>
               <l>The goodwyfe by Corage, is hardy and stoute,</l>
               <l>The goodman contrary, is pacient and méeke:</l>
               <l>And suffreth himselfe to be called loute,</l>
               <l>Yea, and worse misvsed, thrise in a wéeke.</l>
               <l>How say you good wiues, is it not so?</l>
               <l>I warrant you, not one that can say nay:</l>
               <l>Whereby all men here, may right well know,</l>
               <l>That all this is true which I doe say.</l>
               <l>But yet Corage tels you not all that he knowes,</l>
               <l>For then he must tell, of ech wife the name:</l>
               <l>Which is no greate matter, the best are but shrewes,</l>
               <l>But I will not say so, for feare I haue blame.</l>
