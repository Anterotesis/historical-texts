            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y our four former addresses of the <hi>2</hi> of <hi>November, 13</hi> of <hi>December, 17</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and <hi>2</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> we gave you faithfull accompt of the state of affairs here, as they then stood, and by our last Letter of the <hi>2</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> we informed you of the Commission sent to the Lord Marquesse and others, to meet with the chiefest of the Rebels, and to hear, and receive in writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what they could say or propound; before the coming over of this Commission, many ill Symptomes did appear, but now things are grown to an evident cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: For upon Munday last a Letter was read at the Board, from His Majesty (without any Secretaries name subscribed,) the effect whereof was to this purpose; That His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty took notice, that they, the Lords, Iustices, and Councell, without His consent, or Privity, had admitted us to be present at their debates, and did require them, not to suffer us to be present with them any more, as formerly we had been; The Lords, Iustices, and Councell thereupon resolved to do accordingly; And on Tuesday morning, sent Sir <hi>Paul Davis</hi> to our lodging, to acquaint us both with the Letter, and the resolution they had taken upon it; But because the words of the Message were not full enough, as we conceived, We desired their Lordships to expresse themselves cleerly, whither we should be admitted, or not, For we were but servants to the Parliament, and must give a strict accompt of our Actions to those which sent us thither; Thereupon Sir <hi>Paul Davis</hi> returned to the Board, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their Lordships herewith, And after an hour came to us, with a second Message, which we immediately put down in writing, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Lords, Iustices, and Councell, had formerly acquainted us, by him, with a Letter they had received from His Majesty, That they were resolved to obey His Majesties commands; and therefore they could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us any more to be present as a Committee.</p>
            <p>Sir, you will easily imagine that affairs are steered here by the Court Compasse; and if the design be to make peace with the Rebels, that so this Army may be applicable elsewhere: Our presence any longer at the Board, will not further that design; however, The time we have there spent, and the experience gained by that, will perhaps be serviceable to you at our return, which we now hasten (as becomes us) all we can, And resolve to depart hence this week being retarded only to see the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> in a good Posture for his hop full Expedition, he being resolved to march on Tuesday next. We conceive it very necessary to send a Ship of strength and trust to ride in <hi>Bullock</hi>-Road before <hi>Dublyn,</hi> and another of lesse burthen, to ride before <hi>Drogheda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, We have to the utmost of our weak Abilities, indeavoured to wade through the dangers and difficulties, which on all sides do attend our imployment here; but that which does exceedingly astonish us, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That we have not been honoured with one Letter since our coming over.</p>
            <p>We had almost forgot to tell you, That the labour is on both sides the Sea, to make the Rebels appear strong and considerable, and to put difficulties and impediments upon our Military proceedings, the better to bring on a most horrid pernitious peace, which all good men here do abhorre, and are resolved to abandon the Kingdom, rather then to be exposed to an utter extirpation upon the next opportunity, which those blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Saturday the 28 being come nigh unto <hi>Ballinacur,</hi> being a very strong passe, we found the Enemy poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

That night we lodged at and about <hi>Kilteenan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sunday the 29, marching forwards, 4 of our Horse Scouts espyed 4 Horse Scouts of the Rebells, on the top of a hill before them; who seeing our Scouts, hastning towards them, withstood them, being Country Gentlemen of good quality; and being but 4 to 4, they encountred each other a while fairly, with onely their swords, untill one of the Rebells had both given and received a wound, and was seized on by one of our Scouts; whereat the rest, being very well mounted, escaped away, leaving their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to be slain in the place: And being come nigh <hi>Tobbercormick</hi> (where we lay that night) some of our Horse took a Gentlewoman of some quality prisoner, who stood on a hill there by, guarded with some Muskettiers.</p>
            <p>Munday the 30, being come within 5 miles of <hi>Athlone,</hi> we took one M. <hi>Richard Dillon</hi> prisoner, who informed Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> That Generall <hi>Preston</hi> was sending all

Sir <hi>Richard</hi> then presently commanded forth more of his Horse to hasten to second the fore-Troop, which in that Intrim charged the enemy, who retreated to a Bog, where most of them might have been cut off, had not the care of the Safe-Conduct of the provisions appointed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Athlone</hi> forbidden it.

            <p>Saturday the 4 of <hi>Febr:</hi> we all quartered at and about a place called, The Moat, at which time the 600 of the Lord <hi>Rannelaugh</hi>'s, and Sir <hi>Michael Earnlyes</hi> Regiments were lodged with ours, where Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> found in his Quarters an English mans wife, who told him, that the generall report of the Countrey was, That the Irish had gathered all the Forces they could get together, and were confident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe us in on every side, and to cut us all off, resolving and vowing not to leave a man of us alive: saying also, That if we should get the Victory, the heart of their Wars would be broken, for that there was an ancient Prophesie much talked of among the Irish, That that side which should win the Battell at <hi>Rathconnell,</hi> should be Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Kingdom; it being a Tradition superstitiously held amongst the Native Irish.</p>
            <p>On Munday the 5 and 6, we marched towards <hi>Trym,</hi> meeting with no oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but very foul weather and wayes, which greatly disheartned the Souldiers, and killed divers of them; in which time we took severall of the Countrey people, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Tuesday the 7, proceeding in our March, we understood of divers Troops of Horse and Foot that daily had followed our Rear, which then was guarded by a Troop of Horse commanded by Lievtenant <hi>Hatcher,</hi> who charged certain Forces of the enemy which were advanced somewhat nigh him, and then cut off about twenty of them. Afterwards, about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1 of the clock the same day, being come nigh <hi>Mollingar,</hi> we took a prisoner, who told us that the Irish Forces possest our Passe of <hi>Rathconnell,</hi> a mile before us, being very strong in number of men, and the prime Officers and Gentry of of the Countrey. Whereupon Sir <hi>Richard</hi> hastened the advance of his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the foresaid Passe; and being come nigh in view of it, saw the Passe to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what narrow, and that it was cut off by a broad and deep Trench, being compast in on each side with great Boggs, and having adjoyning to it on a very steep hill a strong Castle, and divers other Works well manned, by which there appeared no passage for
<pb facs="tcp:96966:3"/>
either Horse or Foot: Then did Sir <hi>Richard</hi> draw all his Forces into Battell-Order before it, which consisted of a forlorn hope of 50 Muskettiers, commanded by Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Dikes</hi>; and two Wings of sixty shot more, commanded by two Ensignes (one of them a coward) the forlorn hope being seconded with a Division of 200 Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, which was commanded by Sir <hi>Iohn Sherlocke,</hi> which was the Van-Guard of our little Army; whereof, the first Division was led by Captain <hi>Verncy,</hi> and Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Oliver</hi>; and the second Division of it, by Lievtenant <hi>Williams</hi>; and also the third Division by Major <hi>Morris.</hi> The rest of the Forces consisted of three Divisions of Pikes flanckt with shot, which were for the Battell of the Army, each containing about 300 men; whereof, the first was led by Captain <hi>Honywood</hi>; the second by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sir <hi>Abraham Shipman</hi>; the third by Sir <hi>Michael Earnely</hi>: after which followed another Division of 200 Muskettiers, commanded by Major <hi>Fortescue</hi>; which was for the Rear-Guard; whose Rear was guarded by a forlorn hope of 50 Muskettiers commanded by Likewise those Foot were flanckt with three Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Horse; whereof Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> commanded the Van-Guard; Lievtenant <hi>Rogers</hi> the Battell; and Lievtenant <hi>Hatcher</hi> the Rear-Guard. Likewise before the Van-Guard of the Foot, marched the Lord <hi>Rannelaugh,</hi> leading a Troop of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. Likewise for the forlorn hope of the Rear, Captain <hi>Pate</hi> commanded 40 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners, which were also assisted with 20 Fire-locks: which done, seeing not onely a strong enemy of above 2000 Foot, and six Horse Troops before us, and others at least 600 on our right hand, and 600 more of <hi>Longford</hi> men at a distance on our left hand, upon the Boggs, not farre off, from which were hastning up to second them, as it is said, 800 of the Realies; and then, unknown to us, there was waiting upon our Rear 500 more, which then newly possest <hi>Mollingar,</hi> about half a mile behinde us, to hinder our Retreat. Then, for to begin the Play, the forlorn hope of 50 Shot, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on right towards the Passe, and so likewise did the left Wing of Shot, to flank that, the right Wing staying behinde, contrary to command, whose ground notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was made good by others: Those together being advanced as farre as they could, were seconded by severall Divisions drawn out of the Van-Guard; which also disputing it with the enemy, without any apparent good successe, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was enforced before the front of the rest of the Forces, to say, There was no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now, but we must resolve to tarry it, or die, because he saw great numbers of men approaching towards our right hand, and likewise as many towards our left hand; which if they should come to joyn with those before us, would be too strong for us; therefore now of necessity all must use their best endeavours to force thorow the Passe upon the enemy, and by so doing of it resolutely, there was no doubt of good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: Whereunto all men seemed very willing, and so accordingly the three Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Battell advanced cheerfully, with their Colours flying, to force their way, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> keeping upon reserve 250 Muskettiers; which three last Divisions being come at push of Pike with the Rebells that defended that Passe; and Sir <hi>Michael Earnly</hi> espying the advance of the <hi>Longford</hi> men on our left hand, marched towards them, and then presently received a Charge by the Horse that Captain <hi>Brian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which by our Shot was repulsed, and <hi>Brian</hi> himself shot dead; and that gave a stop to the <hi>Longford</hi> men. In the Interim of this Conflict, many of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from off the Castle were running speedily to charge our right Wing of Shot; which Sir <hi>Richard</hi> repulsed, by sending amongst them more Shot from out of his last reserve: Which sudden fury being stopt, and the service continuing violent on all

sides for two hours time, with a doubtfull successe: Sir <hi>Richard</hi> sent forth all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Foot, to assist those at the Passe; during which Skirmish, Lievtenant <hi>Rogers</hi> did at severall times very earnestly desire Sir <hi>Richard</hi> to give him leave to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to force a way thorow that Passe, with the Horse that he commanded; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to at last Sir <hi>Richard</hi> gave him leave, and wisht him good speed; whereat he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departed, and hasted to finde his way: And being come at the Banck and ditch of the Passe, found no possible means there of getting thorow; whereat Major <hi>Morris</hi> called unto Lievtenant <hi>Rogers,</hi> saying, He had found a place for his Horse to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; then that Troop hasted unto it, which <hi>Edward Roscarrocke</hi> of the said Troop, first rid thorow, the Lievtenant and the rest of the Troop clos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

At the same time Cornet <hi>Dixsay</hi> commanding the forlorn hope, pursued another Horse Troop, killed many of them, and found the dead body of Captain <hi>Bryan,</hi> who was lately fled from Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> Troop; whose head was there cut off, and brought away by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net <hi>Dixsay</hi>; our Foot having been at least two hours before at handy blows, and throwing stones with the enemy, our men with one accord cheerfully came on upon those that manned the Trenches, which made them also resolutely run away: which sudden change drew after them all the rest of Our Forces: and being possest of their works and hill, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> gave charge unto Sir <hi>Iohn Sherlock,</hi> That he with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient speed should draw, and keep together his men in good order upon that ground, and furnish all his men with Munition, while he himself, with the Horse, pursued the <hi>Longford</hi> men flying away; and then presently did Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and Lievtenant <hi>Rogers,</hi> with about 40, or 50 Horse pursue them, wherein it chanced, That Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> with a part of those Horse, taking another way, was guided by Noble Sir <hi>Charles Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
