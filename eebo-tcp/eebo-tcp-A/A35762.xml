            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION OF TANGIER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>TANGIER</hi> or <hi>Tangis,</hi> is one of the greateſt and the very antienteſt City in <hi>Fez.</hi> Great its now; thrice as great, ſay the moſt skilful Surveyors it hath been; ſo antient, that we find it was built by thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> fled from the face of <hi>Joſuah;</hi> there being an Inſcription left, and two Pillars, whereon it is engraven to this purpoſe; <hi>Nos fugimus a facie</hi> Joſuae <hi>praedonis filii Nave:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>We here are the Inhabitants of the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>that fled before the face of</hi> Joſuah <hi>the Son of</hi> Nun.</p>
            <p>We have heard much of <hi>Hercules</hi> his Pillars, but here one of them is to be ſeen, on a Hill within ſeven Miles of the place, as the other is over againſt it in <hi>Spain:</hi> for here <hi>Hercules</hi> is reported to have ſlain the Gyant <hi>Anteus,</hi> that the oftner he fell, the oftner he roſe again, and could never be Conquered as long as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94431:4"/>
he could touch his Mother Earth.</p>
            <p>So conſiderable is this place, that <hi>Claudius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brave <hi>Romans,</hi> drew here many Legions that they loſt before the place; which they at laſt gained, and gave a new Name, <hi>viz.

               </gap>e that devolved the World upon that great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, t is Corner of it returned at once to its old Liberty, and antient Name, that it retains unto this day. When the <hi>Romans</hi> could do no good, the ingenuous <hi>Portuguez</hi> gueſſing there was a ſhorter Cut that way than that which they knew formerly to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and yet that that Cut could not be ſecurely paſſed without an intereſt and hold in that Country; <hi>Vaſquez Gama</hi> attempts the Expedition 1497. and with ſo much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that he found the Streights of <hi>Gibralta,</hi> but lived not either to inſtruct or encourage others to make uſe of, or improve his noble diſcovery. Yet he found the Continent large, the Sea Towns ſtrong, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants numerous; and breaking in to ſome Sea Ports, ſpoyled them until he came to the <hi>Atlantique,</hi> where he dyed.</p>
            <p>None could ſecond him but a Prince, and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Viſco</hi> doth it as far as his Eſtate or Credit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; he conſults the experience of all the Sea Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, ſends for the Aſtronomers and Navigators, peruſeth all the Coſmography that was then in the World; he ſets out, and is toſſed along the waters, until he finds a Promontory, or an Head of Land, hanging out to the Sea; this he called preſently, <hi>The Cape of Good Hope:</hi> yet he fails, at once the Love and Grief of that Coaſt. <hi>Jo.</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> ſeconds <hi>him,</hi> and under the Conduct of <hi>Degola</hi> 1500. gets in to the Princes Iſland, takes <hi>Angola,</hi> I mean the City ſo called, and with the

A <hi>Vaſquez</hi> had the honour to begin this diſcovery, and a <hi>Vaſquez</hi> hath the honour likewiſe to compleat it. He therefore, <hi>Almeda,</hi> and <hi>Albu-quierque,</hi> finding their way <hi>clear</hi> to the Indies, but not <hi>ſafe</hi> through the Streights as long as thoſe Moors Poſſeſſed the <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi> Forts, they deſtroy <hi>Hamar,</hi> ruine <hi>Bazre,</hi> take <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilla,</hi> and after much expence of Bloud and Treaſure under <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> win <hi>Tangier;</hi> hard it was to win this Town which was the very ſtrength of <hi>Fez.</hi> the Miſtreſs of the Sea, the Key of the Inland-Countrey, the Sanctuary of all Male-contents and Enemies.

            <p>Its diſtance from the Streights of <hi>Gibralter</hi> is 30 miles, and from the City of <hi>Fez.</hi> 150. it hath been alwayes a Civill, Famous, and well-peopled Town, and very ſtately and ſumptuouſly built, the Field thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing not very Fertill, or apt for health; howbeit not farr off are certain vallies continually watred with Fountains, which furniſh the ſaid City with all ſorts of Fruits in abundance: without the City alſo grows certain Vines albeit upon a ſandy ſoil.</p>

            <p>Twenty five years before the Portugal King wan this City, he ſent forth an Armada againſt it, hoping that the City being deſtitute of aid, while the King of <hi>Fez.</hi> was in Wars againſt the Rebels of <hi>Mecnaſe,</hi> would ſoon yeild it ſelf; But contrary to the Portugals

            <p>Afterward the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſent a new ſupply, who ſuddenly aſſailing the City in the night, were moſt of them ſlain, and the reſidue enforced to flee; But that which the Portugal King could not bring to paſs with thoſe two Armadas, he atchieved at length (as is aforeſaid) with ſmall Forces, and little diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Theſe things were done in the <hi>Hegeira</hi> 917. which was in the year of our Lord 1508.</p>
            <p>Some 12 miles from <hi>Tangier</hi> was <hi>Caſor</hi> and <hi>Ezzagor,</hi> in an open and pleaſant place, over againſt the Coaſt of <hi>Granada,</hi> but ſurprized by the <hi>Portugez;</hi> And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding many attempts by the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> what with money (which is the firſt offer they alwayes make) and what with men to recover it, it is utterly loſt and ruin'd.</p>
            <p>Within 13 mile of <hi>Tangier</hi> is <hi>Tettuan,</hi> called ſo from <hi>Tet teguin,</hi> or <hi>one Eye,</hi> becauſe of the one Eyed Woman that had the command over it, under the <hi>Goths;</hi> fourſcore and fifteen years.

            <p>Some 40 miles off is <hi>Arzitta</hi> a fair Town, between which and <hi>Tangier</hi> if that correſpondence could be kept which was deſigned by <hi>Pedro Navarro,</hi> the Trade and Government of that place would lye at our mercy, the <hi>Portugals</hi> having ſhewed us an example how we might ſurprize their Forts, as they did that of <hi>Narangia,</hi> by a ſtratagem 1486. take their Iſles, as they did <hi>Getria</hi> with a Fleet 1463. demoliſh their Cities, as they did <hi>Bafra</hi> and <hi>Homari.</hi>

            <p>Round about <hi>Tangier</hi> are the wild but fruitful Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Chebal, Rahina, Beni-how, Beni-Cheſtev,</hi> whither the <hi>Moors</hi> fled and ſeated themſelves ſince the <hi>Portugez</hi> took <hi>Tangia</hi> or <hi>Tangier,</hi> from whence they made ſuch Invaſions even into thoſe Mountains, that the Infidels were hardly able to live there; till of late by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>Portugez</hi> they have been able to build Forts and ſtrong holds in thoſe high places, from whence they infeſt us at pleaſure, having two advantages, whereof the firſt is their Warlikeneſs, and the ſecond their Woods.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This place ſtands very convenient to ſecure and advance the Indian commerce as far as thoſe places where there are more riches than were ever yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto the World.</p>

No man knoweth but themſelves, what advantage the <hi>Hollanders</hi> enjoy, and the <hi>French</hi> promiſe themſelves from one or two Towns upon any of theſe Coaſts.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians had another excellent Harbour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Mediterranian,</hi> called <hi>Bedis,</hi> or <hi>Velles de Gumern,</hi> which <hi>Ferdenand</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> took, by ſhutting it up, with two Forts that commanded it, and kept it two years, until it was betrayed by a falſe treacherous <hi>Spaniard</hi> (who ſlew the Governour, becauſe he had taken his Wife from him) into the <hi>Moors</hi> poſſeſſion, and all the Chriſtians were ſlain, not a man eſcaping, ſave only the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Traytor, who, in regard of his Treaſon, was greatly rewarded both by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Bedis,</hi> and alſo by the King of <hi>Fez.

            <p>True, it is a wild kind of Harbour, lying open to the Sea, without any windings or high-land-ſhelter; ſo that let the wind blow from what Compaſs it will, the Ships riding there are expoſed to the ſury of it; and

                  <p>Moſt true it is, that on the Mountains there inhabit certain fierce and untamed People, who, by reaſon of the ſteep, craggy, and inexpugnable ſituation of their Country, cannot be forced to Tributes; that which is gotten of them is the Tenth of their Corn and Fruits; only that they may be permitted to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the Plains.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Revenues, the King hath the Tolls and Cuſtomes of <hi>Fez,</hi> and of other Cities; for at the entring of their Goods, the natural Citizen pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two in the hundred, and the Stranger ten.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt many other things, he hath the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of Mills, which yield him little leſs than half a Royal of Plate, for every Hanega of Corn that is ground in <hi>Fez;</hi> where (as I told you) there are four hundred Mills. The <hi>Moſchea</hi> of <hi>Caruven</hi> had four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Duckets of Rent: The Colledges and Hoſpitalls of <hi>Fez</hi> had alſo many thouſands: All which the King hath at this preſent.</p>
                  <p>And further, He is Heir to all the Alcaydes, and them that have Penſion of him; and at their Death he poſſeſſeth their Horſes, Armour, Garments, and all their Goods. Howbeit, if the Deceaſed leave any Sons apt for the ſervice of the Wars, he granteth them their Fathers Proviſion: but if they be but young, he bringeth up the Male Children to years of ſervice, and the Daughters till they be Married. And therefore,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94431:11"/>
that he may have Intereſt in the Goods of Rich men, he beſtoweth upon them ſome Government, or Charge, with Proviſion: Wherefore, for fear of Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after death, every one coveteth to hide his wealth, or to remove far from the Court, and the Kings ſight: For which cauſe, the City of <hi>Fez</hi> cometh far ſhort of her antient glory.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, His Revenues have been augmented of late years by mighty ſumms of Gold, which he fetcheth from <hi>Tombuto</hi> and <hi>Gago,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Negros;</hi> which Gold (according to the report of Fame) may yearly amount to three Millions of Duckets.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond is, of a Royal Squadron of ſix thouſand Gentlemen, being all of noble Parentage, and of great account. Theſe men are mounted upon excellent horſes, with Furniture and Armes; for variety of Colours, moſt beautiful; and for Riches of Ornament, beyond meaſure eſtimable; for every thing about them ſhineth with Gold, Silver, Pearls, Jewells, and whatſoever elſe may pleaſe the eye, or ſatisfie the curioſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.

                  <p>The third ſort of Forces which he hath, conſiſteth of his <hi>Timarioth:</hi> For he granteth to all his Sons, and Brothers, and other Perſons of Account and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the People of <hi>Africk,</hi> or to the Princes of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the benefit of great Lordſhips and Tenures for ſuſtentation of his Cavalry; and the <hi>Archiades</hi> themſelves till the Fields, and afterwards reap Rice, Oyl, Barley, Butter, Sheep, Hens, and Money, and diſtribute the ſame monthly to the Souldiers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral qualities of their Perſons. They alſo give them Cloth, Linnen, and Silk to apparel themſelves, Armes of Offence and Defence, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with which they ſerve in the Wars, and if they dye, or be killed, they allow them other. Every one of theſe Leaders contendeth to bring his People into the Field well ordered.

                  <p>His fifth kind of Forces Military, are ſomewhat like unto the trained Souldiers of Chriſtian Princes; and among theſe, the Inhabitants of Cities and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of the Kingdom, and of the Mountains are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, whom the King makes very little account of, and very ſeldom puts Armes into their hands, for fear of Inſurrections and Rebellions, except in the Wars againſt the Chriſtians, for then he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently forbid them: For it being written in their Law, That <hi>If a Moor kill a Christian, or is ſlain by him, he goeth directly into Paradice:</hi> Men, Women, and thoſe of every Age and Degree, run to the Wars hand afore head, that at leaſt they may there be ſlain, and by this means gain Heaven.</p>
                  <p>200000. Men he brought againſt <hi>Tituan</hi> 1659. Yet he cannot long continue a War; yea, not above 3. Months, becauſe his Forces living on that Proviſion which he hath daily coming in, as well for Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as for Apparel; and not being able to have all this conducted thither, where the War requireth, it followeth of neceſſity, that in ſhort time they muſt return home for their Maintenance.</p>

Commanders ſet forth two hours one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, every one having its Ambuſcado and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, not in any ſtrict Order of Rank and File. Ye though their Diſcipline is not exact, their Order is ſo without confuſion and violence. All the Commanders have their Wives and Boyes attending them well guarded. Their hoarſe Drums ſerve to deafen the Ears, and confound the Senſes to any other Clamour, with ſome Braſs Diſhes, and wind Inſtruments, to noiſe the Varnes, carried by Fellows on horſe-back, a little before every Company; whoſe Horſes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſwift, it being a ſhame there to loſe a Drum.. His Weapon is Bow and Arrow, an Iron Pole, a Shrene, a Petronel, a Harque-buz, Scemiter; all over armed like a Porcupine.</p>
                  <p>They Eat and Lye in one Blanket, tying their horſes bridle to their armes while they graze.</p>
                  <p>When they come towards an Enemy, they march very exactly and ſilently, not a man, upon pain of death, daring to break the Order.</p>
                  <p>When they are near an Engagement, the Horſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs their Foot in the Rear, in form of a half-Moon or Creſcent; thoſe Horſe have order not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Enemy, but only to drive and neceſſitate the Foot upon them, till they have peirced through their Batalia, if poſſible; and if they chance to recoyl, to hold them to the Slaughter, till they have wearied and dulled the Enemies Swords; and then the Reſerve and they together fall in with freſh fury and vigour: and this ſerves for all advantages of Military Policy, to quicken his multitudes through deſpair to high and gallant ſervices.</p>

C: <hi>Kingwell,</hi> Major <hi>Fiernes,</hi> Captain <hi>Summers,</hi> Captain <hi>Flord,</hi> Captain <hi>Herbert,</hi> Captain <hi>Emerſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Brooks:</hi> No ſooner was my Lord upon the place, than he ſetled a very fair Correſpondence with the <hi>Portuguez</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> there, upon the old Portugal terms, until he could be able to procure himſelf better; ſo that we had the Accommodations of that Place upon as good Conditions as we could wiſh: In the mean time our works went on, our Souldiers were inured to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we were better acquainted with the humour and intereſt of the People; and in a word, had exacter Obſervation of our Advantages, in order to a further ſettlement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 11. 1663. The <hi>Moors</hi> had a Deſign of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Tangier,</hi> whereof his Excellency having In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94431:17"/>
by the <hi>Arabian</hi> Spies he employed to that purpoſe, drew up a Regiment of Foot, and a Troop of Horſe; but being not willing to ſpend any of his own men upon the Barbarians, he ſent out ſome <hi>Moors</hi> who had heretofore revolted, and come in, and have been many wayes uſeful and ſerviceable to us; who accordingly being horſed, encountred with a Party of the Enemy, in the ſight of the Town, and wounded the <hi>Shots</hi> Son, one of the principal Perſons of the Country, of which wounds he is ſince dead, and his loſs is much lamented by the Infidels. In revenge whereof, as we conjecture, five dayes after a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Party came within our Trench, and one of their chief Captains was killed by our Artillery. Theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Braveries prejudice them more than they can annoy us, who can look on until the Country is haraſſed and ruined with Poverty, Hunger and Sickneſs. The <hi>Moors</hi> will be neceſſitated in all probability ere long to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Complyance with <hi>Tangier;</hi> already many of them did run over to us with Horſes and Cattel; ſo that freſh Proviſions were no varieties; and upon the whole matter our condition was much another thing than it was when we firſt ſetled there; Health, Plenty, Trade, Security, and good Government, having put us into a very ſetled Condition; and his Excellency the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> having ſo well and happily ſetled all the Concernments, to the honour and advantage of his Majeſty, then ready, by his Majeſties grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to return into <hi>England,</hi> and put the City into his Succeſſors hands, having payed off all Arrears, and filled up all Stores and Ammunitions. And as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of our Proſperity, we had very good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondenee with <hi>Algier,</hi> together with a reſolution to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94431:17"/>
continue in Amity with us; they of <hi>Sallee</hi> likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a good underſtanding with us: <hi>Tangier</hi> rendring <hi>England</hi> much more conſiderable to <hi>Algier,</hi> than it would be, were this Garriſon in other hands. The Works were ſtrengthned by the ſame Noble Lord; the Garriſon enlarged; the Quarters were diſpoſed; the Rate of Victualls was ſetled; the Guards were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and 5. Mile round clearly gained.</p>
               <p>But the Earl of <hi>Tiveot</hi> arriving, there began a little ſtone Redoubt, which we perfected without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from the Enemy, alſo we made Entrenchments and Lines of Communication from place to place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that a great deal of ground was left free to us, to feed our Cattel in ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> we began another Redoubt on the top of the hill, which overlooketh the Town to the very Ports thereof; at the ſame time we made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments beyond the hill that we might not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, nor our works moleſted. <hi>Gayland</hi> hearing of the conſequence of this Redoubt, and of our dayly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching, aſſembled his Army conſiſting of 4000 Horſe, and 20000 Foot, and Encamps within a league of the Town: Two fugitives one after another brought us news that he reſolved to attaque our works.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Sunday</hi> morning we divided our Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into three Poſts: whereof Col. <hi>Fitz-Gerard</hi> and his Regiment, was to maintain that near the Sea on the Eaſt: Col. <hi>Norwood,</hi> with half the Governours Regiments the middle Poſt, wherein lay the new great Redoubt: L. C. <hi>Knightley,</hi> with the other half of the ſaid Regiment, where the little Redoubts were on the right hand: Col. <hi>Bridges</hi> with the Horſe in the middeſt of all, to give ſuccour as need ſhould require, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94431:18"/>
the Enemy if they entred our works: Col. <hi>Alſop</hi> the Town Major ſtill viſiting the poſts; The outmoſt lines of all for favouring the work-men being divided into three poſts, commanded one by a Lieutenant and 30 men, another by an Enſign and 18 men, and the third by a Serjeant and 12. We made a ſix Pounder Gun to be carried to the outmoſt line at the Serjeants poſt, and gave order that after all, the Garriſon ſhould be in readineſs, and at the ſhooting of the ſaid Gun, ſhould take arms; which was accordingly executed at 12 a Clock at night; and after the Gun was brought off, all thoſe outer Lines were ſown with Chauſtraps, Cultrips or ſtories, whereof we brought over 36000. and the avenues with Sowgards or hollis, wherein was put Powder as in a Mine, and Loaden above with Stones, Granadoes and Swedes feathers were put into thoſe farther poſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday</hi> the 14 preciſely at twelve a clock in the day, whenall the Officers were retired to dinner, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Guards in the Retrenchments, appeared in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Gaylands</hi> forces, who had long attaqued our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Lines, (the Lieutenant, Enſign and Serjeants Poſts) with three Regiments of Red and White Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Black Colours, &amp; one of a ſort of Violet Colour, ſeconded by a Regiment of Horſe. Our Souldiers ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and amazed, abandoned their Poſts, and left the Powder in the Sowguards, with ſome Granadoes, to the Enemy, who purſued with incredible vigour the Souldiers towards the Town. Mean time the great Body of Foot attaqued the great Redoubt, and ſhewed more than ordinary reſolution in ſtanding firm before our Granadoes and fire. In the Fort was Commander, by his turn, Major <hi>Ridgert</hi> with ſome forty men; and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94431:18"/>
to his ſuccour came Lieutenant-Col. <hi>Chun</hi> Voluntier, and Captain <hi>Giles</hi> a Lieutenant in the Governours Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and ſeveral others Reformed Officers: which Major &amp; Officers defended themſelves moſt gallantly, killing about 40 of the Moors. The Chauſtraps that were ſown about all the Lines, and the Redoubt in particular, were of wonderful uſe and effect: for the bare-footed Moors, when they were pricked in the feet by them, ſitting down to pick them out, were pricked behind. Many both of Foot and Horſe were ſo hurt. Mean time, the Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonels, with the Officers, commanded in caſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to maintain the three Poſts; as alſo Col. <hi>Bridges</hi> with his Horſe marched out, repulſed moſt gallantly the Enemy, took in all their Poſts again; and in the end the Enemy retired in great haſt and diſorder. They loſt, as near as we can conjecture by taking off the dead, (for they never leave any bodies behind them, if poſſible) above 100 in all, 14 being left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lines, which they could not carry off, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others in the fields; Colonel <hi>Norwood</hi> with all imaginable gallantry going to the outer point before the Redoubt, and Captain <hi>Needham</hi> with him. The ſaid Captain did kill a Moor for his part, and for his pains was ſhot himſelf thorow the arm in the fleſh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We loſt 14 killed in the field, and twenty hurt with Horſe: and we ſuppoſe we had more of our men hurt from our inner Line and Walls, than by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
               <p>It is reported by the Portuguez and Jews, that he had never loſt ſo many men at any time. They are men of order and reſolution, and have moſt excellent Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms and Lances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94431:19"/>
I had forgot to tell you, that when the Horſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us, he that did command them was cloathed in Crimſon Velvet; who being killed, they went all off immediately: which maketh us ſuſpect he was of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent quality.</p>
               <p>After this Encounter, an Expreſs was ſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement <hi>Gayland;</hi> who returned the Anſwer incloſed by one of his own domeſticks, who confeſſeth that our Crows feet or Chauſtraps did their Foot great harm, and that they have loſt many men.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe Complements, <hi>Gayland</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a new Work of ours with 10000. Men: but the moſt vigilant and excellent Governour had ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſupplyed the defects of that place, by planting great Gun to annoy the Aſſailants; that, though the aſſault was very ſharp, the Enemy was beaten off, and that with the loſs of 900. men; which entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they liked ſo ill, that the Army was drawn off: And thereupon the ſaid Governour, as happy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Advantages, as reſolute to gain them, ſent a Letter to <hi>Gayland,</hi> to let him know, That his Maſter, the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> as he wanted neither Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution nor Ability to manage his juſt Right in that Garriſon: ſo he was ſo great a Friend to Peace, that he would be ready to entertain a better Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with his Excellency: Which ſeconded with the Defeat, (then only you oblige the unworthy,

when you can awe them) prevailed ſo much upon the Uſurper, that he ſent Meſſengers for a Treaty, which had ſo fair a progreſs, that both Parties came to an Agreement. Indeed ſo ill was <hi>Gaylands</hi> ſucceſs, ſo great our progreſs in Fortifications; ſuch convenience we had for freſh Air, and freſh Victualls, that we were in a plight (if it had been thought fit to have ſent Sir <hi>John Lawſon,</hi> to do as much by Sea, as we could do by Land; to ſhut up the Havens and Towns of <hi>Sallee</hi> and <hi>Tituan,</hi> and batter <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Every day put us in a better ſtate, both of freedom and ſecurity, having by our late Treaty gained a ſix Months Peace, which did exceedingly conduce to our ſettlement. At our firſt arrival, a Flux troubled us, but within ſix Months our temper agreed exceedingly well with the temper of the Climate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 24. 1663. The Vigilancy, Courage and Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Tiveot,</hi> moved <hi>Gayland</hi> (in his own Expreſſion) to require a Peace; which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though concluded but for ſix Months, was by him deſired for ſeven Years: After which time the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Forts are finiſhed, and this Advice waited upon his Excellence, who was then embarquing for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time, the Deſign of the Mould, intended for the ſafety and advantage of Shipping, was in a good forwardneſs of perſection, the Paſſage of the Stone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out out of the Rocks, &amp; way made for a Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der blow, &amp; undermining.

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 26. 1663. The <hi>Moors</hi> kept their Peace made with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> very punctually, whom they treated, when they went down into their Countries (which is rich, and well inhabited) with great Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Earl of <hi>Tiveot</hi> was much eſteemed for his Valour, and well beloved for his Candour and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; inſomuch, as the very <hi>Moors</hi> term him a <hi>Good Man.</hi> (and indeed, he was a Perſon of exact honour and integrity) The Place was healthy, and the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation pleaſant, and Proviſions of ſorts in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that a man can ſcarce live cheaper any where.</p>
               <p>But about this time we began our Mould, and found it very hard to blow up the Rocks under water, to make way for our Boats and Engines, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cannot bring Stone, but with difficulty, at the top of high water: but in a month, way was made for our Engines to weigh our Stones, and in ſix weeks time we laid 30. yards of Foundation, and raiſed that two yards high: It ſhould ſeem we are better at this work than any other, this being better work than any in the Streight.</p>
               <p>But that we might not only ſecure our ſelves, but oblige our Neighbours; we ſent Supplyes, with a great deal of hazard, to the <hi>Saint &amp; Falle;</hi> a Favour he acknowledged ſo great, that he hath promiſed, when ever it is in his power, he will not be backward in requital.

Hereupon we had free Trade with the <hi>Moors,</hi> they daily bringing their Camels, laden with Hides and Skins, which is their chief Commodity; and in return they get Money, and other Proviſion: This Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Market for thoſe things that come from <hi>Algier</hi> to <hi>Tituan,</hi> and from thence hither; eſpecially when a ſquare of 30. yards towards a Molle was brought a yard above the water mark: That new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of Maſte-floates promoting our Deſign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſo forward were we in <hi>February,</hi> that <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  </hi>land began to be jealous of us, and therefore there are ſeveral Debates between him and his <hi>Excellency,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tiveot,</hi> whether a War or Peace. Free he would have us to the Fortification of thoſe Redoubts neareſt the Town; but as for thoſe further off, as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> anſwer the Ambaſſadors that come to them, ſaying, <hi>It may be ſo, we will conſider:</hi> So ſaid he, <hi>He would take</hi> 14. <hi>dayes time to think of it.</hi> And they have a Saying amongſt them, the meaning whereof I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not; 13. <hi>dayes make a wiſe man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But from Debate it comes to Action; the <hi>Moor</hi> comes on with Horſe and Foot to hinder the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Quarters, as it concerned him, but was beaten off; and, what is a ſhame in that Country, left one of his Horſe Colours behind him: Neither is he more in earneſt than we, for we baniſh all the <hi>Jewes</hi> out of Town, and go on a pace with the Works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further Attempt or Interruption; only when the Lord Governour declared, he could entertain no Peace, without ſome more Liberty allowed, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the Country: <hi>Gayland</hi> adviſed with his Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Grandees, his Lords of the other Houſe; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94431:23"/>
after mature deliberation, he ſent word by two of his principal Officers, and his Secretary, which was to this Effect; That, <hi>having conſulted all his Savois and Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies upon the Point, it appeared, That they were bound by a Law not to ſuffer Chriſtians to Fortifie in</hi> Africa; <hi>but if his Excellency accepted of Quarters, as in the</hi> Portuguez <hi>time, they were willing to give them.</hi> To which my Lord reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That, <hi>He muſt either have Peace with thoſe Terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, or War without them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the very next week his Lordſhip commenced a new Redoubt upon the utmoſt Liue; againſt which Work, what Stratagems! what Ambuſcadoes! what Surprizes! while we were ſo confident, that one writes to <hi>England</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We expected <hi>Gaylands</hi> whole Army any time theſe ſeven dayes; if he ſtayes but two dayes longer, he muſt come to our terms, and ſuffer this Place to be comfortable to the Garriſon, and the Inhabitants: Or, which is more, let him come when he will, we queſtion not, but we ſhall maintain our Ground in ſpite of his heart: We have good Lines to defend; and better Men certainly are not in the World: To which muſt be added; <hi>That we have a Governour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Conduct (with Gods ordinary Providence) we can fear nothing.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But ah! humane Confidence! he was an excellent man, but a man ſtill; for the next News you heard, was; That the Earl of <hi>Tiveot,</hi> deſigning to cut wayes and paſſages in an adjoyning Wood, that was as great annoyance to <hi>Tangier,</hi> as it was a ſhelter to the <hi>Moors;</hi> and having in vain ſent out Scouts, who were ſuffered to graze their Horſes in the midſt of the Enemies, who lay undiſcovered, behind thoſe riſing Grounds, in

Fernes, and thick Graſs; fell into an Ambuſcado of the whole Infidel Army, where he ſold his life at a dear rate; a life indeed invaluable but that there are many ſuch lives comprehended in his SaCRed Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties large and univerſal Care; which hath that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence even upon this diſtant Place; that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Gaylands</hi> attempts upon it ſeveral times ſince that miſcarriage, not only ſecures, but advanceth it to as much Reputation as ever it enjoyed ſince it was in the Chriſtians hands. How many Millions would the <hi>French</hi> give for ſuch a place? who are now to ſeek for a footing in thoſe Coaſts.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Soyl is proper for any Grain, or Trees, and asketh nothing but dreſſing to be admirable. There is no need of carrying Proviſion thither, as to other Plantations, for the ſupport of the Colonies; the abundance of things there being ſo great, that the Country produceth enough for its ſelf, and to ſpare. The Waters are excellent; the Fruits delicious, and and without Hyperbole; the Place may be improved into a Paradice: Over and above this, there are Golden Mines, in ſuch plenty, that in great falls of Rain, and ravages of Water, the Veins of Gold diſcovered themſelves, all along the Coaſt, and upon the Mountains. The Inhabitants are of a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition tractable enough, &amp; with good words, are ready and willing to be employed in any ſervice; being a People humble, and obedient, and of a very good humour. The Country is ſhared among divers petty Pretenders, who are ſtill making warr one upon the other; and from whoſe Diſagreement we might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily take a riſe to an abſolute eſtabliſhment of our ſelves among them. Beyond this Place the Trading

lyeth open without difficulty into <hi>India;</hi> and more commodiouſly yet to the Country of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where Commerce is ſcarce underſtood, and where are the richeſt Gold Mines upon the face of the Earth. In a word, there is not any where a fitter Place for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Magazine of all Commodities to be brought from thoſe Parts into <hi>Europe,</hi> than is this Place; from whence we may carry the buſineſs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Diſcovery further than any have yet done before us. Beſides that, the Place is of ſo gentle a Climate, that what cloaths ſerve us here in the ſpring, may ſerve us there all the year; and having within its ſelf whatſoever may honeſtly, by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſerve either to the pleaſure, plenty, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of humane life.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this, that lying in a middle way, it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us from the danger and loſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And over and above all this, when others are come as far as <hi>Tangier,</hi> they dare not paſs the Channel without our leave, which they may be made either to fight, or pay for.</p>

               <head>The Qualities of theſe People, Good and Bad.</head>
               <p>THey are Religious to a Superſtition, ſo far, the day they Pray (and they are very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at their Churches or Maſques) they ſpit, nor touch their privy parts. Their dexterity and skill in Mathematiques and Mechaniques is extraordinary: Very Faithful they are, but Cunning, No People ſo Luſtful, and none ſo Jealous; Familiarity with one of their Wives is Death. <hi>Give Place to thy Elders,</hi> is a <hi>great Rule</hi> amongſt them. When ever they diſcourſe of Love, the Youth are to withdraw.</p>
               <p>But with theſe Vertues, they have their Vices too, being very needy and covetous; very proud and wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; very implacable and revengeful. So Clowniſh they are, that they will ſcarce hear you: yet ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, that they will believe you, ſay what you will. Abounding ſo much with Choler, they ſpeak alwayes angry and loud; and you will never walk the Streets, but you will meet with a Squabble. Deſperate they are in their Undertakings: Careleſs they are of their Time; which they ſpend in Hunting, or War, or Theft. Thus have I deſcribed as well their Vices as their Virtues; though I am indebted to this Country for my Birth, and moſt part of my Education.</p>
               <p>Now to deliver ſomewhat concerning the eſtates of theſe Chriſtians: They are called by ſome <hi>Cofti,</hi> or <hi>Coptitae,</hi> and by others, <hi>Chriſtians from the Girdle</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for albeit they be baptized, as we are, yet do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94431:27"/>
they circumciſe themſelves like to the Jews: ſo as a man may ſay, their Chriſtianity comes no lower than the girdle-ſtead. But that which is worſe, they have for 1000 years followed the hereſie of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> which alloweth but of one Nature in Chriſt: by which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie they alſo ſeparate and diſmember themſelves, from the Union of the Church of <hi>Europe.</hi> The occaſion of this ſeparation and ſchiſm, was the Epheſine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, aſſembled by <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> in defence of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> who was now condemned by the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council by ſix hundred and thirty Fathers congregated together, by the authority of <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt. For the <hi>Cofti</hi> fearing, that to attribute two natures unto Chriſt, might be all one, as if they had aſſigned him two hypoſtaſes or perſons, to avoid the hereſie of the <hi>Neſtoreans,</hi> they became <hi>Eutichians.</hi> They ſay their Divine Service in the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> oftentimes repeating <hi>Alleluja.</hi> They read the Goſpel firſt in <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and then in <hi>Arabick.</hi> When the Prieſt ſayeth <hi>Pax vobis,</hi> the youngeſt among them layeth his hand upon all the people that are preſent. After Conſecration, they give a ſimple piece of Bread to the ſtanders by: a Ceremony uſed alſo in <hi>Greece.</hi> They exerciſe their Function in the Church of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> amidſt the ruines of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in that of <hi>Suez,</hi> upon the Red Sea: They obey the Patriarck of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and affirm themſelves to be of the Faith of <hi>Prete Ianni,</hi> In our dayes two Popes have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reduce them to the Union of the Romiſh Church, <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth; whoſe Letter they received with reverence, laying them upon their heads before they opened them.</p>

               <hi>Affrica</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt by the Red Sea, and the famous Bay of <hi>Arabia;</hi> on the Weſt, with the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, which divides it from <hi>America;</hi> on the North it is parted by the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> from <hi>Europe;</hi> and on the South with the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Sea, from that place which Geographers call <hi>Terra Auſtralis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita;</hi> altogether bounded by the Sea, but that there is an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> or a Neck of Land, (of threeſcore, faith Dr. <hi>Heylin;</hi> threeſcore and nine, ſaith <hi>Leo Affricanus;</hi> but fifty and four, ſaith <hi>Munſter;</hi> and ſeventy four miles, ſaith <hi>Atlas)</hi> between it and <hi>Aſia:</hi> over which Neck <hi>Cleopatra</hi> would have drawn her Ships when her dear <hi>Anthony</hi> was defeated, and adventured her ſelf to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Coaſt to eſcape <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſucceſs and fortune, had not her Minions company invited her to her own <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:94431:28"/>
to put a period to that Rant and Frolick wherewith Fate and Fortune played with, and exerciſed that Age of the World.</p>
            <p>The form of <hi>Affrica,</hi> ſaith <hi>Leo,</hi> is a Pyramide rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the Baſis whereof, which reacheth from <hi>Tangier,</hi> and the Streight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> to the foreſaid <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and is in length 1918 Italian miles; the Cone narrow, but 4155 miles in length; that is to ſay, in plain Engliſh, that part of the world is 1920 miles abroad towards us, and runs up narrower and narrower 4156 miles the further it goeth from us. <hi>Aſia</hi> is leſs then <hi>America, Affrica</hi> then <hi>Aſia, Europe</hi> then <hi>Affrica;</hi> that courſe cloth hath good meaſure.</p>
            <p>Touching the temper of the Air, which depends moſt an end upon the poſition and aſpect of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; we gueſs that ſince the Aequator, (I mean that Line that is ſuppoſed to divide the Heavens into two equal parts) croſſeth over the middle of this Country, therefore it was, by thoſe of old, (that had no more Geography then they drew up by aim in their Studies, and concluded from ſome of their own uncertain Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and conjectural Principles) judged to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt Torrid Zone, and ſo for the moſt part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable: whereas a few more years experience, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and obſervation, hath manifeſted moſt part of this Country habitable and temperate; the cool of the Nights allaying the heat of the Days: for there the miſts, dews, and ſhowres of the one, refreſh the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and parches of the other; as indeed that viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sun and Moon was deſigned by the Almighty, (who diſpoſed all things in number, weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, according to the eternal counſel of his will) to keep this world in an equal temper, not overheated
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94431:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the <hi>fever</hi> of the Torrid, nor overcooled with the <hi>ague</hi> of the Frigid Zone.</p>
            <p>The beſt Deſcription extant of this Coaſt that the Ancients had, was that great Souldier and exact Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator <hi>Hannoes</hi> Journal, a great while locked in his Punick Tongue, until that great Reſtorer of Learning at once beſtowed upon it the pains of a Tranſlation into the Greek Tongue, and the charge of an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at <hi>Baſil,</hi> 1526.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affrica</hi> is divided into, 1. <hi>Egypt,</hi> 2. <hi>Numidia,</hi> 3. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> 4. <hi>Terra Nigritorum,</hi> 5. <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> Superiour and Inferiour; with the Iſlands adjoyning to theſe reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive parts. The ſubject of this Diſcourſe lieth in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbary</hi> lieth Eaſtward towards <hi>Cyrenaica;</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, toward the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea; Northward, upon the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> towards the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and the <hi>Atlantick;</hi> and Southward, towards <hi>Atlas, Spain</hi> and <hi>Numidia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is called <hi>Barbary</hi> but lately by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> either, as the more ancient Authors will have it, from the word <hi>Barbar,</hi> which among thoſe people ſignifieth <hi>Murmur</hi> or <hi>Grumbling,</hi> becauſe the Language of that place is like the condition of it, diſcontented: Or from <hi>Bar,</hi> (as our modern Writers aſſert it) a <hi>Deſart</hi> in that <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>The Punick.</hi>
               </note> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, intimating the deſolateneſs of the place before their repleniſhing or peopling of it.</p>
            <p>It is in length from the <hi>Atlantick</hi> to the Streights, fifteen hundred miles; and in breadth from Mount <hi>Atlas</hi> to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> an hundred in the Inland Countries; but outwardly towards the Streights, three hundred.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Barbary</hi> is divided into four parts by moſt Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94431:29"/>
but it is well known by thoſe that travel to conſiſt of ſix parts, <hi>viz. Cus</hi> or <hi>Chus, Hea, Haſcora, Duccala, Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt, is a long piece of barren ground, of one hundred and almoſt eighty Italian miles.</p>
            <p>The ſecond coaſts along as may miles upon the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick</hi> to the very mouth of the Streights: It's ſixty German miles long, and fifty Engliſh miles broad; Mountainous, but well inhabited; Hilly, but plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with all manner of neceſſaries; the higheſt places there, being as well peopled as our Valleys here.</p>
            <p>The third is large, but wild and Mountainous; uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rather from its inhabitants careleſsneſs, then its own nature.</p>
            <p>The fourth is eminent for nothing but that great <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Moſche</hi> made all of VVhale-bones.</p>
            <p>The fifth, <hi>Morocco,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof are called <hi>Moores</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which in the Greek ſigniſieth <hi>black</hi> or <hi>obſcure,</hi> and denotes either their Complexion, which is Tawny, and inclining to black; or their Condition, as who are bafe in their Original, and not very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in their preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morocco</hi> hath on the Eaſt of it <hi>Maloa;</hi> on the VVeſt from <hi>Tremiſon,</hi> the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; on the South, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> and on the North, <hi>Fez.</hi> It hath its chief denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the chief City of it, <hi>Morocco:</hi> it hath large Cities well inhabited &amp; as well fortified; whereof one contained <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, (when there went out an Enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>Xeriff</hi> or chief Governour to Tax every Family by the Poll) 150000 Families, 486 Moſches or Churches: on the Tower of the chiefeſt whereof, or the Mother-Church, as they call it, there was a Globe that weighed 800 pound in Gold, and was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94431:29"/>
at 1300000 Duckats. The Country is like <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> rich and fertile, and wants onely skilful and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious inhabitants, that may improve it to that rich advantage it is capable of; that Country coming up, as all Travellers aver, to our Saviours proportion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſome times and places <hi>thirty fold, ſome fifty, ſome ſixty, and ſome and hundred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Air is much after the temper of <hi>England,</hi> but that there is a South-wind that ever and anon blows and brings along with it an extraordinary and a very hurtful heat, like that at <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> did not an Eaſtern blaſt bring with it four times a year, <hi>(viz.</hi> about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and moſt part of <hi>May,</hi> as extraordinary cold that balanceth the former exceſs to a temper exceeding pleaſant and healthful; inſomuch as it was obſerved by Mr. <hi>Tevillian,</hi> (that traveiled <hi>Morocco anno</hi> 1633. when King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of glorious memory, upon the humble Requeſt of the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> ſent 15 ſhips to aſſiſt him in the Conqueſt of the Pyrates of <hi>Sala,</hi> who were too hard for him; and to his great grief, poor man, infeſted all <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Eaſtern Trade) that never any Engliſh, VVelch, or Scotch, that were caſt upon thoſe coaſts, died before they were an hundred years old: nor any French or Iriſh that lived there a twelve-month for ſome years together, until <hi>Art</hi> helped <hi>Nature;</hi> and they underſtanding the temperature of the Climate, and their own conſtitution, were taught thoſe Rules and Preſcriptions that corrected the firſt, and aſſiſted the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Of the eleven Mountains of <hi>Barbary,</hi> four are fallen to the ſhare of this part of it; 1. <hi>Thanebes,</hi> 2. <hi>Gous,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:94431:30"/>
3. <hi>Phocra,</hi> 4. <hi>Uſaletto:</hi> from which ſpring up thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and wholeſome ſtreams, that run like ſo many Veins of Blood, turning and winding through this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even Ground, diſpenſing their Refreſhments and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure on all ſides, with equal kindneſs to Men, to Beaſts, to the Graſs and Corn.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez</hi> are as it were all one, as well in the ſtate and condition of the Countrey, as in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Come we then at laſt to <hi>Fez,</hi> wherein lieth <hi>Tangier,</hi> the place we have in our Eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fez</hi> hath on the South of it <hi>Morocco,</hi> which is no other then the other half of it: on the North, the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean;</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Malon</hi> and <hi>Tremeſon;</hi> on the Weſt, the <hi>Atlantick.</hi> It is thought by that excellent Surveyor <hi>Maurus,</hi> to be as big as <hi>Toledo,</hi> that is almoſt twice as big as <hi>England,</hi> and ſomething over.</p>
            <p>The Ground is very uneven and unequal; no Hills higher then its Mountains, no Wilderneſs wider and looſer then its Deſerts; no Parks more woody than its Forreſts; no Valleys more Pleaſant and Profitable than its Champaigns, which what they want in length and breadth, they gain in depth; as if Nature had heaped one Acre upon two, in the matchleſs fertility thereof: Our Age, barren of Belief, affords not Faith ſo eaſily to the Story, as this Land afforded Food to their ten hundred thouſand men, <hi>Anno</hi> 1569, when an hundred thouſand fell at the famous Battel before <hi>Tangier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soil of the Countrey of <hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> is ſo rank of it ſelf, that if any compoſt or artificial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement be added unto it, it turns barren (ſaith my ingenious Author) out of fullenneſs and indignation, that men ſhould ſuſpect the native fruitfulneſs thereof;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94431:30"/>
and <hi>Fat upon Fat</hi> is falſe Heraldry in Husbandry: An Engliſh man once dunged two Acres of this Countrey towards <hi>Goſel,</hi> and it's barren to this day, and called by the Inhabitants in the Punick, <hi>Erapi voſci Dos; Gods curſe upon Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ships, when ſailing, are generally conceived to have one moyety of them inviſible under Water; and ſome Countreys in like manner are counted to have their Wealth equally within the Earth, and without it: But the proportion holds not exactly in <hi>Fez,</hi> whoſe viſible Wealth far tranſcendeth her concealed Subſtance. And yet we finde ſome Minerals therein of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe and value: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Braſs and Iron, ſo plentifully, that though they have not the Bleſſing of <hi>Aſher, Thy ſhooes ſhall be iron and braſs,</hi> yet have they ſo competent a ſtore of it, that ſhe is no Gentlewoman there, that hath not her twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty great Iron Rings about her.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Salt, without which no Meat is ſavoury to Man, no Sacrifice acceptable to God: <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſowed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> and <hi>Abdamelech Gaſel</hi> with Salt. There are two ſorts of Salt; 1. <hi>Foſsilis,</hi> digged; 2. <hi>Coctilis,</hi> boyled: both here plentifully, the firſt about <hi>Hea,</hi> the laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Heahem,</hi> and in Lakes near <hi>Fez,</hi> where they ſet no Salt on their Tables, but every one takes a little in his hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Glaſs; whereof the beſt in the World (ſaith the great Hiſtorian of Nature) is found on the River <hi>Belus,</hi> and the next to that, (ſaith <hi>Solinus)</hi> in <hi>Hevalous,</hi> or as they call it now, <hi>Hebal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Marble; the great Ornament of their Cities and Temples.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Precious Stones in abundance, no doubt near
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94431:31"/>
               <hi>Arzilla,</hi> as we may gueſs by thoſe few found there by chance, by <hi>Vaſquez</hi> in his ſecond Expedition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Curious medicinal Waters, ariſing from the ſulphurious ſpring of Mount <hi>Anaba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. For Gold and Silver: though to avoid the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of other Nations, they ſay with St. <hi>Peter, Silver and Gold have I none;</hi> yet no doubt if the <hi>European</hi> Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry poſſeſſed the place of the <hi>Affrican</hi> ſloth, it would finde the <hi>Indies</hi> in its way thither: for <hi>Fez</hi> the chief City of this Region hath its name from that Gold that is ſuppoſed to lie a breeding in the very Bowels of it: But the upper fruitfulneſs of the Soyl makes them the more negligent in digging into the bowels thereof; as thoſe need not play beneath board, who have all the Game in their own hands: For this Countrey hath plenty,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Oyl-Olive; ſo called, to difference it from Seed or Train-Oyl: hereof there are three kindes, or rather degrees: whereof, 1. the courſeſt makes lamps, which they burn in their Moſques, Temples and great Palaces, Day and Night: 2. A middle ſort for fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, uſed for Meat or rather Sallad, with their cold Herbs, and colder Pap: 3. The fineſt, compounded with Spices, for Ointment for Kings, Prieſts and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, at their more ſolemn occaſions of Pomp and State, of Piety and Devotion, and of Pleaſure and Entertainment. Three Carrects of Oyl was one of the deſigned Preſents to the Renowned King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, 1634, by <hi>Abdalla,</hi> that were loſt in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> where Oyl it ſelf ſunk.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Honey: This is their Sugar, as Salt is their Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; whence it was called by the Ancients <hi>Terra Melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flua:</hi> the <hi>Canaanites</hi> here (for you ſhall hear anon how
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94431:31"/>
they fled hither from the face of <hi>Joſhua)</hi> as well as in their own Countrey, enjoying a Land that flowed with Honey: the Gentile part whereof uſe Honey after the Perſian manner in their Sacrifices; which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Lev. 2. 11. Vid. Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. Sacra, in loc.</note> is the reaſon why Honey was forbidden in the Jewiſh Oblations. And to this Honey belongeth Wax, wherewith they dreſs their Leather, the beſt here, if you will believe <hi>Valtolin,</hi> that famous Shooe-Maker and Traveller, whoſe Shooes were ſurely made of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Leather.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fruits. The biggeſt and moſt plentiful that ever I read of: As,</p>
            <p>1. Dates: whereof there is this tradition amongſt them, That a Date-Tree over-ſhadowed an Olive-Tree, and that Olive-Tree a Fig-Tree, and that Fig-Tree a Pomegranate, and that Pomegranate a Vine. 2. Almonds. 3. Nuts. 4. Figs. 5. Pomegranates. 6. Pears. 7. Spices. 8. Cherries. 9. Plums and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Of which they made their moſt conſiderable Preſents, whereof good ſtore were ſent at ſeveral times to the Earles of <hi>Peterburrough</hi> and <hi>Tiveot,</hi> from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rebel <hi>Gayland,</hi> who wants nothing of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat man, as <hi>Cromwel</hi> did not, but that he hath not common Honeſty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Barley: It was the Humility of Chriſt, it is the neceſſity of the <hi>Fezians,</hi> to eat Barley-Loaves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Vines: ſo good, that notwithſtanding the ſtrict Laws of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to which they are moſt ſubject, the inhabitants cannot but requeſt their King to allow, and the King cannot but grant them a liberty to drink Wine; eſpecially at <hi>Ezhaggen,</hi> ſome fifteen Leagues off of <hi>Tangier;</hi> where it's a part of the City-Charter, That they may drinke VVine on <hi>Mundays, Tueſdays,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:94431:32"/>
               <hi>Thurſdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays.</hi> Yet as great as good; ſo that what is propheſied of <hi>Judah,</hi> may be true here, That <hi>they may binde their foals to the Vine, and their aſſes colts to the choice Vine,</hi> though Vines with us are tied to other Trees for their ſupport; and that a Grape there in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places is as big as a Plum with us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Wood: ſo that round <hi>Tangier</hi> the Countrey ſeemed formerly a continued Grove of ſweet Firs, ſhady Palms, ſtrong Oaks, cloſe Cypreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where Trees are wanting, there Graſs and Ferns look like thick Coppices, ſo high, that a whole Army may be lodged Horſe and Foot in a field, and not diſcerned; as they did to our ſorrow, in the late action on the third of <hi>May,</hi> 1664.</p>
            <p>Theſe are their Vegetables: Their Beaſts are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Goats: whoſe fleſh is good Meat, as their skins make good Leather, and their Fleeces good Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Diet is ſo plain, that they have very few Cattle for meat, but many for ſhew and ſervice; as 1. Lyons, ſo tame, that they will gather ſtones up and down the ſtreets in <hi>Fez,</hi> and hurt none; and his Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> hath one of my Lord <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s beſtowing, that will lie upon his Bed as quietly as any Lamb. 2. Elephants. 3. Dragons. 4. Leopards. 5. Horſes, the handſomeſt, the ſtrongeſt and ſwifteſt in the World: A <hi>Barbary Horſe,</hi> is a Proverb.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot that Balm or Balſome, whereof the firſt Plants, <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, <hi>(Antiq. l.</hi> 8.) the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> brought from this place to <hi>Judea.</hi> This Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is two-fold:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Xylo-Balſamum,</hi> the Parent, being the ſhrub out of which it proceeded.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:94431:32"/>
2. <hi>Opo-Balſamum,</hi> being the Daughter, which trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like tears from the former: Uſeful, 1. for the Healthful, making a moſt odoriferous and pleaſant perfume: 2. For the Sick, being ſoveraign and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal: 3. For the Dead, being an admirable preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt corruption.</p>
            <p>To Balm I adde what is more neceſſary, as well as more common, I mean Water: They think we Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern People are drowned with a Dropſie; and we ſuſpect they of the South are on fire with a Feavour: This is a Land like <hi>Judea,</hi> (as it is deſcribed <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 7.) <hi>A land of brooks of waters, of fountains and depths, that ſpring out of valleys and hills:</hi>

               <p>TOuching the Inhabitants of this place, we are to underſtand, That when the Iſles of the Gentiles were divided among the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> this Coaſt fell to the lot of <hi>Mizraim</hi> and <hi>Phut,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Cham,</hi> who firſt inhabited it upon the diſperſion; but thinly, until upon <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s approach, the <hi>Canaanites</hi> fled hither from the face of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and built <hi>Tangier,</hi> as will appear more particularly in the deſcription of that place.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> there were ſeven People, whereof ſix came hither: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Hittites,</hi> thoſe ſons of <hi>Anak,</hi> ſo formidable to their Foes, that ſome conceive them named from <hi>Hittah,</hi> to <hi>ſcare</hi> or <hi>frighten,</hi> ſuch the terrible impreſſions of them upon their Enemies!</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Gergaſhites,</hi> whom the <hi>Hieruſalem-</hi>Talmud makes to dwell near <hi>Cinnereth,</hi> on the Eaſt of <hi>Jordan,</hi> whence they ſtole (faith my Author) into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Canaanites,</hi> particularly ſo called, that dwelt by the ſea and coaſt of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Cadmonites,</hi> or Eaſterlings.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Amorites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Arvadites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe men poſſeſſed the place until the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and moſt remote <hi>Punicks</hi> diſpoſſeſſed them; and they, until the <hi>Saracens</hi> turned them out of doors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here are placed the <hi>Cynocephali,</hi> that have heads like Dogs, ſnouts like Swine, and ears like Horſes.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:94431:33"/>
2. Here are the <hi>Sciapodes;</hi> that have ſuch a broad foot, and but one, that they cover their heads from the heat of the Sun, and the violence of the ſhowrs, by lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this up over them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here are the <hi>Gumnoſophantes</hi> that go naked, and fear nothing more then a cloathed man; being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the uſe of Weapons, and one being able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle to chaſe 1000 of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here are the <hi>Blemmiae,</hi> men that walk as St. <hi>Dyonis</hi> did from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rheimes,</hi> without heads, having their eyes and mouths in their breaſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Here are the <hi>Egipans,</hi> that have onely the bodies of men, ſometimes made up of the necks and heads of Horſes, Mules, Aſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this part of <hi>Affrica</hi> may have its ſhare in that ſaying, <hi>Semper aliquid Affrica portat novi, Affrica</hi> is always teeming with ſome new Monſter. The other day not far from <hi>Tangier,</hi> was to be ſeen a Child with an Eagles Bill, Claws, and Feathers too, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to bode ſome alteration in that Government: whereupon the King and his Friends beſtirred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt <hi>Gayland,</hi> and he gathered up all his forces againſt us; breaking the League with us, and upon no terms admitting the Forts we deſigned in thoſe parts to enlarge our quarters.</p>
               <p>But the People that we converſe with, are as other men, ſave that they are of a duskiſh Complexion, and ſomething inclining to black. Their Stature tall and ſlender, having much of the <hi>Arabians</hi> in them. Their Nature ſubtle, ſly, cloſe, and reaching. Their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition active for War and Horſemanſhip, otherwiſe there is not an idler people under the Cope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: the ſimpleſt of them ſhall dwell with you a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94431:34"/>
twelve-month, and you know no more of his minde then the firſt day you ſaw him; and he ſhall give as exact an account of your Actions, Inclinations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, as any man living. They are very proud and ambitious; and ſhall do more for an Obeyſance, then they will ſometimes for a Town; and buy a Feather for their Cap at a higher rate, then they will a Suit of Cloaths to their backs.</p>
               <p>They are as light as the Feathers they wear, and as unconſtant as their Intereſt; never truſted by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> or <hi>Portugez,</hi> but when they had Swords in their hands. Neither are they more wily themſelves, then jealous of others; eſpecially in the caſe of their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe feature is comely, whoſe skin is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately ſoft, whoſe complexion is blackiſh, and the darker the more amiable; whoſe Ornaments are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous onely to pleaſe their Husbands, and keep at home; it being death to ſtir abroad without leave, and a Keeper. Diſtruſt is the nature there of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, and the policy of all; whereby they keep ſtrangers from that acquaintance with their advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and diſadvantages, which otherwiſe they might have. No peace is to be had with them without an Hoſtage, no kindneſs without a ſecurity; it being a ſaying amongſt them, as ſome think, received by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their Anceſtors the <hi>Canaanites, Remember Ai, and diſtruſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence they pretend it is one of the Laws of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> (as they alledged it to the Earl of <hi>Tiveot) That they ſhould not ſuffer either the Chriſtians or the Europeans to build any Forts in their Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So cautious and wary are they, that you can hardly wrong them; and ſo <hi>implacable</hi> if you do, that they will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94431:34"/>
never forgive you. <hi>Remember this</hi> (ſaid <hi>Gayland</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a little Bruſh given them) <hi>two years hence:</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>We will never forget or forgive.</hi> They are too ignoble to be Maſters of that honourable quality of <hi>Paſsing by Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they are themſelves irreconcileable, (it's the Heathens Character, and it is a true one; <hi>Without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful)</hi> ſo they judge others too: If once the <hi>Moore</hi> offendeth, he will never truſt you; once angry, he thinks, and ever ſo: his own unkindneſs makes him as much your enemy out of <hi>caution,</hi> as yours can make him out of <hi>Paſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſtately Gate is that which they obſerve moſt in themſelves, and that which they take moſt notice of, and tender moſt reſpect to in others. The <hi>Moore</hi> loves and fears a <hi>Man;</hi> therefore the talleſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men were employed to treat with that Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who was more guided with his eyes then his ears; with what he ſaw, then what he heard; in a word, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances then Reaſons.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo much Reaſon are they Maſters of, that (though their ſhifts, tricks and unconſtancy argue them men of a little reach, thoſe being onely the little ways and eſcapes of men that have not a ſolid wiſdome to look round about them, and carry on things hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely) they ſay when preſſed to an Affair of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Stay a little, we muſt think what we ſhall do next year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though their Gate ſeem Majeſtick when they ſtrut and walk, yet none more low and deſpicable when they ſit, even in greateſt ſtate: for when our General and Governour was to meet <hi>Gayland</hi> and his Nobility, we found them all upon the ground upon their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, ſitting croſs-legged like Taylors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:94431:35"/>
Their Garments are as ſumptuous as their Gate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick: for though the poorer ſort wear raw Hides, I mean Goatskins, Leather, Hair-cloth, Sack-cloth, and other courſe Veſtinents; yet we ſeldome meet them out of their fine Linen, their Silk, their Scarlet, and their Cloth of Gold. Of all Colours, they, as the Jews, delight in white, as the emblem of purity, cheerfulneſs, knowledge and victory. No work are they more taken with, then with Waſhing: but their moſt ſolemn Colour is Black, and their moſt Royal and Noble one is Blew; the true and natural Dying where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is loſt in all the world but in that place. Their Scarlet and Crimſon is worn by the Nobility; and their Purple, which is but the <hi>Gaudineſs</hi> of Red, allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Gravity</hi> of Blew, is with them as with us, <hi>Royal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next their skin they wear Linen (as moſt cleanly, ſoft and wholſome, but dyed in Violet) looſe, and at night lie in the ſame. Next this, their Coat, which comes down to their feet, as modeſt and grave; and about that a Girdle, which is alſo their Purſe. Fringe is a great Ornament among their Prieſts. Over this a Mantle, which is among the poorer ſort their Coat by day, and by night their Coverlet. As ſoon as they are born, they are Coated; and when Striplings, the Coat is Party-coloured; when Men, the Coat becomes a Cloak; when in the Field, he hath a Coat of Maile tucked on with a Military Girdle, his Bow and Arrow, his Sword, his Buckler, his Pike, and of late his Gun too; to all this the Ancients adde his Staff: all their Turbants or Mithraes of: pleyted Linen or Callico, in the manner of a Pyramide on their heads, and their <hi>Sandals</hi> on their feet, which had Soles, but no upper
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94431:35"/>
Leather, ſave onely the Ligaments whereby they were tied to the Inſtep and croſs of the feet. Hence their frequent Waſhings in thoſe parts, not onely to cool them, but chiefly to clear them from the Gravel, and cleanſe them from the dirt, which thoſe Caſements of their Sandals let in: but for fear of foul weather, they have their Shooes carried after them, as the Jews had; whence the expreſſion, <hi>whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Women are veiled, and as I told you kept in, but nobly apparelled with Garments wrought with Needle-work, or very curiouſly woven; adorned with their Ear-rings, Bracelets, Frontlets, Mufflers: and if they chance to go abroad, Oh how they ſtretch out their necks! how they walk and mince as they go! how they paint their eyes and eye-brows, and gild their nails!</p>
               <p>Thus are they attired; a man would now know how they are diſpoſed. Very idle I told you they are; and what uſually follows upon that, very quarrelſome: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more uſual among them then deadly feuds; 1000 againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet I muſt ſay this for them, Though they are the worſt Enemies, yet they are very good Friends, <hi>i. e.</hi> very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: for let a ſtranger travel amongſt them, and come into town, they will throw Dice who ſhall entertain him. If the Pilgrim ſaith be will to his Inne, thither they flock to him with their gifts and their preſents: if he is not provided, then ſay they, <hi>This mans houſe is yours.</hi> Their reaſon for it they will give you; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You would ask, What is their Religion? what is their Language?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: For their Religion in the uttermoſt parts of it, it's Heatheniſh; and all that we ever obſerved them do, was croſſing their foreheads, kiſſing their hands, bowing their heads to the Sun, and once a year offering a Kid, once a month meeting at their Groves: for theſe Heathens think it not fit to circumſcribe any thing that hath the name of a god within any compaſs, but that Heaven they ſay he dwells in.</p>
               <p>But moſt of them are Turks; and though that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey hath been moſt famous of old for the Studies of Mathematicks and Philoſophy, thoſe great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Avicenna, Averroes;</hi> thoſe ingenious Poets, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Apuleias;</hi> thoſe holy Fathers, <hi>Cyprian, Tertullian, Lactantius, Victor, Fulgentius;</hi> and as famous for the excellent Library in <hi>Fez,</hi> wherein there were 4000 Volumes of Hiſtory, 2000 of Philoſophy, 3000 of Aſtronomy, Geography, and other Mathematicks, that were more worth then all the Libraries in the world, which that Tyrant, made up of ignorance and fury, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leche Shegge,</hi> deſtroyed all but two Books; whereof the one was an ancient Book of the Myſteries of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Religion and Government, and the other the State of <hi>Europe:</hi> yet now is it but the ſeat of Barbariſm, and the habitation of groſs ignorance in every thing but, as you may read more anon, in <hi>Mechanicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Dunkelden</hi> thanked God he knew not a Letter either in the Old Teſtament or the New, but that he had his Proleſs and Ladies Pſalter by heart. The very Prieſt here pretendeth to no more skill then
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94431:36"/>
ſo much Chyrurgery as may ſerve him to circumciſe a Childe, and ſo much Divinity as may ſerve him to read his Alcoran or Teſtament. It was dangerous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Greek, and Hereſie to profeſs Hebrew in this Land ſome two hundred years ago: it may coſt a man his life there to be wiſe above the age; for that they call conjuring againſt the King. But Cities are the Maps of Countries, and Metropolis of Kingdomes: as therefore he who would look into the nature of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> had beſt take a Survey of <hi>London;</hi> ſo he that would be ſatisfied about this Kingdome, needs no more but look into <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Tituan,</hi> whoſe Deſcriptions follow.</p>

                  <p>Very ſtrict are they that nothing comes into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by any means, before ſome Tribute be paid; which is paid double of him that is caught in a deceit. The ſet order or proportion of their Duckats is to pay two Duckats for the worth of a hundred; for Onyx-ſtones one fourth part; but for Wood, Corn, Oxen and Hens, they give nothing at all: Though at the entrance into the City they pay nothing for Rams, yet at the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they give two Liardos a piece, and to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſhambles one: which Governour with his two men, is careful to ſee that the Bread be weight; if
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94431:39"/>
not, the Baker is led about with contempt, and beaten with cudgels.</p>
                  <p>Decently and civilly attired they are, wearing in the Spring-time Garments made of outlandiſh cloth; over which ſhirts, they wear a narrow and half-ſleev'd Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock or Jacket, whereupon they wear a certain wide Garment cloſe before on the Breſt. They wear thin Caps covered with a certain Skarff, which being twice wreathed about their head, hangeth by a knot. They wear neither Hoſe nor Breeches; but in the Spring-time when they ride a Journey, they put on Boots. The poorer ſort have onely a Caſſock, with a Mantle over that, and a courſe Cap; the Doctors and Gentlemen in a wide-ſleev'd Garment; the common ſort in a kind of a courſe white cloth: And ſo all according to their ſtate and ability.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Fez</hi> eat thrice a day, but naſtily and filthily; their Tables low and dirty, their fingers their ſpoons and knives, the ground their ſeats: they never drink before they have done eating, and then a good draught of cold water.</p>

                  <head>The manner of ſolemnizing Marriages.</head>
                  <p>THe Bride and Bridegroom go together to Church, accompanied with their Parents and Kinsfolks, and two Witneſſes of the Covenants and Dowry; which being done, the preſent Gueſts are invited to two Banquets; the one on the Bridegroom's coſt, the other upon the Bride's Fathers, who though he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth but thirty Duckats onely for a Dowry, yet will he ſometimes beſtow every way two or three hundred
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94431:40"/>
Duckats beſides, which is accounted a point of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. The Bridegroom cauſeth his Bride to be carried home in a Cage eight ſquare, accompanied with his Parents and Kinsfolks, with Muſick and Torches, the Bridegrooms Kinsfolk going before, and the Bride fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after, and going unto the great Market-place; and paſſing by the Temple, his Father-in-law takes his leave of the Bridegroom: The Father, Brother, Uncle of the Bride lead her unto the Chamber-door, and there deliver her with one conſent unto the Mother of the Bridegroom, who as ſoon as ſhe is entered, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her foot with his; and forthwith they depart unto a ſeveral Room by themſelves, where ſhe is deflowred, and the purity of her Virginity afore that time, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with a Napkin ſtained in blood, carried in hand about, which if ſhe be not found, the Marriage is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and ſhe with great diſgrace turned home to her Parents.</p>
                  <p>But at a compleat Marriage there are three Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets; the one for men, the other for women, the third ſeven days after for all her Friends. Furthermore, At the Bridegrooms Fathers there are two Feaſts; the one the night before, which is ſpent in Muſick and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; the other the day after, at her brave dreſſing by a company of Women.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many more Ceremonies do they uſe at a Maids Marriage, but a Widows is concluded with leſs a do. They make alſo great Feaſts and Jollities at the circumciſion of their Males, which is upon the ſeventh day after their Birth; but at the Birth of a Daughter, they ſhew not ſo much alacrity.</p>

                  <p>THere are almoſt two hundred Schools in <hi>Fez,</hi> every one of which is in faſhion like a great Hall. The School-Maſters teach their Children to write our or a certain great Table: Every day they expound a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and firmly commit it to memory; which they do right well in the ſpace of ſeven years: Then read they unto their Scholars ſome part of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thography, which, and the other parts of Grammar, is more exactly taught in the Colledges, then in theſe trivial Schools. Their School-Maſters have a very ſmall ſtipend; but when their Boys have learned ſome part of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they preſent certain Gifts unto their Maſter, according to each ones ability. So ſoon as any Boy hath perfectly learned the whole <hi>Alcoran,</hi> his Father inviteth all his Sons School-fellows to a great Banquet; and his Son in coſtly Apparel rides through the Street upon a gallant Horſe; all which, the Governour of the Royal Citadel is bound to lend him: the reſt of his School-fellows being mounted likewiſe on horſe-back, accompany him to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe, ſinging divers Songs to the praiſe of God and <hi>Mahomet:</hi> Then are they brought to a moſt ſumptuous Banquet, whereat all the Kinsfolks of the aforeſaid Boys Father are uſually preſent, every one of whom beſtoweth upon the School-maſter ſome ſmall Gift, and the Boys Father gives him a new Suit of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. The ſaid Scholars likewiſe uſe to celebrate a Feaſt upon the Birth-day of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and then their Fathers are bound to ſend each one of them a Torch

unto the School, which every Boy carrieth in his hand; which being lighted betimes in the Morning, burn till Sun-riſe; in the mean while, certain Singers reſound the Praiſes of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and as ſoon as the Sun is up, all their ſolemnity ceaſeth. The School-Maſters ſell the remnant of the Wax upon the Torches for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Duckats, and ſometimes for more. They are Free-Schools, in which, as alſo in the Colledges, they have two days of Recreation every Week.</p>

Another kind are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers that make Circles, and turn out Devils by the Magick Rule called <hi>Zairagia:</hi> Firſt, they draw many leſſer Circles within the compaſs of a greater: in the firſt they make a Croſs, in the four corners of it they ſet down the four Quarters of the World, and at the end of each Croſs the Poles, and about the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference they paint the four Elements; then they divide the ſame Circle into four parts, and every one of thoſe four parts into ſeven, each part being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by great Arabian characters, every Element contaming twenty eight characters: in the third cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

they ſet down the ſeven Planets, in the fourth the twelve Signs, in the fifth the twelve Latine Names of the Month, in the ſixth the twenty eight hours of the Moon, in the ſeventh the three hundred ſixty five days of the Year, and about the middle thereof, the four Winds: Then take they one onely character or letter of the Queſtion asked, multiplying the ſame by all the particulars aforementioned, and the ſum total they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide after a certain manner, placing it in ſome room according to the quality of the character, and as the Element requireth wherein the ſaid character is found, without a figure: all which being done, they mark that figure which ſeemeth to agree with the aforeſaid number or ſum produced, wherewith they proceed as they did with the former, till they have found twenty eight characters, whereof they make a word that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth the queſtion demanded; this Word or Speech they make a Verſe of, which is an infallible anſwer to the queſtion propounded.

                  <p n="1">1. THe firſt is the Elephant, plentiful in the Land of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and taken by the Inhabitants thus: They make a round hedge of Boughs and Rafts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſpace round on the one ſide of them, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a door ſtanding upon the plain ground, which may be lift up with Ropes, wherewith they can eaſily ſtop the ſaid open place or paſſage: the Elephant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to take his reſt under the ſhady boughs, entreth the hedge or incloſure, where the Hunters by drawing the ſaid Rope, and faſtening the door, impriſon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is Girapha, headed like a Camel, eared like an Ox, and footed like a Horſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their Camels and Dromedaries, their ſtrength, treaſure and pleaſure: wherefore if you ask how rich a man is? they will ſay, he hath ſo many Camels: they are watred but once in five days, and can go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water or provender fifteen. When they are tired they will not go for beating, but with ſinging ſuch ſongs as they are pleaſed with. The ſwifteſt of them will carry you an hundred miles a day, and the ſloweſt but eight. They teach them to dance thus: They take a young Camel, and put him for half an hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a place like a Bath-ſtove prepared for the ſame purpoſe, the floor whereof is hot with fire: then play they without upon a Drum; whereat the Camel, not ſo much in regard of the noyſe, as of the hot pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that offendeth his feet, lifteth up one leg after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the manner of a Dance; and having been accuſtomed to this exerciſe for the ſpace of a year and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94431:43"/>
ten moneths, they then preſent him to the publick view of the people; whenas hearing the noyſe of a Drum, and remembring the time when he trod upon the hot floor, he preſently falleth a dancing and leaping: and ſo Uſe being turned into a kinde of Nature, he perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obſerveth the ſame cuſtome.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth is the <hi>Barbary-</hi>horſe, brought up in the wild deſert, and broken by <hi>Arabians</hi> ſince <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s time. The tryal of theſe Horſes is the overtaking of a Beaſt called Lant or Oſtrich; which if he can do, he is worth 1000 Duckats. Uſed they are for Hunting, fed with Camels milk, and never rid while in Paſture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The next ſort of Beaſts is, 1. The white Ox, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dant</hi> or <hi>Lant,</hi> of whoſe skin they make ſheilds. 2. <hi>Adimaim,</hi> like a Ram in every thing but his long Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cars, of whoſe wool they make Coverlets, as of their Milk Butter and Cheeſe; whoſe tayls, as do the <hi>Barbary</hi> Rams, weigh ſome ten, ſome twenty pound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece: all the fat of them is in their tayl. 3. The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who the hotter the Country is, the fiercer; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards Spring-time, and their time of coupling, when nothing is ſpared by them but a woman that ſheweth her privy-parts; at the ſight whereof they cry, caſt their eyes to the ground, and depart. 4. The ſpotted Leopard, that never killeth any thing but when toyled by Hunters into an extreamity: whoſoever lets a Leopard eſcape his Toyl, muſt feaſt all the Hunters of that Province. 5. The Dabuh, that is brought out of his Den with ſinging.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Civer-Cat, whoſe excrement, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their ſweat, they gather thus thrice a day: they keep the young ones with milk, bran, and fleſh
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94431:44"/>
in cages and grates; and firſt they drive them up and down the Grate till they ſweat, and then they take the ſaid ſweat from under their flanks, their ſhoulders, their necks and their tayls: which excrement of ſweat is onely called Civet.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Apes and Coneys run up and down in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, one of them always watching the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans coming.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Crocodile that goeth on four legs like a Lizzard, not above a cubit and an half high; its tayl is full of knots; it lurks about the banks of a River, craftily laying wait for men and beaſts that come the ſame way; about whom ſuddainly it winds its tayl, draweth them into the water, and devoureth them. In eating they move the upper Jaw onely, their nether Jaw being joyned unto their breaſt-bone. I ſaw them running and gaping on the banks-ſide, and little Birds flying in and out of their mouths; which ſometimes they would catch when they had eaten up the worms in their jaws, but that a little prick upon the Birds head ſo galleth them that they muſt let it go.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Hydra, againſt whoſe poyſon there is no remedy but the cutting off the infected part.</p>
