         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the French mode; but thoſe which are Genuine, according to our own. Hence it comes to paſſe that <hi>generation</hi> is pronounced <hi>jeneration,</hi> and <hi>ginger</hi> is pronounced <hi>jinger.</hi> The ſame is true of <hi>gely, gender, gentle, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, George, german, giant, Regiſter,</hi> and ſo of all the reſt that can be named, becauſe they are all borrowed words. Whereas <hi>get</hi> is pronounced γεt, and <hi>give</hi> is pronounced γιve, ſo alſo <hi>girle, girdle, together, begin,</hi> and all the reſt that can be named, becauſe they are genuine. And this Rule is ſo general that it admits of no exception: which even learned men not obſerving have ſought for the reaſon of this diverſity in the Conſonants that follow, and not in the Nation to which the words owe their beginning, or firſt cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, inquiring what <hi>ge</hi> ſignifies before <hi>t,</hi> and what before <hi>n:</hi> and by the like kind of vain inveſtigations; not unlike the obſervations of thoſe who look for the wind in the Weather-cocks Tail. Nor will it be amiſs [the occaſion offering it ſelf] to conſider the pronunciation of <hi>Arch,</hi> in divers words: which in ſome is pronounced <hi>Arſh,</hi> in others <hi>Ark,</hi> as for example, we pronounce <hi>Architect</hi> as <hi>Arkitect,</hi> and not as <hi>Arſhitect.</hi> So <hi>Archangel</hi> we pronounce <hi>Arkangel</hi> and not <hi>Arſhangel.</hi> Whereas we pronounce <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> as <hi>Arſhbiſhop,</hi> and not <hi>Arkbiſhop,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Archpriest</hi> is pronounced <hi>Arſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt.</hi> The reaſon is becauſe the words <hi>Architect</hi> and <hi>Archangel</hi> come to us immediately and purely from the Latin, and not from the French, for they have no ſuch word as <hi>Archangel,</hi> bur their word is <hi>Archange</hi> and no more, nor is there any of the French Fancy in <hi>Architect,</hi> which it may call its own: whereas <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> ſeemes to have a nearer affinity to <hi>Archeveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> in the French, then to <hi>Archiepiſcopus</hi> in the Latin, <note n="*" place="margin">But indeed the dirivation of <hi>Biſhop</hi> from either, is ſo obſcure, that its accounted a word of our own (as all words juſtly are wherein there's a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis) and the compoſition of it with <hi>Arch,</hi> to be our own, and therefore we give it our own pronunciation, which herein agrees with the French as nere as our tongues can frame themſelves to it.</note>as for <hi>Archprieſt,</hi> it is manifeſtly derived from <hi>Archpreſtre,</hi> the French word. Some alledg the foreſaid way of conſidering what comes after: As for Example. If <hi>Arch</hi> comes before a Conſonant, then ſay they, it is pronounced <hi>Arſh,</hi> but if after a Vowel, then it is pronounced <hi>Ark,</hi> but they are confuted by <hi>Arch-enimy, Arch-inſtrument, Archer, Arched, Arch-heretick,</hi> &amp;c. all which are pronounced by <hi>Arſh.</hi> But to return and apply althings that have been ſaid, to our preſent purpoſe. <hi>Dervorgille</hi> being genuine, the <hi>G</hi> is to be pronounced as γ without the aid of thoſe forementioned interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to make it good.</p>

The <hi>area</hi> whereof (Garden and all I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be meant) was 96 Foot in length from North to South, and 47 Foot in breadth at the South end, and 41 at the other.

                  <p>But, to return, this unnatural War receiving now a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and thoſe Victories [as all gained upon Rebels do] having made the <hi>King more King, and the Subject more ſubject,</hi> a ſerenity of times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued proper for an improvement of <hi>John dd Balliols</hi> Foundation; which improvement owes it ſelf in the firſt place to the piety of <hi>Dervorgille</hi> his Lady Dowager; and next, to the bounty of ſucceeding Benefactors. But before I deſcend ſo low, I ſhall touch upon the motives, wherewith our Founder ſerv'd himſelf to build this Colledge, then ſtyled by the name of <hi>Balliol-hall:</hi> The firſt doubtleſs, was the honor of God, it being the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50723:10"/>
pole upon which his own Loyalty to the King, and the Charity of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorgille,</hi> in purſuance of his Deſign, did move: whereof ſhe hath given a large Teſtimony in the Preamble to her Statutes, which ſhe left unto us, though attended with the common Errors of thoſe times. The ſecond was the good of his own Soul, as thereby purchaſing the Prayers of his Beneficiaries for his good ſucceſs in the ſervice he went upon, and for the better fitting of his Soul for heavenly Manſions, by what accidents ſoever it ſhould be divorced from his Body. I eaſily yield too, that he alſo ſwimming with the ſtream of thoſe Times, would not be diſpleaſed at the thoughts of ſome future Commemoration of himſelf, at the leaſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that it might do him good, but could do him no harm: And more I ſhall not need to ſay, there being not wanting ſuch as are apt enough to draw hence Arguments againſt Church and Colledge Lands, and to make the higheſt improvement of thoſe as well as of theſe, to the juſtification of their own Sacriledge. But where ſuch Prayers made had reſpect to the re-uniting of the ſoul to the body, they are like to get but little by it. Commemoration of good Perſons hath been anciently received in the Church; inſomuch, that they no oftner celebrated their Divine Services, then they recited the Holy <hi>Diptychs,</hi> as may be ſeen not onely in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hierarchy of <hi>Dionyſius Areop. c.</hi> 3. but, which is more, in St. <hi>Baſils</hi> Liturgy, tranſlated by <hi>Maſius</hi> out of the Syriack, and uſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally through the whole Greek Church. In theſe were written onely the names of Perſons both living and dead: That wherein the names of the dead were written, was recited as propos'd thereby to the Church as a pattern of their imitation, and occaſion of Thankſgiving: But the other wherein the names of the living were regiſtred, was recited that the Church might follow them in their practice; or elſe, by their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might get them confirmed in good, or reform'd from the Error of their evil way. But in proceſs of time theſe names, it ſeems, ſwelling to ſuch a multitude, they contented themſelves with a general Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, onely a few Particulars excepted, as may be ſeen in orher Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies. So that at laſt, the <hi>Diptychs</hi> contained the whole Canon of the Latine Maſs, as <hi>Lindanus</hi> obſerveth upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> Liturgy in <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> and that out of the ancient <hi>Diptychs</hi> of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Church in <hi>Biſcay</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> for the faſhion whereof, ſaith he, they were diſtinct, a foot and a half high, <hi>

But be the Number what it will, it was to receive <hi>an increaſe or diminution according to the increaſe or decreaſe of the Revenue,</hi> provided they exceeded not their ſet Allowance; which was ſo large, that of poor Scholars [which they were to be at their firſt reception] they might become rich, as is obſervable out of the Statutes of <hi>Dervorgille,</hi> and particularly may be noted of <hi>Walter de Fodringheye, the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Principal</hi> [for ſo the Head was then called] that ever was of the Houſe: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen out of the number of the Scholars, did, without any addition to his former allowance, over and above the fruit of his own providence, grow too big for the place; inſomuch, that having reſigned it, he became at laſt a Benefactor to this Foundation, whereof he had been formerly a <note n="†" place="margin">Eight pence then as good as a mark now, and more.</note>Beneficiary, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1311. as by the Letters Patents of the then King does appear.

                     <hi>eleven pence per week,</hi> made by Sir <hi>Philip Somervile,</hi> in caſe his Rents yielded ſo much, as well for the 16 Scholars of the ancient Foundation,

as for the 6 Scholars of his own; though it were intended to be * <hi>twelve pence per week</hi> by Sir <hi>William Felton,</hi> who to that end, as alſo for the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the number of Scholars, gave us the Benefice of <hi>Abboldeſly,</hi> and the Manor thereof, in the <hi>Fourteenth Year</hi> of <hi>King Edward the third</hi> over <hi>England,</hi> and over <hi>France</hi> the firſt; which was at, or immediately before the time of Sir <hi>Philip Scmerviles</hi> Statutes.

Some have Knighted our Founder, and ſay, That our Colledge was built by Sir <hi>Jo: Balliol,</hi> being then an Exile, 1262. But I demand,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50723:12"/>
How could he be an Exile in <hi>England,</hi> and himſelf an Engliſh Man, and three or four of his Anceſtors? or what Record [for I never found any] is it that gives him the Title of <hi>Miles,</hi> or <hi>Eques auratus?</hi> The reaſon of their gratification might be in favour of his Son <hi>John, King of Scots,</hi> leaſt the ſaid <hi>King</hi> ſhould be accounted an <hi>Hibris,</hi> in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his ſenſe in his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; or a Mule in the ſenſe of thoſe, who by a like Metaphor have called <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſo, for being more noble on his Mothers then Fathers ſide; and that by regarding his Perſonal Atchievements onely, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant perhaps of his noble Extraction: But I am afraid they were led hereunto by the Title of <hi>Dominus,</hi> given him in Latin, which they had no other Engliſh for but <hi>Sir.</hi> Some come in and ſay, That albeit <hi>John Balliol King of Scots</hi> builded not this Colledge, yet he Endowed it, or at leaſt made large additions to the Revenue. But if this be true, then this Revenue muſt be in <hi>France, England,</hi> or in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The firſt I never heard any one affirm, though he might have enough there to do it withal, about <hi>Gailzard</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Caſtle whether he retired himſelf, and where he dyed very old and blinde, as <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> writes; albeit the other four fore-named Seigneuries the ſame <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> elſewhere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth to have been given to <hi>Edw: of Caernarvon</hi> with the French Lady, which he the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> marryed. The ſecond I have ſearched for in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and found nothing of it. The third were moſt likely to be found amongſt the Scotiſh Records there: But theſe were then ſo lately brought thither by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that they had not been digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into method, <hi>and now are return'd again (ſince His Majeſties return) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Petition of the Scots, inaſmuch as they concerned their Eſtates, as was pretended: But upon ſearch made, there was found the whole proceeding in the matter of the Covenant, which</hi> Argyle <hi>and his Complices would not have had diſcovered.</hi> Till ſome of theſe can be produced to prove their Aſſertion, it muſt paſs for a Fable: and if any one of them were true, 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable we might find ſomething in our Treaſury which might give us a light in the buſineſs; it being very ſtrange that our Predeceſſors ſhould have been ſo careful as to have preſerved perſonal &amp; ſuch tranſient things, as old Bonds for the payment of monies, which now for hundreds of Years have been paſt recovery, meanwhile neglect things of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern as the real Endowment of our Colledge. Now for the ſecond, Where could any Land fall into the hands of <hi>John Balliol King of Scots</hi> power to take away? If you ſay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> indeed you may ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to believe it, then to take the pains to go thither and find it out. But I demand, How our Founder being Engliſh, ſhould leave Land to this Colledge in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who never had any there, unleſs in right of his Lady <hi>Dervorgille?</hi> The which, had <hi>John Balliol King of Scots</hi> taken it away, certainly his Son and Succeſſor <hi>Edward Balliol,</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again, ſince we find him ſo much a Well-willer to his Grandfathers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50723:13"/>
Benefaction, that he confirmed the Land and Statutes unto us, which Sir <hi>Philip Somervile</hi> gave, as hereafter more at large ſhall appear. I might let theſe things bleed to death upon theſe Conſiderations; but that which at once cuts the Throat of the Diſpute, is, That we find <hi>John de Balliol,</hi> afterwards <hi>King of Scots,</hi> confirming his Fathers and Mothers Charity, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew by the Deed it ſelf under Seal, ſo far was he from the guilt of this Sacriledge. Indeed this <hi>Balliol,</hi> when <hi>King,</hi> making with his Scots an impreſſion upon the Territories of <hi>Edward the firſt, King of England,</hi> who had faſtened the Crown on his Head before, was rendered odious to the Engliſh for this his Ingratitude; which alſo occaſion'd <hi>the ſaid King Edward</hi> his Demand of thoſe three fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seignuries, with 60000 Crowns in Gold upon the Marriage aforeſaid: which was done, ſaith <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> to be revenged on <hi>Balliol</hi> for joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the King of <hi>France</hi> againſt him: And it happens in Fame as in Fortune, that <hi>He who is falling ſhall not want help to his precipitation.</hi> 'Tis the firſt ſtone that is thrown at a Man, which may be ſaid to kill him, all the reſt being caſt upon him by example: and thus it fared with <hi>John de Balliol King of Scots:</hi> He was guilty of this Ingratitude, and therefore Fame muſt render him ſo of the other Crime. But Arguments ſeem not to be wanting for his defence in this too. The worſt that can be ſaid of him is a kind of an Apology for him, and 'tis of <hi>Tacitus, viz.</hi> That <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia eouſque laeta ſunt, dum exolvi poſſunt; ubi multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur:</hi> which is as much as we are wont to ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>great Injuries and great Curteſies are never forgiven.</hi> The ſecond is, That having now no need more of the King of <hi>England</hi> for his ſettlement, he thought hereby to come into favor with his Scots for his preſervation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt their affections before for ſwearing Fealty to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which his Scots would be tender of ſuffering him to do; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were a due, in regard the Scotiſh Kingdom, from the very firſt eſtabliſhment thereof in <hi>Britany,</hi> hath been held of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Vaſſalage:</hi> whoſe ſeveral Kings Homages are Recorded in Verſe by <hi>Harding,</hi> even from the time of <hi>Athelſton,</hi> as we find in <hi>Bakers</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle in the time of <note n="*" place="margin">And this Homage was demanded by K. H. 8. and juſtified by the ſword. <hi>See our Chronicles in temp.</hi> H. 8.</note>
                     <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. The third is, That paying his devoir to the King of <hi>England,</hi> he would have infring'd the League with, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the protection of <hi>France,</hi> ſignified by the double Treſſure counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowr'd, wherewith the Scotiſh Lion is guarded. The fourth is, that of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> who writes, That <hi>Macduffe</hi> a great Man in <hi>Scotland,</hi> being ſlain, his Brother little hoping for Juſtice there, appealed to the King of <hi>England</hi> for redreſs: at the hearing whereof, <hi>Balliol King of Scots</hi> being commanded to deſcend from the Bench to the Bar, took the matter in great indignation. The fifth is, That herein the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation laid upon <hi>John de Balliol</hi> King of Scots, was the leſs, when in the deciſion of the Controverſie between the ſaid <hi>Balliol</hi> and <hi>Bruis,</hi> he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50723:13"/>
had done no more then what he muſt have done to any of his Subjects; it being clear that <hi>Balliol</hi> was Heir at the Common Law to the Crown of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Nay had he, in a Caſe between Subject and Subject, determined an Inheritance to an Heir of a younger Siſter, he might have aſſigned to the right Heir ſomething in Compenſation: but what Compenſation could have been made for a Kingdom? This Act therefore of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, rendred him the <hi>Juſtinian</hi> of the Scots, as other things gained him the title of the <hi>Engliſh Juſtinian.</hi> From whence nevertheleſs ſome [as <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> notes] have endeavored to eclipſe the Honor of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and of that <hi>Bruis</hi> [who by the Scots was ſurnamed <hi>The Noble]</hi> ſaying, That King <hi>Edward</hi> promiſed <hi>Bruis</hi> the deciſion of the Crown to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, he would hold it of him in Vaſſalage; and that <hi>Bruis</hi> ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That he would not betray the Liberties of his Country for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and yet that the ſame <hi>Bruis</hi> afterwards, at the Fight at <hi>Dunbar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Balliol,</hi> ſhould privately charge all his Friends to give back from the reſt of the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon a promiſe made him by King <hi>Edward,</hi> that he ſhould be King in caſe of Victory: which being ſo done, did ſo diſanimate the reſt of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they yielded the day, and became a ſubject of ſpoyl to the Enemy. But King <hi>Edward, Though he loved the Treaſon, eſteemed the recompenſe too good for the Traytor.</hi>

Secondly, becauſe no mention is made [in this Writing] of St. <hi>Katerine,</hi> which is an Argument that it was of ancienter date then the Biſhops Letters, which entitles her as well as the <hi>B.

The French Hiſtorians [as it ſeems by the Treaſury of the Hiſtory of <hi>France]</hi> make mention of a certain ſilken Banner of a Vermillion colour, call'd <hi>Oriflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> from the Flames of Fire and colour of Gold repreſented therein; which Enſign they ſay, was never born but in a Battle againſt Infidels: but when once their Kings abuſed it againſt the Chriſtians, it vaniſhed as it came, that is, by Miracle. This Standard was kept in the Church of St. <hi>Denys</hi> in <hi>France</hi> (near unto <hi>Paris)</hi> wherein, as in our <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey, their Kings are Interred: But ſome ſay, that the Engliſh being rendered Maſters of <hi>Paris,</hi> burned the Banner with the Maid of <hi>Orleans.</hi> This <hi>Oriflamme,</hi> they ſay, was the Cope of St. <hi>Denys;</hi> and that their Kings not able to have the Body of St. <hi>Martin</hi> entire for their ordinary Guard, found a means to have his Cope, which in French is called <hi>Chappe</hi> or <hi>Chape;</hi> and commonly their Kings, who could not aſſiſt at the publick Service, were wont to have Clergy Men who followed them with <hi>portable</hi> Oratories, which they called <hi>Chappels</hi> and <hi>Chapelains,</hi> from this <hi>Chappe,</hi> h. e. <hi>Cope</hi> of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and that other of St. <hi>Denys:</hi> and ſo much for the derivation of the word <hi>Chappel.</hi> Though portable Oratories <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

Beſides a Grant made of the Domaine Lands in <hi>Mickle Benton</hi> by <hi>Rokysborow,</hi> an Agreement was made for the maintenance of ſix Scholars above the ancient number, and one Chaplain, to be maintain'd out of the Lands given by Sir <hi>Philip Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyle, viz.</hi> Two Cottages and ſix Acres of Land, with the Appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in great, <hi>h. e.</hi> in <hi>Mickle Benton</hi> aforeſaid, which are call'd <hi>The buts:</hi> and in the Statutes of Sir <hi>Philip Somervile</hi> the Advowſon of the Church of <hi>Mickle Benton</hi> is alſo mentioned, with <hi>duabus carrucatis terre arabilis, &amp; viginti acris prati; h. e.</hi> as ſome interpret it, as much as two Ploughs will Till in a Year, <hi>Charrue</hi> (which comes from *<note n="✚" place="margin">(Or <hi>Carru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> from <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue)</hi> the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Gauls</hi> (now pre erved in the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages) being not a corruption of the Latin, as the vulgar Error is; but the condition wherein it now is, proceeds from the light Impreſſion that the Latin hath made upon it (as the learn'd <hi>Breerwood</hi> obſerves in his Enquiries of Languages) And it is doubtleſs antienter then the Latin it ſelf, having Declenſions and Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its own, which reſemble not thoſe of the Latin at all: Declining all Words by Articles, as all Eaſtern Languages (except the Arabick) do, and not by variation of Terminations of Caſes, as the Latin and Greek are wont to do.</note>

The next Year after this, the Rectory of <hi>Mickle Benton</hi> was appropriated to the Colledge by the Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as appears by divers Writings.

The which Rectory was appropriated to this Houſe by Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> a competency being reſerved for the ſupport of the Vicar there: by whom it was alſo granted, that the Scholars might continue in the Houſe after they became Maſters and Doctors, having been formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to vant and beggary [by the foreſaid rigour of <hi>Dervorgilles</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes] All which, though it appears by a Publick Notary, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1520. yet I ſhall fetch it from the Originals, and therein you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reaſons why, I ſaid before, this Benefaction was about the ſame Year that Sir <hi>Philip Somerviles</hi> Statutes were made, or the Year before. For the Deed of Gift from Sir <hi>William Felton</hi> of <hi>Abbotſley</hi> Rectory, <hi>cum pertinentiis,</hi> to the Maſter and Scholars, and their ſucceſſors for ever, was firſt made <hi>in festo Sancti Martini in Hieme, Anno Dom.</hi> 1340. confirmed by Letters Patents, 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. over <hi>England,</hi> and over <hi>France</hi> the firſt; which was a Year before Sir <hi>Philip Somerviles</hi> firſt Grant, which was 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. as I have already noted. Livery and Seiſin was likewiſe given by him to <hi>Balliol</hi> Colledge, <hi>Anno</hi> 1340. as by another appears. Yet I find another Deed of Gift of <hi>Abbotſley,</hi> of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Feltons,</hi> dated 1341, <hi>Robert Skelton</hi> being then Chancellor of the Univerſity, which was after Sir <hi>Philip Somerviles</hi> gift, and after his Statutes confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Edw.

But the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Abbotſley</hi> for the Vicar, and conſequently the Appropriation of the Rectory to the Colledge was not made till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1361, by <hi>John Synwell</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> which was 20 Years after, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by <hi>John Williams</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>

And if there be any Ambiguity, the</hi> Biſhop <hi>was to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.

After this, the next thing I find was a Leaſe made of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botſley</hi> for 45 marks a Year, dated <hi>Anno</hi> 1374. (Frank Pledge and Court held, 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2.) A ſecond made to <hi>Robert Bateman</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sekyll,</hi> reſerving the keeping of the Court, and all Emoluments thereof, and of the Tenements, <hi>Anno</hi> 1386. A third ſet for 43 marks <hi>per annum, Anno</hi> 1389. And <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1395. there happened a difference between the Colledge and <hi>William Willeſthorn</hi> Vicar, on the one part, and the Pariſh on the other, touching the maintenance of the Clerk of <hi>Abbotſley</hi> Pariſh Church, in relation to ringing <hi>Hora aurorae,</hi> or <hi>The Day-bell,</hi> and <hi>Ignite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> h. e. <hi>Courfue,</hi> and Offices done for the Saints, &amp;c. This was heard before the Archdeacon <hi>(Tho: Barry</hi> one of the Fellows being made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for the Colledge) and compoſed; the Pariſhioners promiſing to be perpetually ſilent for the time to come, under the Seals of ſix of them ſet to the Inſtrument; and that the Colledge and Vicar for thoſe things ſhould be left to their own liberty. As for the Licenſe granted by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> for the Scholars continutnce in the Colledge till Maſters and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, it was neceſſary, (though made after Sir <hi>Philip Somervyles</hi> Statutes, whereby the inconveniences of <hi>Dervorgylles</hi> Statutes were obviated) in as much as her Statutes were ſtill in force; the which interfering with thoſe of Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> occaſioned future grievances and alterations.

Jurors five, Tenants admitted three. <hi>Item,</hi> a Leaſe ſet to <hi>Anthony Hare</hi> for three Lives, dated 1615. at the uſual Rent: The ſaid <hi>Anthony</hi> hath hereby power granted him to keep a Court Yearly, and is enjoyned to return the Court-Rolls to the Colledge; for which, 3 <hi>s.</hi> was to be allowed (which Covenant, the Tenants there have never obſerved) the Colledge diſcharging him of Vicar-Biſhop and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon.

In the laſt place, I find a true and a perfect Terrar of all Lands, Domaine and Copy-hold, taken <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. 1621.

To theſe Statutes thus confirmed by <hi>Edward Balliol,</hi> is put the Seal of Sir <hi>Philip Somervyle,</hi> which is a Field <hi>(Semée)</hi> powdered with <hi>Croſſes Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chées,</hi> charged with <hi>Three Spread-Eagles:</hi> wherein it is provided, amongſt other things, That nothing contrariant to the Statutes of the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be binding to theſe: of which ſort, are the Rules given to Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be choſen to the profeſſion of Divinity, when once they become Regents; and after ſo many Years, to become Bachelors in Divinity, &amp;c. as having no Foundation in, but rather overthrowing the Statutes of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorgille,</hi> which allow neither Maſters nor Bachelors in Divinity to be in the Houſe; the rigour whereof was fain to be taken off by the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as hath been ſaid. But to take things in that order as they are in theſe Statutes of Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> the firſt for our purpoſe, is, That over and above the 16 Fellows, which had of old been in the Houſe, the Fellows wete to chooſe ſix Scholars, born in places neareſt to the ſite of the Lands by him given, and thoſe <hi>the pooreſt, the beſt and the greateſt Proficients.</hi> 2. They were to chooſe a Maſter by a formal Election, to be called by the Principal or his Vicegerent; which Maſter was no ſooner elected, then they were bound to preſent him: 1. To the Lords of the Mannor of <hi>Wicknore</hi> in <hi>Northumberland</hi> (ſo long as they were of the Poſterity of the ſaid Sir <hi>Philip.)</hi> 2. To the Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> or to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary. 3. To the Warden of the Monks of <hi>Durham</hi> (now Trinity Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) and others, Maſters of Art: who without all contradiction were to admit him. The which <hi>Durham</hi> Colledge, or place of the Monks of <note place="margin">Guil: Camden &amp; alii per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringuntur.</note>
                     <hi>Durham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britania</hi> will have to be built and endowed by <hi>Thomas Hatfeild</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Godwin</hi> of Biſhops (in the Life of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Hatfeild) Pitſaeus</hi> and others whom they follow. <note n="*" place="margin">Which <hi>Durham</hi> Colledge, <hi>Pitſaeus</hi> ſays, was for eight Monks and ſeven Clerks, to be placed there at the diſcretion of the Prior of <hi>Durham:</hi> But they had a Prior of their own, as is evident from theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</note>Put it is clear to be otherwiſe from the very date of theſe Statutes, which was <hi>Anno Dom:</hi> 1340. whereas <hi>Durham</hi> Colledge, pretended to be built by the ſaid <hi>Hatfeild,</hi> was Founded <hi>Anno</hi> 1350. and <hi>Hatfeild</hi> himſelf not advanced to be Biſhop of that Sea before about 1345. But it's yet more evident, in that theſe Statutes were confirmed (as we ſee) by <hi>Richard</hi> (that is <hi>Richard Bury)</hi> Biſhop of that Sea, and immediate Predeceſſor to the aforeſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> which had been 10 Years before the Foundation of <hi>Hatfeilds</hi> pretended Colledge, had the ſame been of no greater Antiquity, and ſo our Maſter had been to be preſented to a mere <hi>Idea:</hi> And therefore that which the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Godwin,</hi> in the Life of the ſaid Learned and pious Prelate <hi>Richard Bury</hi> aforeſaid, ſays to be an erroneous Tradition, is a very truth, or nearer to it then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely, That the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> Founded the ſaid <hi>Durham</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, unto the Warden or Prior whereof [by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of him and his Society upon the Priory of the Cathedral of <hi>Durham]</hi> our Maſter was to be preſented.

But to return, they were in the third place to chooſe ſix Fellows out of the whole number for the ſtudy of Divinity, whereof they were to be capable as ſoon as they became Regents: and the Parties ſo Elected, in the ſixth Year of their Election, were to oppoſe; and in the ninth or tenth Year, to <hi>read the Maſter of the Sentences</hi> [which anſwers to our <hi>Reading the Epiſtles of St. Paul, and is the Formality of a Batchelor in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity]</hi> unleſs hindred by ſome lawful and reaſonable cauſe. Fourthly, They were to remember the Benefactors in the Grace, as well as Offices. Fifthly, Of the Chaplains which were then divers, they were to have one perpetual in the Houſe to be choſen by Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and his Heirs, &amp;c. Sixthly, The number of Scholars to be deſign'd for Divinity, were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe according to the increaſe of the Revenues [provided that his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and thoſe of the ancient Foundation, had 11 <hi>d. per</hi> week] unleſs future Benefactors ſhould otherwiſe Ordain.

                  <p>In which Letter, he very truly profeſſes the Patronage of the ſaid Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice to remain in us, and our readineſs to aſſiſt him in the overthrowing of the Leaſe, &amp;c. For my Lord of <hi>Lincoln, Williams</hi> (whoſe Chaplain Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> was) did by his Letter to the Maſter and Fellows [at the reading whereof I was preſent] ſignifie, That the ſaid Living was in the Lapſe, with deſire that we would give Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> a Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if ſo, then his Lordſhip would adde only a Corroboration thereof, to the end that the Colledge might not ſuffer in their right to the Advowſon: which deſire of his Lordſhip we yielded unto, and gave him a Preſentation under Seal. But what uſe he made thereof, I cannot ſay: but two of our Fellows did afterwards travel to <hi>Lincoln</hi> Aſſizes to teſtifie on his behalf, where Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> obtained only a ſpecial Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; the which (Troubles coming on) enforced Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> to a Compoſition. But it ſeems by the aforeſaid Letter, that in 1647. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived his Suit, and then brought my Lord to terms, which, as I have heard, made up Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>'s allowance, in all, to be worth 60 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> with the 22 <hi>l. per annum</hi> reſerved upon the Leaſe. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were well performed to him, or he pleaſed with the allowance, I cannot ſay; but ſo it was, that, ſince the King came in, he tryed another fall with my Lord <hi>Caſtleton,</hi> who, at the Aſſizes, laid him on his back u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

[He was either ſurprized in the buſineſs, or elſe he wanted a good and able Lawyer to extricate him out of that preſent difficulty; ſuch was St. <hi>Ives</hi> in the matter of his poor Hoſteſs at <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> We read in the Annals of <hi>Britania Armorica,</hi> written in French by <hi>Alan Bouchard,</hi> but afterwards augmented and Printed in French at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1531. that in the Year 1303. this St. <hi>Ives</hi> was eminent, born in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Treguier,</hi> one of the nine in <hi>Britany</hi> aforeſaid, all whoſe Bps. are ſuffragans to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tours:</hi> He is famous (amongſt other things) for pleading the cauſe of that his Hoſteſs, a poor Widow of <hi>Tours,</hi> againſt two crafty Merchants, who delivered her a full Purſe, upon condition that ſhe ſhould not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

it to either ſingly, unleſs they came both together. A little after, one of them, under pretext of an urgent neceſſity, required the Purſe of her, which ſhe delivered to him, pretending that his Fellow ſtood by the goods he had bought in the Market in expectation of the money. The Purſe was no ſooner thus delivered to the one, then the other came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; nor would he take any anſwer, but brings his Action againſt her for 200 Crowns of gold, which he pretended to have been in the Purſe. The Night before the hearing, St. <hi>Ives</hi> came to her Houſe, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what news, ſhe ſaid, Very bad on her part, for to morrow ſhe was in danger of being condemned in 200 Crowns of gold. St. <hi>Ives</hi> received a relation of the matter, bade her fear nothing. On the morrow, the Caſe being opened by the Plaintiff, St. <hi>Ives</hi> ſaid, That he was for the Widow (he was a profeſſed Advocate for thoſe who went to Law in <hi>forma pauperu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> and that ſhe had with much adoe procured the money, and ſaid, Let them according to their Conditions come both in place, and they ſhould receive it; which anſwer, the Judge allowed of. Whereupon that cunning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant waxed pale with fear; and the matter being further examined, he was hanged within three days, as one who might have put Iron into the Purſe inſtead of Gold. How many cheats were here complicated, I ſhall not now ſtand to obſerve, nor how the Law is many times made uſe of to undoe perſons, and rob them of their right. This St. <hi>Ives</hi> was, upon the Petition of rhe Country, Sainted 50 Years after his death. He was a Prieſt and an Advocate too, and was buryed in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Treguier,</hi> with this Epitaph, <hi>Sanctus Ivo fuit Brito; Advocatus, &amp; non latro; res miranda.</hi> For want of ſuch a Lawyer, our <hi>Hollingworth</hi> was fain to become non-ſuited.] The rectifying of which miſtake (if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it) was prevented by his death: who indeed, during his life, did ſo well ſeaſon that great Pariſh with his Doctrine, that he left not behind him one Factious or Fanatick perſon in the place. But a queſtion may be made, Why the Maſters of the Houſe, bound by Oath to accept of the Preſentation to the Rectory of <hi>Fillingham,</hi> by vertue of the foreſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of 1571, did ſuffer it to Lapſe into the hands of Strangers? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I anſwer, That that Obligation was taken off by a later Decree; the Tenor whereof is as followeth.</p>

And in the tenth of <hi>Ric:</hi> 2. I find a Licence from the King to <hi>Hamond Haskman</hi> and <hi>Thomas Cinlow,</hi> to give three Tofts and one Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with the appurtenances contiguous to the Houſe of the Maſter and Scholars of <hi>Balliol</hi>-hall, for the enlargement of their Manſion; and this written <hi>Margarets</hi>-hall on the back-ſide thereof, in a hand as old, if not the very ſame, as that within is.

by <hi>George Nevil</hi> B. of <hi>Exon.</hi> The corner Tenement, over-againſt <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dych,</hi> was given 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. but when or how the Tenement adjoyning to it, which is now the South-part of the <hi>Katherine-wheel,</hi> came to be the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, I doe not find; the ſaid Tenement ſeemed to have belonged to St. <hi>Fridiſweds,</hi> as being formerly deſcribed to be on the weſt-part of <hi>Old Balliol</hi>-hall. I thought it might poſſibly have been exchanged for the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue and great Port in St. <hi>Aldats</hi> Pariſh, which were taken away, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſt of our fore-mentioned Houſes, npon the building of <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> but that I find under a Publick Notaries hand, 1529. that we never received any thing in compenſation of them, though largely promiſed, as before is noted, <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. That which now is the <hi>Katherine-wheel,</hi> was given us 3 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. as being deſcribed in the Deed to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to the Eaſt-end of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Church. In the ſame Year alſo, <hi>John Duke</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> his Wife, gave a Meſſuage and Shop in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Pariſh: ſo that four Meſſuages were given in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Pariſh, but three of them only remain to us: whereof, unleſs two united and made one ſince, I cannot ſhew a reaſon. And laſt of all, a ſhop under a room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Oriel</hi> Colledge in St. <hi>Marys</hi> Pariſh, was given 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. which is part of Mr. <hi>Cryps</hi>'s ſhop, late Book-ſeller in the High-ſtreet. There is mention made in a Deed without date (and therefore very ancient) of a Meſſuage ſituate between a Tenement of the Univerſities, called <hi>Old Balliol</hi>-hall on the Weſt, and a Tenement of the Maſter and Scholars of <hi>Balliol</hi>-hall, call'd <hi>New Balliol</hi>-hall; which Tenement ſtood next to, or upon part of that ground where now <hi>Hammonds</hi> Lodgings do ſtand, which have been formerly call'd the <hi>New buildings.</hi> I ſhall ſhew hereafter how it came to be called <hi>Hamond</hi>-hall, or <hi>Hamonds</hi> Lodgings. Theſe Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings were either intended to be drawn out farther, or elſe were cut off to make room for the Maſters Garden, as appears by the Door and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiſes for Joyſts left, to be ſeen at the end thereof. But that there have been Buildings farther Eaſt-ward from thence, appears by the Oven, and other Evidences found upon the late reparation of the Wall towards the ſtreet adjoyning; which Ovens mouth was found to be lower then the ground we there tread upon, ſo much is the Earth ſwelled up again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its natural rotundity; if it be true, that (as ſome Geographers would have it) the Earth in general has ſuch inclinations, and is daily experimented in the parts thereof: where we ſee the Mountains willing to abate daily of their proud tops, by the abundance of ſtones falling from thence towards the Valleys; and the humble Valleys ſwelling up, as if they would meet them half way for an accommodation into a level, as is experimented in all Meadows, and may be ſeen by our old Colledges, whereof time hath half buryed ſome in that Earth they once ſtood above; and had done all the reſt, had they not been kept from ſinking quite into their Graves, by the bounty of Pious Benefactors: Were theſe things to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50723:37"/>
be aſcribed, as ſome think, to the ſinking of Buildings, 'twere ſtrange that they ſhould never leave ſinking, and that ſo equally too, that the Eaves, for the moſt part, hold the ſame proportion of height in every part, and the ſame level as ever they did. But be it as it will, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent excreſcences of ſome parts of the Earth are ſo inconſiderable to the whole, that it holds the proportion of a moth or duſt to a ball, as ſome note <hi>Cleomedes</hi> to have affirmed. We uſually ſay, That the Earth and the Sea make one Globe, and therefore without all conſideration (as ſome have had) of the depth of the Sea, the higheſt Mountain in the World has been found ſcarce to bear ſuch proportion to the ſemidiameter of the Earth, as is that of one to a thouſand. Nevertheleſs, the uneveneſs of the Earth, how ſmall ſoever in it ſelf, is of much concern to thoſe that people it, for the advantage that is in it, as well for the conveniency of habitation, as for quantity of ground, which is much greater, being meaſured by the Arks, then by the <hi>Hypoteneuſes</hi> or <hi>Subtenſes</hi> according to which it were to be meaſured, were it perfectly round: unto which roundneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, did the Earth incline, it would not receive its accompliſhment in the time that the World (according to the Opinions of Men) is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the motion towards it being ſo ſlow as it is: which may be proved from the buildings which are noted, <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. to be given by <hi>Sawſer</hi> to <hi>Fodringheye,</hi> to be confirmed to the Colledge, which are none elſe but the Maſters Stable and the adjacents, though ſerv'd at firſt for Lodgings for Scholars; which, I am confident were never ſince that time, new built; and yet the Earth is not ſwell'd up above four or five Foot in this Four hundred Years ſpace.</p>
                  <p>But in the Condition, wherein now it is, it ſomething reſembles the old remainder of <hi>Braſenoſe Colledge or Hall</hi> in <hi>Stanford</hi> in Lincoln ſhire, but that that ſtands more upon the declining of a Hill: alike ſqualid it was and had nothing [when I viſited it] remaining in it ſelf whereby to own that Name, beſides the <hi>Brazen Noſe</hi> which held the Ring of the Door. And now to ſtay the Reader a little longer, I would have him note that ſome <hi>Cantabrigians,</hi> willing to prove their Univerſity the Ancienter of the two, would have ours to be of no longer ſtanding then that <hi>Brazen-Noſe</hi> and of the return [for it was no more] of part of it from thence [which gave occaſion to that Oath given to Proceeders, <hi>Quod non leges vel au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> Stanfordiae <hi>tanquam in Schola generali]</hi> which was at the leaſt 100 years after the firſt Foundation of this our Colledge.

And this gave the firſt occaſion of that Duty of the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> of Swearing to maintain the Priviledges of the Univerſity, as another did of Offering 63 Pence; all which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Records of our Univerſity under the Seal of the Town of <hi>Oxon.</hi> The Oath is to be taken at the appointment of the Vice-Chancellour: and the Offering of 63 Pence (which is for the 63 Schollars which were ſlain) is yearly upon St. <hi>Scholaſtica</hi>'s day, which is <hi>Feb.</hi> 10.

the return of the Lands into their Crown, the Rent was not paid, till Dr. <hi>Cotes,</hi> Maſter of our Colledge, and the Scholars thereof, had it decreed to them and their Succeſſors, by the Chancellor and Court of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to be paid, together with the arrearages due from the diſſolution, by the hands of the particular Receiver of the Court of Augmentations of the Revenues of the Crown, in the ſaid County of <hi>Oxon,</hi> for the time being. All which, may appear by the Exemplification of the ſaid Decree under the Great Seal, and ſeveral other Writings in our Archives in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> Box there. This Rent was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved down to the taking away of Cathedrals, by the late Rebellion, and that for many Years by the hands of Auditor <hi>Squib</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> who told us, That we were never like to receive it more, unleſs we bought ſome of the Lands belonging to the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſo got it allowed in the Purchaſe.

But ſince that time, I never heard of the Sollicitor or Buſineſs: It may be that the greedineſs of Purchaſers went between him and home; for Men having devoured the whole diſhes of the Church, they were ready to fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears for the ſcraps. But how the diſſolution of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Church, either firſt or laſt aforeſaid, ſhould extinguiſh our Rent ſetled in maner aforeſaid, <hi>reſtat inquirendum.</hi> At preſent, this Rent is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be due from the Receivers of <hi>Kent:</hi> To which purpoſe, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Sawyer,</hi> Auditor for <hi>Kent,</hi> gives a Debentur; which being ſhewn to Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Receiver for <hi>Kent,</hi> he pays it, and hath paid ſince the coming in of the King. After this, one Houſe was given to the Colledge in <hi>Grand-pont (vulgo</hi> Gram-pool) call'd by the name of <hi>Rack</hi>-hall, ſituate in St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Pariſh at the South Port [which Pariſh is now part of St. <hi>Aldats]</hi> which had been the Land of <hi>Thomas Coventry</hi> Burgeſs and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſold by him 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. the ſeveral Conveyances are 18. this Houſe is now Leaſed to <hi>Crayford</hi> the Baker.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50723:40"/>
the upper part thereof, which is adjoyning to the Chappel, was built by <hi>Robert Abdy</hi> Maſter of this Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about which time, that which is now the Maſtets Hall, was built by B. <hi>Gray</hi> (the great Furniſher of our Library with rare Manuſcripts) as appears by his Coat of Arms engraven in Stone upon the three Brachets, under the out-ſide of the Bay Window thereof. The very faſhion of the Building ſpeaks it to have been the Chappel, &amp; to have been done after the mode of thoſe Times; unto the Building or Glazing whereof, <hi>George Nevil</hi> (of whoſe ſeveral Preferments you ſhall hereafter underſtand) might contribute, in as much as his Coat of Arms are to be ſeen yet in the Weſt Window of the ſame place; together with <hi>Beauchamps</hi> Coat of Arms, who was Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> before this <hi>George Nevil</hi>'s Brother: But <hi>Beauchamp</hi>'s Heirs males failing, the Earldom of <hi>Warwick</hi> devolved to his Siſter, whom <hi>Nevil</hi> marrying, he was created Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> in her Right, if I well remember. But be this as it will, this ſaid Hall having been a Chappel, and built no longer agoe, it makes void the common Cabale, that it was a Parliament Houſe. Indeed, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are ſacred things, and not miſ-becoming a Chappel, when not employed to Religious Exerciſes; nor am I ignorant, that the Houſe of Commons at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was once a Chappel: moreover, I have ſeen Courts of Juſtice made after the faſhion of this ſaid Hall, with ſuch a Bay Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow at the Eaſt end thereof, for the celebration of Divine Offices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, even the Courts fitting, which take no more notice thereof, then of the Elevation of the Hoſt, which they are warned of by the ringing of a little Hand-bell, whereupon they all uncover and adore: But the time of Parliaments held at <hi>Oxon,</hi> or of the building of the Room, makes it uncapable of either of theſe uſes. We had many Benefactors in thoſe times, mentioned in the Windows of our Library, whoſe bounty was moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imploy'd in building, and partly in adorning the Colledge with Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, or enriching the Library with Books. In the Eaſt Window of the Library, looking into the Chappel, is the Picture of St. <hi>Katerine,</hi> in the right light thereof, with her Wheel before her, and her Sword behind her, with this Motto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

(and teſtified by a <hi>Publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> with his <hi>Protocollum</hi> put thereunto) wherein the number of Fellows is ſtated to be ten, with a Maſter over them, which are bound to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of Divinity, and to take Holy Orders upon them, at or before four Years ſtanding Maſters of Art. The Maſter, and every Graduate Fellow, is to have the Preſentation of one Scholar, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Maſter and the two ſenior Fello vs: the buſineſs of which Scholars, is to ſerve the Maſter and the Fellows by whom they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, provided they be not ſo exerciſed and oppreſt with buſineſs, as to hinder their ſtudies.

This Statute concerning the two Prieſt-Fellows, hath been generally obſerved, unleſs it be in the clauſe of their being ordeyned Prieſts before their election: for I find upon our Regeſter <hi>anno Dom:</hi> 1564 <hi>Maii</hi> 12. that <hi>George God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell</hi> Bachelour of Art was choſen in <hi>ſocium ſacerdotalem,</hi> albeit he was not ordeyned: but took an oath to be ordeyned, <hi>Quam primum fieri potuit,</hi> which might give an occaſion to the Decree made by <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lillie</hi> Maſter and the Fellows, in our book of Statutes, which are the moſt exact and conciſe body that ever was made us; to the peruſall whereof I muſt refer the Reader; and ſhall make my further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation only upon that of the Viſitor.

by the date of the glazing of the Windows, it being then, that <hi>Lawrence Stubbys</hi> gave the Eaſt Window, which is ſo fair, that the Founder of <hi>Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Colledge is ſaid to have offered the Society 200 <hi>l.</hi> for it, to glaze the Eaſt Window of his Chappel, as repreſenting in lively Colours and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Poſtures, the Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt: but the Chappel being fair, they thought not that Window too gawdy for it; and I would they had not thought the Leads too heavy, I am ſure others did not, for weaker Frames at the <hi>Schools</hi> upon which they were laid.

Upon further conſideration of the aforeſaid exchange, the Rector and Scholars of <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, did covenant to pay to the Maſter and Scholars of <hi>Balliol</hi> aforeſaid, a yearly Rent of 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> for ever, to be iſſuing and going out of a Tenement of the ſaid Rector and Scholars in <hi>Magdalene</hi> Pariſh, to be paid at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel only; and for non-payment thereof, the Maſter and Scholars of <hi>Balliol</hi> may, by the ſame Deed, diſtrain upon the aforeſaid Tenement; or (in caſe of inſufficient Diſtreſs to be found there) upon any other Tenement belonging to the ſaid <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge in the City of <hi>Oxon,</hi> or Suburbs thereof: All which, appears in an Indenture under the Seal of the Colledge of <hi>Exeter</hi> aforeſaid, dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. <hi>Anno</hi> 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> After which exchange ſo made, I ſuppoſe the ſaid Houſe was new builded; from whence, it obtained the name of the <hi>New Buildings:</hi> but whether done by the Colledge, or any Tenant in performance of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants made with the Colledge, I cannot ſhew. But I find it to have been Leaſed out to one <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> at the time of <hi>William Hammond</hi>'s benefaction. The Leaſe it ſelf I have not ſeen; but it appears by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, bearing date <hi>Febr:</hi> 14. in the 36 of Q <hi>Eliz.</hi> That <hi>William Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of <hi>Guilford,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey</hi>

But then, in caſe the Rent charge were redeem'd by the payment of the ſaid 1100 <hi>l.</hi> then the Will of him the ſaid <hi>Hammond</hi> was, That the ſaid Eleven hundred pounds, with Three hundred pounds more, ſhould be paid over to my Lord <hi>Mountague, Anthony Garnet,</hi> and <hi>John Brown</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the advancement of our Colledge. The ſaid <hi>Garnet,</hi> with the conſent of the other two, did receive ſeveral ſums as part of the ſaid 1100 <hi>l.</hi> &amp; namely 200 <hi>l.</hi> at one time: which 200 <hi>l.</hi> was lent to Dr. <hi>Ainſloe,</hi> Doctor in Phyſick, for the good of the Colledge, till the reſt ſhould be received: for the payment whereof, the ſaid <hi>Ainſloe</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Lee</hi> became bound. Moreover, the ſaid <hi>Ainſloe</hi> became bound to the ſaid Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> in a Bond of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for the payment of 20 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for divers Years. Now my Lord <hi>Mountague, Ainſloe</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> being dead, there paſſed a Decree in Chancery againſt <hi>Garnet</hi> aforeſaid, that the ſaid two Bonds ſhould be delivered to the Colledge; and my Lady <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> with the reſt of the Executors and Aſſigns of my Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> did appoint <hi>George Abbots,</hi> Maſter of Arts of the Colledge, to receive
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50723:46"/>
that 200 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Ainſloe,</hi> and upon Receipt thereof, to pay it over to the Colledge, further enabling the Colledge to ask and take of the ſaid Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of <hi>Hammond</hi> the ſaid 300 <hi>l.</hi> mentioned in the ſaid two Obligations. Now whether the ſaid <hi>George Abbot,</hi> or the Colledge, did receive any part of the forementioned ſums, it appears not. But I find that the foreſaid <hi>Garnet,</hi> in purſuance of the ſaid Decree, did ſurrender the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Leaſe of the New Lodgings [thence call'd <hi>Hammonds</hi>-hall] to our Colledge, by his Deed, bearing date 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which Leaſe had been bought by the ſaid <hi>Garnet,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Hammond</hi> s Executors, as is probable, to the ſame intent and purpoſe: The which Tenement, by this means, became part of the ſite of the Colledge, and ſo remains. By which, and divers other caſes of our own, we may ſee how the Charity of good Perſons is moſtly left unto the truſt of thoſe, who either neglect it, or lick their own Fingers with it: ſo that very little or nothing falls, as here it did, to the ſhare of thoſe to whom its intended. Only by the taking in of this Leaſe [which time and patience would have worn out] we gained Lodgings for two Fellows more, which were added to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by the Charity of <hi>Peter Blundel,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Periham.</hi>

Theſe misfortunes ſome have aſcrib'd to the unluckineſs of the place, it being never known that any Man thrived upon it: But this hath been the uſual Apology for bad Husbandry, which is the reaſon why our Chapman ſold it, and our Tenant grew poor upon it, beſides the Suits in Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was continually embroyled, for land of his own adjoyning. I ſhould rather aſcribe it to the non-performance of <hi>Blundel</hi>'s Will, by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a Fellow and a Scholar, he intending it for two Scholars only. Some will be ready to ſay, That it hath followed <hi>Fortunam Loci, h. e.</hi> the Colledge which was cheated in the firſt Foundation lands, and hath been ſince many times abuſed, as herein, ſo in other things before, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be mentioned, aſcribed to the ſuperſtitious uſes whereunto the Houſe was conſecrated, <hi>viz.</hi> the honor, not of God only, but of the whole Choir of Heaven, to whom Prayers, Supplications, and Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were wont to be made. Whereunto I anſwer, That this hath been ever the Argument of Sacriledge, and at this day is, for the ſales of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops lands and other Church Revenues, and holds as well againſt the moſt flouriſhing Colledges of <hi>England</hi> as againſt this. But in the firſt place, theſe Benefactions were no Acts of conſtraint, they being all done or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended before the perſons lay upon their Death-beds, and conſequently not ſollicited thereunto by their Confeſſors, which was the matter of an <note place="margin">Anno Dom. <hi>1646.</hi>
                     </note>Appeal, I remember, once at <hi>Rouen</hi> in the great Chamber of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Caſſation of a Teſtament, whereby the Teſtator gave all his moveables and one Years Rent of his lands to a Religious Houſe, inaſmuch as the Curat having his ſoul in his hand, one would preſume it to have been done by an Act of conſtraint: for by the Civil Law, it is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any one to perſwade a <hi>Moribund</hi> to bequeath any thing to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but his Tutor, his Phyſician, or his Servant, inaſmuch as the laſt Will ought to be free. The matter was ſo learnedly and readily argued on both ſides, that the Court gave no Sentence in the Cauſe. On the ſame day there was another Proceſs, touching a Teſtament which had been ſign'd by the Teſtator before it was read unto him, by reaſon of the feebleneſs of his hand, not able to expect the reading thereof: whereupon, the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant demanded the Caſſation of the ſame: But it was pronounced good by the ſentence of the Court, as a thing freely intended by the Teſtator. Secondly, then I ſay, That though thoſe Conſtellations of Saints were in her [as in others] religious Horoſcope, as carryed away with the common Error of the Times; yet ſhe made God, whoſe honor is firſt regarded by her, the Lord of her Aſcendent. The like hath the good Lady <hi>Periham</hi> done [thoſe Conſtellations being by the Reformation removed out of the places they held in our Founders time] who for the promoting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Learning and Religion, hath annexed one Fellowſhip and two
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50723:48"/>
Scholars places to the old Foundation for ever, with 40 <hi>s. per annum</hi> to the ſenior Fellows Scholar; but with a more equitable <hi>Proviſo</hi> then any is in <hi>Blundel</hi>'s Compoſition, and more ſuitable to that of the Founders Statutes; which is, That the Revenues decreaſing, the allowance of her Eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynaries ſhould decreaſe proportionably: which otherwiſe, had not been agreeable to the Founders Statutes, wherein it is provided, that <hi>Decreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centib us reditibus decreſcat numerus Sociorum:</hi> Wherefore ſhe choſe rather to have part of the maintenance of her own Scholars withdrawn, then in this caſe leave them to rob us. And all this was done by the direction of <hi>George</hi> Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as is recited in an Indenture of mutual Releaſe between his Grace and this Colledge, to whoſe diſcretion it was by her wholly left, to what uſes, and in what Colledge in <hi>Oxon</hi> her Charity was to be imployed. To the end and purpoſe aforeſaid, the ſaid Lady <hi>Beriham</hi> did (18 <hi>Jacobi)</hi> give to the ſaid Archbiſhop the Farm call'd <hi>Borough-farm,</hi> with all the Members and Appurtenances whatſoever in <hi>Medmenham</hi> and <hi>Hambleton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> yet in leaſe for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">The Leaſe dated 18 <hi>Jac.</hi>
                     </note>13 Years to come; which Intereſt of his Graces, did he Releaſe to the Colledge by the foreſaid Indenture, dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 9. in 4 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noque Dom.</hi> 1628.

                     </note>to lye convenient for themſelves, took it, and left us that at <hi>Prince-Risborow</hi> for it. Thus our Pious Benefactrix beteem'd her Scholars rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Meſſes of Commons, but her Cooks licked their own Fingers in dividing of them. Not far from this <hi>Prince-Risborow,</hi> we have another Farm of an ancienter Donation, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Morton</hi> near <hi>Tame,</hi> conveyed by <hi>George Nevil</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> to ſeveral Truſtees, 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Nevil</hi> by <hi>Botelet,</hi> conveyed by <hi>Botelet</hi> to <hi>Jacket,</hi> conveyed to <hi>Jacket</hi> by <hi>Pyron,</hi> and to <hi>Pyron</hi> by <hi>Wolundun,</hi> 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and ſo up, till we come to Writings without date. And beſides this, I do not know of any thing that I have not mentioned, unleſs the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> bought of one <hi>Mead</hi> (13 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.) with 100 <hi>l.</hi> given us by a Benefactor, and 60 <hi>l.</hi> added thereunto.</p>

                     <p>That great Earl of <hi>Warwick, Richard Nevil</hi> [who, as in a ſtage for ſome Years, did ſet up and depoſe Kings at his pleaſure] had a Brother which was this <hi>George Nevil,</hi> whom yet but young, he promoted to high Honors: for, being Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon</hi> [where he ſtudyed and became Fellow of this Colledge] he was conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Exeter, Nov.</hi> 25. 1455. not yet 20 Years of Age. Afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> 1460. he was made Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> till his Brother the Earl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent by K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. upon an Embaſſy into <hi>France,</hi> he was put out of his Chancellorſhip, and another, <hi>viz.
