            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>As will appear when he is underſtood.</l>
            <l>Your Orator, <hi>John Ketch, St. Giles,</hi> Eſquire,</l>
            <l>Comes with all due ſubmiſſion, to deſire,</l>
            <l>That he of this High Court may Juſtly have</l>
            <l>Juſtice againſt an Old <hi>True Prot'ſtant</hi> Knave;</l>
            <l>(To wit,) 'gainſt <hi>Bethelesky,</hi> who was late</l>
            <l>Controuler of that ſtrong and famous Gate</l>
            <l>That holds the Thieves and Rebells of the Town,</l>
            <l>When caught, 'till Sov'reign Juſtice cuts them down.</l>
            <l>And being, as aforeſaid, in that place,</l>
            <l>Preferr'd by Knaves and Fools: He tells his Caſe,</l>
            <l>In manner following: Worthy Friend and Brother,</l>
            <l>Says he (and ſo we ſtill did call each other;)</l>
            <l>'Tis not unknown I am ſure dear <hi>Jack,</hi> to you,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106718:3"/>
What my New Office does oblige me to.</l>
            <l>'Tis true (my old acquaintance, Friend, and Brother)</l>
            <l>That I can Hang and Head, well as another:</l>
            <l>But having other buſineſs to diſpatch,</l>
            <l>(And then he hugg'd me cloſe) my Deareſt <hi>Catch,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I muſt if we agree, leave that affair</l>
            <l>To your wiſe management, your Art, and Care,</l>
            <l>I know y'are Active, Reſolute, and Stout,</l>
            <l>And able as my ſelf (I'me old) to do't</l>
            <l>And abler, for in truth, fince 48.</l>
            <l>My loving friend, I never did the feat,</l>
            <l>To ſpeak on, tho' a friend to the profeſſion,</l>
            <l>And would again, upon the ſame occaſion,</l>
            <l>Faithfully ſerve the People of the Nation.</l>
            <l>But to my great Content, dear <hi>Jack</hi> I ſee</l>
            <l>While you ſurvive, there'l be no need of me,</l>
            <l>Thou art the Top of our Fraternity.</l>
            <l>Thus he cajol'd your humble Orator,</l>
            <l>Who having Brandy ta'ne too much, and Beer,</l>
            <l>Was ſoon prevail'd upon with theſe fair words,</l>
            <l>To take the management of th'Ax and Cords:</l>
            <l>Which he perform'd for the Defendents Year,</l>
            <l>As to this Court he hopes to make appear,</l>
            <l>And That, he did it at ſo Cheap a rate,</l>
            <l>Had he been paid 'twould ſcarce have found him meat.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106718:3"/>
Not then ſuſpecting what would be the End on't,</l>
            <l>Nor could believe this Canting damn'd Defendent</l>
            <l>Had a deſign to Cheat, at leaſt to differ</l>
            <l>With one of his Profeſſion, and in Nature</l>
            <l>Not much unlike to him; but for all that,</l>
            <l>Your Orator can't get a ſingle Groat,</l>
            <l>Altho' he hath performed every part</l>
            <l>Of his Agreement, yet to his grief of heart</l>
            <l>The juſt Reward of all his Care and pains</l>
            <l>Still in this <hi>Bethelesky's</hi> hands remains;</l>
            <l>And there for ever ſince deny'd, it muſt,</l>
            <l>Unleſs the Court ſhall force him to be Juſt.</l>
            <l>The Bargain being made only between</l>
            <l>Our ſelves, and ſome good friends of his and mine,</l>
            <l>Who ſince that time are either <hi>Hang'd,</hi> or <hi>gone,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So that in truth your Orator has none</l>
            <l>To prove the Truth of the aforeſaid matter,</l>
            <l>Or if he had, what would he be the better,</l>
            <l>Were they unhang'd? and here, what ſignifies</l>

As in this Caſe (an't pleaſe ye) is plainly ſeen</l>
            <l>After your Orator had often been,</l>
            <l>As he well hop'd, and was advis'd he might,</l>
            <l>With the old <hi>Hamburgher</hi> to ask his Right:</l>

            <l>Sometimes pretending with Contempt and Scorn,</l>
            <l>He had a hangman been e'er I was born,</l>
            <l>And hop'd he ſhould be ſo when I was dead,</l>
