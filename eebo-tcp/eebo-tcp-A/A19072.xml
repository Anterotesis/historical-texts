            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as that honorable Aucthor made moſt graue ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to handle ſuch matter and ſubiect as for this time and ſtate of his Countrey was more then neceſſarie, ſo can I not but ſingularly commende your choyce of this ſtranger, &amp; your endeuour to make him an Engliſh Denizon, thereby to tranſport, and communicate with your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey generally ſuch precious wares as will be founde no leſſe hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome &amp; commodious, then delectable and pleaſant to all degrees, but eſpecially to the beſt and moſt noble.

And it is no ſtraunge thing to ſee how much the pasſions and affections of men doe ſtaine the truth, which is the very eye of hiſtories, (<hi>Polibus</hi> him ſelfe reherſeth the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of ſundrie hiſtoriographers before his time) and diſcouer contrarieties betweene them ſelues, and by other greater authours then they are condemned of lying, as we haue marked in the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> before, which haue written the hiſtory of the new world, and of the weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> who couer and make leſſe, their owne exceſſe, and incredible vilanies, the greateſt part of them beeing reuenged and puniſhed thorough the iuſt iudgement of God. The Engliſhmen haue ſomewhat runne awry, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the affaires on this ſide the ſea. <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> was wont to ſay, that to doe fauour to ſuch great perſonages as gaue him penſions, he ſet thinges downe, in ſuch ſort as they that liued in that time, were well inough able to diſcouer them, mary the poſterity ſhould hold them for true. And in truth ſundrye hiſtoriographers of all times, thorough ignoraunce, hatred, couetouſnes, or ambition, take a colour to warrant their lying and diſguiſing, vpon a beleefe they haue, that few ſhall bee able to diſcerne their coſeninges. And for becauſe thorough this error of diſcourſe, they name ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wiſe and prudent, which in deed haue beene moſt wicked, and blame french men that haue bene vertuous, of a good conſcience, and haue ended their liues honeſtlye, and laudablye, condemning them of fole hardines and vice, men ought therin to carry a good ſound, and right iudgement.

They do not in reſpect of the french men referre any of their actes at all to vertue, if they be not led thereto by that which they account prudence, but rather to raſhnes: as they doe in regarde of their owne nation, imputing their owne actes of cowardneſſe, baſenes of minde, diſceat, diſſembling, treaſon, crueltie, diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, infidelity and ambition, to wiſedome and prudence. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe here we may well conſider for what cauſe, they haue made

the like compariſon of french men that <hi>Antigonus</hi> did of <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> to a gameſter, whome the diſe fauoured well, but knew not how to ſerue him ſelfe, of thoſe chaunces that happened vnto him:<note place="margin">To make con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſts aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> (for that loke what he got by the effect, he loſte thorough, hope, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſuch ſort what he had not, that he cleane forgot to aſſure himſelfe of what he had gained) becauſe they are more ready to get then wiſe to keepe, and that by feates of armes they make braue conqueſtes, but they preſerue them but a while, not knowing that a countrye conquered by ſuch as obſerue not diſcipline, is both vnprofitable, and hurtfull. Therefore they coniecture, that valour and dexteritie in armes, is a greate matter: but that nobility not brought vp in learning, nor in reading of hiſtories, hath not this wiſedome to moderate it ſelfe, and to prouide by ſuche meanes as they ought to take, to bee able in peace to conſerue what they haue conquered, and ſuffer themſelues to bee led by the coloured wordes of their enemies: who after that the firſte fire, and french boyling is extinguiſhed, they know wel inough how to vſe their occaſion, and ſerue their owne turnes, with the ignoraunce of ſuch as eſteeme nought but armes, without running ouer, the courſes held by their aunceſtors, in keeping their conqueſtes, and vſing of their victories: as we haue but too manye examples, which is the cauſe that <hi>Caeſar</hi> writeth in his Commentaries,<note place="margin">Comment. li. <hi>6</hi>
                  </note> that french men are more hardie and couragious, then fine in warre, (which they make great account of) ioynct, that they giue them ſelues more to the hope which they take of conquering,<note place="margin">Men differ from beaſts by reaſon.</note> then they doe to anye feare of loſing.

And if victories be not made ſure with temperance, &amp; prudence, they dim through ſome vnloked for accident, the glorye which was before gotten: and in ſhort time loſeth the whole fruit through inſolency, careleſnes,<note place="margin">Cauſes of loſſes.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, arrogancy, violentnes of taking vp of lodging, &amp; yet to be well entreated, in capacity of a gouernor, couetouſnes confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to make no diſtinction betwene perſons, in giuing, taking away, or changing, and ſomtime a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement amiſſe conceaued, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ill executed, raſhnes, &amp; vanity of ſpeach, carrieth the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye awaye cleane vnto ſuch, as before ſeemed already vanquiſhed.

And a marueilous prudence is required, to foreſee an innumerable number of other accidentes in matters of warre, and ſometime to apply counſell to necesſitye: beeing no leſſe the dutye of a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Captaine to ſhew him ſelfe wyſe in his actions then coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, to the end hee approoue, deliberation leſſe difficile, and daungerous, and cleane reiecte all raſhe counſelles attendinge likewyſe the oportunities of times, and ripeneſſe of occaſions, not for all that preſuppoſing for certayne, thoſe perilles that are vncertaine, beeing more afrayde then he ought, calling hope no leſſe to his counſell,<note place="margin">More lauda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to keepe then to gette</note> then feare. <hi>Cirus</hi> likewiſe in the ende of the ſeuenth booke of the <hi>Pedion</hi> of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> thought it a <hi>matter more laudable to keepe then to get,</hi> becauſe often tymes in conqueſtes is nothinge but hardineſſe, but a bodie can not conſerue what hee hath taken without temperaunce, continence, care and diligence beſides valour. And as it is a greater greefe to become poore, then neuer to haue beene riche, ſo is it to loſe, more bitter, then neuer to haue gotten. I doe not thinke that garriſons ſerue to ſo great an ende, as if the conquerours ſhew them ſelues meeke, and louers of good thinges: and that no thing can ſucceede well to ſuche as abandon vertue and honeſtie. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> dedicatinge his Rhetorique to <hi>Alexander,</hi> writeth vnto him, that as the bodye is entertayned thorough a good diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Vſe &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</note> ſo is the witte by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and erudition: which were the cauſes that not onelye hee had euer an addreſſe to doe well, but alſo to conſerue what he had gotten. It is likewiſe requiſite, that we put the ſayde reading in vſe and practiſe, thereby to becomme more vertuous, wiſe, and aduiſed, and that we conferre, thinges paſſed with the preſent and ſuch as might enſue: and to apply examples, to the rule of veritye, iuſtice,<note place="margin">Aug. cap. 131 mor. epise.</note> and equitye. And albeit that <hi>Sainct Auguſtine,</hi> attributed much to hiſtories, yet doth he adde, that hee can not ſee how all that which is written by the witte of man can bee in euerie point true, conſideringe that all men are lyers, and that it commeth to paſſe often tymes,<note place="margin">Mens vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in all points can not be true.</note> that they which follow the reaſon of man in anye hiſtorie, builde vppon the brutes of the vulgar ſorte, and are abuſed by the pasſions of ſundrie men, which report no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge of certayne. Notwithſtandinge they are to bee excuſed, if they keepe a libertye, and write not to the ende to deceaue. But in the holye hiſtorie, they oughte to feare no ſuch thinge ſince that it proceedeth of the holye Ghoſte, and thence a man maye take out certayne witneſſes and ſoueraigne arreſtes.

Now that wee may the better reape our profite out of Hiſtoryes,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges and motife cauſes of al things as to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> we muſt conſider the beginning, and motyfe cauſe, of all enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the meanes which therin they haue held, and afterwardes the iſſue thereof, which cannot poſsibly be good proceeding from an euil beginning.

And it is to be excuſed in young men,<note place="margin">Youth ſtirred vp to vertue through praiſe</note> if they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in doing wel: becauſe vertues do double and flouriſh in that age, and doe increaſe through moderate praiſe giuen vnto them. And the common wealth hath an intereſt, in making the praiſes of famous men to remaine engrauen, to ſerue for an imitation pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forward, &amp; example to al ages.

And againſt this it is thought an excellent remedy not to be delicate, nor too light of beliefe, nor to thinke, one may contemne &amp; iniury one as he liſteth, nor to haue a will thereto, and to vſe delayes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of tyme.<note place="margin">The fagots of the licturs</note> As <hi>Plutarque</hi> wryteth, that the carryinge of bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of ſtickes bound togeather, vpon pollaxes, was to ſhew that the wrath of a Magiſtrate, ought not to bee prompt and loſe, for that while leaſurelye, thoſe bundels ſo bounde togeather were loſed, it brought ſome delaye &amp; ſpace to choler, which buyeth her pleaſure with perill of lyfe, as ſundry Poets haue written.

And the fault is ſo meaſured, as he to whom the offence is committed is perſwaded.

The deſtruction of 15. thouſand ſoules, was attributed to the choler of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which afterward he greatly repented him ſelfe of.

that vengeaunce which is ſo often forbidden of the Lorde, and which proceedeth from the ſame ſpring, as doth the iniury, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Notwithſtanding, that anger is not to be blamed, which is vſed ſometimes to make men amende when they haue done a fault. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth in the fourth of his <hi>Morales,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anger allow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed.</note> euen as diſordinate anger is a fault, ſo is ſometime the want of moderate choler, or rather hatred of vice.

For this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> called anger the ſinew of the ſoule, for that it ſerued to encreaſe valour, being moderate, and temperate.<note place="margin">Anger the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevve of the ſoule.

                  </note> And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth that it is an armour to vertue, but ſuch a one as rather mooueth vs, then is ought mooued it ſelfe. <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his booke intituled of the wrath of God, <hi>c.</hi> 17. writeth, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that thoſe thinges which are nought, ſhould diſpleaſe ſuch as are vertuous perſons, and that hee which is diſpleaſed at euill, ſhould be mooued when he ſeeth it wrought, ſo wee doe decline to vengeaunce, not becauſe men haue offended vs, but to the end diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline may be kept, maners corrected, and licentiouſnes repreſſed. This kinde of choler is lawfull, which as it is neceſſarye to man for the amendment of lewdneſſe, ſo is it found in God of whome man taketh example: for as much as we ought to chaſtiſe our ſubiectes, ſo ought God to repreſſe the vices of each one. And to bring this to paſſe it is neceſſarye that he be angry, and that it is naturall and good to be mooued and ſtirred to wrath. Therefore,<note place="margin">

                  </note> anger ought to be defined, a motion of the ſpirite, lifted vp for the represſion of ſinne. For the definition which <hi>Cicero,</hi> maketh of the deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, is not much different from this, but that anger which we call choler, or fury, ought not to fall within man, being a thing vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; vnprofitable.

Yea wee ſee what toyle men take in harueſt ſeaſon, and yet howe ſlacke and ſluggiſh we are to reape our celeſtiall wheate. And the ſayde holy ſcriptures are better vnderſtoode of a modeſt idiote, then of an arrogant Philoſopher. And as Saint <hi>Baſile</hi> wrote the lambe wadeth thorough the ſtreames of the ſcriptures, when the Elephant ſwimmeth. And in 119.

And the moſt auncient trueth, ſayth <hi>Tertullian</hi> is the moſt certaine. It is alſo called a teſtament and alliance, becauſe we finde therein the legacye of eternall life, and an immortall ſucceſsion, in communicating of all the riches,<note place="margin">The ſcripture called a teſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment and alli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aunce.</note> merites and perfections, of our Lorde, and ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, thorough the fayth which we haue in his promiſes.

It is alſo called the ſquare, balaunce, iudge of all nations, the Canon,<note place="margin">The Scripture called a ſquare and ballaunce.</note> and rule to liue well by, and the very touchſtone which diſcerneth truth from falſhoode. And S. <hi>Baſile</hi> wrote that it reſembled a great ſhop full of all kinde of medicinable drugges, where each man might finde a fitte ſalue for his ſore. And it is to be feared, which God threatned in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> that he wil take away the force of bread from the vnthankefull. And in <hi>Amos,</hi> that hee will ſende a famine not of bread, but of hearing of his word. And in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> that he will take away the candleſticke, as much to ſay, as that his word ſhall be no more purely preached. And we ought well to weigh the ſaying of <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Prouerbes, that <hi>where there is no viſion</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereby the preaching of the worde, <hi>there the people decaye,</hi>

The ſhadowes are paſſed, and the vayle of the temple cleane taken away to the ende that all men might enter in.

Let vs not then be Chriſtians in name onely, as we haue before declared: and let vs be patient in aduerſitie, modeſt in proſperitie, in our dewtie temperate, in our life iuſt, charitable towardes our neighbours, towardes the poore ſweete and tractable, in our conuerſation louing peace, integritie, and truth, beſeeching to this ende by earneſt prayers the ayde of God thorough his holy ſpirite, and imagining that wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the preſence of God, his holy ſaintes and Angels.

And in the tenth of his commonwealth he writeth, that neither the paines, nor rewardes in this world, are ought, either in number or greatnes, in reſpect of what ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are in an other life. Whereof we are better certified, in the holy ſcriptures, to the end we ſhould be reconciled vnto God, without differring, or longer wallowing in the filth of ſinne, for which we ought moſt earneſt to beſeech of him pardon, diſpoſing our ſelues wholy to obey him, ſince that he is our father, &amp; rendring vnto him all homage &amp; fealtie, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we hold of him in cheife, calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in all our buſines. And ſince that he hath pomiſed to heare, and prouide for all, let vs not abuſe his bountie, but in dewe time reconcile our ſelues vnto him,<note place="margin">

This is that which we beſeech at Gods handes in the Lords prayer, that his will may be done in earth as it is in heauen, as much to ſay, as that he giue vs grace to be ſo prompt and ready to do his will, as are the Angels that are in heauen, who no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement from god, but at the inſtant put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. For ſince that God is our ſoueraygne Lord, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing that is not reaſonable, &amp; for their profit whom he will imploy in his ſeruice, we ought not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult or deſcant, if we ſhuld obey what he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, nor be more ſlacke or ſlowe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his will, then are his creatures without ſoule, which as it is written in ſundry of the Pſalmes and Prophetes, leaue no one iot to doe in whatſoeuer their creator commaundeth them. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> ſayde vnto him that was ſo readie to followe him, marie vppon condition that he mought firſt goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne houſe, and take his leaue of ſuch his friendes as were there, <hi>No man which putteth his hande to the plough, and looketh backe,</hi>

Euen <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> wrote to a friend of his, that he was glad hee followed Philoſophie, which deteſted all vnhoneſt gaine and deceite, and whoſe finall ſcope was vertue and iuſtice. The which with much more certaintie wee may auerre of the holy ſcripture, wherein we ought to exerciſe our ſelues for feare of falling into that threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which God pronounced by his Prophet, becauſe thou haſt reiected knowledge, therefore I wil caſt thee off.

So the not knowing of God or of our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee were inſtructed by the worde of God, was the payne of ſinne vnto condemnation, but after we haue hearde the word, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is of it ſelfe a moſt grieuous ſinne.

to the ende that when they came to the maniging of affayres, they ſhould not ſeeke to enrich them ſelues, nor receaue bribes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the inward gold which is vertue is proper vnto them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit that ſundry of thoſe meanes, may bee perceiued by that which we haue before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, yet by reaſon of their importance &amp; to be meete with ſundry inconueniences which happen, I thought good to ſet forth more at large, howe the very fountayne of all trueth,<note place="margin">Bringing vp of youth of vvhat impor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance.</note> godlines, bountie, iuſtice, pollicy, and vertue, proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a naturall good, and that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the careleſnes of heads &amp; Magiſtrates, guiding their affayres by hazard without any foreſight, &amp; according to the humor of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which in all time haue halted in their dutie, youth neuer hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued good bringing vp, corruption hath in euery place mightely increaſed. For as <hi>Iſocrates</hi> wrote in his <hi>Areopagiticke;</hi> it is not great reuenewes nor riches, nor lawes &amp; ordinances which make a citie quiet and happie, but the good nourture of youth; which being ill brought vp maketh no account of lawes;<note place="margin">Good lawes ſtraighly to be obſerued.

And <hi>Plato</hi> in the 4. of his commonwealth was of opinion, that it had no great neede of lawes, by reaſon of the good diſcipline in which his citizens had beene nouriſhed, as ſuch as without lawes were able to gouerne themſelues as they ought. And in his Politiques and bookes of lawes, he attributeth all the diſorder of a countrey or citie, to the multitude of lawes and ſo often change of them,<note place="margin">Nourture &amp; bringing vp of children.</note> and all delightes to lewde bringing vp, &amp; ſheweth that the principal ſcope of a good eſtabliſher or reformer of a commonwealth, ought to be in cauſing youth to be well brought vp &amp; inſtructed: &amp; to the end it mought be more capable of good diſcipline, it is required that the fathers and mothers ſhould be ſober, moderate, and quietly minded: that when children are borne, they ſhould ſucke their owne mothers breaſtes, to be ſure that they ſhould not be nouriſhed in delightes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8895:122"/>
nor idleneſſe, and in playing might faſhion themſelues to vertue. He would alſo that whatſoeuer might breed happines, were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen through good nourture in the maners &amp; hearts of men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne there all their life as a good impreſsion: becauſe that while they are young, they haue more neede to be well looked vnto &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently taken heed of, then any other kind of beaſts. And it is more meete that care ſhalbe taken hereof, then of getting or preſeruing of wealth, or encloſing our parks, or gardens, with walls, or hedges. And there is no doubt, as S. <hi>Ierom</hi> and other ancient doctors haue written, that the cauſe which moued the moſt part of ſuch, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore founded Churches,<note place="margin">The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches prebends and colleges</note> Prebends, &amp; Colleges was chiefly for to bring vp youth in learning, &amp; to render the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more capable to ſerue God &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwelth, and the better to imprint in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feare of God which is the beginning of all wiſedome, &amp; which formeth the mind to the true mould of truth &amp; vertue, and carieth it far off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vice, fooliſh faſhions, &amp; lewde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, whence there is always caried away, ſome botch &amp; ſtayne of the infection of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.<note place="margin">Good brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp of children ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derate and temperate.</note> And by the ordinance of the three eſtates in all Cathedrall and collegiall Churches of this Realme, the reuenew of one prebend, is ſtill allotted to a ſcholemaſter. For that according vnto the ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> when youth in the beginning hath bin wel taught, then is the nauigation &amp; voyage of this world happie; and all the life after is accompanied with contentment, felicitie, &amp; good hope, and ſuch as haue bin well nouriſhed &amp; brought vp, become for the moſt part very moderate &amp; temperate &amp; the old prouerbe auerreth that nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture paſſeth nature.

And it is manifeſt that the <hi>Almanes</hi> and ſundry other nations which were meruelous barbarous, as we reade in <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> became more meeke and induſtrious by better education. And ſome haue written that at <hi>Rome</hi> in auncient time, it was ordayned that children for the firſt fault ſhould be tolde of it,<note place="margin">Punishments of childrens faults at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> for the ſeconde puniſhed, for the third hanged, and the father baniſhed. And <hi>Plato</hi> was alwayes of opinion, that enourmious vices proceeded more from a generous nature corrupted, then from vilitie, or low eſtate. And the firſt thing which ought to be beaten into youth, is to loue honour, to feare God and to obey his will, to make no account of the brickle goods of fortune, but of the eternall and ſpirituall and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8895:122"/>
of vertue; to ſet before their eyes the examples and praiſes of vertuous perſonages, and the blames and miſeries of the lewde and wicked, to the ende they may become wiſe by others harmes, and deteſt all vice and euill companie, receiuing correction at the handes of euery one, without preſuminge ought of themſelues, ſhunning wantonneſſe and delightes, neither ſpeaking nor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too lightly, not beeing to obſtinate, harde, ſtubborne, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke, impatient, nor vnconuerſable.

And <hi>Salomon</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father, but a fooliſh ſonne is a heauineſſe vnto his mother.</hi> The wife <hi>Crates</hi> was wont to ſaye, that if it were poſsible for him he would climme vp to the toppe of the citie, and crye alowde: O men, whither doe you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie your ſelues thus headlonge, that take what care you can to heape vp wealth, and yet make ſmall account of thoſe to whome you are to leaue it, as caring more for the doublet or ſhowe, then the bodie or foote. The ſame <hi>Salomon</hi> in his prouerbes ſaieth, that wiſedome cryeth thoroughout. To this purpoſe, the contentes of an Epiſtle written by <hi>Xenophon</hi> to <hi>Crito,</hi> ſeemeth worthie of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Knowe ye that <hi>Socrates</hi> hath often told vs, that ſuch as leaue great riches to their children, without ſeeing them brought vp well and honeſtly, are like vnto ſuch as giue much prouender vnto young horſes, but neuer breake them at all: for ſo they waxe fat, but vnprofitable. The praiſe of an horſe conſiſteth not in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of his bodie, but in his ſeruice and dexteritie. They alſo are in as great an errour, which buy heritages for their children which ſet little by them; becauſe they will eſteeme of the wealth, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, wheras there is a great deale more reaſon that the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dien
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8895:123"/>
ſhould be better liked then the poſſeſsion. He then which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his ſonne worthie to be had in eſtimation, hath don much for him although he leaue him but litle wealth. For it is the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which maketh euery thing ſeeme great or ſmall, becauſe that whatſoeuer the wel brought vp poſſeſſeth,<note place="margin">Knovvledge and vertue a more ſure inheritaunce then riches.</note> is moderate &amp; ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but vnto the euil nurtured it is verie litle. Leaue no more then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy children, then verie neceſsitie requireth: for they ſhal verie much eſteem that which is ſufficient, if thou haſt wel brought them vp:<note place="margin">Phocion.</note> and if they be ignorant, then wil they haue leſſe care, feare, and occaſion to do euil. The which <hi>Phocion</hi> practiſed, refuſing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of <hi>Alexander</hi> as <hi>Plutarque</hi> writeth. Let vs then conſider that knowledge is not laid open to fortune as are richeſſe, the which are verie often poſſeſſed by the wicked: nor mutable as glorie: nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

courage the threates of Fortune and death to be ſounde and ſhort in diſcourſe, to render themſelues, and quite their force to trueth, as ſoone as they ſhall perceiue it, without beeing too ſtubborne, that their conſcience, ſinceritie, and vertue, be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in their wordes and deedes, that in companie they caſt their eyes rounde about, and in themſelues controll the manners of eche one, to followe the good and contemne the wicked.

And there is no doubt, but that man being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to knowe,<note place="margin">Adoleſcencie is from 12. to 21. years.</note> and encline to vertue from his birth, if by a good guyde he bee vntill the laſt yeare of his adoleſcencie kepte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the ſnares, which the delightes of ſences and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures drawe with them, his vnderſtanding beeing once fortified thorough good inſtructions, ſhall after of himſelfe bee ſo well rooted in the loue of knowledge, vertue, and the feare of God, that it ſhalbee verie harde euer after to withdrawe him.
