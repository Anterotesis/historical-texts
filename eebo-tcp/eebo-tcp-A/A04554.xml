            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore, whether Princes be good or bad, let subiects be obedient, lest (for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, God take away the good, and double the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the bad.</p>
            <p>Then, I wonder, why men are so bewitched with the inticements of the Deuill, to lay violent hands vpon the Lords Anoynted, knowing, that the reward of such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, is shame and confusion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let all men consider this, that God by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie examples preserueth the innocent, from the violent
<pb facs="tcp:9668:4"/>
hands of the wicked, euen in the pride and greatest hope of their purposes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haman</hi> erected a gallows for <hi>Mardocheus</hi> the Iew; and he and his ten sonnes suffred therevpon.</p>
            <p>The false Iudges had got sentence of death against chaste <hi>Susanna:</hi> but by diuine prouidence, the stones da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out their owne braines. But where the practise ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the murther of Anoynted Princes, the odiousnes thereof so highly offendeth the Maiesty of God, as he hath defended euen notable Tyrants, from the murthering swords of Traytours.</p>
            <p>As for example: <hi>Commodus</hi> was a wicked Emperour, and to kill him, the Traitor <hi>Quintianus</hi> wayted at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lutarch.</note> dore: his dagger was ready drawne, his heart was resolute, and his hand was striking the stroke, at what time the Traytor cryed, <hi>This the Senate sendeth thee.</hi> By which fore-warning, <hi>Quintianus</hi> was stayd, and the Emperour escaped vnhurt.</p>
            <p>If God plucked wit and prudence from Traytors, that purposed to kill such notable Tyrants, as this was, it is constantly to bee beleeued, that with the Shield of his strength, he wil defend righteous Princes, amongst whom our most gracious King is crowned with the soueraigne renowne of vertue: in which dignity the King of Kings long continue his Maiestie.</p>
            <p>The murther of a Prince is so odious, as euen nature it selfe crieth out against it.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Croesus</hi> had a young sonne, that from his birth was dumbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and yet, when one of King <hi>Cyrus</hi> soldiers (taking him for a common person) was ready to kil him, the Infant
<pb facs="tcp:9668:4"/>
cryed out, <hi>O, kill him not; for he is the King my father.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Also I haue read of a stranger matter; namely, of a Kings sonne that brake forth of his mothers wombe, to giue his father warning of his enemies; &amp; presently after his birth, cryed out, <hi>I am borne in a wofull houre, to be the messenger of no better tidings, then that my father is in present danger, so lose both his life and kingdome.</hi> Which being spoken, the Infant presently dyed.</p>
            <p>We hereby perceiue, how the person of an anoynted Prince is so sacred, as nature maketh a passage for sucking babes and dumbe persons, to deliuer the same from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and withall, the Traytor is so open to destruction, as the Preacher saith to the Traytour, <hi>A Bird of the ayre</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes. 10. 20.</note> 
               <hi>shall bewray thy voyce, and with her feathers shall discouer thy words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> they, and all that they had, went downe quicke into hell, because of their rebellion.</p>
            <p>And certainly, whosoeuer marketh the sequel of treason, shall find a hundred examples to one, to proue the end of Traytors to be most miserable.</p>
            <p>By Statute law, it is petty treason for a seruant to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his master, being but a subiect. How detestable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is it then, for a sworne seruant, to lay violent hands on his anoynted Prince? The offence being in the extremest degree of sinnes, the punishment ought to be according to the seuerest censure of iustice.</p>
            <p>Euery mans house well gouerned, resembleth a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, wherein seruants ought to liue in the awe and subiection of subiects. But the wicked policy of men hath alwayes bene such, as where open power was too weake,
<pb facs="tcp:9668:5"/>
ambition, enuy, and money, allured the seruants of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours &amp; Kings, and men of all estates, to lay violent hands on their masters, and to betray them to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas,</hi> one of the Apostles, betrayed our Sauiour Iesus into the hands of the Iewes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Alexander</hi> was poysoned by his Physicion.</p>
            <p>The death of the Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> was compassed by the practise of his owne sister.</p>
            <p>Many haue had their bane by their wiues; some by their sonnes: but innumerable haue beene destroyed by the treason of their seruants.</p>
            <p>But let all good subiects, to their comfort, and Traytors, to their confusion, know, that the wicked dig a pit, and fall therein themselues.</p>
            <p>The Iewes had Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in prison, where forty of them vowed, that they would neither eate nor drinke, vntil they had slayne him: but God in a due time defended him.</p>
            <p>The Angell of the Lord led <hi>Peter</hi> forth of prison.</p>
            <p>The Angell of the Lord defended <hi>Sidrac, Misac,</hi> and <hi>Abednago</hi> in the burning fire.</p>
            <p>The Angell of the Lord stopped the Lions mouthes, that should haue deuoured <hi>Daniel.</hi> And there is no doubt but the good Angell of the Lord, with a drawne sword, will defend our Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> from all his enemies.</p>
            <p>A comfortable saying it is, that this holy Angell of the Lord, with a drawne sword (though not visibly seene) standeth between the godly and their enemies. And then, though the wicked come armed with an host of men, they shall bee ouercome with their subtill deuices, and their
<pb facs="tcp:9668:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
swords shall goe thorow their owne hearts.</p>
            <p>Call we now to mind our late soueraigne Lady Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom the Angell of the Lord, euen from her cradle, did miraculously preserue from the tyranny of all her enemies. When (for our sinnes) Queene <hi>Mary</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted both the Word and Sword, to the hypocrisy and tyranny of the popish Cleargy, good Lady <hi>Elizabeths</hi> life was then assayled with a thousand publike and priuate practises, but the Angell of the Lord still stood betweene her and her harmes; and from the fetters of aduersity, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and crowned her Maiesty, with the supreme dignity of this Realme. Afterwards, in the dayes of her Maiesties most happy raigne, many there were, that with the superstition of Papistry were so blinded, that they sought dayly to take away this good Queenes life: as <hi>Arden</hi> and <hi>Someruile;</hi> the one whereof was quartered, and made a prey for Powles; the other hanged himselfe, the night before the appoynted day of his execution.</p>
            <p>The dangerous Traitor <hi>Throgmarton,</hi> as cunningly as he disguised his odious treasons, was intrapped in the snares, which he set for his Countries destruction, and worthily dyed with the sword, which hee had whetted for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>The odious Atheist <hi>Parry</hi> likewise had the reward of his fellow Traytors, who, though he had the place and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, yet as gracelesse as he was, the very Maiesty of her princely countenance made him lose his resolution.</p>
            <p>Many are the falles of Traytors, which I could bring in, since the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, which for this time I omit. But surely, neither her Maiesties good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:9668:6"/>
nor their own duties could mouethem to obedience, that had but once drunke of the dregs of Popery. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all true subiects may sigh and say, Alas: those whose hearts are hardened therein, haue their iudgements blind, and their affections swift to runne vpon destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharao</hi> was warned with diuers plagues, that he should not hinder the departure of the children of Israel forth of Egypt: yet he would needs follow them, to his vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Gods iustice strooke <hi>Mahomet</hi> with the falling sicknesse, to make him knovv and repent his blasphemie: but to strengthen the peoples misbeleefe, the Deuill taught him to say, that his traunce proceeded of the conference of an Angell, vvhose diuine presence could not endure his earthly shape.</p>
            <p>Vpon the principall day of the bloudy murther at Paris in Fraunce, as a token that Gods word should flourish, in despight of their cruelty, a dead and withered tree bare greene leaues, in that Churchyard that receiued many a murthered carkase. And yet the Papists, on the contrary part, applied this prophesying example, to the second flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of the Romish church. Thus blind they are in their wicked imaginations &amp; traytrous attempts: and thus, with such vaine hopes, are all Traytors led vnto the follies, and falles of vnloyall subiects. Wherefore, howsoeuer they perswade themselues, and threaten our Countrey with a change of prosperity; so long as we feare God, and be true to his Maiesty, our peace will vndoubtedly last, and the <note n="*" place="margin">Sir Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</note> disturbers thereof are like shortly to taste their own mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fortunes, being already iustly condemned for their

Therefore let all sorts of people beare this in mind, that whosoeuer loseth his life by any kind of treason or violence, God will not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the bloud of the same man so murthered, but will also seuerely punish the murtherers in a strange maner.</p>
            <p>God punished the murther of <hi>Abel,</hi> committed by his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> with a most bitter curse; and yet that there might bee no protection in murder, God sayd himselfe, <hi>That whosoeuer slue the reprobate Cain, it should be auenged seuen fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to touch the guilt of murther more neerely, God requireth the bloud of Innocents, at the hands of Kings and anoynted Princes, as thus: To punish the fault of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> in seeking the death of <hi>Vrius,</hi> God tooke away the life of the child, which <hi>Dauid</hi> had by <hi>Vrias</hi> vvife.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the time of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> there were three yeres famine, and <hi>Dauid</hi> demaunded the cause why? And the Lord sayd, It was for <hi>Saul,</hi> and the house of bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he slew the Gibeonites. According to the opinion of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> the consenter to murther, is as gilty as the doer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed Christ, and <hi>Pilate</hi> that adiudged him to death, only to please the Iewes, carried the feareful bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of murther in their consciences, and by the horrour thereof, wrought their owne destructions.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, nature hath taught the very Infidels and heathen people to beleeue, that vengeance followeth mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Reason then may perswade all Christians, to assure
<pb facs="tcp:9668:7"/>
themselues, that the bloudthirsty are worse then Infidels, and cannot escape the sword of vengeance.</p>
            <p>Now, seeing that Kings, if they shead any bloud, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by the sword of Iustice; and Iudges, if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge death for hatred, feare, or gayne, by Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes are punished as murtherers: what may they then expect, that in corners lay violent hands on annoynted Kings, or without colour of authority, murther the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? If the eyes of their vnderstanding were not blind, they might see a bad successe in their purpose, and the open confusion of themselues.</p>
            <p>I haue read of a number of good and bad Princes, and also of other which haue bene bereaued of their liues, by the violent hands of secret Traitors: but among a hundred, you shall hardly find of one murtherer, that hath escaped the torture of Gods vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> and his partakers murdered <hi>Iulius Casar;</hi> but not one of them escaped a violent death.</p>
            <p>Wee may yet remember the vnhappy murther of the King of Scotland, father to our Soueraigne Lord, King <hi>Iames</hi> (whose life God long continue) how villanously he was made away: yet the greatest fauourers, &amp; the greatest procurers of the sayd murther, were by common iustice drawn to commit almost all the murderers into the hands of the hangman; and such as escaped, and were not bound to the censure of the law, could by no meanes shift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from the vengeance of God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9668:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all the blessings of the Pope, the commendations and threatnings of the King of Spaine, exchanged the Pistoll wherewith hee slue him, for most horrible tortures to bee executed vpon himselfe, being the iust reward for his hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous treason.</p>
            <p>I could alledge infinite examples, to disswade men from violent murther, which Gods prouidence many wayes preuenteth, when as his iustice neuer leaueth the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnpunished. Yet if Traytors had reason to obserue the iudgements of such practisers, or experience to looke into the wisdome of this age, they should see their attempt as vayne a matter, as to throw stones against the starres, or with a knock of their head to leuell a mountaine, that seeke to displace a beloued Prince.</p>
            <p>But now to wade into the depth of our subiect, ambition and desire of dignity, is the welspring of rebellion and treason: they that will flye without wings, are like to fall before they are wise.</p>
            <p>Hee that is borne to bee a seruant, in no wise ought to looke for double attendance.</p>
            <p>Dignity is like a vane on a high Tower, which is subiect to the chaunce of fortune, as the other is to the chaunce of the wind. And, who so will sit surely vpon the seat of prosperity, must, like the Snayle, get experience with slow climing; lest in taking a swifter course, like vnto a Bird, he be remoued with the least stone that is throwne, I meane, with the least disgrace of fortune. If mens minds grow bigger then their naturall conditions, there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of vertue to imitate, which haue raised sundry men from the cart to the highest degree of honour: when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
<pb facs="tcp:9668:8"/>
in clyming by treason, many honorable Estates dye dishonorably, and to their posterity, leaue no better Inheritance, then Infamy. Therefore let all ambitious minded men know, that destruction followeth presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the clyming of pride will haue a fall.</p>
            <p>And now I thinke it not amisse, to discourse vnto you the speaches of an English Traytour, which hee spoke at his execution within these few yeres: and his words were these, Oh, woe is me, vnhappy man! I may now rightly compare my estate to the state of <hi>Adam,</hi> who at first was placed in Paradise, and there enioyed all the pleasures of the earth, and was onely forbidden to eate of the fruite of one tree: but for his transgression, he not onely procured misery vpon his owne head, but vpon the heads of all his posterity. So (quoth he) I that wanted nothing, but had health, wealth, and friends, and so might long haue liued, if I could haue forborne to haue bin vntrue to my Prince: but alas, for my offence, I haue brought my selfe vnto this misery, by which, my good mother, my louing wife, my foure brethren, and sixe sisters, yea, and our whole house (neuer before attaynted) is infamed, and our posterity for euer like to be vndone.</p>
            <p>By his ouerthrow all men are warned to make choyce of good company: for the old Prouerbe is verified, Euill company corrupts good maners. And truly, the injury he hath done to his vvhole posterity, may be a fearefull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to feare men from treason, especially the Nobility and better sort of Gentlemen: for they thereby not onely lose their liues and liuings, but the honour of their houses are corrupted. Contrarivvise, for the vertue and dutifull
<pb facs="tcp:9668:8"/>
seruice of one man, a number of his posterity receiue both honour, and many other worldly blessings.</p>
            <p>Hereby we may compare a Traytors offence to <hi>Adams</hi> fault, and wee may liken the sacred Maiesty of our renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med King, to the pleasant and glorious fruit of the tree of life, so precious in Gods eyes, as he forbade <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> to lay violent hands vpon.</p>
            <p>But now, to returne againe to the bad successe of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in their attempts, consider yet these fewe examples, that hapned in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes.</p>

The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals fled; but escaped not the iustice due vnto Traytors: and the Earle of Westmerland himselfe euer after liued in pouerty, and for a bare allowance, was subiect to the proud controlement of euery rascall Spanyard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Felton,</hi> to draw her Maiesties subiects from dutifull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, set vp the Popes Bull vpon the Bishop of Londons gate: but (God be praysed) the hornes, that should haue gored the innocent, turned into a halter to hang the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Felton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope expecting no good successe by open force, then armed his practises with <hi>Machiauils</hi> policies: <hi>Mader</hi> &amp; <hi>Barlow,</hi> were made Instruments to murther some principal Magistrates: but their confusion was speedy, and their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose frustrate.</p>

            <p>Doctor <hi>Story</hi> may be an example of Gods iustice herein; the Earle of Desmond, Doctour <hi>Saunders, Campion,</hi> the foureteene Traytors, and many others may be sufficient witnesses of the miserable ends of Traytors.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we may read in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt his time, of a generall rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was almost throughout England: yet al had bad successe. The Papists tempted the commons to rebellion, with perswasions to throw downe inclosure, and for themselues foysted in, to haue their olde Religion againe.</p>
            <p>The banishment of strangers, hath bin made the cause of many commotions. Also the Northerne men had but a bad proofe of two rebellions, when they had the Crosse and Banner of fiue wounds borne before them.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, thus you may see the iust end and due desert of all Traytors. Therefore my counsell is (which I speake from the true zeale of my heart) that my louing brethren the subiects of England, open not their eares to the subtill perswasions of Papists, lest rebellion enter into their hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
