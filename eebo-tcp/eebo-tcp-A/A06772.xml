            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Ye haue heard my mynde of
preachers, which were sclaundred
(I speake of the godly) in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
I wyl now speake sumwhat
of gentlemen. As I do not alowe
al that be called preachers, so do I
not approue the doinges of al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that be called gentlemen. And as
I do not condemne all preachers,
so do I not dispraise all gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For as they are, whiche are trewe
<pb facs="tcp:9699:34"/>

ther whiche are true gentlemen in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede.
But some abuse the name of
preachers, by teaching papistrie, a
nabaptistry, Epicurisme, &amp;c. &amp; are
no prechers in dede, but rather pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
&amp; deceiuers of the people: so
lykewise are ther many which are
called gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; are no gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and catchers, bribers and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torcioners,
yea and very caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale. For they
abuse the name of a gentleman,
whiche is vnfeynedlye a name of
muche worship and great honour,
and worthy to be had in reuerence
and hye estimacion. Wythout the
true gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common weale

what ye shall eate, or what ye shall

ye shal put on. Is not the life more
worthe then meate, and the bodye
more of value then raymente? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

               <p>Whych of you (thoughe he tooke

vnto his stature? And whye
care ye then for rayment? Consider
the lylies of the fyelde, howe they
growe. They labour not, neyther
spyn. And yet for all that I say vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
you, that euen Salomon in all
his royaltie was not arayed lyke
vnto one of these. Wherfore if god
<pb facs="tcp:9699:77"/>
so cloth the grasse, whych is to day
in the field, &amp; to morow shal be cast
into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furnace, shall he not muche
more do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same vnto you, o ye of ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle
faith? Therfore take no thought
saying: what shal we eate, or what
shall we drinke, or wher w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shal we
be clothed? After all these thinges
seke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles. For your heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
knoweth that ye haue nede of
all these thynges. But rather seke
ye fyrst the kyngdome of god, and
the ryghteousenes thereof, and all
these thynges shall be caste vnto
you. Behold what goodly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
examples our sauiour christ
bringeth forth here, that he may al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lure
vs to truste only on gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
&amp; not to be carefull for the
necessaries of this lyfe, whych are
not gotten by painful trauaile, but
receyued of gods mere liberalitie.
And because we shuld not be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for meate, he first setteth before
<pb facs="tcp:9699:78"/>
our eies the foules of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayer for an

feedeth so plenteouslie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they want
nothyng, when they neyther sowe
nor reape, nor cari in to the barnes,
muche more wyll he feede vs, and
sende vs what soeuer is necessarie
for the preseruacion of thys our na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall

And as touchynge oure apparell,
to disswade vs from thoughte ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge

and diligentlye marke the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes

although they neyther labour nor
spynne, are so clothed wyth fyne

Kynge Salomon in all hys royal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie

be cut downe and caste into the fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nace,

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9699:79"/>
Christ therfore concludeth, that all

if we seke the kyngdom of god and
the ryghteousnes therof. Lette vs

howe beneficiall God is to them
that put theyre truste iu hym, and
lyue accordyng to theire vocacion:
so that those that be faytheful nede
not to despayre of comfort, seme the
scarsenes of thynges so greate, that
it bryngeth presente deathe almoste
wyth it. For in that dearthe and
penurye, the faytheful man that ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steth
hys care on God, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
wholly on hys fatherlye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,<note place="margin">Psal. xxii.</note>
maye well saye wyth the

I will not be afrayde of any euell,
for thou arte wyth me. God is euer
present wyth hys people in al their
tribulacion,<note place="margin">Psal. xci.</note> &amp; he wyl vndoubtedlie
delyuer them, &amp; saue them harmles.
Thys nowe remayneth, that when

these swete scriptures that ye haue

hearde, which wythout all doubte
shal greatly stirre and quiete their

their pouertie wyth your ryches.</p>
               <p>Exhorte your ryche neyghboures

that he maye geue vnto the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touse
worldlynges, a merciful and
liberall herte, that after thys they
maye no lesse wyllynglye seeke the

hytherto they haue soughte theyr

so lyue, and so frame our lyfe accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
