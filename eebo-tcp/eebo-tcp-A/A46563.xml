         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>gn, Intituled, <hi>An Additional Act for Improvement of Tillage,</hi> whereby it is Provided, amongſt other things, That all and every Our Iuſtices of the Peace for the ſeveral and reſpective Counties within Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Our Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> ſhall at their next reſpective Quarter-Seſſions after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and <hi>Eaſter</hi> yearly, by the Oaths of Two or more honeſt and ſubſtantial Perſons of the reſpective Counties, being neither Merchants nor Factors for the Importing of Corn, nor any ways concerned nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed in the Corn Imported, and each of them having a Freé-hold Eſtate of Twenty pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> or a Leaſe-hold Eſtate of Fifty pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> above all Charges and Reprizes, and being skilful in the Prices of Corn, and by ſuch other ways and means, as to them ſhall ſeem fit, to Examine and Determine the Common Market Prices of midling <hi>Engliſh</hi> Corn and Grain of the reſpective Sorts in the ſaid former. Act mentioned, as the ſame ſhall be commonly bought and ſold in the ſaid reſpective Counties into which any Foreign Corn or Grain ſhall be Imported, and certifie the ſame, with Two ſuch Oaths made, as aforeſaid, in VVriting annext, unto Our Chief Officer and Collector of Our Cuſtoms for the time being, reſiding in the ſaid reſpective Ports and Havens where the ſaid Corn and Grain ſhall be Imported, to be hung up in ſome Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place in the Cuſtom-houſe. And it is thereby likewiſe Enacted, That the Cuſtom and Duty of Foreign Corn and Grain Imported into any of Our ſaid Dominions of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> appointed by the ſaid former Act to be paid, ſhall be Collected and paid according to the Prices contained in ſuch reſpective Certificates as aforeſaid, and not otherwiſe. And it is further thereby Provided, That all that by vertue of the ſaid laſt mentioned Act is to be done by Our Iuſtices of the Peace at their Quarter-Seſſions in their ſeveral Counties, ſhall be done and performed in like manner in the City of <hi>London</hi> in the Months of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>April</hi> yearly by the Mayor, Aldermen and Iuſtices of the Peace there; And that the Perſons making ſuch Oaths ſhall be no Corn-Chandler, Mealman, Factor, Merchant, or other Perſon Intereſted in ſuch Corn ſo to be Imported, but ſhall be ſome ſubſtantial Houſe-keepers living in <hi>Middleſex</hi> or <hi>Surrey,</hi> qualified as aforeſaid. And whereas VVe are given to underſtand by the Humble Petition of ſeveral of Our Loving Subjects Trading in Corn, That through the general neglect in moſt parts of Our Kingdom, of putting the ſaid laſt mentioned Act in Execution, by aſcertaining the Prices of Corn and Grain, as is thereby directed, and by the ſubtile and crafty practices of unfair Dealers, by raiſing the Price of Corn in ſome few and ſmall Markets, when Corn hath generally born but a low Price, on purpoſe to defraud Vs of the higher Duty due by Law, and thereby to enable themſelves to underſell Our Loving Subjects Trading in Corn of the growth of Our Dominions, which miſchiefs were principally intended to have been prevented by the ſaid Acts. And being fully ſatisfied that the ſaid Act made in the Firſt Year of Our Reign, is of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick benefit to this Our Kingdom: VVe have thought fit, by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council, to ſignifie and Publiſh Our VVill and Pleaſure, That the ſaid Act made in the Firſt Year of Our Reign, be duly and ſtrictly put in Execution. And VVe do hereby VVill and Command Our Mayor, Aldermen, and Iuſtices of the Peace within Our City of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, and all and every Our Iuſtices of the Peace for the time being for the ſeveral and reſpective Counties and Places within Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> That from henceforth they do Half-yearly duly and ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Directions of the ſaid Act, in examining and determining the Common Market-Prices of Corn and Grain within their reſpective Counties and Places, and make Certificate thereof to Our Chief Officers of Our reſpective Cuſtom-houſes, as by the ſaid Act is Directed. And to the end they may be conſtantly put in mind of their Duties therein, VVe do ſtrictly Charge and Command all and every Clerks of the Peace and Town-Clerks at the ſeveral Seſſions of the Peace next after <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> to cauſe this Our Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be fixed in ſome open place in the reſpective Seſſion Houſes, that it may be read by Our Iuſtices of the Peace attending ſuch Seſſions, and to cauſe the ſame to be conſtantly read at the ſaid reſpective Seſſions. And VVe do ſtrictly Charge and Command all and every of Our Chief Officers and Collectors of Our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in Our ſeveral Ports and Havens, that they yield Obedience to Our Royal VVill and Pleaſure in the due Obſervance of the ſaid Act, as they will anſwer the contrary.</p>
