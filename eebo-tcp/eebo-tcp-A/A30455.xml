         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS against the Repealing the Acts of Parliament concerning the TEST
Humbly offered to the Consideration of the Members of both
Houses, at their next Meeting.</head>
            <p>I. IF the just Apprehensions of the
Danger of <hi>Popery</hi> gave the Birth
to the <hi>two Laws</hi> for the <hi>two
Tests,</hi> the one with relation to all <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employments</hi> in 73. and the other
with relation to the <hi>Constitution</hi> of our
<hi>Parliaments</hi> for the future in 78. the
present time and conjuncture does not
seem so proper for repealing them;
unless it can be imagined, that the
<hi>Danger of Popery</hi> is now so much less
than it was formerly, that we need be
no more on our guard against it. We
had a <hi>King,</hi> when these Laws were
enacted, who as he declared himself
to be of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by
receiving the Sacrament four times a
year in it, so in all his Speeches to his
Parliaments, and in all his Declarations
to his Subjects, he repeated the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of his firmness to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion so solemnly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that if the saying a thing
often gives just reason to believe it,
we had as much reason as ever People
had to depend upon him: and yet for
all that, it was thought necessary to
fortifie those Assurances with Laws:
and it is not easie to imagin, why we
should throw away those, when we
have a Prince that is not only of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religion himself, but that has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
so much steadiness in it, and so
much zeal for it. that one would think
we should rather now seek a further
security, than throw away that which
we already have.</p>
            <p>II. Our King has given such Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his Zeal for his Religion,
that we see among all his other Royal
Qualities, there is none for which he
desires and deserves to be so much
admired. Since even the passion of
Glory, of making himself the terrour
of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Arbiter of
<hi>Christendom</hi> (which as it is natural to
all Princes, so must it be most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
so to one of his Martial and Noble
Temper) yields to his <hi>Zeal for his
Church;</hi> and that he, in whom we might
have hoped to see our <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third, or our <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth reviv'd;
chooses rather to merit the heightning
his degree of Glory in another World,
than to Acquire all the Lawrel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
Conquests that this low and vile World
can give him: and that, instead of
making himself a terrour to all his
Neighbours, he is contented with the
<hi>humble Glory</hi> of being a terrour to his
own People; so that instead of the
great Figure which this Reign might
make in the World, all the News of
<hi>England</hi> is now only concerning the
practises on some fearful Mereena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se things shew, That His
Majesty is so possessed with his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that this cannot suffer us to
think, that there is at present no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from Popery.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43333:3"/>
III. It does not appear, by what we
see, either abroad or at home, that
Popery has so changed its nature, that
we have less reason to be afraid of it
at present, than we had in former
time. It might be thought ill nature
to go so far back, as to the Councils
of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> that decreed <hi>the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Hereticks,</hi> with severe Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on those Princes that failed in
their Duty, of being the Hangmen of
the Inquisitors; or to the Council of
<hi>Constance,</hi> that decreed, that Princes
<hi>were not bound to keep their faith to
Hereticks;</hi> tho it must be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that we have extraordinary Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
if we can forget such things, and
more extraordinary Understandings if
we do not make some inferences from
them. I will not stand upon such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Trifles as the Gunpowder-Plot,
or the Massacre of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but
I will take the liberty to reflect a little
on what that Church has done since
those Laws were made, to give us
kinder and softer thoughts of them,
and to make us the less apprehensive
of them. We see before our Eyes
what they have done, and are still,
doing in <hi>France;</hi> and what seeble
things <hi>Edicts, Coronation Oaths, Laws</hi>
and <hi>Promises,</hi> repeated over and over
again, proved to be, where that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
prevails; and <hi>Louis le Grand</hi>
makes notso contemptible a Figure in
that Church, or in our Court, as to
make us think, that his example may
not he proposed as a Pattern, as well as
Aid may be offered for an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to act the same things in <hi>England,</hi>
that he is now d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing with so much
Applause in <hi>France:</hi> and it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
tho rather desired from hence to
put him a little in countenance, when
so great a King as ours is willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
himself so far as to copy after him,
and to depend upon him: so that as
the Doctriue and Principles of that
Church must be still the same in all
Ages and Places, since its chief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
is, that it is <hi>Infallible,</hi> it is no
unreasonable thing for us to be afraid
of those, who will be easily induced
to burn us a little here, when they are
told, that such servent <hi>Zeal</hi> will save
them a more lasting burning hereafter,
and will perhaps quit all scores so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttirely,
that they may hope scarce to
endure a Singeing in Purgatory for all
their other Sins.</p>
            <p>IV. If the severest Order of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that has breathed out
nothing but Fire and Blood since its
first formation, and that is even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed
at <hi>Rome</hi> it self for its Violence,
is in such credit here; I do not see
any inducement from thence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
us to look on the Councils that
are directed by that Society, as su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
harmless and inoffensive things, that
we need be no more on our guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. I know not why we may
not apprehend as much from <hi>Father
Petre,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> have felt from
<hi>Pere de la Chaise,</hi> since all the difference
that is observed to be between them,
is, that the <hi>English Iesuite</hi> has much
more Fire and Passion, and much less
Conduct and Judgment than the <hi>French</hi>
has. And when <hi>Rome</hi> has expressed so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43333:3"/>
great a Jealousy of the Interest that
that Order had in our Councils, that
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Morgan,</hi> who was thought to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
our <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> was ordered to
leave <hi>Rome,</hi> I do not see why <hi>England</hi>
should look so tamely on them. No
reason can be given why Card. <hi>Howard</hi>
should be shut out of all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
unless it be, that the Nobleness
of his Birth, and the Gentleness of his
Temper, are too hard even for his
Religion and his Purple, to be mastered
by them. And it is a Contradiction,
that nothing but a Belief capable of
receiving <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> can recou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile,
to see Men pretend to observe
Law, and yet to find at the same time
an <hi>Ambassadour</hi> from <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
when there are so many Laws in our
Pook of Statutes, never yet Repealed,
that have declared over and over again
all Commerce with the Court and
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Rome</hi> to be High Treason</p>
            <p>V. The late famous Judgment of our
Judges, who knowing no other way to
make their Names immortal, have
found an effectual one to preserve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem
from being ever forgot, seems to call
for another Method of Proceeding.
The P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>esident they have set must be

our Laws, the <hi>English Government</hi> is to
be hereafter lookt at with as much
Scorn, as it has hitherto drawn Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
That doubtful Words of <hi>Laws,</hi>
made so long ago, that the intention of
the <hi>Lawgivers</hi> is not certainly known,
must be expounded by the Judges, is
not to be question'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to infer
from thence, that the plain Words of
a Law so lately made, and that was
so vigorously asserted by the present
Parliament, may be made void by a
Decision of theirs, after so much Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
upon them, is just as reasonable a
way of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>puing, as theirs is, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Church of <hi>England</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that the Church has a Power in
Matters of Rites and Ceremonies, will
from thence conclude, that this Power
must go so far, that tho Christ has said
of the Cup, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> we must
obey the Church when she decrees
that we shall not drink of it: Our
Judges for the greater part, were
<hi>Men</hi> that had past their Lives in so much
Retirement, that from thence one
might have hoped, that they had
studied our Law well, since
the Bar had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alled them so seldome

               </gap>o Speculation,
as that which disorders and hurries
the Judgment, they who had practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so little in our Law, had no byass
on their Understandings: and if the
habit of taking Money as a Lawyer is
a dangerous preparation for one that
is to be an incorrupt Judge, they
should have been incorruptible, since
it is not thought, that the greater part
of them got ever so much Money by
their Profession as pay'd for their Furs.
In short, we now see how they have,
merited their Preferment, and they
may yet expect a further Exalcation
when the Justice and the Laws of
<hi>England</hi> come to be in hands, that will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43333:4"/>
be as careful to preserve them, as they
have been no destroy them. But what
an Infamy will it lay upon the Name of
an <hi>English Parliament,</hi> if instead of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those <hi>Betrayers of their Countrey</hi> to
an account, they should go by an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game
to confirm what these <hi>Fellows</hi>
ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e done.</p>
            <p>VI. The late <hi>Canferences</hi> with so
many <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>both houses,</hi> will give
such an ill-natured piece of Jealousy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, that of all Persons living,
that are the most concern'd to take care
how they give their <hi>Votes,</hi> the World
will believe, that <hi>Threatnings</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
had as large a share in those <hi>secret
Conversations,</hi> as Reasoning or Persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and it must be a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
degree of zeal and Courage in
them, that must take off the Blot, of
being <hi>sent for,</hi> and <hi>spoke to,</hi> on such a
subject and such a manner. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Behaviour of the <hi>Members</hi> in the
<hi>last Session,</hi> had made the <hi>Nation</hi> unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to remember the Errors committed
in the <hi>first Election:</hi> and it is to be hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they will not give any cause
for the future to call that to mind. For
if a <hi>Parliament,</hi> that had so many Flaws
in its first Conception, goes to repeal
<hi>Laws,</hi> that we are sure were made by
<hi>Legal Parliaments,</hi> it will put the <hi>Nation</hi>
on an Enquiry that nothing but necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will drive them to. For a <hi>Nation</hi> may
be laid asleep, and be a little cheated;
but when it is awakned, and sees its
danger, it will not look on and see a
<hi>Rape</hi> made on its <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi>
without examining, <hi>from whence have
these Men this Authority?</hi> they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find that it is <hi>of Men;</hi> and they will
not believe that it is <hi>of God.</hi> But it is
to be hoped, that there will be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
given for this angry question
which is much easier made than answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>VII. If all that where now asked in
favour of <hi>Popery,</hi> were only some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
towards the <hi>Papists,</hi> there were
some reason to entertain the <hi>Debate,</hi>
when the Demand were a little more
modest: If Men were to be attainted of
<hi>Treason,</hi> for being <hi>Reconciled</hi> to the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or for <hi>Reconciling</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to it; If <hi>Priests</hi> were demanded
to be <hi>hanged,</hi> for taking Orders in the
<hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and if the <hi>two thirds</hi>
of the <hi>Papists Estates</hi> were offered to be
<hi>Levied,</hi> it were a very natural thing to
see them uneasy and restless: but now
the matter is more barefaced; they are
not contented to live at ease, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their <hi>Estates;</hi> but they must carry
all before them: and <hi>F. Petre</hi> cannot
be at quiet, unless he makes as great a
<hi>Figure</hi> in <hi>our Court,</hi> as <hi>Pere de la Chaise</hi>
does at <hi>Versailles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Cessation of all Severities against
them, is that to which the <hi>Nation</hi>
would more easily submit; but it is
their <hi>Behaviour</hi> that must create them
the continuance of the like Compassion
in another <hi>Reign.</hi> If a restless and a
persecuting <hi>Spirit</hi> were not inherent in
that <hi>Order,</hi> that has now the <hi>Ascendant,</hi>
they would have behaved themselves so
decently under their present Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
as to have made <hi>our Divines,</hi> that
have charged them so heavily, look a
little out of countenance: and this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43333:4"/>
would have wrought more on the good
Nature of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Princly
Nobleness</hi> of the <hi>Successors</hi> whom we
have in <hi>view,</hi> than those <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Craft</hi>
and <hi>Violence,</hi> to which we see their
Tempers carry them even so early, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is yet time to show themselves.
The Temper of the <hi>English Nation,</hi>
the Heroical Vertues of <hi>those</hi> whom we
have in our Eyes, but above all, our
most <hi>holy Religion,</hi> which instead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Cruelty, inspires us with
Charity and Mercy, even for Enemies,
are all such things, as may take from
the Gentlemen of that <hi>Religion</hi> all sad
apprehensions, unless they raise a Storm
against themselves, and provoke the
<hi>Iustice of the Nation</hi> to such a degree,
that the <hi>Successors</hi> may find it necessary
to be <hi>Iust,</hi> even when their own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
would rather carry them to <hi>shew
Mercy.</hi> In short, they need fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what they create to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
so that all this stir that they
keep for their own <hi>Safety,</hi> looks too like
the securing to themselves <hi>Pardons</hi> for
the <hi>Crimes</hi> that they intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>VIII. I know it is objected as no
small prejudice against these <hi>Laws,</hi>
that the very making of them discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a particular Malignity against <hi>His
Majesty,</hi> and therefore it is <hi>ill Manners</hi>
to speak for them. The <hi>first</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
an Eye at his being then <hi>Admiral:</hi>
and the <hi>last</hi> was possibly levelled at
him: though when that was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he was excepted out of it by a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Proviso,</hi> And as for that which past in
73, I hope it is not forgot, that it was
enacted by that <hi>Loyal Parliament,</hi> that
had setled both the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the
Crown and the Rites of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
that had given the <hi>King</hi> more <hi>Money</hi>
than all the <hi>Parliaments of England</hi> had
ever done in all former Times. <hi>A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
that had indeed some Disputes
with the <hi>King,</hi> but upon the first step
that he made with relation to <hi>Religion</hi>
or Safety, they shewed how ready they
were to forget all that was past: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by their Behaviour after the
<hi>Triple Alliance.</hi> And in 73, though they
had great cause given them to dislike the
<hi>Dutch War,</hi> especially the strange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of it upon the <hi>Smirna Fleet:</hi>
and the <hi>stopping</hi> the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
for <hi>Toleration,</hi> and the <hi>Writes</hi>
for the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> were Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of hard Digestion; yet no saoner
did the <hi>King</hi> give them this new assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for their <hi>Religion</hi> then, though
they had very great Reasons given them
to be jealous of the <hi>VVar,</hi> yet since the
<hi>King</hi> was Engaged, they gave him
1200000 <hi>Pounds</hi> for carrying it on; and
they thought they had no ill Penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths
for their Money, when they
carried home with them to their
Countries this new Security for their
Religion, which we are now desired to
throw up, and which the Reverend
Judges have already thrown out as a
Law out of date. If this had carried
in it any new piece of Severity, their
Complaints might be just; but they
are extream tender, if they are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
under a Law that only gives them
Leisure and Opportunities to live at
Home, And the last Test, which was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43333:5"/>
intended only for shutting them out
from a share in the Legislative Body,
appears to be so just, that one is rather
amased to find that it was so long a
doing, than that it was done at last;
and since it is done, it is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
on our Understandings to
think, that we should be willing to part
with it. If it was not sooner done,
it was because there was not such
cause given for Jealousie to work upon
but what has appeared since that time
and what has been Printed in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Name, shews the World now,
that the Jealousies which occasion'd
those Laws, were not so ill grounded,
as some well meaning Men perhaps
then believed them to be. But there
are some times in which all Mens Eyes
come to be opened.</p>
            <p>IX. I am told, some think it is very
indecent to have a Test for our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
in which the King's Religion
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> accused of Idolatry; but if this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is good in this particular, it will be
full as good against several of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our Church, and many of the
Homilies. If the Church and Religion
of this Nation is so formed by Law,
that the King's Religion is declared
over and over again to be Idolatrous,
what help is there for it? It is no other,
than it was when His Majesty was
Crowned, and Swore to Maintain our
Laws.</p>
            <p>I hope none will be wanting in all
possible Respect to his sacred Person;
and as we ought to be infinitely sorry
to find him engaged in a Religion
which we must believe Idolatrous, so
we are far from the ill manners of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on his Person, or calling him
an Idolator: for as every Man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a Lye, is not for that to be called
a Lyar; so that tho' the ordering the
Intention, and the prejudice of a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswasion
are such abatements, that
we will not rashly take on us to call
every Man of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
an Idolater; yet on the other hand,
we can never lay down our Charge
against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as guilty of
Idolatry, unless at the same time we
part with our Religion.</p>
            <p>X. Others give us a strange sort of
Argument, to perswade us to part with
the Test; they say, <q>The King must
imploy his Popish Subjects, for he
can trust no other; and he is so assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of their Fidelity to him, that we
need apprehend no Danger from
them.</q> This is an old Method to
work on us, to let in a sort of People
to the Parliament and Government,
since the King cannot trust us, but will
depend on them: so that as soon as
this Law is repealed, they must have
all the Imployments, and have the
whole Power of the Nation lodged in
their hands; this seems a little to gross
to impose, even on <hi>Irish-men.</hi> The
King saw for many Years together,
with how much Zeal both the Clergy,
and many of the Gentry appeared for
his Interests; and if there is now a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Damp on their Spirits, the
King can dissipate it when he will; and
as the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a Body
that will never Rebell against him, so
any Sullenness under which the late
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43333:5"/>
Administration of Affairs has brought
them, would soon vanish, if the King
would be pleas'd to remember a little
what he has so often promised, not
only in Publick but in Pivate; and
would be contented with the Exercise
of his own Religion, without imbroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his whole Affairs, because <hi>F. Petre</hi>
will have it so: and it tempts Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen
to to more than ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Rage, against a sort of Men,
who it seems, can infuse in a Prince,
born with the highest Sense of Honour
possible, Projects to which without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some Violence to his own Royal
Nature, he could not so much as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, if his Religion did not so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
muffle him up in a blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But if we are so unhappy, that
Priests can so disguise Matters, as to
mis-lead a Prince, who without their
ill Insluences would be the most Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Monarch of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and would
soon reduce the Grand <hi>Lauis</hi> to a much
humbler Fgure, yet it is not to be so
much as imagined, that ever their Arts
can be so unhappily successful, as to
impose on an English Parliament, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Protestant Members.</p>

Pen: but one of such an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as this is, was probably
more severely Examined; there is a
new designation of his Majesties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
here set forth of his <hi>Absolute
Power,</hi> which is so often repeated,
that it deserves to be a little searched
into. Prerogative Royal and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority, are Terms already
received and known; but for this
<hi>Absolute Power,</hi> as it is a new Term, so
those who have coined it, may make
it signifie what they will. The <hi>Roman</hi>
Law speaks of <hi>Princeps Legibus solutus,</hi>
and <hi>Absolute</hi> in its natural signification,
importing the being without all Ties
and Restraints; then the true meaning
of this seems to be, that there is an
Inherent Power in the King, which
can neither be restrained by Laws,
Promises, nor Oaths; for nothing less
than the being free from all these, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
a Power <hi>Absolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. If the former Term seemed to
stretch our Allegiance, that which
comes after it, is yet a step of another
nature, tho one can hardly imagine
what can go beyond <hi>Absolute Power:</hi>
and it is in these Words, <hi>Which all our
Subjects are to obey without reserve.</hi> And
this is the carrying Obedience many
sizes beyond what the Grand Seigneur
ever yet claimed: For all Princes, even
the most violent Pretenders to <hi>Absolute
Power,</hi> till <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great's time,
have thought it enought to oblige their
Subjects to submit to their Power, and
to bear whatsoever they thought good
to impose upon them; but till the
Days of the late Conversions by the
Dragoons, it was never so much as
pretended, that Subjects were bound
to <hi>Obey</hi> their Prince <hi>without Reserve,</hi>
and to be of his Religion, because he
would have it so. Which was the
only Argument that those late Apostles
made use of; so it is probale this
qualification of the Duty of Subjects
was put in here, to prepare us for a
terrible <hi>le Roy le veut;</hi> and in that case
we are told here, that we must <hi>Obey
without Reserve;</hi> and when those Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Orders come, the Privy Council,
and all such as execute this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will be bound by this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to shew themselves more forward
than any others, <hi>to Obey without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve:</hi>
and those poor pretensions of
Conscience, Religion, Honour, and
Reason, will be then reckoned as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves</hi>
upon their Obedience, which
are all now shat out.</p>
            <p>III. These being the grounds upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43333:7"/>
which this Proclamation is founded,
we ought not only to consider what
consequences are now drawn from
them, but what may be drawn from
them at any time hereafter; for if they
are of force, to justify that which is
inferred from them, it will be full as
just to draw from the same promises an
Abolition of the Protestant Religion,
of the Rights of the Subjects, nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Church-Lands, but to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
whatsoever. In a word, it As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
a Power to be in the King, to
Command what he will, and an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in the Subjects, to Obey what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he shall Command.</p>
            <p>IV. There is also mention made in
the Preamble of the <hi>Christian Love and
Charity,</hi> which His Majesty would have
established among Neighbours; but
another dash of a Pen, founded on
this <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> may declare us all
Hereticks; and then in wonderful
Charity to us, we must be told, that
we are either to Obey without Reserve
or to be Burnt without Reserve. We
know the Charity of that Church
pretty well: It is indeed Fervent and
Burning: and if we have forgot what
has been done in former Ages, <hi>France,
Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> have set before
our Eyes very fresh instances of the
Charity of that Religion. While those
Examples are so green, it is a little too
imposing on us, to talk to us of <hi>Christian
Love and Charity.</hi> No doubt His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
means sincerely, and his Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to all his Promises, chiesfly to
those made since he came to the
Crown, will not suffer us to think an
unbecoming Thought of his Royal-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
but yet after all, tho' it
seems by this Proclamation, that we
are bound to <hi>Obey without Reserve,</hi> it is
hardship upon hardship to be bound to
<hi>Believe without Reserve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. There are a sort of People here
Tolerated, that will be hardly found
out: and these are the Moderate Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians:
Now, as some say, that
there are very few of those People in
<hi>Scotland</hi> that deserves this Character,
so it is hard to tell what it amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts
to; and the calling any of them Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,
cuts off all their share in
this Grace. Moderation is a quality
that lyes in the mind, and how this
will be found out, I canot so readily
guess. If a Standard had been given
of Opinions or Practices, then one
could have known how this might
have been disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ished; but as it
lyes, it will not be easy to make the
Discrimination; and the declaring
them all Immoderate, shuts them out
quite.</p>
            <p>VI. Another Foundation laid down
for repealing all Laws made against the
Papists, is, That they were Enacted
in King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth's Minority:
with some harsh expressions, that are
not to be insisted on, since they shew
more the heat of the Penner, than the
Dignity of the Prince, in whose name
they are given out; But all these Laws
were ratifyed over and over again by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43333:7"/>
King <hi>Iames,</hi> when he came to be of
fall Age: and they have received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Confirmations by King <hi>Charles</hi> the
First, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, as
well as by his present Majesty, both
when he represented his Brother in the
Year 1681, and since he himself came
to the Crown: so that whatsoever may
be said concerning the first Formation
of those Laws, they have received
now for the course of a whole hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years, thet are lapsed since King
<hi>Iames</hi> was of full Age, so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations,
that if there is any thing
certain in Human Government, we
might depend upon them; bat this new
coyned <hi>Absolute Power</hi> must carry all
before it.</p>
            <p>VII. It is also well known, that the
whole Settlement of the Church Lands
and Tythes, with many other things,
and more particularly the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Protestant Religion, was
likewise enacted in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
as well as those Penal Laws:
so that the Reason now made use of,
to annul the penal Laws, will serve
full as wel for another Act of this <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Power,</hi> that shall abolish all those;
and if Maximes that unhinge all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
of Human Society, and all
that is sacred in Government, ought to
be lookt on with the justest and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
prejudices possible, one is tempted
to lose the respect that is due to every
thing that carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Royal Stamp upon

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st shake all Settlements
whatsoever; for if a prescription of
120 Years, and Confirmations reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
over and over again these 100
Years past, do not purge some Defects
in the first Formation of those Law,
what can make us secure: but this
looks so like a Fetch of the French
Prerogative Law, both in their proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with Relation to the Elict of <hi>Nantes,</hi>
and those concerning Dependences at
<hi>Mets,</hi> that this seems to be a Copy
from that famous Original.</p>
            <p>VIII. It were too much ill nature
to look into the History of the last
Age, to examine on what grounds
those Characters of <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi>
given to the Memory of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> are
built, but since K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Memory
has the character of <hi>glorious</hi> given to it,
if the Civility of the fair Sex makes
one unwilling to look into one, yet
the other may be a little dwelt on.
The peculiar Glory that belongs to K.
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Memory, is, that he was a
Prince of great Learning, and that
he imployed it chiefly in writing for
his Religion: of the Volume in <hi>Folio</hi>
in which we have his Works, two
thirds are against the Churh of <hi>Rome,</hi>
one part of them is a Commentary on
the Revelation, proving that the Pope
is Antichrist; another part of them
belonged more naturally to his Post
Dignity; which is the warning that he
gave to all the Princes and States of
<hi>Europe,</hi> against the Treasonable and
Bloody Doctrines of the Papacy. The
first Act he did when he came of Age,
was to swear in person with all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and afterwards with all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43333:8"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Covenant, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Enumeration of all the points of
Popery, and a most solemn Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, somewhat like our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Test: his first Speech to the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was Copious on
this Subject: and he left a Legacy of a
Wish on such of his Posterity as should
go over to that Religion, which in
go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d manners is suppressed. It is
known, K. <hi>Iames</hi> was no Conquerour,
and that he made more use of his Pen
than his Sword: so the Glory that is
peculiar to his Memory must fall chiefly
on his Learned and Immortal Writings:
and since there is such a Veneration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
for him, it agrees not ill with
this, to wish, that his Works were
more studied by those who offer such
Incense to his <hi>Glorious</hi> Memory.</p>
            <p>IX. His Majesty assures his people of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> upon a certain Knowledge
and long Experience, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
as they are good Christians, so
they are likewise Dutiful Subjects: but
if we must believe both these equally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then we must conclude severely against
their being good Christians; for we
are sure they can never be good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
not only to a Heretical Prince
if he does not extirpate Hereticks; for
their beloved Council of the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
that decreed Transubstantiation
has likewise decreed, that if a Prince
does not extirpate Hereticks out of his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ominions, the Pope must depose
him, and declare his Subjects absolved
from their Allegeance, and give his
Dominions to another: so that even
his Majesty, how much soever he may
be a Zealous Catholick, yet cannot be
assured of their fidelity to him, unless
he has given them secret Assurances,
that he is resolved to extirpate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
out of his Dominions; and that
all the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omises which he now makes
to these poor wretches are no other
way to be kept, than the Assurances
which the Great <hi>Lewis</hi> gave to his Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Subjects, of his observing still
the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> even after he had
resolved to break it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also his last
promise made in the Edict, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> by which
he gave Assurances, that no Violence
should be used to any for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the very time that he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all possible Violences to be put
in execution against them.</p>
            <p>X. His Majesty assures us, that on
all Occasions the Papists have shewed
themselves good and faithful Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jects
to him and his Royal Predecessors; but
how <hi>Absolute</hi> soever the King's <hi>Power</hi>
may be, it seems his Knowledge of
History is not so Absolute, but it may
be capable of some Improvement. It
will be hard to find out what Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they shewed on the Gunpowder
Plot, or during the whole progress
of the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland;</hi> if the
King will either take the words of
King <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Glorious</hi> Memory, or
K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first, that was indeed of
<hi>pious</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Memory, rather than
the penners of this Proclamation, it
will not be hard to find Occasions
where they were a little wanting in
this their so much boasted Loyalty:
and we are sure, that by the Principles
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43333:8"/>
of that Religion, the King can never
be assured of the Fidelity of those he
calls his Catholick Subjects, but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
to them to make his Heretical
Subjects Sacrifices to their Rage.</p>
            <p>XI. The King declares them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all the Offices and <hi>Benefices</hi>
which he shall think fit to bestow on
them, and only restrains them from
invading the Protestant Churches by
force: so that here a Door is plainly
opened for admitting them to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their Religion in Protestant
Churches, so they do not break into
them by force; and whatsoever may
be the Sense of the term <hi>Benefice</hi> in its
antient and first signification, now it
stands only for Church Preferments;
so that when any Churches, that are
at the King's Gift, fall vacant, here is
a plain intimation, that they are to
be provided to them; and then it is
very probable, that all the Laws made
against such as go not to their parish
Churches, will be severely turned
upon those that will not come to
Mass.</p>
            <p>XII. His Majesty does in the next
place, in the vertue of his <hi>Absolute
Power,</hi> Annul a great many Laws, as
well those that Established the Oaths
of Allegeance and Supremacy, as the
late Test, enacted by himself in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
while he represented his Brother:
upon which he gave as strange an Essay
to the World of his Absolute Justice
in the Attainder of the late Earl of
<hi>Argile,</hi> as he does now of his <hi>Absolute
Power</hi> in condemning the Test it self,
he also repeals his own Confirmation
of the Test, since he came to the
Crown, which he offered as the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Evidence that he could give of his
Resolution to maintain the Protestant
Religion, and by which he gained so
much upon that Parliament, that he
obtained every thing from them that
he desired of them; till he came to
try them in the Matters of Religion.
This is no Extraordinary Evidence to
assure his people, that his Promises will
be like the Laws of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians,
which alter not; nor will the
disgrace of the Commissioner that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
that Law, lay this matter wholly
on him; for the Letter, that he brought,
the Speech that he made, and the
Instructions which he got, are all too
well known to be so soon forgotten:
and if Princes will give their Subjects
reason to think, that they forget their
Promises, as soon as the turn is served
for which they were made, this will
be too prevailing a Temptation on the
Subjects to mind the Princes promise
as little as it seems he himself does
and will force them to conclude, that
the Truth of the Prince, is not so Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
as it seems he fancies his power to
be.</p>
            <p>XIII. Here is not only a repealing of
a great many Laws, and established
Oaths and Tests, but by the Exercise of
the <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> a new Oath is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
which was never pretended to by
the Crown in any former time, and as
the Oath is created by this <hi>Absolute
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43333:9"/>
Power,</hi> so it seems the <hi>Absolute Power</hi>
must be supported by this Oath: since
one branch of it, is an Obligation to
Maintain His Majesty and His Lawful
Successors in the Exercise of this their
<hi>Absolute Power</hi> and Authority against all
deadly, which I suppose is Scotch for
Mortals: now to impose so hard a yoke
as this <hi>Absolute Power</hi> on the Subject,
seems no small stretch; but it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
exercise of it to oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to defend this: it had been more
modest, if they had been only bound
to bear it, and submit to it: but it is
a terrible thing so far to extinguish all
the remnants of natural Liberty, or of
a Legal Government, as to oblige the
Subjects by Oath to maintain the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of this, which plainly must destroy
themselves: for the short execution by
the Bow-strings of <hi>Turkey,</hi> or by sending
Orders to Men to return in their Heads,
being an Exercise of this <hi>Absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
it is a little too hard to make men
swear to maintain the King in it: and if
that Kingdom has suffered so much by
the many Oaths that have been in use
among them, as is marked in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
I am afraid this new Oath
will not much mend the matter.</p>
            <p>XIV. Yet after all, there is some
Comfort; his Majesty assures them, he
will use no Violence nor Force, nor any
<hi>Invincible Necessity</hi> to any man on the
account of his perswasion: It were too
great a want of respect to fancy, that a
time may come in which even this
may be remembrad, full as well, as the
promises that were made to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after His Majesty came to the
Crown: I do not I Confess, apprehend
that; for I see here so great a Caution
used in the choice of these words, that it
is plain, very great Severities may very
well consist with them: It is clear,
that the general words of Violence
and Force are to be determined by
these last of <hi>Invincible Necessity,</hi> so that
the King does only promise to lay no
<hi>Invincible Necessity</hi> on his Subjects; but
for all Necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies that are not Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
it seems thy must expect to bear
a large share of them; Disgraces, want
of Imployments, Fines and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and even Death it self are all
Vincible things to a man of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irmness
of mind: so that the Violences of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Furies of Dragoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and some
of the Methods now practised in <hi>France,</hi>
perhaps may be Included within this
Promise; since these seem almost <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible</hi>
to Humane Nature, if it is not
fortified with an Extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Grace: but as to all other
things, His Majesty binds himself up
from no part of the Exercise of His
<hi>Absolute Power</hi> by this Promise.</p>
            <p>XV. His Majesty Orders this to go
Immediately to the Great Seal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
passing through the other Seals:
now since this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>unter-signed by the
Secretary in whose hands the Signet
is, there was no other step to be made
but through the Privy Seal; so I must
own I have a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat Curiosity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Character in whose hands the
Privy Seal is at present; for it seems
his Conscience is not so very supple, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43333:9"/>
the Chancellors and the Secretaries
are; but it is very likely, if he does
not quickly change his mind, the Privy
Seal at least will very quickly change its
Keeper; and I am sorry to hear, that
the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary
have not another Brother to fill this
post, that so the guilt of the ruin of that
Nation, may lie on one si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gle Family,
and that there may be no others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in it.</p>
            <p>XVI. Upon the whole matter many
smaller things being waved, it being
extream unpleasant to find fault, where
one has all possible dispositions to pay
all respect; we here in <hi>England</hi> see
what we must look for. A Parliament
in <hi>Scotland</hi> was tryed, but it proved a
little Stubborn; and now <hi>Absolute
Power</hi> comes to set all right; so when
the Closetting has gone round, so that
Noses are counted, we may perhaps
see a Parliament here; but if it chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s
to be untoward, and not to <hi>Obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reserve,</hi> then our Reverend Judges
will copy from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and will not
only tell us of the King's Imperial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but will discover to us this new
Mystery of <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> to whch
we are all bound to <hi>Obey without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</hi>

amongst the several Professors
thereof, to the ruin and decay of

Crimes will import; nor are they to
presume to Build Meeting-Houses, or
to use Out-Houses or Barns, but only
to exercise in their Private Houses, as
said is: In the mean time, it is Our
Royal Will and Pleasure, that Field-Conventicles,
and such as Preach, or
Exercise at them, or who shall any
ways assist or connive at them, shall
be prosecuted according to the utmost
Severity of our Laws made against
them, seeing from these Rendezvouzes
of Rebellion, so much Disorder hath

               <p>I A. B. do acknowledge, testifie and

            <head>A LETTER, containing some Reflections on His Majesties Declaration for
Liberty of Conscience, Dated the Fourth of April, 1687.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>1. I Thank you for the Favour of
sending me the late <hi>Declaration</hi>
that His Majesty has granted for
<hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> I confess, I long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it with great Impatience, and
was surprised to find it so different from
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pattern; for I imagined,
that it was to be set to the second part
of the same tune: nor can I see why
the Penners of this have su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k so much
in their stile; for I suppose the same
men penned both. I expected to have
seen the Imperial Language of <hi>Absolute
Power, to which all the Subjects are to
Obey without reserve; and of the Cassing,
Annulling, the stopping, and disabling of
Laws</hi> set forth in the Preamble and
body of this <hi>Declaration;</hi> whereas those
dreadful words are not to be found
here: for instead of <hi>Repealing the Laws,</hi>
His Majesty pretends by this only to
<hi>Suspend them;</hi> and tho in effect this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to a <hi>Repeal,</hi> yet it must be
confessed that the words are softer.
Now since the <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> to which
His Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sty pretends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not
founded on such poor things as <hi>Law;</hi>
for that would look as if it were the gift
of the People; but on the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which is supposed to be dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to His Majesty, this may be as
well claimed in <hi>England</hi> as it was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
and the pretentions to <hi>Absolute
Power</hi> is so great a thing, that since
His Majesty thought sit once to claim
it, he is little beholding to those that
make him fall so much in his Language;
especially since both these <hi>Declarations</hi>
have appeared in our <hi>Gazettes;</hi> so that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s we see what is done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we
know from hence what is in some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hearts, and what we may expect
in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. His Majesty tells his people, that
<hi>the perfect Injoyment of their Property has
never been in any Case invaded by him since
his coming to the Crown.</hi> This is indeed
matter of great Incouragement to all
good Subjects; for it lets them see,
that such Invasions, as have been made
on <hi>Property,</hi> have been done without
His Majesties knowledge: so that no
doubt the continuing to levy the <hi>Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes</hi>
and the <hi>Additional Excise</hi> (which
had been granted only during the late
Kings Life,) before the Parliament
could meet to renew the Grant, was
done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge;
the many Violences committed not
only by <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but <hi>Officers,</hi> in all
the Parts of <hi>England,</hi> which are severe
Invasions on <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>perty,</hi> have been all
without His Majesties knowledge; and
since the first Branch of <hi>Property</hi> is the
Right that a man has to his Life, the
strange Essay of <hi>Mahometan Government,</hi>
that was shewed at <hi>Taunton;</hi> and the no
less strange proceedings of the present
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43333:13"/>
Lord Chancellour, in his Circuit after
the Rebellion (which are very justly
called His Campagne, for it was an
open Act of Hostility to all Law) and
for which and other Services of the like
nature, it is believed he has had the
reward of the Great Seal, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
of those who have left their
Colours, which being founded on no
Law, are no other than so many Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
all these, I say, are as we are
sure, Invasions on Property; but since
the King tells us, that no such Invasions
have been made since he came to the
Crown, we must conclude that all these
things have fallen out without His Priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.
And if a standing Army, in time
of Peace, has been ever lookt on by
this Nation as an Attempt upon the
whole Property of the Nation in gross,
one must conclude, that even this is
done without His Majesties know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>III. His Majesty expresses his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for us in a kind wish, that we were
all Members of the Catholick Church;
in return to which we offer up daily
our most e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rnest Prayers for him, that
he may become a Memebr of the truly
Catholick Church: for Wishes and
Prayers do no hurt on no side: but His
Majesty adds, that it has ever been his
Opinion, that Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ience ought not to
be constrained, nor people forced in
matters of meer Religion. We are
very happy if this continues to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
his sense: but we are sure in this
he is no Obedient Member of that
which he means by the Catholick
Church: for it has over and over ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in
decreed the Extirpation of Heriticks.
It encourages Princes to it, by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of the Pardon of their Sins; it
threatens them to it, by denouncing to
them not only the judgments of God;
but that which is more sensible, the loss
of their Dominions: and it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ems they
intend to make us know that part of
their Doctrine even before we come to
feel it, since tho some of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
would take away the Horror
which the Fourth Council of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi>
gives us, in which these things
were decreed, by denying it to be a
General Council, and rejecting the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of those Canons, yet the most
learned of all the <hi>Apostates</hi> that has fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to them from our Church, has so
lately given up this Plea, and has so
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmally a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>knowledged the Authority
of that Council, and of its Canons, that
it seems they think they are bound to
this piece of fair dealing of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning
us before hand of our Danger. It is
true <hi>Bellarmin</hi> says, <q>The Church does
not always execute her Power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Heretical Princes, tho she
always retains it:</q> one reason that he
assigns, is, <q>Because she is not at all
times able to put it in execution:</q> so
the same reason may perhaps make it
appear unadviseable to Extirpate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
because that at present it cannot
be done; but the Right remains inti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e,
and is put in execution in such an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
manner in all places where that
Religion prevails, that it has a very
ill Grace, to see any Member of that
Church speak in this strain: and when
neither the Policy of <hi>France,</hi> nor the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43333:13"/>
Greatness of their Monarch, nor yet
the Interests of the Empero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r joyned
to the Gentleness of his own temper,
could withstand these Bloody Councils,
that are indeed parts of that Religion,
we can see no reason to induce us to
believe, that a Toleration of Religion
is proposed with any other design but
either to divide us, or to lay us asleep
till it is time to give the Alarm for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
us.</p>
            <p>IV. If all the Endeavonrs, that have
been used in the last four Reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, for
bringing the Subjects of this Kingdom
to a Unity in Religion have been
ineffectual, as His Majesty says; we
know to whom we owe both the first
beginnings and the progress of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
among our selves; the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Government,
and the numbers of those that adhered
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> made it scarce
possible to put an end to that Party
during her Reign, which has been ever
since restless, and has had Credit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
at Court during the three last
Reigns, not only to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the supporting the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Extirpating all the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists:
and it were easie to name the
persons, if it were decent, that had
this in their Mouths; but now all is
turned round again, the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is in Disgrace; and now the
Encouragement of Trade, the Quiet
of the Nation, and the Freedom of
Conscience are again in Vogue, that
were such odious things but a few
Years ago, that the very mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them was enough to load any
man with Suspicious as backward in
the King's Service, while such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
are used, and the Government

            <p>V. There is a good reserve here left
for <hi>Severity,</hi> when the proper Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

ago, and there had not been so much

as the least Tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> raised by them
these 50 Years past: so that the French
who have smarted under this Severity,
could not be charged with the least
Infraction of the Law: yet Stories of
a huddred years old were raised up to
inspire into the King those Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of them, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave produced
the terrible effects that are visible to all
the World. There is another Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in this Declaration, which lets us
likewise see with what Caution the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of Favour are now worded, that
so there may be an Occasion given
when the Time and Conjuncture shall
be favourable to break through them
all: it is in these words, So that they
take especial Care that nothing be
preached or taught amongst them,
which may any ways tend to alienate
the Hearts of our people from us or
our Goverment. This in it self is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reasonable; and could admit of no
Exception, if we had not to do with
a set of men, who to our great Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
have so much Credit with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and who will be no sooner lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Power to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
then they will make every thing
that is preached against Popery pass
for that which may in some manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate
the Sabjects from the King.</p>
            <p>VI. His Majesty makes no doubt of
tthe Concurrence of his Two Houses of
Parliament, when he shall think it
convenient for them to meet. The
Hearts of King are unsearchable, so
that it is a little too presumptuous to
look into His hajesties secret Thoughts:
but according to the Judgments that
we would make of other mens
Thoughts by their Actions, one would
bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpted to think, that his Majesty
made some doubt of it, since his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
both at home and abroad could
not go the worse, if it appeared that
there were a perfect understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Him and his Parliament, and
that his people were supporting him
with fresh Supplies; and this House of
Commons is so much at his Devotion,
that all the World saw how ready they
were to rant every thing that he could
desire of them, till he began to lay off
the Mask with relation to the Test,
and since that time the frequent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations,
the Closetting, and the pains
that has been taken to gain Members,
by Promises made to some, and the
Disgraces of others, would make one a
little Inclined to think, that some doubt
was made of their Concurrence. But
we must confess, that the depth of His
Majesties Judgment is such, that we
cannot fathom it, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
guess what his Doubts or his Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
are. It is true, the words that
come after unriddle the Mistery a litt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
which are, when His Majesty shall
think it convenient for them to mett:
for the meaning of this seems plain, that
His <hi>Majesty</hi> is resolved that they shall
never meet, till he receive; such Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
in a new round of Closetting
that he shall be pat out of doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it.</p>
            <p>VII. I will not enter into the dispute
concerning Liberty of Conscience, and
the Reasons that may be offered for it
to a Session of Parliament; for there is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43333:14"/>
scarce any one point, that either with
relation to Religion, or Politicks, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a greater variety of matter for
Reflection: and I make no doubt to
say, that there is abundance of Reason
to oblige Parliament to review all the
nal Laws, either with relation to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
or to Dissenters: but I will take
the boldness to add one thing, that the
Kings Suspending of laws strikes at the
root of this whole Government, and
subverts it quite: for if there is any
thing certain with relation to English
Government, it is this, that the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive
Power of the Law is entirely in
the King; and the Law to fortifie him
in the Management of it has cloathed
him with a vast Prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made it
unlawful on any pretence wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> oev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
resist him: whereas on the other hand,
the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> is not so entirely
in the King, but that the Lords and
Commons have such a share in it, that
no Law can be either made, repealed,
or which is all one suspended, but by
their consent: sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that the placing this
<hi>Legislative Power</hi> singly in the King, is
a subversion of this whole Government,
since the Essence of all Governments
consists in the Subjects of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Authority, Acts of Violence or
Injustice, committed in the Executive
part, are such things that all Princes
being subject to them, the peace of
mankind were very ill secured if it
were not unlawful to resist upon any
pretence taken from any ill Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
in which as the Law may be
doubtful, so the Facts may be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and at worst the publick Peace
must always be more valued than any
private Oppressions or Injuries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
But the total Subversion of a
Government, being so contrary to the
Trust that is given to the Prince who
ought to execute it, will put men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
uneasie and dangerous Inquiries:
which will turn little to the Advantage
of those who are driving matters to
such a doubtful and desperate Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>
            <p>VIII. If there is any thing in which
the Exercise of the <hi>Legislative Power</hi>
seems indispensable, it is in those Oaths
of Allegeance and Tests, that are
thought necessary to Qualifie men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be admited to enjoy the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Law, or to bear a share in
the Government; for in these the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Government is chiefly
concerned; and therefore the total
Extinction of these, as it is not only a
Suspension of them, but a plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
of them, so it is a Subverting
of the whole Foundation of our Go-Government:
For the Regulation that
King and Parliament had set both for
the Subjects having the Protection of
the State by the Oath of Allegeance,
and for a share in the places of Trust
by the Tests, is now pluckt up by the
roots; when it is declared, That these
shall not at any time hereafter be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be taken or subscribed by
any persons whatsoever: fot it is
plain, that this is no Suspension of
the Law, but a formal repeal of it,
in as plain Words, as can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43333:15"/>
IX. His Majesty says, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Service of all his Subjects
is by the Law of Nature Inseparably
an nexed to and inherent in his Sacred
Person. It is somewhat strange, that
when so many Laws, that we all know
are suspended, the Law of Nature,
which is so hard to be found out,
should be clted; but the Penners of
this Declaration had best let that Law
lie forgotten among the rest; and
there is a scurvy Paragraph in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
self-Preservation, that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of very unacceptable Glosses. It
is hard to tell what Section of the
Law of Nature has markt either such
a Form of Government, or such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
for it. And if His Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
his Pretensions to our Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as founded on the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and betakes himself to this Law of
Nature, he will perhaps find the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
was a little too rash; but to make
the most that can be, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Nature does indeed allow the
Governors of all Societies a Power to
serve themselves of every Member of
it in the cases of Extream Danger;
but no Law of Nature that has been
yet heard of will conclude, that if by
special Laws, a sort of men have been
disabled from all imployments, that a
Prince who at his Coronation Swore
to maintaiu those Laws, may at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
extinguish all these Disabilities.</p>
            <p>X. At the end of the Declaration,
as in a Postscript, His Majesty assures
his Subjects, that he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them in their Properties, as well
in Church and Abbey Lands, as other
Lands: but the chief of all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
being the share that they
have by their Representatives in the
<hi>Legislative Power;</hi> this Declaration,
which breaks thro that, is no great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that the rest will be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and to speak plainly, when a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
Oath is so little remembred,
other Promises must have a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
degree of Credit given to them:
as for the Abbey Lands, the keeping
them from the Church is according to
the Principles of that Religion Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and that is a mortal Sin, and
there can no <hi>Absolution</hi> be given to any
who continue in it: and so this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
being an Obligation to maintain
men in a mortal Sin, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and void
of it self: <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rch Lands</hi> are also accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Doctrine of their Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
so immediately Gods Right, that
the Pope himself is the only Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator
and Dispeneer, but is not the
Master of them; he can indeed make
a truck for God, or let them so low,
that God shall be an easie Landlord:
but he cannot alter God'<hi>s</hi> Property,
nor translate the Right that is in him
to Sacrilegious Laymen and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>XI. One of the Effects of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
will be the setting on foot a
new run of Adresses over the Nation:
for there is nothing how impudent
and base soever, of which the abject
flattery of a slavish Spirit is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
It must be confest, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Age, that all those strains
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43333:15"/>
of flattery among the Romans, that
<hi>Tacitus</hi> sets forth with so much just
Scorn, are modest things, compared
to what this Nation has produced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these seven Years: only if our Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
has come short of the Refinedness
of the Romans, it has exceeded theirs
as much in its loathed Fulsomne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s:
The late King set out a Declaration,
in which he gave the most solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
possible of his adhering to the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
established by Law, and of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to have frequent Parliament;
upon which the whole Nation fell as
it were into Raptures of Joy and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
but tho he lived four Years after
that, he called no Parliament, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Law for Trien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and the manner of his Death,
and the Papers printed after his Death
in his Name, having sufficiently shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he was equally sincere in both
those Assurances that he gave, as well in
that relating to Religion, as in that other
relating to frequent Parliaments; yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Death a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew let of Addresses ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
in which all that Flattery
could invent was brought forth, in
the Commendations of a Prince, to
whose Memory the greatest kindness
can be done, is to forget him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his present Majesty upon his
coming to the Throne give some very
general Promise of maintaining the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> this was magnified
in so Extravagant a st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain, as if it had
been a Securiry greater than any that
the Law could give: tho by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the King has both to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and to
the Laws, it appears that he is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to maintain both equally: since
then the Nation has already made it
srlf sufficiently ridiculous both to the
present and to all succeeding Ages; it
is time that at last men should grow
weary, and become ashamed of their
Folly.</p>
            <p>XII. The <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to set an Example to the rest:
and they who have valued themselves
hitherto upon their Oppositian to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and that have quarrelled with
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for some small
Approaches to it, in a few Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
are now solicited to rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Laws that secure us against
it, are all plucked up: since they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
at present and during pleasure
leave to meet together. It is natural
for all men to love to be set at ease, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in the matter, of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
but it is visible, that thos
who allow them this favour, do it
with no other design, but that under
a pretence of a General Toleration,
they may Introduce a Religion which
must persecute all equally: it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
apparent how much they are
hated, and how much they have been
persecuted by the Instigation of those
who now Court them, and who have
now no game that is more promising,
than the engaging them and the Church
of <hi>England</hi> into new Quarrels: and as
for the Promises now ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to them,
it cannot be supposed that they will be
more l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sting than those that were made
some time ago to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43333:16"/>
who had both a better Title in
Law and greater Merit upon the Crown
to assure them that they should be well
used than these can pretend to. The
Nation has scarce forgiven some of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> the Persecution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they have suffered themselves
to be cosened; tho now that they see
Popery barefaced, the Stand that they
have made, and the vigorous Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they have given to it, is that
which makes all men willing to forget
what is past, and raises again the Glory
of a Church that was not a little stained
by the Indiscretion and Weakness of
those, that were too apt to believe and
hope, and so suffered themselves to be
made a Property to those who would
make them a Sacrifice. The Sufferings
of the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> and the Fn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
that the Popish party expressed against
them, had recommended them so
much to the Compassions of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and had given them so just a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
to favour in a better time, that
it will look like a Curse of God upon
them, if a few men, whom the Court
has gained to betray them, can have
such an ill Influence upon them as to
make them throw away all that Merit,
and those Compassions which their
Sufferings have procured them; and
to go and court those who are only
seemingly kind to them, that they
may destroy both them and us. They
must remember that as the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is the only Establishment that
our Religion, has by Law; so it is the
main body of the Nation, and all the
Sects are but small and stragling par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and if the Legal Settlement of
the Church is dissolved, and that body
is once broken, these lesser bodies will
be all at Mercy: and it is an easy thing
to define what the Mercies of those
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are.</p>
            <p>XIII. But tho' it must be confessed,
that the Nonconformists are still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some Temptations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to receive
every thing that gives them present
ease, with a little too much kindness;
since they lie exposed to many severe
Laws, of which they have of late felt
the weight very heavily, and as they
are men, and some of them as ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
men as other people, so it is no
wonder if upont he first surprises of the
Declaration, they are a little delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to see the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after
all its Services and Submissions to the
Court, so much mortified by it; so
that taking all together it will not be
strange if they commit some Follies
upon this occasion. Yet on the other
hand it passes all imagination, to see
some of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those whose Natures we know
are so particularly sharpned in the
point of Persecution, chiefly when it
is levelled against the Dissenters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at this Declaration, and make
Addresses upon it. It is hard to think
that they have attained to so high a
a pitch of Christian Charity, as to
thank those who do now <hi>Despitefully use
them,</hi> and that as an earnest that
within a little while they will <hi>Persecute</hi>
them. This will be an Original, and
a Master-piece in Flattery, which must
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43333:16"/>
needs draw the last degrees of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temption
such as are capable of so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and sordid a Compliance, and that
not only from all the true Members of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but likewise
from those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it
self; for every man is apt to esteem an
Enemy that is brave even in his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
as much as he despises those
whose minds sink with their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for what is it that these men would
the King? Is it because he breaks those
Laws that are made in their Favour,
and for their Protection: and is now
striking at the Root of all Legal Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
that they have for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Or is it because that at the same
time that the King professes a Religion
that condemns his Supremacy, yet he
is not contented with the Exercise of it
as it is warranted by Law, but carries it
so far as to erect a Court contrary to
the express worps of a Law so lately
made: That Court takes care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a due proportion between their
Constitution and all their Proceedings,
that so all may be of a piece, and all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
contrary to Law. They have
suspended one Bishop, only because he
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld not do that which was not in his
power to do: for since there is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudiciary
Authority in <hi>England,</hi> a
Bishop can no more proceed to a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Suspension against a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
without a Tryal, and the hearing
of Parties, than a Judge can give a
Sentence in his Chamber without an
Indictment, a Tryal, or a Jury, and
because one of the greatest bodies of
<hi>England</hi> would not break their Oaths,
and obey a Mandate that plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
them, we see to what a pitch
this is like to be carried. I will not
anticipate upon this illegal Court, to
tell what Judgments are coming; but
without carrying our Jealousies ton far,
one may safely conclude, that they
will never depart so far from their first
Institution, as to have any regard, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our Religion, or our Laws, or
Liberties, in any thing they do. If
all this were acted by a owed Papists,
as we are sure it is projected by such,
there were nothing extraordinary in
it: but that which carries our Indig,
nation a little too far to be easily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
is to see some pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and a few Bishops, among
those that are the fatal Instruments of
pulling down the Church of <hi>England</hi>
and that those Mercenaries Sacrifice
their Religion and their Church to
their Ambition and Interests; this has
such peculiar Characters of Misfortune
upon it, that it seems it is not enough
if we perish without pity, since we
fall by that hand that we have so much
supported and fortified, but we must
become the Scorn of all the world,
since we have produced such an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Brood, that even while they are
pretending to be the Sons of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> are cutting their Mothers
Throat: and not content with <hi>Iudas's</hi>
Crime, of saying, <hi>Hail Master,</hi> and
<hi>kissing</hi> him, while they are betraying
him into the hands of othnrs; these
carry their Wickedness f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her. If after all this we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43333:17"/>
were called on to bear this as
Christians, and to suffer it as Subjects,
if we were required in Patience to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
our own Souls, and to be in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with our Enemies; and which is
more, to forgive our False Brethren
who add Trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ery to their Hatred;
the Exhortation were seasonable, and
indeed a little necessary: for humane
Nature cannot easily take down things
of such a hard digestion: but to tell us
that we must make Addresses, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Thanks for all this, is to insult a
little too much upon us in our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
and he that can believe that a
dry and cautiously worded Promise of
maintaining the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
will be religiously observed after all
that we have seen, and is upon that

            <head>An Answer to a Paper, Printed with Allowance, Entitled, A New
Test of the Church of Englands Loyalty.</head>
            <p>1. THE Accusing the Church of
<hi>England</hi> of want of Loyalty, or
the putting it to a new Test,
after so fresh a one, with relation to
His Majesty, argues a high degree of
Confidence in him who undertakes it.
She knew well what were the Doctrines
and Practices of those of the Roman
Church, with Relation to Hereticks;
and yet She was so true to her Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
that She shut her Eyes on all the
Temptations that so just a fear could
raise in her; and She set her self to
support His Majesties Right of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with so much Zeal, that She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
not only put her self in the power of
her Enemies; but She has also Exposed
her Self to the Scorn of those who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
over her Misfortune. She lost the
Affections even of many of her own
Children; who thought that her Zeal
for an Interest, which was then so
much decry'd, was a little too fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent:
and all those who judged se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
of the proceedings, thought
that the Opposition which She made
to the side that then went so high, had
more Heat than Decency in it. And
indeed all this was so very Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
that if She was not acted by a
principle of Conscience, She could
make no Excuse for her Conduct. There
appeared such peculiar Marks of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Heartiness, at every time
that the Duke was named, whether in
Drinking his Health, or upon graver
Occasions, that it seemed affected: and
when the late King himself (whose
Word they took that he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant)
was spoke of but coldly, the
very Name of the Duke set her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
all on fire: this made many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they were ready to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
all to him, for indeed their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was inflamed with so much Heat,
that the greater part of the Nation be
lieved they waited for a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to declare themselves, Faith
in Jesus Christ was not a more frequent
Subject of the Sermons of many, than
Loyalty; and the Right of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown, the Heat that
appeared in the Pulpit, and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that was in their Books on these
Subjects, and the Eloquent Strains that
were in their Addresses, were all Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
and made the World conclude,
That whatever might be laid to their
Charge, they should never be accused
of any want of Loyalty, at least in
this King's time, while the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of so signal a service was so
fresh. When His Majesty came to
the Crown, these men did so entirely
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43333:18"/>
depend on the Promise that he made,
<hi>to maintain the Church of England,</hi> that
the doubting of the performance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to them the worst sort of <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
They believed, that in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
the <hi>Hero,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> would
be too strong for the <hi>Papists,</hi> and when
any one told them, <hi>How weak a tie the
Faith of a Catholick to Hereticks must
needs be,</hi> they could not hearken to
this with any patience: but looked on
his <hi>Majesties Promise</hi> as a thing so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
that they imploy'd their interest
to carry all <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>Parliament-Men,</hi>
for those that were recommended
by the Court, with so much Vigour,
that it laid them open to much Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
In <hi>Parliament</hi> they moved for
no <hi>Laws</hi> to secure their Religion; but
assuring themselves, that <hi>Honour</hi> was the
Kings Idol, they laid hold on it, and
fancied, that a publick reliance on his
Word, would give them an Interest in
his Majesty, that was Generous, and
more suteable to the Nobleness of a
Princely Nature than any new <hi>Laws</hi>
could be: so that they acquieseed in it,
and gave the <hi>King</hi> a vast <hi>Revenue</hi> for
Life: In the Rebellion that followed.
they shewed with what Zeal they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to his Majesty, even against a
Pretender that declared for them. And
in the Session of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which came
after that, they shewed their disposition
to assist the <hi>King</hi> with new <hi>Supplies,</hi>
and were willing to Excuse and indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
all that was past; only they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with all possible Modesty, that the
<hi>Laws</hi> which His <hi>Majesty</hi> had both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and at his <hi>Coronation</hi> had <hi>Sworn</hi>
to maintain might be Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cuted. Here
is their Crime, which has raised all this
Out-cry; They did not move for the
Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>evere and penal <hi>Laws</hi>
but were willing to let those sleep, till
it might appear by the Behaviour of
the Papists, whether they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that there should be any Mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of them in their Favour.
Since that time, our <hi>Church-men</hi> have
have been constant in mixing their
Zeal for their <hi>Religion</hi> against Popery,
with a Zeal for <hi>Loyalty</hi> against <hi>Rebellions</hi>
because they think these two are very
well consistent one with another. It
is true, they have generally expressed
an unwillingness to part with the two
Tests; because they have no mind to
trust the keeping of their Throats to
those who they believe will cut them,
and they have seen nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Papists, either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>thin or
without the Kingdom, to make them
grow weary of the Laws for their sakes,
and the same principle of common
sense, which make it so hard for them
to believe Transubstantiation, makes
them conclude that the Author of this
Paper, and his Friends, are no other,
than what they hear, and see, and
know them to be.</p>
            <p>II. One instance in which the Church
of <hi>England</hi> shewed her Submission to
the Conrt, was, that as soon as the
<hi>Nonconformists</hi> had drawn a new Storm
upon themselves, by their medling in
the matter of Exclusion, many of her
Zealous Members went into that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of them, which the Court set
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43333:18"/>
on foot. with more Heat, than was
perhaps justifiable in it self, or reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in those Circumstances; but how
censurable soever some angry men may
be, it is somewhat strane to see those
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> blame us for it,
which has decreed some unrelenting
Severities against all that differ from
her, and has enacted that not only in
Parliaments but even in General <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi>
It must needs sound odly to hear
the Sons of a Church, that must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all others as soon as it can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
it, yet complain of the Excesses of
Fines and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mprisonments, that have
been of late among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. But if this
Reproach seems a little strange when it
is in the Mouth of a Papist, it is much
more provoking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it comes from
any of the Court. Were not all the
Orders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> late Severity sent from
thence? Did not the Judges in every
Circuit, and the Favourite Justices of
Peace in every Sessions, imploy all their
Eloquence on this Subject? The Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that were given to the Justices
and the <hi>Grand Iuries</hi> were all repeated
Aggravations of this Matter: and a
little <hi>Ordinary Lawyer,</hi> without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Visible Merit,</hi> but an <hi>Outragious Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in those Matters, on which he has
chiefly valued himself, was of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
taken in his <hi>Majesties</hi> special Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and raised up to the <hi>Highest Posts</hi>
of the Law. All these things, led
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me of our Obedient Clergy, to look
on it as a piece of their Duty to the
<hi>King,</hi> to encourage that <hi>Severity,</hi> of
which the Court seemed so fond, that
almost all people thought, they had
set it up for a Maxime, from which
they would never depart. I will not
pretend to excuse all that has been
done of late Years: but it is certain,
that the most crying <hi>Seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ities</hi> have
been acted by persons that were raised
up to be Judges and Magistrates for
that very end: they were Instructed,
Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sted and Rewarded for it, both in the
last and under the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esent Reign, <hi>Church-preferments
were distinguished</hi> rather as
Recompences of this devouring Zeal,
than of a real Merit; and men of
more mode ate Tempers were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ill lookt at, but ill used. So that it
is in it self very unreasonable to throw
the load of the late Rigour on the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but it is worse than in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
it is fit to call it, if this Reproach
comes from the Court. And it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
unbecoming to see that; which
was set on at one time, disowned at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
while yet he that was the
chief Instrument in it is still in so high
a post; and begins now to treat the
men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with
the same Brutal Excesses, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
so lately and so liberally on the
<hi>Dissenters;</hi> as if his <hi>design</hi> were to render
himself equally odious to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>III. The Church of <hi>England</hi> may
justly expostulate when she is treated
as Seditinus; after she has rendred the
highest Services to the <hi>Civil Authority,</hi>
that any Church now on Earth has done,
She has beaten down all the Principles
of Rebellon, with more Force and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
than any Body of men has yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43333:19"/>
done; and has run the hazard of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
her Enemies, and losing her
Friends, even for those, from whom
the more learned of her <hi>Members</hi> knew
well what they might expect. And
since our Author likes the figure of a
Snake in ones Bosom so well; I could
tell him, that according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ogue,
we took up and sheltred an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
that was almost Dead, and by
that warmth gave it Life, which yet
now with the Snake in the Bosom, is
like to bite us to Death. We do not
say, that we are the <hi>only Church that has</hi>
the <hi>Principles of Loyalty,</hi> but <hi>this we may</hi>
say, that we are the Church in the
World that carries them the <hi>highest;</hi>
as we know a Church that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sinks them the lowest. We do
not pretend that we are inerrable in
this <hi>Point,</hi> but acknowledge that some
of our Clergy <hi>miscarried</hi> in it upon <hi>King
Edwards</hi> Death: Yet at the same time
others of our Communion adhered more
ftedily to their Loyalty in favour of Q.
<hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>She</hi> did to the <hi>Promises</hi> that
she made to them. Upon this Subject
our Aurhor by his false <hi>Quotation</hi> of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi>
forces me to set the <hi>Reader right,</hi>
which if it proves to the <hi>Disadvantage</hi>
of his Cause, his <hi>Friends</hi> may thank
him for it. I will not enter into so te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a <hi>Digression,</hi> as the <hi>justifying Queen.
Elizabeths</hi> being <hi>Legitimate,</hi> and the
throwing the Bastardy on Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
must carry me to; this I will only say,
that it was made out, that according to
the best sort of Arguments, used by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I mean the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<hi>Tradition</hi> of all Ages, <hi>King Henry the
Eighth</hi> marrying with Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi>
was Inces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uous, and by consequence Q.
<hi>Mary</hi> was the Bastard, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
was the <hi>Legitimate</hi> Issue. But
our Author not satisfied with defaming
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> tells us, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> was no sooner set up
by her, than She Enacted those Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Cannibal</hi> Laws, to Hang, Draw and
Quarter the Priests of the <hi>Living God:</hi>
But since these Laws disturb him so
much, what does he think of the Laws
of <hi>Burning</hi> the poor Servants of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God,</hi> because they cannot give <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wership</hi> to that which they believe
to be only a Piece of Bread? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
he gives of this part of our
History, is so false, that tho upon Q.
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> coming to the Crown, there
were many Complaints exhibited of
the illegal Violences that <hi>Bonner</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Butchers had committed, yet all
these were stifled, and no Penal Laws
were Enacted against those of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The popish Clergy were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
turned out; but they were well
used, and had Pensions assigned them;
so ready was the Queen and our <hi>Church</hi>
to forgive what was past, and to shew
all Gentleness for the future. During
the first thirteen Years of her Reign,
matter went on calmly, without any
sort of Severity on the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But then the restless spirit of
that Party, began to throw the Nation
into violent Convulsions. The Pope
deposed the Queen, and one of the
Party had the Impudence to post up the
<hi>Bull</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> upon this followed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Rebellions, both in <hi>England</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43333:19"/>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Papists of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
entred into Confederacies with
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
the Preists disposed all the people that
depended on them, to submit to the
<hi>Popes</hi> Authority in that Disposition, and
to reject the <hi>Queens;</hi> These endeavours,
besides open Rebelion, produced many
Secret Practices against her Life. All
these things gave the rise to the severe
Laws, which began not to be enacted
before the twentieth year of her raign.
A War was formed by the Bull of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
between the <hi>Queen</hi> and the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> so it was a necessary
Piece of Precaution, to decleare all those
to be Traitors who were the Missiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of that Authority which had stript
the <hi>Queen</hi> of hers: yet those Laws were
not executed upon some Secular Priests
who had the Honesty to condemn the
Deposing Doctrine. As f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Death of the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it
was brought on by the wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of her own Party, who fatally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
her in some of them; She was
but a Subject here in <hi>England;</hi> and if
the Queen took a more Violent way,
than was decent for her own Security,
here was no Disloyalty nor Rebellion in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which owed
her no sort of Allegeance.</p>
            <p>IV. I do not pretend that the
<hi>Church of England</hi> has any great cause
to value her self upon her Fidelity to
King Charles the First, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our Author
would have it pass for the only thing of
which She can boast: for I confess, the
cause of the Church was so twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed with
the King`s, that Interest and Duty went
together: tho` I will not go so far as
our Author, who says, that the Lavs of
Nature dictates to every Individual to
fight in his own Defence: This is too
bold a thing to be delivered so crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at this time. The Laws of Nature
are perpetual, can never be cancelled
by any special Law: So if these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
own so freely, that this is a
Law of Nature, they had best take care
not to provoke Nature too much, lest
She fly to the Reliefe that this Law may
give her, unless she is restrained by the
Loyalty of our Church Our Author
values his Party much upon their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to King Charles the first: but I
must take the Liberty to ask him of
what Religion were the <hi>Irish Rebells;</hi>
and what sort of Loyalty was it, that
they shewed either in the first Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre,
or in the progress of that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion?
Their Messages to the Pope, to
the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and to the Duke
of <hi>Larrain,</hi> offering themselves to any of
these, that would have undertaken to
protect them, are acts of Loyalty which
the Church of England is no ways in
clined to follow: and the Authentical
Proofs of these things are ready to be
produced. Nor need I add to this, the
hard terms that they offered to the
<hi>King,</hi> and their ill usage of those whom
he Imployed. I could likewise repress
the Insolence of this Writer, by tell<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
him of the Slavish Submissions that<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
Party made to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and son. As for their Adhering
to <hi>King Charles</hi> the first, there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Boldness in our Authors A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43333:20"/>
who says, that they had no Hope
nor Interest in that Cause: The State of
that <hi>Court</hi> is not so quite forgot, but
that we do well remember what Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
the Queen had with the King, and
what Hopes She gave the Party; yet
they did not so entirely espouse the
Kings Cause, but that they had likewise
a flying Squadron in the Parliaments
Army, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oldly soever this may be
denyed by our Author, for this I will
give him a proof, that is beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in a <hi>Declaration</hi> of that Kings, sent
to the Kingdom of Scotland, baring date
the 21 of <hi>April</hi> 1643. which is printed
over and over again, and as an Author
that writes the History of the late
Wars, had assured us the clean draught
of it, corrected in some places with
the <hi>King</hi>'s own Hand, is yet extant:
so that it cannot be pretended, that
this was only a bold Assertion of some
of the <hi>Kings Ministers,</hi> that might be
ill affected to their Party. In that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
the King studied to possess his
Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Justice of
his Cause, and among other things, to
clear himself of that Imputation that
he had an Army of <hi>Papists</hi> about him,
after many things said on that head,
these words are added: <q>Great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that Religion have been with
great Alac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity entertained in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Army against us: and others
have been seduced, to whom we had
formerly denyed Imployments; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Examination of many
Prisoners, of whom we have taken
twenty and thirty at a time of one
Troop or Company of that Religion.</q>
I hope our Author will not have the
Impudence to dispute the Credit that
is due to this Testimony: but no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
how evident soever they may
be, can affect some sort of men; that
have a Secret against bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shing.</p>
            <p>V. Our Author exhorts us, to charge
our <hi>Principles</hi> of Loyalty, and to take
Example of our <hi>Catholick Neighbours,</hi>
how to behave our selves towards a

But would he have us learn of our <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish
Neighbours,</hi> to cut our Fellow Subjects
Throats; and rebel against our <hi>King,</hi>
because he is of another Religion? for
that is the freshest Example that any of
our Catholick Neighbours have set us:
and therefore I do not look so far back,
as to the <hi>Gunpowder-plot,</hi> or the League
of <hi>France</hi> in the last <hi>Age.</hi> He reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bhes
us for failing in our <hi>Fidelity</hi> to our
King. But in this matter we appeal to
God, Angels and Men; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to His Majesty: Let our Enemies
shew any one <hi>Point</hi> of our Duty, in
which we have failed: for as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be charged for having preacht any
Seditious Doctrine, so we are not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Preaching of the Duties of
Loyalty, even when we see what they
are like to cost us. The <hi>Point</hi> which
he singles out is, That we have failed
in that grateful Return, that we owed
his Majesty for his Promise, of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
our Church as it is Established
by Law; since upon that we ought to
have repealed the Sanguinary Laws,
and the late impious Tests: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
being enacted to maintain the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43333:20"/>
of Queen Elizabeth; and the
other being contrived to exclude the
present King. We have not failed to
pay all the Gratitude and Duty that was
possible, in return to His Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
which we have carried so far, that
we are become the Object even of our
Enemies Scorn by it. With all Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be it said, that if His Majesty had
promised us a farther Degree of His
Favour, than that of which the Law
had assuered us, it might have been
expected, that our return should have
a degree of Obedience beyond that
which was required by Law; so that the
return of the Obedience injoyned by
Law, answers a Promise of a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
according to Law: yet we carried
this matter farther; for as was set forth
in the beginning of this paper, we
went on in so high a pace of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Confidence, that we drew
the censuers of the whole Nation on us:
nor could any Jealousies or Fears give
us the least Apprehensions, tell we were
so hard pressed in matters of Religion,
that we conld be no longer silent; The
same Apostle that taught us to Honour
the King, said likewise, that we must
obey God rather than man. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
knows the History of our Laws ill;
for besides wha has been allready said,
touching the Laws made by Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,
the severest of our Penall
Laws, and that which troubles him
and his friends most, was past by K.
<hi>Iames</hi> after the Gunpowder-plot; a
provocation thut might have well Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
even greater Severities. But
tho our Author may hope to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on an Ignorant Reader, who may
be apt to believe Implicity, what he
says concerning the Laws of the last
Age, yet it was too hold for him to
assert, that the Tests, which are so
lately made, were contrived to exclude
the present King: when there was not
a thought of Exclusion many Years
after the first was made, and the Duke
was accepted out of the second by a
special <hi>Proviso.</hi> but these Gentlemen
will do well never to mention the
Exclusion; for every time that it is
named, it will make people call to mind,
the Service that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
did in that matter, and that will carry
with it a Reproach of Ingratitude that
needs not be aggravated. He also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
the two Tests, as if that for
publick Imployments, contained in it
a Declaration of the Kings being an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater,
or as he makes it, a Pagan:
which is not at all in it, but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the Members of Parliament,
in which there is indeed a Declaration,
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of
Idolatry; which is done in general
terms, without applying it to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as our Author does: Upon this
he would infer, that his Majesty is not
safe till the Tests are taken away: but
we have given such Evidences of our
Loyalty, that we have plainly shewed
this to be false, since we do openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that our Duty to the King is not
founded on his being of this or that
Religion; so that his Majesty has a full
Security from our Principles, tho the
Tests contiune, since there is no reason
that we, who did run the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43333:21"/>
ruined by the Excluders, when the
Tide was so strong against us, would
fail his Majesty now, when our Interest
and Duty are joyned together: but if
the Tests are taken away, it is certain
that we can have no Severity any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
for we shall be then laid open to
the Violence of such restless and ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
men, as the Author of this Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
and his Brethren are.</p>
            <p>VI. The same reason that made our
Saviour refuse to throw himself down
from the Roof of the Temple, when
the Devil tempted him to it, in the
vain Confidence, that Angels must be
assistant to him to preserve him, holds
good in our Case. Our Saviour said,
<hi>Thou shalt not Tempt the Lord thy God.</hi>
And we dare not trust our selves to
the Faith and to the Mercies of a
Society, that is but too well known to
the World, to pretend, that we should
pull down our Pales, to let in such
Wolves among us. God and the Laws
hath given us a legal Security, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
His Majesty has promised to maintain
us in it: and we think it argues no
Distrust, either of God, or the Truth
of our Religion, to say, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by any Act of our own, lay our
selves open, and throw away that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenee.
Nor would we willingly expose
his Majesty to the unwearied Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a sort of men, who, if we
may Judge of that which is to come,
by that which is past, would give him
no rest, if once the Restraints of Law
were taken off, but would drive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to those Extremities, to which
we see their Natures carry them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>VII, The last Paragraph is a strain
worchy of that School that bred our
Author; he says, <q>His Majesty may
withdraw his Royal Protection from
the Church of <hi>England</hi> which was
promised her, upon the account of
her constant Fidelity,</q> and he brings
no other Proof to confirm so bold an
Assertion but a false Axiome of that
despised Philosophy, in which he was
bred: <hi>Cessante causa tollitur Effectus</hi>
This is indeed such an lndignity to His
Majesty, that I presume to say it with
all humble Reverence, these are the
last persons whom he ought to pardon,
that have the Boldnels to touch so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
a point as the Faith of a Prince,
which is the chief Security of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Foundation of all
the Confidence that a Prince can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himself from his People, and
which, once blasted, can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered:
Equivocations may be both
taught and practised with less danger
by an Order that has little Credit to
lose; but nothing can shike Thrones
so much, as such treacherous Maxims
I must also ask our Author, in what
point of Fidelity has our Church failed
so far, as to make her forfeit her
Title to His Majesties Promises?
for as he himself has stated this
matter, it comes all to this. The
King promised that he would maintain
the Church of <hi>England</hi> as Established
by Law. Upon which in Gratitude
he says, that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:43333:21"/>
was bound to throw up the Chief Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
that she had in her Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Law; which is, that all who
are intrusted either with the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or the executive Parts of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
must be of her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and if the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
not so Tame and so Submissive, as to
part with This, then the King is free
from his Promise, and may withdraw
his Royal Protection; though I must
crave leave to tell him, that the Laws
gave the Church of <hi>England</hi> a Right to
that Protection, whether His Majesty
had promised it or not.</p>
            <p>Of all the Maxims in the World,
there is none more hurtful to the Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment,
in our present Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
than the saying, that the Kings
Promises and the Peoples Fidelity
ought to be Reciprocal; and that a Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
in the one, cuts off the other:
for by a very natural consequence the
<hi>Subject</hi> may likewise say, that their <hi>Oaths
of</hi> Allegeance being founded on the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of His Majesties Protection, the
One binds no longer than the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thir
is observed: and the Inferences
that may be drawn from hence will be
very terrible, if the Loyalty of the sos
mueh decryed Church of <hi>England,</hi> does
not put a stop to them.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Thank you for the two Royal Papers,
that you have sent me: <hi>I</hi> had heard
of them before, but now we have
them to well t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ested, that there is no
hazard of being deceive by a false Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
you expect that in return, <hi>I</hi> should
let you know, what Impression they have
made upon me. <hi>I</hi> pay all the reverence
that is due to a Crownd Head, even in
Ashes; to which <hi>I</hi> will never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
far less am I capable of suspecting
the Royal Attestation that accompanies
them; of the truth of which <hi>I</hi> take it for
granted no man doubts; but <hi>I</hi> must crave
leave to tell you, that <hi>I</hi> am confident,
the late King only copied them, and that
they are not of his Composing: for as
they have nothing of that free Air, with
which he expressed himself; so there is
a Contexture in them, that does not look
like a Prince; and tho beginning of the
first shewes it was the effect of a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and was to be communicated to
another: so that <hi>I</hi> am apt to think they
were Composed by another, and were
so well relished by the late King, that he
thought fit to keep them, in order to his
examining them more particularly: and
that he was prevailed with to Copy them
lest a Paper of that nature might have
been made a Crime, if it had been found
about him writen by another hand: and
<hi>I</hi> could name one or two Persons, who
as they were able enough to Compose
such Papers, so had power enough over
his Spirit to engage him to Copy them,
and to put themselves out of danger by
restoring the Original.</p>
                  <p>You ought to address your self to the
Learned Divines of our Church, for an
answer to such things in them as puzzle
you, and not to one that has not the
honour to be of that Body, and that has
now carried a Sword for some time, and
imploys the leasure that at any time he
enjoyes, rather in Philosophical and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Enquiries than in matters of
Controversie. There is indeed one
Consideration that determined me more
easily to comply with your desires, which
is, my having had the honour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
copiously of those matters with
the late King himself: and he having
proposed to me some of the particulars
that I find in those Papers, and I having
said several things to him, in answer to
those Heads, which he offered to me
only as Objections, with which he seemed
fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly satisfied, I am the more willing to
communicate to you, that which I took
the liberty to lay before His late Majesty
on several occasions: the particulars on
which he insisted in discourse with me,
were the <q>uselessness of a Law without
a Judge, and the necessity of an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Tribunal to determine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
to which he added, the many Sects
that were in <hi>England,</hi> which seemed
to be a necessary consequence of the
Liberty that every one took to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Scriptures: and he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
that of the Church of <hi>Englands</hi>
arguing, from the obligation to obey
the Church, against the Sectaries, which
he thought was of no force, unless
they allowed more Authority to the
Church then they seemed willing to
admit, in their Disputes with this
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </q> But upon the
whole Matter <hi>I</hi> will offer you some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43333:23"/>
that will, <hi>I</hi> hope, be of as
great weight with you, as they are with
my self.</p>
                  <p>I. All Arguments that prove upon
such general Considerations, that there
ought to be an Infallible Judge named
by Christ and clothed with his Author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
signify nothing, unless it can be
shewed us, in what Texts of Scripture
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omination is to be found; and till
that is shewed, they are only Arguments
brought to prove that <hi>Christ ought to have
done somewhat that he has not done.</hi> So
these are in effect so many Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ, unless it appears that he
has Authorised such a Judge: therefore
the right way to end this dispute, is, to
shew where such a Constitution is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised:
So that the most that can be
made of this is, that it amounts to a
favourable presumption.</p>
                  <p>II. It is a very unreasonable thing for
us to form Presumptions, of what is, or
ought to be, from Inconveniences that
do arise, in case that such things are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
for we may carry this so far, that it will
not be easie to stop it. It seems more
sutable to the infinite Goodness of God,
to communicate the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to all mankind, and to furnish every
Man with such assistances as will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevail over him. It seems also rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to think, that so perfect a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
as Jesus Christ was, should have
shewed us a certain Way, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
with the free Use of our Faculties,
of avoiding all sin: nor is it very easy to
imagine, that it should be a reproach on
his G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>spel, if there is not an Infallible
Preserv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tive against Errour, when it is
acknowledged, that there is no infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vative against sin: for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the one Damns us more Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly,
than the other.</p>
                  <p>III. Since presumptions are so much
insisted on, to prove what things must
be appointed by Christ; it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that it is also a reasonable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
that if such a Court was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by him, it must be done in such
plain terms that there can be no room to
question the meaning of them: and
since this is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ge upon which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters turn, it ought to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so particularly, in whom it is vested,
that there should be no occasion given
to dispute, whether it is in one Man or
in a Body; and if in a Body, whether
in the Majority, or in the two thirds, or
in the whole Body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>animously agreeing;
in short, the Chief thing in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being the Nature a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d Power of
the Judges, those are always distinctly
specified; and therefore if these things
are not specified in the Scriptures; it is
at least a strong Presumption, that Christ
did not intend to authorise s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch Judges.</p>
                  <p>IV. There were several Controve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sies
raised among the Churches to which the
Apostles writ, as appears by the Epistles
to the Romans, Corinthians, Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and Colostians, yet the Apostles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ever
make use of those passages that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for this Authority to put an end
to these Controversies; which is a shrewd
Presumption, that they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them in that selfe in which the
Church of Rome does now take them.
Nor does St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the directions that
he gives to Church-men in his Epistles
to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> reckon this of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the directions of the Church

                     </gap>t ought to
have been revealed in a way so very
clear and past all dispute.</p>
                  <p>VI. If it is a <hi>Presumption</hi> for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons to judge concerning <hi>Religion,</hi>
which must be still referred to <hi>the Priests</hi>
and other Guides in sacred matters, this
is a good Argument to oblige all <hi>Nations</hi>
to continue in the <hi>Established Religion,</hi>
whatever it may happen to be; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all others, it was a convincing
Argument in the Mouths of the <hi>Iews</hi>
against our <hi>Saviour.</hi> He pretended to be
the <hi>Messias,</hi> and proved it both by the
<hi>prophesies</hi> that were accomplished in him,
and by the <hi>Miracles</hi> that he wrought:
as for the <hi>Prophesies,</hi> the Reasons urged
by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will conclude
much stronger, that such dark passag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
as those of the Prophets were, ought
not to be interpreted by <hi>particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
but that the Expos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of these
must be referred to the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedrin,</hi>
it <hi>being</hi> expresly provided in their
law (Deut. 17. 8) <hi>That when Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
arose, concerning any Cause that was
too intricate, they were to go to the place
which God should choose, and to the Priests
of the Tribe of Levi, and to the Iudge in
those days, and that they were to declare
what was right, and to their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cision all were
obliged to submit, under pain of Death:</hi> So
that by this it appears, that the <hi>Priests</hi> in
the <hi>Iewish Religion</hi> were authorised in so
extraordinary a manner, that <hi>I</hi> dare say,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not <hi>wish</hi> for
a more formal Testimony on her behalf:
As f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r our <hi>Saviours Miracles,</hi> these were
not sufficient neither, unless his <hi>Doctrine</hi>
was first found to be good: since <hi>Moses</hi>
had expresly warned the people (Deut.
13. 1.) <hi>That if a Prophet came and taught
them to follow after other Gods, they were
not to obey him. tho he wrought Miracles to
prove his Mission, but were to put him to
Death:</hi> So a <hi>Iew</hi> saying, that <hi>Christ,</hi> by
making himself one with his Father,
brought In thk worship of another God,
might well pretend that he was not <hi>oblig'd</hi>
to yield to the authority of our <hi>Saviours
Miracles,</hi> without taking cognisance of
his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and of the Prophesies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Messias,</hi> and in a word, of the
whole matter. So that, if these <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
are now good against the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
they were as strong in the mouths of
the <hi>Iews</hi> against our <hi>Saviour:</hi> and form
hence we see, that the authority that
seems to be given by <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Priests,</hi>
must be understood with some Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
since we not only find the prophets,
and <hi>Ieremy</hi> in particular, opposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the whole body of them, but
we see likewise, that for some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time before our <hi>Saviour's</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ys not
only many ill-grounded Traditions had
got in among them, by which the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of the moral law was much enervated,
but likewise they were universally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a selfe notion of their <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias;</hi>
so that even the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had not quite shaken off those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
at the time of our Saviour's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention.
So that here a Church, that
was still the Church of God, that had
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43333:24"/>
the appointed means of the Expiations
of their sins, by their Sacrifices and <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
as well as by their Circumcision,
was yet under great and fatal Errors,
from which particular persons had no <hi>way</hi>
to extricate themselves, but by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Doctrine and Texts of Scripture,
and by judging of them according to
the Evidence of Truth, and the force
and freedom of their Faculties.</p>
                  <p>VII. It seems Evident, that the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<hi>(Tell the Church)</hi> belongs only to
the <hi>reconciling of Differences:</hi> that of <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sing,</hi> according to the use of
those terms among the <hi>Iews</hi> signifies
only an <hi>Authority</hi> that was given to the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> of <hi>giving</hi> precepts, by which
men were to be obliged to such Duties,
or set at liberty from them: and <hi>(the
gates of Hell not prevailing against the
Church)</hi> signifies only, that the <hi>Christian</hi>
Religion was never to come to an end,
or to perish: and that of <hi>(Christs being
with the</hi> Apostles <hi>to the end of the</hi> world)
imports only a special conduct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
which the <hi>Church may always</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
but as the promise, I will not leave
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ee nor forsake thee; that belongs to
every <hi>Christian,</hi> does not import an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility:</hi>
no more does the other, And
for those passages concerning <hi>(the spirit</hi> of
God <hi>that searches all things)</hi> it is plain,
that in them St. <hi>Paul</hi> is treating of the
divine <hi>Inspiration,</hi> by which the <hi>Christian</hi>
Religion was then opened to the world,
which he sets in opposition to the wisdom
or philosophy of the Greeks; so that as
all those passages come short of proving
that for which they are alledged, it must
at last be acknowledged, that they have
not an Evidence great enough to prove
so important a truth, as some would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
by them; since 'tis a matter of
such vast consequence, that the proofs for
it must have an undeniable Evidence.</p>
                  <p>VIII. In the matters of <hi>Religion</hi> two
things are to be considered first, the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
that we must give to God, and the
<hi>Rewards</hi> that we expect from him: and
in this every man must answer for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of his heart, in <hi>examining</hi> divine
Matters, and the following what (upon
the best Enquiries that one could make)
appeared to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>: and with relation
to this, there is no need of a Judge: for
in that Great Day every one must <hi>answer</hi>
to God according to the Talents that he
had, and all will be saved according to
their sincerity; and with relation to <hi>that</hi>
judgment, there is no need of any other
judge but God. A second view of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is</hi> as it <hi>is</hi> a Body united together,
and by consequence brought under some
Regulation: and as in all States, there
are subalterne Judges, in whose decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
all must at least acquiesce, tho they
are not <hi>infallible,</hi> there being still a sort
of an apperl to be made to the Sovereign
or the supream legislative Body; so the
Church has a subalterne Jurisdiction, but
as the authority of inferiour Judges is
still regulated, and none but the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
themselves have an Authority equal
to the Law; so it <hi>is</hi> not necessary for
the preservation of Peace and Order,
that the Decisions of the <hi>Church</hi> should
be <hi>infallible,</hi> or of equal <hi>Authority</hi> with
the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> If Judges do so manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abuse their Authority, that they fall
into Rebellon and Treason, the Subjects
are no more bound to consider them;
but are obliged to resist them, and to
maintain their obedience to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;
tho in other matters their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must take place, till they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
by the Sovereign. The case of
<hi>Religion</hi> being then this, <hi>That Iesus Christ
is the Sovereign of the Church;</hi> the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the <hi>Pastors</hi> is only a subalterne
Judge: if they manifestly oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the <hi>Screptures,</hi> which is the
<hi>Law of Christians,</hi> particular persons may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43333:24"/>
be supposed as competent <hi>Iudges</hi> of
that, as in civil <hi>Matters</hi> they may
be of the Rebellion of the Judges, and
in that case they are bound still to
maintain their Obedience to Jesus <hi>Christ.</hi>
In matters indifferent, <hi>Christians</hi> are
bound, for the preservation of Peace &amp;
Unity, to acquiesce in the Decisions of
the <hi>Church,</hi> and in <hi>Matters</hi> justly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or of small Consequence, tho they
are convinced that the <hi>Pastors</hi> have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet they are obliged to be silent,
and to bear tolerable things rather than
make a Breach but if it <hi>is</hi> visible, that the
<hi>Pastors</hi> do Rebel against the <hi>Sovereign of the
Church,</hi> I mean <hi>Christ,</hi> the people may put
in their Appeal to that great Judge, and
there it must lie. If the Church did use
this Authority with due Discretion, and
the people followed the rules that I have
named with humility and modesty, there
would be no great danger of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions;
but this is the great Secret of
the providence of God, that men are still
men, and both Pastors and People mix
their Passions and Interests so with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, that as there is a great
deal of sin and vice still in the World,
so that appears in the Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well as in other things: but the
ill Consequences of this; tho they are
bad enough, yet are not equal Effects

Zeal have produced in the World, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                     </gap> of this
Church, notwithstanding all those unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Rents that are in it, is a much more
desirable thing, than the gross Ignorance
and blind Superstition that reigns in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> at this day.</p>
                  <p>IX. All these reasonings concerning
the Infallibility of the Church signify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
unless we can certainly know,
whither we must go for this Decision: for
while one Party shewes us, that it must
be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> or is no where, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Party sayes it Cannot be in the
<hi>Pope,</hi> because as many <hi>Popes</hi> have erred,
so this is a Doctrine that was not known
in the Church for a thousand Years, and
that has been disputed ever since it was
first asserted, we are in the right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
both sides; first, that if it is not
in the Pope, it is no where; and than,
that certainly it is not in the Pope; and
it is very Incongruous to say, that there
is an Insallible Authority in the Church,
and that yet it is not certain where one
must seek for it; for the one ought to be
as clear as the other, and it is also plain,
that what Primacy so ever St. <hi>Peter</hi> may
be supposed to have had, the Scripture
sayes not one word of his Successors at
<hi>Rome;</hi> so at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st this is not so clear, as a
matter of this Consequence must have
been, if Christ had intended to have
lodged such an Authority in that See.</p>
                  <p>X. It is no less Incongruous to say,
that this Infallibility is in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
for it must be somewhere else, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it will return only to the Church
by some Starts, and after long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals:
and as it was not in the Church,
for the first 320 years, so it has not been
in the Church these last 120 years. It
is plain also, that there is no Regulation
given in the Scriptures; concerning this
great Assembly, who have a right to
come and Vote, and what forfeit this
right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what number must concur in

                     </gap>lity
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43333:25"/>
of the Judgment. It is certain, there
was never a General Council of all the
Pastors of the Church: for those of
which we have the Acts, were only the
Councils of the Roman Empire, but for
those Churches, that were in the South
of <hi>Africk,</hi> or the Eastern Parts of <hi>Asia,</hi>
beyond the bounds of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
as they could not be summoned by
the Emperours Authority, so it is certain
none of them were present: unless one
or two of <hi>Persia</hi> at <hi>Nice,</hi> which perhaps
was a Corner of <hi>Persia</hi> belonging to the
Empire; and unless it can be proved,
that the Pope has an Absolute Authority
to cut off whole Churches from their
right of coming to Councils, there has
been no General Council these last 700
years in the World, ever since the Bish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ops
of Rome have excommunicated all
the Greek Churches upon such trifling
reasons, that their own Writers are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w
ashmed of them; and I will ask no
more of a Man of a Competent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to satisfy him that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> was no General Council, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that Freedom that became Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,
than that he will be at the pains to
read <hi>Card. Pallavicins</hi> History of that
Council.</p>
                  <p>XI. If it is said, that this Infallibility
is to be sought for in the Tradition of
the Doctrine in all Ages, and that every
particular Person must examine this:
here is a Sea before him, and instead of
examining the small Book of the N.
Testament, he is involved in a study
that must cost a Man an Age to go thro
it; and many of the Ages, thro which
he carries this Enquiry, are so dark, and
have produced so few Writers, at least
so few are preserved to our dayes, that
it is not possible to find out their belief.
We find also Traditions have varied so
much that it is hard to say that there is
much weight to be laid on this way of
Conveyance. A Tradition concerning
Matters of Fact that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l People see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
less apt to fail than a Tradition of Points
of Speculation: and yet we see very
ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r the Age of the Apostles, contrary
Traditions touching the Observation of
<hi>Easter,</hi> from which we must conclude, that
either the Matter of Fact of one side, or
the other, as it was handed down, was
not true, or at least that it was not rightly
understood. A Tradition concerning the
Use of the Sacraments, being a visible
thing, is more likely to be exact, than a
Speculation concerning their nature;
and yet we find a Tradition of giving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
the Communion, grounded on the
indispensible necessity of the Sacrament,
continued 1000. years in the Church. A
Tradition on which the Christians foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their Joy and Hope, is less like to be
changed, than a more remote Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet the first Writers of the
Christian Religion had a Tradition han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
down to them by those who saw the
Apostles, of the Reign of Christ for a
Thousand Years upon Earth; and if
those who had Matters at second hand
from the Apostles, could be thus mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it is more reasonable to apprehend
greater Errors at such a distance. A Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
concerning the Book of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is more like to be exact, than the
Exposition of some passages in it; and
yet we find the Church did unaimously
bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

to have been the effect of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Inspiration. till S. <hi>Ierome</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
this matter better, and made a
New Translation from the Hebrew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.
But which is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> all the rest,
It seems plain, that the Fathers before
the Council of Nice believed the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Son of God to be in some
sort Inferiour to that of the Father, and
for some Ages after the Council of Nice,
they believed them indeed both equal,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43333:25"/>
but they considered these as two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Beings, and only one in Essence, as,
three men have the same humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in common among them; and that
as one Candle lights another, so the one
flowed from another; and after the
Fifth Century the Doctrine of one Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Essence was received. If you will
be farther informed concerning this,
<hi>Father Peta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> will satisfie you as to the
first Period before the Council of Nice,
and the learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> as to the
second. In all which particulars it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
how variable a Thing Tradition
is. And upon the whole Matter, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
Tradition thus, is still a search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among Books, and here is no living
Judge.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Authority that must
decide Controversies, lies in the Body
of the Pastors scattered over the World,
which is the last retrenchment, here as
many and as great Scruples will arise, as

                     </gap>nd in any of the former Heads.
Two difficulties appear at first view, the
one is, How can we be assured that the
present Pastors of the Church are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in a just Succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
there are no Registers extant that
prove this: So that we have nothing for
it but some Histories, that are so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
writ, that we find many mistakes
in them in other Matter; and they are
so differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the very first links of that
Chain, that immediately succeeded the
Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es that the utmost can be made
of this is, that here is an Historical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
somewhat doubtful; but here is
nothing to found our Faith on: so that
if a Succession from the Apostles tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,
is necessary to the Constitution of that
Church, to which we must submit our
selves, we know not where to find it:
besides that, the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctrine of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
of the Intention of the Minister to
the Validity of a Sacrament, throws us
into inextricable difficulties. I know
they generally say, that by the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they do not mean the inward Acts of
the Minister of the Sacrament, but only
that it must appear by his outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
that he is in earnest going
about a Sacrament, aud not doing a thing
in j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st; and this appeared so reasonable
to me, that I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orry to find our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
urge it too much: till turning
over the Rubricks that are at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssal, I found upon the
head of the Intention of the Minister,
that if a <hi>Priest</hi> has a Number of <hi>Hosti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
before him to be consecrated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to consecrate them all, except
one, in that case that Vagrant exception
falls upon them all: it not being affixed
to any one, and it is defined that he
consecrates none at all. Here it is plain,
that the secret <hi>Acts</hi> of a Priest can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the Sacrament: so this overthrows
all certainty concerning a Succession:
But besides all this, we are sure, that
the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> have a much more
uncontested Succession than the <hi>Latines:</hi>
So that a Succession cannot direct us.
And if it is necessary to seek out the
Doctrines that are universally received,
this is not possible for a private Man to
know. So that in ignorant Countries,
where there is little Study, the people
have no other certainty concerning their
Religion, but what they take from their
Curate and Confessor: since they cannot
examine what is generally recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed. So
that it must be confessed that all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that are brought for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of a constant <hi>Infallible Iudge,</hi> turn
against all those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that do not acknowledge the <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the <hi>Pope:</hi> for if he is not <hi>infallible,</hi>
they have no other <hi>Iudge,</hi> that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it. It were also easie to shew,
that some Doctrins have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
received in some Ages, as they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43333:26"/>
have been rejected in others; which
shews, that the Doctrine of the present
Church is not always a sure measure.
For five Ages together, the Doctrine
of the Popes Power to <hi>depose Heretical
Princes</hi> was received without the least
Opposition: and this cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any that knows what has been the
State of the Church since the End of
the eleventh Century: and yet I believe
few Princes would allow this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the concurring authority
of so many Ages to fortifie it. I could
carry this into a great many other Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but I single out this because it is a
point in which princes are naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
sensible.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole Matter, it can never
enter into my mind, that God, who has
made Man a Creature, that naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
and reasons, and that feels as sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
a pleasure when he can give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a good account of his actions, as one
that sees, does perceive in comparison
to a blind man that is led about; and
that this God that has also made Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
on design to perfect this Humane
Nature, and to raise it to the utmost
height to which it can arrive, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
it to be dark, and to be so much
beyond the penetration of our Faculties,
that we cannot find out his mind in
those things that are necessary for our
Salvation: and that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that
were writ by plain men, in a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
stile, and addrest without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination
to the Vulgar, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
such an unintelligible Book in
these Ages, that we must have an <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Iudge</hi> to expound it: and when I
see not only <hi>Popes,</hi> but even some Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that pass for General Councils, have
so expounded many passages of it, and
have wrested them so visibly, that none
of the modern Writers of that <hi>Church</hi>
pretend to excuse it, I say I must free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
own to you, that when I find that I
need a Commentory on dark passages,
these will be the last persons to whom I
will address my self for it. Thus you
see how fully I have opened my mind
to you in this matter; I have gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a great deal of ground in as few
words as is possible, because hints I
know are enough for you; I thank God,
these Considerations do fully satisfie me,
and <hi>I</hi> will be infinitely joyed, if they
have the same effect on you.</p>

Papers were sent into the Countrey; some that saw it, liked it well,

entirely confine himself to the Reasons that were in those Papers, but took the
whole Controversy to task in a little compass, and yet with a great variety of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.
And this way of examining the whole matter, without following those
Papers word for word, or the finding more fault than the common concern of this
Cause required, seemed more agreeing to the respect that is due to the Dead,
and more particularly to the Memory of so great a Prince; but other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

this letter, it has been kept in private hands till now: those who have boasted
much of the Shortness of the late Kings Papers, and of the length of the Answers

Majesties Secretary of State.</head>
            <p>I Know the Disadvantages of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones Innocence, especially
when he is prosecuted at the suit
of his Natural Prince, to whom he
owes so profound a Duty: and this has
kept me so long in a respectful silence,
after I had seen my Name in so many
<hi>Gazettes,</hi> aspersed with the blackest of
all Crimes: but there is both a time
to be silent, and a time to speak: and
as hitherto I have kept my self within
the bounds of the one, so I do now
take the Liberty which the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
me: but I was not hitherto silent
where I ought to speak; for I have
made many humble Addresses to His
Majesty by the Earl of <hi>Midletoune</hi> his
Secretary of State; hoping that my
Innocence, joyned with my must hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Duty, would have broke through
all those Prejudices and false Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with which my Enemies had
possessed His Majesty against me.</p>
            <p>Upon the first Notice that I had of
His Majesties having writ to the Privy-Council
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordering Process
to be issued out against me for High-Treason,
I writ my First Letter: in
that I could enter into no particulars;
for in the Advertisement that was sent
me, it was said, that there was no
special Matter laid to my Charge in the
King's Letter. Some days after that,
I received a Copy of my Citation, to
which I presently writ an Answer, and
sent that with my Second Letter to the
same Noble Person; to both these
Letters <hi>I</hi> received no Answer: but <hi>I</hi>
was advertised, that some Exceptions
were taken at some words in my First
Letter, and this led me to write my
Third Letter, for explaining and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
those words. <hi>I</hi> have kept my
self thus within all those Bounds that <hi>I</hi>
thought my Duty set me; and am not a
little troubled, that <hi>I</hi> am now forced to
speak for my self. <hi>I</hi> have delayed
doing it as long as <hi>I</hi> had any reason to
hope, that my Justification of my self
was like to produce the effect which <hi>I</hi>
most humbly desired, and which <hi>I</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
but now the Day of my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
being come, in which it is
probable Sentence will pass against me,
since <hi>I</hi> have had no Intimations given
me to the Contrary, <hi>I</hi> hope it will not
shew either the least impatience, or
the want of that Submission, which <hi>I</hi>
have on all occasions payed to every
thing that comes to me from that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
under which God had placed
me that <hi>I</hi> publish these Papers for my
own Vindication. If it had been only
in defence of my Life and Reputation,
that <hi>I</hi> had been led to appear in such a
manner, <hi>I</hi> could have more easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ained
my self: and have lest these to
be Sacrifices to the Unjust Rage of
those, who have so far prevailed on
His Majesties readiness to believe them,
as to drive this matter so far: but the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43333:27"/>
Honour of that Holy Religion which <hi>I</hi>
profess, and the Regard <hi>I</hi> bear to that
Sacred Function to which <hi>I</hi> am dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
lay such Obligations on me, that
<hi>I</hi> am determined by them, to declare
my Innocence to the World, which <hi>I</hi>
intend to do more copiously within a
little while: but in the mean time, <hi>I</hi>
hope the following Papers will serve to
shew how clear <hi>I</hi> am of all the Matters
that are laid to my Charge.</p>
            <p>There is one Particular, which is
come to my Knowledge since <hi>I</hi> writ my
Answer, that will yet more evidently
discover my Innocence: I have receiv'd
certain informations from <hi>England,</hi> that
both Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi> and his Son, and
Mr. <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter,</hi> have declared upon many
Occasions, and to many Persons, that
they cannot imagin how they come to
be Cited as Witnesses against me; that
they can scarce believe it can be true;
since they know nothing that can be
any way to my Prejudice; and that
they must clear me of all the Matters
objected to me in this Citation, and
the Two Witnesses, that as it seems are
citkd for that Article that relates to
<hi>Holland,</hi> have solemnly declared, that
they know nothing relating to me, or
to the Matters specified in this Citation,
which one of them has signifyed to
my Self in a Letter under his hand; so
that the Falsehood of this Accusation
is so Evident, that it serves to discover
the Folly, as well as the impudence of
those who have contrived it.</p>
            <p>But it is yet too early to set on a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
for Matters of Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Crimes against the State must be
pretended, and fastned on those whom
these Men intend to destroy. And as
foul and black Scandals are invented to
defame me, and put in the mouths of
those who are ready to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
every thing that may disgrace
me, without considering that they do
a thing that is as unbecoming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem,
as it is Base and injust in it self, so all
Arts are used to destroy me; but I
trust to the Protection of that Great
God, who sees the injustice that is
done me, and who will in his own
Time and Way vindicate my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
and under Him I trust to the
Protection of the HIGH AND MIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY
STATES OF HOLLAND
AND WEST-FRIESLAND.</p>

               <p>THE Affairs of these Provinces
belonging to Your Lordship's
share in the Ministry, leads me
to make this most humble Address to
You, and by Your Lordship to His
Majesty.</p>
               <p>I have received Advertisements from
<hi>Scotland,</hi> that the King has writ to the
Privy Council, ordering me to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against for High Treason against
His Person and Government: and that
pursuant to this, the King's Advocate
has cited me to appear there; if any
thing in this World can surprise or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
me, this must needs do it: For
as few have writ more, and preacht

                  </gap>ts of Treasonable
Doctrines and Practices than my Self,
so all the Discoveries that have been
made of late Years, have been so far
from aspersing me, that though there
has been disposition enough to find
fault with me, yet there has not been
Matter given so much as for an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
It is now thirteen Years since
I came out of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and for these
last five years, I have not so much as
mentioned the commonest News in any
Letter I have writ to any in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
I do not mention Acts of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
because I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w that I do not need
the benefit of them. I went out of

and I have stayed out of it because His

of <hi>Holland:</hi> but though by this, <hi>during
my stay here, my Allegiance is translated
from his Majesty to the Soveraignty of this
Province,</hi> yet I will never depart from
the profoundest Respect to his Sacred
Person, and Duty to his Government:
since my coming into these parts, I have
not seen any one Person either of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or <hi>England</hi> that is Outlawd for
Treason; and when the King took Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
at the Access I had to the
Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> there
was not any thing of this kind objected
to me. So I protest unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I do not so much as imagine upon
what it is that those informations, which
it seems are brough to his Majesty, are
founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> As I am not ashamed of
any thing I have done, so I am not
afraid of any thing that my Enemies
can do to me: I can very easily part
with a small Estate, and with a Life of
which I have been long weary; and if
my Engagements in this Countrey could
dispence with it, I would not avoid the
coming to stand my Tryal: but as this
cannot be expected in the state in
which I am, so I humbly throw my
self at His Majesties Feet, and beg,
that he may not Condem me so much
as in his thoughts, till I know what is
the Crime t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for I cannot betray my own Innocence
so far as to suffer a thing of his: nature

of the greatest Misfortunes that can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

               <head>An Answer to the Criminal Letters issued out against me.</head>
               <p>I Look upon it as a particular Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that I am forced to answer a
Citation that is made in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Name, which will be ever so
Sacred with me, that nothing but the
sense of an indispensable Duty could
draw from me any thing that looks like
a Contending with that sublime Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> owe the Defence of my own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and of my own Reputation and
Life to my self: <hi>I</hi> owe also to all my
Kindred and Friends, to my Religion
as <hi>I</hi> am a Christian and a Protestant,
and to my Profession as <hi>I</hi> am a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and above all, to His Majesty, as
<hi>I</hi> am his Born-Subject, such a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Loyalty and Integrity, as
may make it appear, that my not
going to <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the
Tenour of this Citation, does not flow
from any sense of Guilt or Fear, but
meerly from those Engagements under
which I am in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope my Contradicting or Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Matters of Fact set forth in
this Citation, shall not be so maliciously
perverted by any, as if <hi>I</hi> meant to
reflect either on His Majesty for writing
to his Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordering
this Citation to be made, or on his
Advocate for forming it, and issuing it
out. But as <hi>I</hi> acknowledge, that upon
the Information that it seems was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
of those matters here laid against
me, it was very reasonable for Hs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to order Justice to be done upon
me; so his Advocate, in whose hands
those Informations it seems are now
put, had all possible reason to lay them
against me, as he has done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will not pretend to make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to the Laws and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
set forth in the first part of this
Citation; but I will only answer the
matters of Fact laid to my Charge; and
whatsoever <hi>I</hi> say concerning them, does
only belong to my false Accusers; and
therefore I hope they will not be lookt
on as things in which even His Majesties
Advocate, but much less His Sacred
Majesty is any ways concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> am first accused for having seen
conversed with, and held correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the late Earl of <hi>Argyle:</hi> and
to make this appear the more probable,
the place is marked very Critically,
where I lived; and where, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
we met, But as it is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
two years since the late <hi>Argyle</hi> was
taken and suffered; and that a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
was had of all his secret Practices,
in all which <hi>I</hi> have not been once so
much as mentioned, tho' it is now a
year since I have lived and preacht o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
in these Provinces. The truth
is, that for nine years before the late
Earl of <hi>Argiles</hi> forfeiture, I had no
sort of Correspondence with him, nor
did <hi>I</hi> ever see him since the year, 1676
After his Escape out of Prison I never
saw him, nor writ to him, nor heard
from him, nor had <hi>I</hi> any sort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with him, directly nor indirectly:
the Circumstance of my House, and
the Place in which I lived, is added, to
make the thing look somewhat proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but tho' it is very easy to know
where I lived, and I having dwelt in
<hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> the space of seven
years, it was no hard matter to add
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43333:31"/>
this particular; yet so inconsiderate is
the Malice of my Enemies, that even
in this, it leads them out of the way;
for soon after <hi>Argile</hi>'s Escape, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the stay that as is believed he
made in <hi>London,</hi> I had removed from
<hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> into <hi>Brook-Buildings;</hi>
this makes me guess at the Informer,
who saw me often in the one House,
but never in the other: and yet even
he, who has betrayed all that ever past
between us, has not Impudence enough
th charge me with the least Disloyalty,
though I concealed very few of my
thoughts from him.</p>
               <p>With this of my seeing <hi>Argile,</hi> the
Article of the Scandalous and Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
words pretended to be spoken
by me to him, against His Majesties
Person and Government, falls to the
ground; it is obvious that this cannot
be proved, since <hi>Argile</hi> is dead: and it
is not pretended that these words were
uttered in the hearing of other Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
nor is it needful to add, that His
Majesty was then only a Subject, so
that any Words spoken of him at that
time cannot amount to Treason: but I
can appeal to all those with whom I
have ever Conversed, if they have
ever heard me fail in the respect I
owed the King: and I can easily bring
many Witnesses from several parts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> of the Zeal with which I have
on all occasions expressed my self on
those Subjects, and that none of all
those hard words, that have been so
freely bestowed on me, has made me
forget my Duty in the least.</p>
               <p>I am in the next place accused of
Correspondence with <hi>Iames Stewart,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguson, Thomas Stewart,
William Denholm,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi>
since my coming out of <hi>England,</hi>
and that I have entertained and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
them in Foreign Parts; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in the Cities of <hi>Amsterdam, Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
Leyden, Breda, Geneva,</hi> or in some
other parts within the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
This Article is so very ill laid in all its
branches, that it shews my Enemies
have very ill Informations concerning
my most general Acquaintance since;
tho' there are, among those that are
condemned for Treason, some that are
of my Kindred and ancient Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
they have here cast together
a Company of men who are all <hi>(Iames
Stewart</hi> only excepted) absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to me, whom I never saw, and
with whom I never exchanged one
word in my whole Life, as far as I can
remember; one of them Mr. <hi>Robert
Martyn,</hi> was as I ever understood it,
dead above a year before I left <hi>England,</hi>
as for <hi>Iames Stewart,</hi> I had a general
Acquaintance with him twenty years
ago, but have had no Commerce with
him now for many years, unless it was
that I saw him twice by accident, and
that was several years before there was
any Sentence past on him: my Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
know my motion ill, for I have
not been in <hi>Breda</hi> these twenty three
years. I se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led in the <hi>Hague</hi> upon my
coming into <hi>Holland,</hi> because I was
willing to be under the Observation
of His Majesties Envoy: and I chose
this place the rather, because it was
known, that none of those that lay
under Sentences come to it. I have
never gone to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or <hi>Roterdam</hi>
in sccret: and have never been there
but upon my private Affairs, and that
never above a Night or two at a time;
and I have been so visible all the while
that I was in those places, that I thought
there was no room left even for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:43333:31"/>
In the last place it is said, that I have
publickly and avowedly uttered seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Speeches and Positions to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
of his Majesties Person, Authority
and Government, and that I continue
and persist in those Treasonable Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
This is so generally afferted, that
it is enough for me to say, that it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
false: but I have yet clearer
Evidence to the contrary of this: <hi>I</hi>
have Preached a whole Sermon in the
<hi>Hague</hi> against all Treasonable Doctrines
and Practises; and in particular against
the Lawfulness of Subjects rising in
Arms against their Sovereign, upon the
acc unt of Religion: and <hi>I</hi> have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this so oft, both in publick in
private, that <hi>I</hi> could, if <hi>I</hi> thought it
convenient, give proofs of it that would
make all my Enemies be ashamed of
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>njustice and Malice.</p>
               <p>The Witnesses cited against me are
first, Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> have
not seen above this four Years last past,
and with whem <hi>I</hi> have had no sort of
Commerce since I saw him It is almost
two Years since he had his pardon, so it
is probable he then told all that he has
ever told concerning me: and it is not
likely, that the matter would have been
let lie asleep all this while, if he had
said any thing to my prejudice. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<hi>I</hi> have been long acquainted with
him, <hi>I</hi> look upon him as a man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and <hi>I</hi> reckon my self so safe in
his Honour, and in my own Innocence,
that <hi>I</hi> do very freely release him from
all the Obligation of Frindship and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and with that he may declare
every thing that has past between us:
for then <hi>I</hi> am sure he will do me the
right to own, that as oft as we talkt of
some th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Scotland, I</hi> took occation to repeat my
Opinion, of tie Duty of Subjects to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and hear all the ill Administrations
that might be in the Government, but
never to rise in Armt upon that account.
The <hi>next Witness</hi> is his Son, whom <hi>I</hi> never

what became a man of my profession
to so young a person, exhorting him to
the Duties of a Christian. The next
two are Mr. <hi>West</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> whose

Mr. <hi>Carstaires</hi> and <hi>Mr., Baird.</hi> whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>I</hi> know not neither, it seems these
are the Witnesses to be led against
me for the Article relating to

Stranger to <hi>Mr. Carstaires,</hi> so <hi>I</hi> do not
so much ar know if there is such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in being as <hi>Robert Baird,</hi> Merchant
in <hi>Holland.</hi> and for the last, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I</hi> have had no Correspondence at
all with him these two and Twenty
Years; unless it was that once or twice
I have met him by accident in a V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Years ago I went to discourse with him
concerning a matter of History in which
we differ'd; but as all our Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at that time was in the presence of
some Witnesses so it was not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to matters of State.</p>
               <p>And now I have gone over all the
Matter that is laid against me in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and have made such Reflections
both on the Facts that are alled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Witnesses that are named, as will
I hope satisfie even my Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
of the Falsehood and Injustice
of these Informations. So that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
so far on his Majesties Justice, as
to expect that all the Indignation which
is kindled against me, will be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To all this I will add one thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for my Justification, tho <hi>I</hi> am
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43333:32"/>
fully satisfied it is that which <hi>I</hi> am not
obliged to do, and which if <hi>I</hi> were in
other Circumstances <hi>I</hi> would not do
my self; as <hi>I</hi> would advise no other
man to do it, For it is a part of that
Right that every man has to preserve
himself by all lawful ways, that he do
not accuse himself, and by consequence,
that he do not purge himself by Oath
of matters objected to him: and I do
not so well approve of the Courts of
Inquisition, as to give countenance to
a practice which was first set on foot
by them, of requiring men to answer
upon Oath to matters objected to
them. If I were not a Churchman I
would not do this which I am about
to do; as I declare I will never do it
again, let my Enemies lay to my
charge what they please. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<hi>I</hi> have to this sacred Function to
which I am dedicated, makes me now
once for all. offer this solemn purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my seif. <hi>I attest the Great God,
the searcher of all things, and the Iudge
of all men, that all the matters of Fact
laid to my charge in this Citation, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
Groundless, and absolutely false.</hi>
This I am ready to confirm with my
Corporal Oath, and to receive the
Sacrament upon it.</p>
               <p>And now I hope I have said enough
to satisfie His Majesty concerning my
Innocence, so that I am confident he
will not only discharge all further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against me, upon this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
but that he will express his
Royal Displeasure against my False
Accusers. But if the power of my
Enemies, and their credit with His
Majesty is still so great, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall be carried further, and that
advantage shall be taken from my not
appearing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to proceed to a
Sentence against me, which some bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
men now in the <hi>Hague</hi> are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before hand, that they will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it: I then make my most humble
Appeal to the Great God, the King of
Kings, who knows my Innocence, and
to whom my Blood will cry for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
against all that may be any
way concerned in the shedding of it.
He will at the Great Day judge all men
righteously, without respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
It is to him I fly, who I am sure
will hear me. Judge me O God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraing

will appear so evident to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as well as to all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,

I confess the many hard things that
have been of late cast on me, and
in particular to Young and Old, and
Forraifners as well as <hi>English</hi> men,
that have been coming into these
darts, make me see that my Enemies
have possessed His Majesty with
thoughts of me, that I must crave
leave with all Humility to say, that
they are as undeserving as hard.
What have I either done or said, to
draw on me so heavy and so long a
continued Displeasure? but my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
lyes in the Witness that I have
within me, of my own Innocence:
So that I dare appeal to God, as I
do new to his Vicegerent.</p>
               <p>Since this Matter is now become

by an effect of His Majesties Iustice,
in ordering an end to be put to this
Accusation, and that by some Act
that may be as publick as the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

His Majesties being satisfied with
my Innocence, as to these Matters;
but if I have still as Melancholy an

I must maintain my Innocence the

that seems a little too vehement, I
hope the provocation that I have met
with will be likewise considered; for
while my Life and Reputation are

my Addresses to your

the Paper that I sent you
by my last of the Seventeenth
of <hi>May,</hi> together with the two
Lettes that I writ you: for I
find it necessary to add this,
and that it go with the rest to
the Press.</p>
               <p>I am told, that great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
have been taken upon an
Expression in my First Letterr,
in which I writ, <hi>That by my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalisation
during my stay here,
My Allegeance was translated from
His Majesty to the Sovereignty of
this Provence;</hi> as if this alone
was Crime enough; and I hear
that some who have been of
the Profession of the Law are
of this mind. I indeed thought
that none who had ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to study Law, or the
general Notions of Entercourse
among Nations, could mistake
in so clear a Point. I caution'd
my words so, as to shew that
I considered this Translation
of my Allegeance only as a
temporary thing <hi>during my stay
here.</hi> And can any man be so
ignorant as to doubt of this?
Allegeance and Protection are
things by their nature recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:

gives a Legal Protection, there
must be a return of Allegeance
due upon it. I do not deny
the Root of Naturali Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
remains, but it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under a suspension, while
the Naturalised Person enjoys
the Protection of the Prince or
State that has so receiv'd him.
I know what a Crime it had
been if I had become Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralised
to any State in War
with the King: but when it
was to a State that is in Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with him, and when it
was upon so just a ground as
my being to be Married and
Settled in this State, as it could
be no Crime in me to desire it,
so I having obtained it, am not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43333:34"/>
a little amased, to hear that
any are so little conversant in
the Law of Nations, as to take
Exception at my words. Our
Saviout has said, <hi>That a man
cannot servs two Masters:</hi> and the
Nature of things say, that a
man cannot be at the same
time under two Allegeanees.
His Majesty by Naturalising
the Earl of <hi>Feversham</hi> and many
others of the <hi>French</hi> Nation,
knows well what a right this
gives him to their Allegeance,
which no doubt he as well as
many others have sworn, and
this is a translating thesr Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
with a Witness: That
Lord was to have commanded
the Troops that were to be
sent into <hi>Flanders</hi> in 1678 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Natural Prsnce: and
yet though the Laws of <hi>France</hi>
are high enough upon the <hi>points</hi>
of Soveraignty, it was never so
much as pretended that this
was a Crime. And it is so
much the Interest of all Princes
to assure themselves of those
whom they receive into their
Protection by Naturalising
them (since without that they
should give Protection to so
many Spies and Agents for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Prince) that if I had not
very good grounds to assure
me, that some have pre ended
to make a Crime out of my
Words, I could not easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it.</p>
               <p>My Lord,
This is the last Trouble that
I will give your Lordship upon
this Subject, for it being now a
Month since I made my first
Address to you, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That it is resolved to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
this matter to all Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and Mr. D' <hi>Albevilles</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
against me, and the
Threatnings of some of his
Countrymen, make me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that all my most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Addresses to His Majesty
are like to have no other effect
but this, that <hi>I</hi> have done my
Duty in them; so that it seems
<hi>I</hi> am to be judged in <hi>Scotland.
I</hi> am sorry for it, because this
will engage me in a defence of
my Self, <hi>I</hi> mean a justification
of my own Innocence, which
<hi>I</hi> go to much against my heart:
but God and man seee that <hi>I</hi> am
forced to it: and no Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43333:34"/>
of any here with frighten
me; for <hi>I</hi> will do that which
<hi>I</hi> think fit for me to do to day,
though <hi>I</hi> were sure to be assassi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nated
for it to morrow: but to
he last moment of my Life <hi>I</hi>
will pay all Duty and Fidelity
to His Majesty.</p>

            <p>WHen <hi>I</hi> had resolved on
the Printing these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and was waiting till the
day should come to which I
was Cited, I received a new
Advertisement, that the first
Citation was let fall, and that
<hi>I</hi> was cited of new to the <hi>15th.</hi>
of <hi>August,</hi> to Answer to the
Crimes of <hi>High Treason,</hi> upon
the account of <hi>two Heads</hi> in my
First Letter to the Earl of Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toune:
The one is. That I say
that <hi>by my Naturalization I am
loosed from my Allegeanee to His
Majesty;</hi> and the other is, that
I threaten His Majesty with the
<hi>Printing and Discovering of Secrets
that have been long hid.</hi> If after
what I have hither to met with,
there were room lest for new
Surprises, this would have
been a very great one. Those
who have advised the King to
this way of proceeding against
me, shew that they consider
very little the Reputation of
His Majees Justice and so
I be but sacrificed, they do not
care how much the King's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
suffers in it: for First,
after a Citation of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which has made so much
Noise, that is let fall: Which
is plainly to Confess, that there
is no Truth in all those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that were laid to my
Charge; and then, where is
the Justice of this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
to summon a man to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43333:35"/>
appear upon the pretence of
Crimes, of which they know
him to be Innocent? But this
new matter is of such a nature,
that it is not easie for me to
find words soft enough to
speak of it with the decency
that becomes me.</p>
            <p>This is now more the Cause
of the <hi>States of Holland</hi> and
<hi>West-Friezland</hi> than it is mine.
It is indeed the Cause of all the
Sovereigns in the World, and
so it is His Majesties own cause,
who has so often call'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalised
<hi>French</hi> His Subjects, and
by Consequence they owe him
an Allegeance, and so here must
be at least a Temporary <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of their Allegeance made to
him from their Natural Prince:</hi>
And either this must be the
same as to those who are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalised
by the States here, or
they are not a Sovereign State,
and by consequence this cause
is theirs, and not mine; since
the Crime of which I am now
accused is the acknowledging
my self to have become their
Subject <hi>during my stay here,</hi> upon
their having granted me the
Benefit and Protection of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalisation;
so that either His
Majesty was much mistaken in
calling the <hi>French</hi> that are <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralised,
His Subjects;</hi> or it can be
no <hi>Crime</hi> in me to have owned
my self to have become a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Subject to the Statet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if those who have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
the <hi>Roman Law</hi> will reflect
a little on the effects that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the (<hi>Ius Civitatis</hi>) or
the Rights that followed on
the being made a <hi>Roman Citizen,</hi>
which are the same in all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
States, and that <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raluzation</hi>
is with regard to a
<hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption</hi>
was by the <hi>Roman Law</hi>
with regard to <hi>Private Families,</hi>
they will see that my Enemies
do not reflect enough on the
Principles of Law when they
pretend to make me a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
upon such an account. If
I had been charged for having
desired to be <hi>Naturalised,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
there had been some more
colour for it: but since it is now
a received Practice over all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
for the <hi>Subjects of one State</hi>
to procure their being <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralised</hi>
in another; it is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
how any can call in
question that tie of <hi>Allegeance</hi>
that he who is <hi>Naturalised</hi> owes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43333:35"/>
his New Masters. Not have my
Enemies considered how much
this way of proceeding against
me, must si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k the Credit of His

for how can they expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Protection from him, if it is
made apparent that the <hi>King</hi> does
not think he has a right to their
Allegeance? and into what a
consternation must it throw them
when they find by my Case that
the King looks upon them as so
many <hi>Traitors</hi> for becoming his
<hi>Subjects,</hi> and for swearing <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi>
to him? for that <hi>Oath</hi> is
sworn in terms that are plain and
full, and that have not the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
that I put in my words of
<hi>during my stay here;</hi> so that they
are much more <hi>Criminal</hi> than it
can be pretended that <hi>I</hi> am.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Article</hi> is no less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to His Majesty, since they
would make a Crime out of my
words, that mention my Fear
that he may be displeased at some
things that may be in the <hi>Apology,</hi>
that I will be obliged to make for
my self, to the <hi>Writing</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of which a Sentence against
me will drive me. If these men
who have advised this, had the
regard to His Majesty which
they owe him, they would not
have presumed to infer, that it
was a Threatning of <hi>His Majesty</hi>
when I say, <hi>that I must justifie my
self: or that any History of past Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
can be a want of Duty to him,</hi>
this Consequence of theirs inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
that his <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>the late King
his Brothers,</hi> cannot bear a <hi>True
History,</hi> otherwise <hi>Where is the
Threatning?</hi> but how great a <hi>Crime</hi>
this is, will I hope appear to <hi>His
Majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when he has the leisure
to reflect upon it; yet there may
be many particulars that <hi>I</hi> must
necessarily bring in, in <hi>the History</hi>
that <hi>I</hi> am writing, which have
such a connection with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to my self, that <hi>I</hi> cannot
pass them by; which yet if it
could be avoided, may not be fit
for publick view. <hi>Now if my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
fancy, that it is a Crime for
me to justifie my self, because they have

answer this with some famed sayings
of</hi> Tacitus'<hi>s, that would disturb 'em
a little; and if in a humble Groan
that I make before His Majesty, I
mention this as a consideration that
may be of some weight with him,
they who can turn this Expression of my
Duty and Respect into a Crime, and
are successful in the attempt, have a
Talent for which I do not envy them,
though I my self come to feel the weight
of it.</hi>
