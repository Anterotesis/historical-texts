            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MY Friends, you are well met here; I ſuppoſe your buſineſs now is walking; and I am for a turn or two with you.</p>

               <p>I wiſh you had ſpoken that <hi>Penitently; So</hi> I am ſure you ought to have done. And if you had come a little ſooner, you had learnt that duty from a very good Sermon.</p>

               <p>To the ſame purpoſe ſaid the Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that ſince they had <hi>left to burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, they had wanted all things,</hi> and <hi>had never ſeen good days.</hi> All times have afforded matter enough of complaint, and I muſt confeſs there hath been a ſort of Preaching that hath greatly contributed to the evils of ours: but in this place, and ſuch like, there is, I hope, no danger of hearing any of thoſe peſtilential Doctrines, that once poyſoned the publick Air. I am ſure the true Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtianity teacheth things
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53420:3"/>
that would cure all our maladies were they duly heeded, and put in practice: I need not tell you how earneſtly it every where preſſeth <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Patience</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal, Charity</hi> and <hi>Peace, Mortification</hi> to the world, and <hi>Conſcientious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to Governours. Theſe our Miniſters preach, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will not ſay, that <hi>ſuch</hi> Preaching promotes the evils of the times; if it do, 'tis very accidentally, and <hi>ſo,</hi> as the Grace of <hi>God is turn'd into laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs,</hi> and the ſtrivings of his Spirit may contribute to mens greater hardneſs.</p>

               <p>We have more reaſon to <hi>thank</hi> God for the plenty, than to <hi>quarrel</hi> at the abundance. It would be very humorſome and fooliſh to complain that the Rivers run with more water than is neceſſary for our occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and 'twould have been abſurd perverſencſs in the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to have murmured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more Manna fell than they could uſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Do you not think then that there may be over-doing in this?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes doubtleſs; when <hi>all</hi> religious offices are run into Preaching; when <hi>that</hi> excludes the publick Prayers, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing; when private Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days are ſet apart without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53420:4"/>
Authority, to humor the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of vain people; all theſe are over-doing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But is not conſtant Preaching twice every Sunday, beſides occaſional weekly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, too much?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It may be too much for the ſtrength and health of the Miniſter; it may be too much, where the people will not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thoſe afternoon Sermons, or are prejudiced againſt them; it may be ſo in Country Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and where no remarkable inconvenience ariſeth from the omiſſion of them: But in Cities and great Towns, (as the times are) they are in a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſince without them, people would idle more about,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53420:5"/>
and more would run to the Conventicles; and 'twould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the reproach of lazineſs, on our Miniſters, and turn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers off from the Church, that are kept in tolerable order by this double diligence.</p>
               <p>There is not juſt ſo much Preaching ſet and ſtated by the Laws of Chriſt, and the Church, as muſt not be exceeded; but ſo much is due as Edification, Peace and Order require; now this is more or leſs, according as circumſtances of times are; and ours are ſuch as make it very behooveful for Miniſters to abound in this work; what is grievous in it is to <hi>them,</hi> who have much more labour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them than former
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53420:5"/>
times expected, and in ſtead of being advanced in proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable maintenance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>that</hi> is faln as much (or more) than their work is increaſt. So that 'tis indeed very hard upon <hi>them,</hi> but <hi>wee,</hi> the people, have no reaſon to complain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But Preaching being ſo frequent and common, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes contemptible by it; and is ſo much the leſs heeded.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This is too true: and 'tis a great evil and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe that labour in the Word and Doctrine: but what help fo rit? To reſtrain and put a ſtop to the courſe of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cure this abuſe, would in likelyhood be followed with a

train of greater Evils; and as circumſtances are, it could not be done, without manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the great Intereſts both of Church and State. If the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Clergy ſhould leave fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preaching, the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle-meetings would ſwallow all: and therefore, upon the whole, whatever is to be thought of the thing it ſelf, nakedly, and abſtractedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it is not, I think, any matter of juſt complaint, that there is ſo much Preaching: where the fault is not in the quality, the plenty is no grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>

               <p>For my part I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I ſeldom hear Sermons, I love the Prayers of the Church,

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is a great unhappineſs to mankind, that we are ſo apt to run from one extreme into another: In the late times (and ſtill among ſome) Preaching and Hearing were in a manner all the Religion: and the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church deſpiſed, and excluded; and now, ſome on the quite contrary, pretend to magnifie the publick prayers, but vilifie Preaching; and make Hearing nothing. So that one duty and part of Religion is ſet up to conflict and deſtroy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I obſerve, that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally people of this pretence, do in good earneſt care for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Preaching is an Evangelical Inſtitution, and the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given the Apoſtles was, that they ſhould <hi>go and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 'twas <hi>neceſſary</hi> for him <hi>to Preach the Goſpel,</hi> and woe to him if he did it not; and that he was not ſent to <hi>Baptiſe</hi> but to Preach. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>viz.</hi> not to do the former chiefly. <hi>Faith comes by hearing;</hi> and <hi>how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> This was the way whereby God convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind unto men in all times. <hi>Noah</hi> was a <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and God ſpake unto them of old, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophets.

initiated, and adult that are to be confirmed; there are weak to be ſtrengthened; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be reſolved, and ſetled; there are Pious to be directed, and Wicked to be reproved; There are Hereticks and other Erroneous, and many who at the bottom are Infidels, that muſt be confuted, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: Theſe needs are and will be ſtill, and Preaching is the ordinary means that God hath appointed in his Church to miniſter to ſuch occaſions, ſo that this was not a <hi>temporary</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to ſerve the firſt times only, but is of perpetual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſe. And therefore when our Saviour delivered the Commiſſion to the Apoſtles to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53420:9"/>
teach all Nations, he gave it to them and their ſucceſſors, and annext a promiſe of his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual help, which continues ſtill, and will always, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would be <hi>with them to the end of the world.</hi>

               <p>Well, well! I think I know as much as the Preacher can tell me; and therefore ſhall not trouble my ſelf much with hearing Sermons.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No wiſe man will think you the more knowing for that opinion. You have read what one that knew a great deal ſaid, <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him,</hi> Prov. 26. 12. And another, <hi>He that thinks he knows any thing, knows nothing yet as he</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53420:9"/>
                  <hi>ought to know.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 2. For even Apoſtles, and the greateſt, confeſt that they knew <hi>but in part,</hi> and ſaw <hi>through a glaſs darkly.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> you know hath pronounc'd roundly againſt <hi>opiniators,</hi> ſaying, That 'tis the <hi>fool that rageth, and is confident,</hi> Prov. 14. 16. But if you did know ſo much, that you were not to be taught, yet ſince others do not, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is neceſſary for their wants, you ought to encourage their attendance by your example, though you had no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hear Sermons: Yea you would have need however to hear on your own ſcore; For the deſign of Preaching is not to teach men new things; not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53420:10"/>
always to inform the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in matters before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; but ſometimes it gives order and method to our thoughts, which perhaps were perplext, and ſo ſets things in their right place, helping us to clearneſs of conception, which is a great advantage: It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to bring known things to our minds, to render them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our thoughts, to awaken confideration, and by that to excite the affections, and ingage the practice. It is not ſo much our want, that we do not know our duty, as that we are dead, and cold, and averſe to practiſe what we are acquainted with; ſo that it is the buſineſs of Preaching to ſet before us the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53420:10"/>
proper motives, and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to move us to ſutable action. The grand cauſe of mens ſins and neglects is <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> and Preaching is a means to cure <hi>that.</hi> And let me ask you, whether you do not ſometimes find your ſelf much moved by what is ſaid, and preſt by another, when you had had the ſame things in your mind before, without effect?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot deny that; but I ſee but little good that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth in the world: Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame after all their hearing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>More good, many times, is done than appears; and I doubt not but it is ſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe. There are ſeeds of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53420:11"/>
Picty and Vertue ſown in the Soul, that ſhew themſelves not a long while after, till time, further conſideration and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bring them forth; many convictions lodged in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of wicked men, that lie there like fire in a flint, till they are excited, and then they become means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of repentance: many hints of truths taken without preſent emotion, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much influence the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and practice, ſome habitual fear of God, and love and eſteem of religion, planted inſenſibly in the mind, that in their ſeaſon work great effects; and I doubt not but by theſe, men that are very bad, are in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53420:11"/>
divers inſtances reſtrain'd and rendered leſs wicked than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would be. And though I have as deep a ſence of the vileneſs of the world as moſt men have, yet I queſtion not but that it would be very much worſe were it not for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; many there are who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly own, and ſhew the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they receive from it, and 'tis fit the River ſhould run on, though but few men, or beaſts are refreſh'd by it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>We have indeed read of great effects of Preaching here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, as of <hi>Jonas</hi> on the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s on the three thouſand converted at one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and <hi>Orpheus</hi> and others among the Heathens, have done
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53420:12"/>
ſtrange things by the force of their Poetry and Eloquence; but now we ſee no ſuch things; which is a plain indication that our Preaching is little worth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis an ill meaſure to judge of the worth of things by their ſucceſs. The inſtances you give are great, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Preachers as thoſe have not ſucceeded, as they did. You know how it was with <hi>Noah</hi> in reference to the old world, to whom he preach'd many years without ſucceſs on any, beſides ſome of his own family: <hi>Lot,</hi> no doubt, exhorted and reproved the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> but to how little purpoſe? The Prophets were earneſt and powerful in their Preaching,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53420:12"/>
and yet few believed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but the people continued ſtill a ſtubborn and perverſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Our Saviour preacht to many that would neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, nor his doctrine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the divinity of his perſon, and the power of his miracles; And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> one of the moſt powerful of Preachers, after great pains with the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> ſeems to fear that he had <hi>labour'd in vain</hi> with them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 5. and after much inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſtowed on the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he complains that <hi>though for the time, they ought to have been teachers, they had ſtill need to be taught again which were the Principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> Hebrews 5. 12. So that the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53420:13"/>
want of ſucceſs is not always juſtly chargeable on the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And <hi>ours</hi> certainly hath as great a ſubject, as great ends, as great motives, and as great helps as ever any, bating the <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi> had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore doubtleſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is in the Preaching, and our Preachers have not the <hi>way,</hi> or ability to uſe thoſe advantages.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Our Preachers are men, and have imperfections; and I confeſs there are divers ſorts of Preaching that have no perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force in them: But yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have moved much, have been in their perſons, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and other natural talents as indifferent, as generally our Divines are: and ſome of our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53420:13"/>
Preaching is as ſubſtantial, plain and forceable, both as to the matter, and manner of it, a perhaps any Age ſince the Apoſtles hath yielded; and yet ſuch doth not prevail. There is therefore ſomewhat more in it than you imagin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In order to your infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this matter, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to conſider, that in all affairs, both of nature and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, the ſeemingly greateſt and fitteſt means, many times, produce nothing; when things mean, and to appearance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, work wonders. This might be exemplified in divers of the great changes of the world, and is to be ſeen daily
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53420:14"/>
in the variations that happen in the Spirits, and Actions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſpoſitions required in the Subject, in order to its being affected, or altered by the Agent: where thoſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, a ſmall matter makes great impreſſion; but where they are not, the greateſt effects nothing: The moſt warm Sun, and ſeaſonable ſhowers cauſe no verdure on a rock; when a few kindly beams, and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able drops make the graſs ſhoot in the fruitful meads. There are analogous preparations and diſpoſitions in the ſpirits of men, that ariſe from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the conjunction of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53420:14"/>
which is not obſerved: where ſuch are as are proper to incline the ſubject, mean inſtruments work mightily, where they are wanting, the <hi>ſame,</hi> yea and thoſe that in themſelves are <hi>more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and forcible, are fruitleſly employ'd. Now under the appearance of the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, inclinations, humors and appetites, there is a vaſt inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diverſity in theſe unheeded circumſtances; ſo that one is powerfully moved by that which no way affects another; as we ſee in a trivial inſtance of one mans being inflamed by the paſſion of love by the ſight of an agreeable beauty, that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taking to another, equally amorous: and the ſmalleſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53420:15"/>
thing kindles him that is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly diſpoſed, when all the charms of the ſame perſon are loſt upon another. I give this inſtance, not out of lightneſs in ſo ſerious a matter, but becauſe I cannot at preſent think of a better, that ſo plainly illuſtrates what I endeavour to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This ſhews indeed how particular men may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moved by ſmall things, when the ſame, and greater, make no impreſſions elſewhere. But how is it that multitudes are ſtrongly affected together, as in the caſe of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and the ſudden converſion of whole Nations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The perſons that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53420:15"/>
in thoſe wonderful converſions, were acted by an extraordinary Spirit, which gave them extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and prepar'd the hearts of men for thoſe wonderful changes; and it was not the bare natural force of their Preaching, and Eloquence, that was the cauſe of thoſe mighty operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that theſe are not fair inſtances in our caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But will you not grant that Preaching hath generally affected more in other of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ages of the Church, than it doth in this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt grant it, and think that it ſcarce ever influenced the people leſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well! and is not the cauſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53420:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the want of ordinary ſucceſs, the meanneſs and defects of the preſent preaching.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You may gather from what I have been ſaying that I do not judge ſo. As in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, ſo in publick bodies, and in whole Nations there may be a concurrence of favourable or croſs circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that either diſpoſe to, or hinder the effect and influence of Preaching. You remember that in the beginning of the late unhappy times, the Preaching of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Miniſters (then ſo call'd) did great things, ſtrangely prevailing upon the people; and there were no doubt conſiderable changes wrought upon many of their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53420:16"/>
lives by it, at leaſt, to reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from open prophaneneſs, and irreligion; which we have no need to aſcribe to their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater matters to ſay than were ſaid before, or ſince: But there was then a concurrence of many things that diſpoſed the multitude to be ſo affected. They were much ſcared with the noiſe of <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> by thoſe who pretended themſelves to be the only Preachers, and defenders of the <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> religion: and people that are frighted are ſoftned, and rendred very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible: and then, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of thoſe men were very taking, it was all <hi>light</hi> and <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> that they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53420:17"/>
taught, ſet out by new conceits, and new phraſes, by great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and fervours of mighty zeal, which things eſpecially when they are <hi>new,</hi> fill the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and by that work ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly upon the affections of the vulgar. Beſides which, the times were troubled, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented; men were angry with their Governours, and diſſatisfied with the legal eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments (which then 'twas part of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>godlineſs</hi> to oppoſe) And this begat the greater opinion of, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe Preachers, and their Doctrines: Theirs were looked on as the only Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving Sermons, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits contributed mightily to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53420:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſucceſs of them: ſo that they could not chooſe but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon warm, imaginative people, ſo prepared and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But when the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe ways no longer met oppoſition, when the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the notions and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was over, and the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow ſtale, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to them, then you may remember, that thoſe moving Preachers affected nothing ſo much as they had done before: Then we heard great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the comparative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequency of converſions, and the loſs of that warm zeal that the people were acted by in the former ſeaſon. Such were the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53420:18"/>
diſpoſitions that contributed to <hi>their</hi> popularity: But <hi>our</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are under the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſadvantages, ſo that 'tis a rare thing if any of them be very popular, though never ſo excellent Preachers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what are thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages you ſpeak of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The generality of the people have their phancies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſteſt with the notions, phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ways of thoſe other men, and ſo are prejudiced, or indiſpoſed to that Preaching that would inſtruct them better. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them follow thoſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into Conventicles, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral that do not, have an hankring after the Garlick and Onions; and others are cold
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53420:18"/>
and indifferent to ſuch matters one way, or other: The hurt that the irregular leading men did by their Preaching, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in divers a diſlike and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of the thing it ſelf: and for <hi>their</hi> ſakes alſo the Perſons of our Miniſters undergo diſreſpect and contempt: Their practices have begot in many an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at leaſt a diſregard to the Clergy, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the nocent and the innocent: Atheiſts, Papiſts, Phanaticks, the debauched livers, and the covetous envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, make it their buſineſs to ſlander, vilifie, and expoſe them. The preferments that are good raiſe envy, the vaſt number of mean and poor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53420:19"/>
Vicarages beget contempt, and both the one and the other, as ill will can take occaſion, are applyed to the whole Order.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But do you not think the preſent Clergy have a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults that deſerve the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect that is fallen on them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So big a body of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without faults: but 'twould be too great a diverſion from our preſent buſineſs to diſcourſe what I have to ſay of that now, I may take another occaſion to talk with you fully about it; I ſhall only note at preſent, that they ſuffer for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faults as much, or more, than for their own. Many of the old <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſthood got great poſſeſſions by abuſing the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53420:19"/>
credulity of the people at their death; and the contrary humor prevails ſo much now, that ſcarce any thing is given by Will to Clergy or Church uſes: even the little that is left is thought too much, and every one (almoſt) is nimming, and catching from them what he can. The Fanatical and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Clergy Preacht us into Rebellion, and many are ſo ſet againſt the whole Order by it, that they cannot endure any of that gown, though moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to thoſe principles and ways: Now the caſe being thus as to their faculty and perſons, it cannot be expected that their labours ſhould be very taking; and ſince there is ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53420:20"/>
conjunction of ſo many other circumſtances to indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the people to the preſent Preaching, it is no wonder our Preachers have not that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and lead not the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, as ſome others have done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But the non-conforming Preachers do it ſtill, though the Novelty you ſpoke of be over, which is a ſign it was not that which occaſioned their ſo great prevalency, and ſucceſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Novelty was one of the concurring circumſtances men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; that is gone indeed, but the others are revived, and new added, the fears of Popery, the oppoſition to eſtabliſhments, the diſcontent, the glory of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53420:20"/>
thought more godly, the phancy of perſecution, and ſuch like, are as formerly: and there are over and above, the great exceſs of Atheiſm and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, that the ſcandals they have brought on Religion have occaſioned; and their pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Teachers whom they look on as oppreſt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſplaced: Theſe make them ſtick cloſe, and to hear their Preachers with more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and zeal of attention, which affords them advantages for fame and applauſe. But for all this, though when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt <hi>Idolatry, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Will-worſhip, Formality,</hi> the people ſigh and take on, and ſeem to be much moved; yet
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53420:21"/>
let them but Preach heartily and home againſt <hi>malice, cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, bitter zeal, lying, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, ſchiſm, diſobedience</hi> to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governours, <hi>ſpiritual pride, waywardneſs, fondneſs</hi> towards <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain opinions,</hi> and ſuch like ſins of the parties; they will then find very cold entertainment of their doctrine, and move no paſſions by it, but rage and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt themſelves; and the conſequents, withdrawings from their meetings, and bitter revilings of their perſons. So that indeed their Teachers how powerful ſoever eſteem'd have not power to move them to any thing contrary to their humor, and the corrupt intereſt of their party: and therefore I never
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53420:21"/>
heard but of one man among them who durſt venture to tell them plainly and honeſtly their own ſins; and him, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the moſt conſiderable perſon that goes with them, they worry, and perſecute with their bittereſt reproaches and invectives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>For my part I think the way for our Miniſters to bring the people back again to our Church, would be to out-preach thoſe Teachers which you ſo much condemn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>But who ſhall be judge what ſort of Miniſters out-preach the other. The people ſo diſpoſed and prepoſſeſt, as I have ſhewn ours generally are, will always judg on the ſide of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53420:22"/>
the men that flatter them, and cant in their phraſes, and ſtand in oppoſition to the Government; ſo that though our Miniſters ſpake all like Angels, and all theirs brayed like Aſſes, thoſe people would give the power and ſpirituality on <hi>their</hi> ſide. I ſuppoſe, you know the Apologue, the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale and Cuckoo ſung, the Aſſe was judge; The appeal was made, and the ſentence was, That he could not deny but the Nightingale did well, but for <hi>a plain Song</hi> he was for the <hi>Cuckoo.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>They will confeſs indeed that there is not ſo much Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and fine language in their Sermons, but they are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53420:22"/>
commended and followed for their <hi>Plainneſs.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Plainneſs</hi> is one of the beſt characters any Sermon, or other Diſcourſe can have; and he is the Speaker that hath the <hi>art</hi> to be <hi>plain.</hi> But one of the greateſt faults I find with thoſe mens Sermons is, that they are not ſo. They generally ſtate their doctrines confuſedly, in words <hi>metaphorical</hi> and <hi>ambiguous;</hi> and direct to practice <hi>myſtically,</hi> and obſcurely in <hi>phraſes,</hi> and odd ſchemes of ſpeech, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and ſcarce intelligible; as hath been ſufficiently ſhewn in divers late Books. Theſe the people having been uſed to, by them in the late times, though they underſtand no
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53420:23"/>
meaning in them, yet they take them to be plain; at leaſt to be ſo to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> underſtandings, which they preſume their own are. Another part of their Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts in <hi>homely ſimilitudes,</hi> and rude and blunt alluſions, accommodated to the humor of the vulgar, who love ſuch <hi>familiar Preaching,</hi> as they call it, which is indeed a debaſing of Religion, and expoſing what they deliver to the ſcorn of thoſe of a better reliſh. Whereas our Miniſters repreſent their doctrines and inſtructions in clearneſs of thought, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of ſpeech, without non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical myſteries, and words without meaning. This I am ſure is ſo in thoſe that I hear, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53420:23"/>
I hope moſt other regular Miniſters endeavour the ſame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>And yet I have heard people complain that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Some would ſay, they have been ſo much uſed to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that ſence is a hard thing to them: Plaineſt things may ſeem difficult to thoſe that are not accuſtomed to hear them. Our Miniſters find it neceſſary ſometimes to ſhew the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of the principles and duties of the Chriſtian religion, for the aſſiſtance of thoſe of more advanced underſtandings, againſt the pretences and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of Atheiſts and Infidels: and 'tis impoſſible <hi>ſo</hi> to expreſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53420:24"/>
all the matters that concern thoſe great ſubjects, as that every vulgar head, that hath not been uſed to thinking, and deep reaſoning, ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take them. No, theſe though never ſo plainly diſcourſt will require manly, exerciſed minds, or they will not be receiv'd, or comprehended; and Miniſters muſt divide the word to every one his portion, and not always ſpeak to one ſort. If there be any thing in this complaint, here I am ſure is the ground, which the Preachers cannot help, except they could create underſtandings for their hearers: Otherwiſe they indeavour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and practiſe Plainneſs: and in thoſe ſubjects too, as far as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53420:24"/>
the nature of the thing will bear. Their ornament and all they pretend as language, is Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and the great fault they accuſe the others of is want of it: you may ſee in their books againſt them that they chiefly reprove, and expoſe thoſe men for their affectation of myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nonſence, and words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, that is, for their not being intelligible, and plain.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Plain</hi> Preaching doubtleſs is beſt: and that it may be is the reaſon that the moſt <hi>learned</hi> men are not the beſt Preachers; for they ſpeak in a ſcholar-like way, and cannot deſcend to ordinary capacities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have indeed often heard
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53420:25"/>
that ſpoken as a maxim, but though it hath ſome ſhew of truth, yet there is much miſtake, if not malice againſt Learning in it. There are a ſort of learned men who have ſpent moſt of their time, and pains upon <hi>Languages</hi> and <hi>Antiquities</hi> (things in their kind very good and uſeful) others whoſe chief employment hath been <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> and the ſpinoſities of controverſie: and theſe of each kind, generally get great fame for learning. But then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they do not exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Preaching, which is a faculty very diſtinct from thoſe ſtudies, and requires proper helps and indeavours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it happens, when ſuch
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53420:25"/>
Preach, that their Sermons are dry and harſh, ſavouring of the crabbedneſs of their ſtudies and having little of the genius of moral and practical Divinity: This I know is the caſe of ſome, I ſay not of all the learned men of thoſe ſorts. And this I think is the occaſion of the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But then there is another ſort of learned men, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign hath been to ſtudy things, to furniſh their minds with clear and right conceptions, to make obſervations on human nature, the manners and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, to turn their thoughts, after due preparations, towards practical Theology, to take parochial charges, and to exerciſe themſelves in frequent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53420:26"/>
Preaching: And theſe are by their learning and knowledge inabled to ſpeak with the moſt judgment, propriety and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For (as I intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) it requires parts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to be plain. He muſt think diſtinctly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that would teach ſo: and the true uſeful learning is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtrument to inable a man for that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>But if ſo much knowledg and underſtanding is neceſſary to the conſtituting a true and plain Preacher, methinks we ſhould not have ſo <hi>many</hi> in that buſineſs: for the maintenance of Miniſters is in moſt places ſo ſmall, that it will not afford en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for ſuch men; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53420:26"/>
others that are unqualified diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the profeſſion, and do miſchief to the publick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If I ſhould ſpeak to the thing it ſelf, I ſhould ſay, that as the maintenance for Miniſters, and the conſequents are, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a much leſs number of Preachers might ſuffice; But our circumſtances muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: The common people count almoſt nothing elſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and diſcharge of duty in ſupply of a Cure, but Preaching: and the Diſſenters carry all by <hi>that,</hi> ſo that as our affairs are, <hi>general indifferent</hi> Preaching may be more expedient, than much <hi>better,</hi> when more <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>reſtrained.</hi> But as to this, the Governours of the Church are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53420:27"/>
the beſt Judges of what is fit, and we are to acquieſce in what they ordain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I think that neither they, nor we need make ſo much adoe about it, for Preaching is no part of <hi>Divine Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I believe you are out in that, for pray what do you call Divine Worſhip?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Prayer, <hi>and</hi> Thanksgiving, <hi>and</hi> Sacramental Communion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You name me ſome of the parts of Worſhip, but what is the general nature, and notion of it? Is it not the ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and honouring of God, in the ways he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well! and what then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then! it follows that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53420:27"/>
Preaching is Worſhip, and ſo is hearing. For Preaching is publiſhing Gods mind and will, that the people may know his truth, and obey his laws: and are not his Wiſdom, Holineſs and Legiſlative Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by glorified? If they are not known, how ſhall they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd? if not believ'd how can they be honoured? and how can they be either known or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd without being publiſht? how can <hi>they believe on him of whom they have not heard, and how can they hear without a Preacher?</hi> Rom. 10. 14. This is part of <hi>his</hi> Homage and Worſhip, he is ſent to <hi>Preach</hi> the Goſpel. And <hi>Publick Hearing</hi> Gods word preacht, is part of the <hi>peoples</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53420:28"/>
Worſhip, ſince thereby we ſolemnly acknowledge, that he is our Lord, and that we deſire to know how we may accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſerve him: That he is our teacher, and we are willing to be inſtructed by his word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and explained by his meſſengers: That in him is our ſupream happineſs, and that we are deſirous to know how we may enjoy him; and all this is doing ſolemn honour to God our maker, and why this ſhould be denyed to be Worſhip, I cannot tell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This I have often heard; as I ſuppoſe you have alſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, but we ſhould not receive every bold ſaying to the prejudice of our duty.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53420:28"/>
There are many ſuch that paſs for current among thoſe that are willing to entertain them, that would not bear the tryal; and we ought to examine the things we hear before we admit them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall not differ from you in that. But pray don't you think that <hi>Catechiſing</hi> is better and more uſeful than ſo much Preaching?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Such compariſons are odious. One duty ſhould not be commended to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an other; each ought to have its place. And indeed Catechiſing is a ſort of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is but another way of teaching the principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and is no doubt very uſeful, and much needed:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53420:29"/>
ſo that the Pulpit-Preaching ſhould not exclude this, both becauſe the Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, and becauſe that will enter and make impreſſion one way, that will not another. And Catechiſing hath been uſed in the beſt ages of the Church with very good ſucceſs. This you know our Miniſter doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form one ſeaſon of the Year; till all the youth is gone over that he can get to that exerciſe: and during all that time he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo in the afternoon upon ſome Catechiſtical head, in order for the inſtruction of the Men and Women, as well as Children. So that as Preaching doth not exclude Catechiſing, neither doth Catechiſing exclude that. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53420:29"/>
is double labour I confeſs for the Preacher ſo to do, but the People (at leaſt in great Towns) will not be contented without the afternoon Sermon, and a Miniſter cannot do his duty to the Church, and his charge, without the other, in fit times. On this occaſion I muſt take notice to you, that generally the people are very cold, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and wanting to their children in this matter, in that they do not duly catechiſe them at home, and do their parts for the inſtructing them in the principles of Religion; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſomething of this kind, what is done in publick will not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie much: And 'tis through the want of domeſtick inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53420:30"/>
that people grow up ſo much in ignorance, and are thereby ſo apt to be blown about by every wind of vain doctrine; and to be drawn away from the Church by every pretender that whiſtles them either to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> on the one hand, or the Sects on the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But Catechiſing you ſay is Preaching, and what! would you have private men Preach?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may and ought to Preach in this ſence. Every ſuch is a Prieſt to his own family, that is, it is his duty to teach them the great things of Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of his skill, and knowledg. This is one
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53420:30"/>
way to provide for our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and 'tis the moſt neceſſary. Men had better neglect the getting their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Bread and Cloaths, than to omit the care about this grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more needed proviſion. 'Tis noted to the honour of the holy Patriarch, That he would <hi>teach his Children. Timothy</hi> was taught the Scriptures from a youth, and all Parents are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to bring up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the <hi>nurture</hi> and <hi>admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord.</hi> Were not this duty ſo much neglected, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would find their people more teachable, and leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the greater and ſtronger truths that they yet know not; more tenacious of,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53420:31"/>
and better ſetled in thoſe that they know already, and more able to ſhame, and to reſiſt the attempts of Gain-ſayers.</p>
               <p>Among all the Preaching we have, this is very much needed, and the great defect that is the occaſion of moſt of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maladies lyes here. We are very apt to catch at any thing that may faſten a blame on our Miniſters, when there is the leaſt ſhew of neglect on their parts; I wiſh we could be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and reform this great one of our own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But what think you of the <hi>Homilies?</hi> Are not <hi>they</hi> very uſeful, and fit to be read in Churches, inſtead of ſo much other Preaching? For
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53420:31"/>
my part I ſhould like that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Homilies</hi> contain very good, pious, and wholſom inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and doctrines; and in due place and time may be uſed with great profit and advantage. But I ſuppoſe you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have them in to exclude all <hi>other</hi> Preaching; For that would render the abilities of learned Miniſters (as to this part of their office) uſeleſs. There are many occaſions which thoſe diſcourſes make no proviſion for; and by ſuch a practice the people in all likelyhood would be very much diſcontented, if not inflamed. I ſuppoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you mean not that the Homilies ſhould thruſt out all other Preaching, but that in ſome
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53420:32"/>
places and times, they might be profitably uſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No, I think it would be well if they were generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd; and ſuch others added to them as ſhould be thought ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and fit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have as great a reverence for that Book as you, and as great a ſenſe of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that ariſe from the defects of many Preachers. But we muſt not always judge of things, as they are nakedly in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but circumſtances muſt be weigh'd. Publick Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are not only to conſider the goodneſs, but <hi>expediency;</hi> and in reference to a due judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that, many extrinſecal matters are to be taken into the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53420:32"/>
account. Now as our caſe is we have (bleſſed be God) plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of learn'd and moſt excellent Preachers (as many I believe as any Age or Nation ever had) Thoſe have beſtowed much time, pains, and coſt for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing themſelves with abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the Pulpit; and after all, to ſuppreſs their excellent, and uſeful labours, and to ſet them upon the ſame level with thoſe that can but read, would be a great diſcouragement to them, and loſs to the Church: it would diſhearten and divert young Students in the Univerſities, be a great damp upon learning, and in all likelyhood, deſtroy the glory of thoſe venerable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Piety and Literature:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53420:33"/>
Beſides which, the People you know are ſo prejudiced, that it would poſſeſs them with rage againſt their Governours, and contempt of their Miniſters, fill the Conventicles, and 'tis to be fear'd, make our breaches and diviſions incurable. So that certainly you are not in earneſt in this, or if you are, I ſuppoſe there are but very few of your mind. I have heard ſome talk indeed that they thought it might do well, if only ſome ſelect men in every Dioceſs (and thoſe to be ſeated in the moſt eminent places) ſhould be allow'd to Preach; and the fame enjoyned to make every year ſo many Sermons to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to the Biſhop, as in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53420:33"/>
whole ſhould come to fifty two: beſides ſome for the anniverſary dayes; that a Volume of thoſe Sermons ſhould be printed yearly. That each Miniſter of thoſe not licenſed to Preach their own, ſhould have a Copy, and no more be printed than would ſuffice for <hi>them:</hi> That they ſhould read, or recite one of theſe by heart, every Sunday, till they ſhould arrive to ſuch Age and Ability, as to be thought fit to be intruſted with the inſtructing the people with their own Sermons. What this would do, and how practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable it is, I ſhall not pretend to determine: It looks I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs plauſibly enough. But I am no propoſer of new projects;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53420:34"/>
theſe matters muſt be left to our Governours; and I mention this only by the by.</p>

               <p>You are reſolv'd to have your own opinion in all things we have talked on; and you ſhall for me. But notwithſtanding all you have ſaid, I ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to have ſo good an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Preaching, as you ſeem to have, till I have reaſon to think that the Preachers believe their own Doctrines.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By that you ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that you think they do not: A very hard thought, that ſhould not be entertain'd light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What any man believes we cannot tell, but by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: and the Clergy make zealous and earneſt profeſſion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53420:34"/>
of the Chriſtian truths; and therefore 'tis great injuſtice, and uncharitableneſs to judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of them, except upon clear evidence. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil,</hi> it makes the beſt and moſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did interpretations of things, that are capable of wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: But to judg and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe evil where there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it, this is to exerciſe a lawleſs and brutiſh force upon the names of men, and to <hi>rejoyce in iniquity,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. No ones reputation can be ſafe from any aſperſion, if men may take this lewd liberty of faſtening the worſt they can phancy on them; ſo that except you can make out what you ſay
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53420:35"/>
(which I am ſure you cannot) you manifeſtly incurr the guilt of being an accuſer of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. To aſperſe any private Chriſtian in this manner, is a great ſin; how much more is it ſo to ſlander an whole order of publick perſons, that bear a Sacred Character. For you do not only injure them in their perſons, but miſchief others by it, whom by ſuch reproaches you prejudice againſt them, and ſo hinder the good that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might do by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: On which account the reputation of Miniſters is and ought to be dear to thoſe that are truly honeſt and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: and where men love to pickeer, and to find faults with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53420:35"/>
Miniſters; 'tis a plain caſe that they have ſome corrupt byas that ſways them in thoſe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>

               <p>For my part I thank God I have none. But by their <hi>fruits ye ſhall know them:</hi> Their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons preach contrary to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and are too plain indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the little ſerious credit they give their own doctrines and inſtructions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I hope you do not think that I would patronize any mens vices or miſcarriages: There are too many in all ſorts, and where they are in thoſe of the ſacred function they are worſt; among whom I cannot deny but there are ill practices; they are ſubject to the follies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53420:36"/>
and paſſions of other men. But then I muſt tell you too, that were they Angels in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they would be black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made vile. For pray conſider how many enemies they have on all ſides, that watch for their haltings, and are ready to triumph in any opportunity to expoſe them. Many hate them for their Function, more for their Conformity: The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts on the one hand, and the Sects on the other; Thoſe that have plunder'd the Church, and thoſe that deſire to do it; thoſe that have devour'd, and thoſe that take lickeriſh notice that they have a morſel left. Theſe generally are glad of any fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a conforming Miniſter;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53420:36"/>
they lye at catch for ſuch, and when they have got a ſtory, they blow it about with wondrous diligence: So that where there is a ſmall miſcarriage they will aggravate it, till they have made it a great wickedneſs; and when 'tis an heinous offence; they will impute it to the whole Order. And which is worſe, there are many wicked lewd ſlanderers ready to aſperſe the cleareſt innocence; and ſome that make it their buſineſs in their debauches to contrive igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Tales of Clergy-men, which their Enemies are willing to believe, or at leaſt to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, though they do not. Wherefore conſidering theſe, and ſuch like unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53420:37"/>
'tis no wonder if the preſent Clergy ſuffer much in their names on this ſcore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But what then, are all the things we heard of lewd and debaucht Clergy-men falſe, do you think? and are there not many ſuch vile Perſons in Holy Orders?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you I acknowledge, and lament that there are ſo many unworthy perſons crept in among the Clergy; and I wiſh with all my Soul there could be a remedy found for it. But will you conſider how moſt of them get in; you know moſt of the livings of <hi>England</hi> are in Lay-Patronage, and you cannot be ignorant what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ways are now frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53420:37"/>
taken in the diſpoſal of them: what Bonds, Contracts and Terms are required, which honeſt, worthy and ingenious men will not comply with, but thoſe of no worth or conſcience accept. They bring their Preſentations to the Biſhops, and are able to give an account of their learning, as far as the Law requires (which I have heard is much leſs than will render a man able and ſufficient according to the expectation of our days) They bring us alſo a formal Teſtimonial from thoſe that likely know little of them, and the Biſhop knows nothing at all of what they are, leſs of what they are like to prove: But being ſo qualified, Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53420:38"/>
and Induction cannot be denyed by the Law. They get into a cure, and misbehave themſelves in it; and then the blame ſhall lie on the Biſhop, and the diſgrace ſpread upon the whole Clergy. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally I obſerve that thoſe who ſo infamouſly, and diſhoneſtly diſpoſe of the livings in their gift, and by ſo doing fill the Church with unworthy and incompetent perſons, are the ſame that clamour about the ill lives of the Clergy, moſt.</p>

               <p>But ſhould not theſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be rectified?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think ſome good Laws may be wanted to do this: and let me tell you, thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain might contribute to the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53420:38"/>
reforming of the miſcarriages.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>How ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By complaining where, and as they ought: As to inform the Biſhop when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of any Simonaical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; to tell the Miniſter his fault when they know him pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and if after that he perſiſt in his vice, to make publick complaint to the Dioceſan, that his reformation may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by the Cenſures of the Church; or that upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious perſiſtence, he may be caſt out. If this courſe was faithfully taken, the evils would be in great part cured. But the miſery on't is, many that cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor do not deſire <hi>that,</hi> but are rather glad of an opportunity to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53420:39"/>
aſperſe, and vilifie the Clergy; and therefore they complain for miſchief, not for remedy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It may be ſo with ſome, but I aſſure you 'tis not ſo with me. But I think now we have talkt enough of this ſubject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think ſo too; and 'tis time for me to be going homewards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>Pray let me ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to you firſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder you have been ſilent ſo long, what is it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>Is it! It is to tell you that you have been very bitter in your Cenſures of thoſe godly Miniſters, whoſe Conſciences will not give them leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. And after all you have, or can ſay, I muſt tell you they are very <hi>powerful</hi> Preachers, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53420:39"/>
prevail ſo much, not for I know not what phancies of yours, but becauſe they <hi>Preach Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>cry down Sin,</hi> which very few of your National Preachers do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I did not conſider that you were ſo near, elſe perhaps I might have dealt more gently with your Friends. In what I have ſaid I have ſpoke plainly as I thought, and as I doubt not, the matter clearly is, as all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding unprejudiced men, who have been acquainted with their ways, may ſee; ſo that you do me wrong to accuſe me of bitterneſs, as if I had aggravated things beyond the juſt and due repreſentation of them, which I aſſure you was all I intended.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>Powerful</hi> indeed to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53420:40"/>
move the affections that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Enthuſiaſm, Pride, Singularity and Faction have begot: Thoſe they ſtir by the ſame ways by which they were produced; they are powerful on the affections of the ſenſleſs inconſidering vulgar, which are mightily tranſported by bluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and noiſe, as the waters are by a Storm, when as ſoon as the violence is over, they are ſtill as before: But I do not find that they generally move the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and judicious, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than to beget in them ſcorn of their egregious follies, and pitty of their fond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.</p>
               <p>But they <hi>Preach Jeſus Chriſt</hi> you ſay, which others you think
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53420:40"/>
do not: and 'tis true they have the name of Chriſt almoſt ever in their mouths, and talk as men tranſported with the beauties and excellencies of the Lord <hi>Jeſus:</hi> This others do not ſo much, and therefore Preach not Chriſt, you phancy; by which you ſhew how little you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what you ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you live under their powerful Preaching. For to Preach Chriſt is to declare and preſs his Doctrines, Laws, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and Sanctions, which I am ſure our Miniſters (thoſe of them I hear) conſtantly and earneſtly do: and not to doat upon, and to be always imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently and fulſomly repeating of his name. I cannot deny
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53420:41"/>
indeed but that your men alſo profeſs his Doctrins and Laws; but yet 'tis the opinion of ſome, that many of thoſe Preachers have ſo darkned theſe by their phraſes, and ſo corrupted them by their falſe and fanatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that their Goſpel is quite another thing from the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Apoſtolical Chriſtianity; and if ſo, they Preach not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but their own <hi>dreams.</hi> But that is too large a ſubject for us to diſcourſe now. That I may obtain your favour, I will allow they Preach Chriſt (I wiſh ſome do it not out of <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Envy)</hi> yet certainly they are not the <hi>only</hi> men that do it, nor is that fit to be a mark of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and our Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53420:41"/>
O but they <hi>Preach down Sin,</hi> you tell us; and that's power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preaching, and by that they affect the hearts and conſciences of their hearers. And 'tis true thoſe Teachers cry out againſt ſin in the <hi>general,</hi> with a great deal of earneſtneſs, declaring what a vile and odious thing ſin is, with wondrous zeal (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay with ſo much ſence and judgment) but then, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome deſcend to particulars, except in declaiming againſt the noted ſins of others, and ſuch as they take their Governours in Church and State, and thoſe of oppoſite judgment to them, to be guilty of: So that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places of invective, are <hi>Idolatry, Will-worſhip, Superſtition,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53420:42"/>
                  <hi>Humane Inventions, Formality, Perſecution, hatred</hi> of the <hi>Godly,</hi> and ſuch like (things of which themſelves are as guilty as any ſort of men in the world, though they think not ſo) But for the ſins with which they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and plainly chargeable (thoſe I mention'd before) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Deceit, Diſobedience, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Backbiting, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Schiſm, Sacrilege,</hi> and other ſuch, we ſeldom hear them declaim againſt thoſe. I do not remember that in ten years, in which I was capable of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the late times, that I ever heard one Sermon from any of them, upon either of thoſe ſubjects.</p>

               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>You may talk what you
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53420:42"/>
pleaſe, but for my part, I ſhall hear thoſe men, becauſe I find I <hi>profit</hi> by them, and I cannot by your Pariſh Miniſter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is the continual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for leaving our Churches, when people have nothing elſe to ſay. Pray therefore let you and I debate this matter a little. <hi>You don't profit by our own Miniſter:</hi> You <hi>do by thoſe other Teachers.</hi> As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> let me ask you, whoſe fault is it that you do not profit? Doth not our Miniſter Preach the great Truths, and Duties of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Don't you obſerve that he picks out the moſt ſutable, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and awakening Subjects? Doth he not repreſent the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines with plainneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53420:43"/>
Doth he not preſs the duties with earneſtneſs and affection, doth he not lay down the great motives and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and give us the true practicable directions to guide us in the performance? (You have heard him often) what ſay you, can you deny any of this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>I have no great fault I confeſs to find with the mans Preaching, but yet methinks I am not ſo much affected with it, nor can I profit by it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems you do not profit, but you cannot tell why; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give me leave to tell you the reaſon. Firſt, you have no kindneſs for the Miniſters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe he conforms, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53420:43"/>
it may be, is not in all things of the ſame opinion with the men you admire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>Now you mind me of it, I muſt tell you he is not <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> nor ſound in his judgment, and that I confeſs doth beget in me ſome diſlike of him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orthodox</hi> is a word by which your men mean one of their own opinions; and of theſe they are very fond, and in doating on uncertain points that appertain not to the foundation, they ſhew themſelves very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and lay ground for eternal Schiſm, and even for Scepticiſm, and Atheiſm it ſelf. For when diſputed things are adhered to as certain and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Chriſtian Charity will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53420:44"/>
be deſtroyed, and all things at laſt diſputed.</p>
               <p>But pray what do you make the meaſure of Orthodoxy? Are not the belief of and adherence to the Scriptures, the firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, the old Creeds, and the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (which in the Doctrines your men pretend to allow) are not theſe enough to intitle a man Orthodox? and all theſe our Miniſter teacheth, and profeſſeth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>But doth he not hold ſome opinions that are contrary to thoſe grounds of belief?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I do not think he doth, and I dare ſay he thinks he doth not. In extra-eſſential matters the Pious and the Learned of all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53420:44"/>
ſorts have ever been of different judgments, and are like ſo to continue to the worlds end. I have in my time, converſt with men of all perſuaſions, and yet ſcarce ever met any two (though of the ſame general way and Communion, that were in all things of the ſame mind: And therefore if our Miniſter judgeth otherwiſe than you or I, or this or that Divine, in ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points of Theology, it is but as every <hi>thinking</hi> man elſe doth: and we that hear him conſtantly know, that he generally Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great acknowledg'd Truths, and never troubles his hearers with private opinions: But zealouſly and frequently reproves thoſe that diſturb the

               <p>Well! but I have heard him Preach Doctrines I did not like.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That may be: But I hope you do not take your liking or diſliking to be the ſtandard of Doctrines fit to be Preach'd or not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>And yet you ſtick to all your opinions with that ſtiffneſs as if you were infallible: and condemn every one for errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that in the leaſt differs from you. This let me tell you, is great pride and immodeſty, and renders people very unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or bear any thing but what is juſt according to their own phancy, and preconceiv'd opinion; nor be taught to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing better than they do already, as if their

knowledg was perfect, and their minds had no need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; when as moſt commonly ſuch preſumptuous perſons are very ignorant, and the knowledg they pretend, is but a confuſed heap of vain imaginations, which they pickt up by chance, and have no truth or coherence in them.</p>

               <p>Every man muſt judg by the beſt underſtanding he hath, and ſo did I, when I judg'd your Miniſter to Preach Erroneous Doctrine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>And that you ſay was one reaſon of your withdrawing from him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But did you ever go to him to diſcourſe the matter

with him? Perhaps you miſtook his meaning; or it may be he might have made it appear that he was in the right, and you in the wrong.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>I did not trouble my ſelf to do that.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And yet you withdrew from his Miniſtry upon it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>I did.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then let me tell you, you did a very raſh, uncharitable, unchriſtian action. We are not, you know, to ſeparate from the converſation of any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon till we have told him his fault between us and him, though the fault be plain and apparent: much leſs may we divide from the Church and our Miniſters, till we have made

the matter of offence known; much leſs may we do it when the fault is not evident, and certain. It is no ſmall matter to change the Guide that Gods providence, and our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours have ſet over us, and to take others contrary to the Laws under which we live; 'tis a thing that before a man doth it he ſhould conſider well, for here is at leaſt the <hi>appearance</hi> of danger. 'Tis <hi>ſomething</hi> to break Laws and diſturb Governors, and trouble Miniſters, and offend private Chriſtians; 'tis <hi>ſomething,</hi> I ſay, which a tender Conſcience would not do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great conſideration, and without being fully reſolv'd in the neceſſity of it: and how
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53420:47"/>
then durſt you do it, upon a miſlike of your Miniſters Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when you never did your ſelf or him that right, as to ſpeak with him about it? and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what ſatisfaction he could give you in it. This let me tell you plainly, is an error greater than any you can pretend in his Doctrines, it is a ſin that hath a complication of many others, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Stomach, Self-will, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of your betters, and cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to your Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53420:48"/>
will render your ſin and folly inexcuſable.</p>

               <p>Nay, pray ſtay a little, I am not ſo much angry as griev'd at your ways: and have a queſtion more to ask you on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of what you have told me; and that is, Whether you are to leave every Miniſter and Church, as ſoon as any thing is ſaid that is really erroneous, in the leſſer and uneſſential mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>

               <p>And upon theſe terms we

ſhall never ſettle any where at all. For no Church pretends it ſelf to be infallible, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> and there are no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men or body of men, but have their actual errors and miſtakes. So that according to this way of proceeding you muſt have departed from the Preaching and Communion of the holieſt Men, and beſt Churches of the moſt ancient, yea and of all times.

               <p>I have thus ſpoken to you freely in this matter, I hope you will conſider it. But I have a little more to ſay of your <hi>not profiting</hi> under our Miniſter: I am yet ſpeaking to the <hi>firſt</hi>

               <p>I have taken notice, that though the Miniſter hath been ſpeaking of the greateſt matters, in the moſt pathetical and moving way, yet you have looked coldly, inſenſibly, and unconcernedly upon it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I remember when the men you now follow, preacht in publick, you uſed to liſten with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53420:49"/>
a very viſible and affectionate attention to all, even the poor, mean, impertinent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſenſeleſs things, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd; and to be very diligent in penning thoſe Sermons; when as theſe you manifeſtly ſlight by your carriage, even when they are full of the weightieſt, and moſt uſeful truths? And is not this to have the Faith of Chriſt with <hi>reſpect of perſons?</hi> And to come under St. <hi>Judes</hi> Character of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts of his time, who had mens <hi>perſons in admiration?</hi> This is not to honour Miniſters for their works ſake, but to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and ſlight their work for theirs; whereas a Chriſtian ſhould joyfully hear Chriſts

Truths and Laws, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately imbrace them for their own ſake, and his.</p>

               <p>He ſpeaks bitterly againſt our Miniſters, when he is in company where he can talk at liberty. His common accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them is that they Preach for <hi>hire.</hi>

               <p>It is fit that he that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Goſpel ſhould live by it. And the Juſtice and Piety of our Anceſtors have made ſome proviſion for them in moſt places, ſetled by our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53420:52"/>
moſt Fundamental Laws; and what they have out of any mans Eſtate on that account, is as much <hi>theirs,</hi> as the remaining part is <hi>his.</hi> Here is the miſtake of men that talk thus, They reckon that all they poſſeſs is their own, in which account they are much out: all is their own when their debts are paid; when they have paid to God the <hi>things that are Gods,</hi> and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the <hi>things that are Caeſars;</hi> what the Laws have ordained to be paid out of their Eſtates to others, is <hi>their</hi> property, and no man can be called an hireling for taking what is his own: Nor can Miniſters be any more juſtly called ſo for receiving the maintenance the ancient Laws

               <p>Miniſters have much to do with ſuch people: and many that in words pretend they love the Church are as trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as thoſe. Such as neglect the publick worſhip, and never come to it, but when they have nothing elſe to do; now and then you ſhall ſee them drop into the Church by chance, but in their very coming in they ſhew how little concerned they are, and their whole carriage after declares their careleſsneſs, and indifferency to thoſe things. So that if the Miniſter particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly court and careſs them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53420:53"/>
without taking notice of their indevotion, and other ſins, he may chance to have their good word a little while: but if he do not ſo, they be ready on all occaſions, and without any, to carp at him; if he omits any of the leaſt circumſtances of his duty (or they phancy ſo) he ſhall be ſure to hear of their railing, and backbiting of him; when as the moſt conſtant, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and worthy diligence in the work of his Miniſtry, and the moſt laudable performance of all offices publick and private, ſhall not gain him any jot of intereſt or favour with them, nor as much as their good word. The ground of which is becauſe the things he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

to them are not at all valued, and have no hold upon their affections.</p>

               <p>Perhaps they may like to hear him Preach a little, while he is new among them: but when he hath reſided any time, he grows ſtale, and cannot affect them with his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe hath never ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him in that faculty.</p>

               <p>And 'tis another diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to learned and able Miniſters that after all their teaching, people have ſo little ſenſe and underſtanding of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters, as to be moſt of all taken with the weakeſt, and moſt trifling of thoſe men, that now and then happen to ſupply
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53420:54"/>
their room. I have heard ſome of them ſay that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly glad when their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors happen to be pleaſed with any true and ſubſtantial Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but to hear of their admiring and applauding thoſe that they, and other judicious men, were aſham'd to hear; this ſhews their little proficiency, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be matter of trouble to their Miniſters.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53420:55"/>
them; to find that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally feel not any thing of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, practical, awakening truth, but will ſit ſtupid, and dead under ſuch; when they are pleaſed, and tranſported with weak, affected, ſuperficial ſtuff, that hath no ſence, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or life in it.

               <p>Pray before we part let me have a word or two more with you. You have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting and commending <hi>Plain Preaching,</hi> and you ſeem to make <hi>Plainneſs</hi> the general Character of all good Sermons, But will not this diſoblige the Miniſters from taking pains about them?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53420:55"/>
would it not expoſe their Preaching to the diſreſpect, if not contempt of the People? Will they not think they can Preach themſelves, if it be ſo plain a buſineſs? And will not the Miniſterial office be hereby render'd liable to be uſurp'd by every one that judgeth he has abilities for plain inſtruction?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive you have not taken ſufficient notice of what has been ſaid in deſcribing plain Preaching; I do not mean by it, what is ſlight and vulgar, what is unthought, unconſider'd; but what is unſtrain'd, unaffected; what is manly, and ſolid; and ſo to ſpeak requires learning and ſtudy, and improved facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This ſhould be the end of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53420:56"/>
a wiſe mans pains to conceive things clearly, and to expreſs them plainly. It asks much leſs of parts and abilities to talk myſtically in phraſes, and hard words, and terms of art (which many admire, becauſe they do not underſtand) than it doth to ſpeak properly, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly; which, though it may ſeem very eaſie to be done, yet indeed it requires moſt labour, and 'tis maſtery to have gain'd this ability. A man doth not ſhew his wit or learning, by rolling in metaphors, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his ſentences of Greek and Latin, by abounding in high expreſſions, and talking in the clouds, but he is then learned, when his learning has
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53420:56"/>
clear'd his underſtanding, and furniſht it with full and diſtinct apprehenſions of things; when it enables him to make <hi>hard</hi> things <hi>plain;</hi> and conceptions, that were <hi>confuſed, diſtinct,</hi> and <hi>orderly;</hi> and he ſhews his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſpeaking good, ſtrong, and plain ſence. So that you ſee there is no fear of making Learning unneceſſary to good Preaching; there is no fear of excuſing Miniſters from taking pains; there is no fear of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the office by the plainneſs I have commended: and for your objection that this will lay it open to intruſions, beſides the anſwer contain'd in what I have ſaid already, I ſay further, that the Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> function is, bleſſed be God, ſecured from

ſuch invaſions by the diſcipline, order, and government of the Church according to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Apoſtolical pattern, and rules, and not by the Clergies having the only abilities to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct; I doubt not but there are many pious and knowing Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe parts and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg would enable them for publick teaching: but they have no Authority ſo to do; and therefore 'twould be a great ſin, and folly for them to attempt it. Every man may not do every thing that he can; there is a <hi>politick</hi> as well as <hi>natural</hi> capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Laws of Government are to be conſider'd, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and according to them, the abilities of men ought to be imployed, or reſtrain'd.</p>
