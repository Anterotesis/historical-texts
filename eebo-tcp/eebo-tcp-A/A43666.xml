            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Letter, wherein you charge me with unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for having neglected to Write unto you for the laſt ſix
moneths; and you alſo tell me, you cannot imagine what
hath made me ſo ſilent all this while, that others have ſent their
Correſpondents in <hi>England</hi> ſo many Letters of <hi>Scottiſh</hi> News.
But what you ſeem to make an aggravation of my fault, I muſt
Retort upon you in my own Defence, and tell you plainly, that
being a Perſon uncapable to Write certainties in State-matters, and
too honeſt to Write lyes, I could not prevail with my ſelf to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ill example of many of my Countrey-men, whereof
ſome maliciouſly Wrote their own Forgeries, and ſome out of
weakneſs their Jealouſies, and Fears, and all pretending to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not only what were, but what would be the Intrigues of
<hi>Halyrud-Houſe,</hi> fill'd their <hi>Muddiman-letters</hi> with their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
inſtead of real Truth.</p>
            <p>The Reports which theſe Inſtruments of Miſchief ſent to
<hi>London,</hi> rebounded as quickly hither again; and conſidering how
fooliſhly ſome, and how maliciouſly others of their Stories were
contriv'd, I cannot but ſigh for the unhappineſs of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
where theſe Coiners and Diſperſers of falſe News, like the
falſe Prophets in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are a National judgment,
and a grievous Plague both to Church and State.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let me prevail with you for the time to come, to give as
little credit to the flying Reports, which are ſent from our Country,
as I do to thoſe which are ſent from yours; and that we may both
grow wiſer by other mens Follies, and take ſurer meaſures in our
future Correſpondence, give me leave to propoſe, that we Write
nothing hereafter; but matters of Fact, and conſine our ſelves to
relate ſuch uſeful, and worthy Contingencies, as might become
an Hiſtorian of his own Age. By obſerving this rule, we ſhall
keep our ſelves within the ſafe bounds of Prudence, and Duty,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49582:3"/>
and profit one another by our mutual Correſpendence, without
abuſing the credulity of the Vulgar, or injuring the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
publick Affairs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that I may put my own advice into practiſe, and be
a good example to my own rule, the Subject of this Letter ſhall
be a faithful Narrative of the Tryal, Condemnation, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of one of our <hi>Presbyterian Preachers,</hi> who made an attempt
on the Sacred Perſon of the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in the
moneth of <hi>July,</hi> 1668. The Story is very comprehenſive, and
will invite me to ſpeak of many particular things, and perſons,
and it will be difficult for me to paſs through it all without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little upon publick Affairs, in doing of which, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to perform the part of a faithful Hiſtorian, in keeping to
my rule of Writing nothing but matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>I have already fix'd the beginning of this Story in the moneth
of <hi>July,</hi> 1668. But the execrable wretch reſolved to do the Fact
two years before he did it, and languiſh'd all the time for want of
an opportunity to execute his inhumane deſign. At laſt, having
obſerv'd, that the Lord Primate us'd always to go about this Town
in his Coach, he reſolv'd to Piſtol him in it; and accordingly on
Saturday of the foreſaid moneth diſcharged a Piſtol, loaden with
three Bullets at him, which were intercepted by the arm of the
Lord Biſhop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> who at the ſame inſtant was getting into
his <hi>Graces</hi> Coach: As ſoon as he had ſhot, he walked faſt away,
and as he croſſed the Street, the Primate got a view of his face.
He was not immediately purſued; which gave him opportunity to
eſcape into the Houſe of one <hi>Ferguſon</hi> an ejected Miniſter, which
being in an obſcure place of the Town, he had prepar'd for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
in caſe he could get ſafe thither.</p>
            <p>There having diſguiſed himſelf by putting on a Periwig, and
changing his Clothes, he immediately went into the Street again,
and made as great a buſſel as any in the throng to find out the
<hi>Aſſaſſin,</hi> who had ſhot at the Primate, and, as he hop'd, had kill'd
him in his Coach. He was known by none in the crowd, but by
three of his Confederates, who had come to Town on purpoſe to
aſſiſt him in his bloody deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49582:3"/>
Their Deſignations, or Titles were <hi>Barſcob, Mandroget,</hi> and
Major <hi>Lermouth,</hi> who had been Ring-leaders in the Rebellion at
<hi>Pentland-Hills</hi> in the year 1668. The <hi>Aſſaſſin</hi> joyn'd himſelf
with theſe three; and after a Conſultation what they ſhould do for
their further ſecurity, they unanimouſly reſolv'd to retire into the
Garden of Sir <hi>Archibald Primroſe,</hi> the now <hi>Juſtice General,</hi> or to
ſpeak in your Phraſe, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice;</hi> who had for many
years the misfortune to be eſteem'd a favourer, and encourager of
the Fanatical Faction, though it be hard to imagine how a man
that hath gotten ſo great an Eſtate by the Kings Royal Bounty,
ſhould have ſo much favour for the worſt of His Subjects, unleſs
he hath loſt all ſenſe of Gratitude and Honour.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that there are ſuch Monſters of Diſloyalty, and
Ingratitude in the World; and as certain it is, (though he be
not one of them) that the credit he hath with that party encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
this Murnival of Rebels, and Murderers to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the following night within his Precincts, rather than any
other Man's in this populous Town. But the Morning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
they thought it ſafer to quit the Town, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three conducting Mr. <hi>James Mitchel</hi> (for that's the name of
this abominable Man) he made a final eſcape by their aſſiſtance,
and was never after ſeen in this Country, till the latter end of
1673. In this Interval betwixt <hi>July,</hi> 68. and the latter end of
73. he had rambled through <hi>Holland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
from whence he return'd to his Country, reſolv'd (as it ſeems)
to aſſaſſin the Primate again. Not long after his return he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and repair'd with his Wife to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> preſuming, that
after more than five years abſence, he might live <hi>incognito</hi> here,
at leaſt ſo long, till he could find another opportunity to execute
his bloody deſign. In order to which, he hir'd a Shop within a
door or two of the Primate's Lodgings, where his Wife pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſell Tobacco, and Brandy, and ſuch like things.</p>
            <p>But he had not long frequented there, before he was diſcover'd,
and apprehended upon ſuſpicion; and when he was taken (which
was on the ſame day of the Week, and in the ſame place where
he had formerly ſtood to commit the fact) there were two Piſtols
found about him, in ſize, and ſhape like that which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49582:4"/>
ſaw him hold in his hand, immediately after he had ſhot at
his <hi>Grace;</hi> and upon ſearch, they were alſo found to be charg'd
with three bullets each. Being apprehended by Sir <hi>William
Sharp,</hi> he was immediately brought to his Brother the Primate's
Lodgings; and though a great croud had preſſed in after him,
yet his <hi>Grace</hi> knew him at firſt ſight from all the reſt, (ſuch a
deep impreſſion the tranſient view he got of him, after the ſhot,
had made upon him) and going ſtreight up to him without any
heſitation, he ſaid unto him, <hi>You, Sir, are the Man;</hi> upon
which the Wretch trembled, and grew pale.</p>
            <p>Not long after, he was conven'd before the Privy Council, and
the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> his Majeſty's High Commiſſioner then
ſitting in Council; but he would confeſs nothing before them;
which made the Right Honourable <hi>Bord</hi> depute a Committee for
his farther examination; before which he freely confeſſed the fact,
and afterwards acknowledg'd and ſign'd his Confeſſion before
the King's High Commiſſioner ſitting in Council, with the Lord
<hi>Halton</hi> the Treaſurer Deputy, the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
and ſome others of the Council ſubſcrib'd as Witneſſes;
and this Paper was brought at his Tryal againſt him as a <hi>judicial</hi>
confeſſion of his crime.</p>
            <p>After this examination of him before His Majeſty's High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
ſitting in Council (which happen'd in <hi>February,</hi> 1674.)
he was put upon his Tryal in the Criminal Court. But after his
<hi>Libel,</hi> which your Law calls the <hi>Indictment,</hi> was read, he deny'd
it, and retracted the confeſſion; which he had freely made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any promiſe of pardon before the High Commiſſioner, and
the Council; upon which Sir <hi>John Nisbet His Majeſty's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
(who, notwithſtanding his fair pretentions to the Church,
either loves or fears the Fanatical Faction too much) ſeem'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much ſurpriz'd, and deſiſted immediately from his proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
deſiring the Judges to Adjourn the Court, and from that
time would never purſue the murderous Villain again, although
he was oblig'd by his Office to do it, as well as by the Arch-Biſhop;
who <hi>in Cauſa Sanguinis</hi> would not purſue him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Judges alſo at that time had no great Stomach to ſit
upon the Tryal of this bloody Saint: So that the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49582:4"/>
were forc'd to ſend him Priſoner to the <hi>Baſſe</hi> (a Rock in the
<hi>Forth,</hi> where I wiſh all his Brethren were) where he continued
till the latter end of laſt <hi>December,</hi> when the Privy Council
ſent for him to be try'd again.</p>
            <p>About this time it was rumour'd about Town, and Country,
that the <hi>Whigs</hi> (for ſo we call Fanaticks) deſign'd to take off
both the Archbiſhops, and ſome other Biſhops by aſſaſſination;
and likewiſe vehement ſuſpicions, and preſumptions were found,
that they had the like deſign on other eminent Perſons, who
were moſt concern'd, and reſolv'd to ſee them reduc'd to order
and obedience. And therefore the Council thought it expedient,
to prevent ſuch barbarous attempts, and ſecure the Lives of His
Majeſty's faithful <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to bring Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> to publick
Juſtice, that the <hi>Remonſtrator-Presbyterians</hi> of our Country
might ſee, what their <hi>Clements</hi> and <hi>Ravillacs</hi> were to
expect.</p>
            <p>Since the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> came laſt hither, Sir <hi>John
Nisbett</hi> reſign'd his Charge, and his Majeſty put Sir <hi>George
Machenzy,</hi> a Learned, and Worthy Gentleman into his place;
who in obedience to the order of the Privy Council, purſu'd this
common enemy of Mankind, with a Courage, and Zeal, that
became ſuch a gallant Man, and a good Chriſtian; although he
foreſaw, he muſt for ever diſoblige that implacapable party,
which hath ſworn to extirpate Epiſcopacy here.</p>
            <p>You may eaſily judge with what deliberation, and caution this
miſcreants Proceſs was made: Seeing his Tryal was dependant
four days; for he was arraigned on Monday the ſeventh of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
in the Morning, and receiv'd not Sentence till the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Thurſday at two in the Afternoon. As the Privy Council
were very juſt, ſo were they exceeding merciful to this inhumane
Man: for at the inſtance of his Majeſty's Advocate, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Sir <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> one of the beſt Lawyers of this
Nation, to be of his Counſel, and had he been the greateſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the three Kingdoms, his cauſe could not have been
more ſtrenuouſly defended, nor his Proceſs made with more
care.</p>

The firſt day was ſpent in reading the Libel, and diſcuſſing
ſome preparatory doubts, neceſſary to be determin'd by an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocutory</hi>
ſentence, before the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> which you call the Jury,
could be impannell'd, and the Witneſſes ſworn. The doubts
were three. Firſt, whether that confeſſion, which the <hi>Pannel</hi>
(for ſo we call the Priſoner at the Bar,) made before the King's
High Commiſſioner, and the Privy Council ſitting in Council
were <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Extrajudicial?</hi> The ſecond was, whether if this
Confeſſion ſhould be made appear to upon hopes, or promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
it ſhould not ſerve for the <hi>Pannels</hi> exculpation? And the third
was, whether by a certain Act of Parliament made for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Majeſty's Privy Counſellers, and Officers, the attempted
aſſaſſinage of the Primate, who was, and is, a Privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
were Capital, or no? All which preliminaries the Judges
deliberated upon, and debated among themſelves on Tueſday,
and on Wedneſday following pronounced their <hi>Interlocutory</hi> in
the affirmative upon the ſeveral heads.</p>
            <p>You may perceive by the terms wherein I am forc'd to couch the

            <p>But to return to my Narrative, after the <hi>Interlocutory</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
the Jury was impannell'd, and the Witneſſes ſworn,
ſome of whoſe depoſitions I ſhall ſet down as I heard them, and
I think, I ſhall never forget them, as long as I can remember
my Name.</p>
            <p>The Keeper of the <hi>Tolbooth</hi>'s Son, (for ſo we call the Priſon
here) depon'd, that having ask'd the <hi>Pannel,</hi> how he could do
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49582:5"/>
ſuch a Barbarous Action in cold blood againſt a man, that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done him wrong? he anſwer'd, That it was not done in cold
blood; for the blood of the Saints was reeking yet at the Croſs in
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi> By the <hi>Saints</hi> he meant the Rebells at <hi>Pentland-hills</hi>
in 1666, one of which he himſelf had been, and ſome Principals
whereof, that were taken in the Field, had been Executed about
two years before at the Croſs in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Biſhop of <hi>Galloway</hi> (whom no good Church-man
here ought to mention without honour, and reſpect) having firſt
aſſerted the priviledge that is granted to Biſhops to have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
taken at home according to the Civil, and Canon-law,
and proteſted that his Obedience to the Court ſhould be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to that priviledge, depon'd, that having ask'd the Priſoner
what mov'd him to make ſuch a bloody attempt on an innocent
man? he anſwer'd, That he did it, becauſe he apprehended him to
be an Enemy to the People of God.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Halton</hi> depoſed, that having ask'd him how he durſt
be ſo wicked, as to do ſuch an execrable Fact? he anſwer'd, That
he did it becauſe the Archbiſhop was an Enemy to the Godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore the Lord Chancellor, and the Lord <hi>Halton,</hi> teſtifi'd
upon Oath (for with us the greateſt Peers muſt be ſworn) that
he own'd the Confeſſion produc'd in the Court before the Privy
Council, and acknowledg'd their names, which were ſubſcrib'd
under it, and the Pannel could not deny his.</p>
            <p>Theſe Depoſitions being taken, there was no way left to ſave the
Pannels neck, but by making it appear that he had made this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
upon promiſe, or hopes of Pardon, and therefore his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
deſir'd, that the Lord Chancellor might be call'd to declare
upon Oath, if he did not encourage him to confeſs upon Promiſe,
or Oath to endeavour to ſecure him, life, and limb, as he alledged
his Lordſhip did. But he declar'd upon the great Oath he had
taken, that he never made any ſuch Promiſe, or Oath unto him;
and the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Halton</hi> being alſo
call'd to Depone upon that particular teſtifi'd, that they never
knew that the Lord Chancellor or any other had encourag'd him to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49582:6"/>
make that Confeſſion upon hopes, or promiſe of Pardon, which if
it could have been legally prov'd, he muſt have been abſolv'd.</p>
            <p>The impudent Villain likewiſe deſir'd the <hi>Lords Juſtitiary</hi>
(whom before I call'd the Judges in your ſtyle) that the Primate
himſelf might be cited into the Court to declare upon Oath, if he
did not encourage him to confeſs upon a promiſe to endeavour to
procure his Pardon; to which being ſworn he anſwer'd, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after his apprehenſion he took him aſide to diſcourſe
with him in private, where he did aſſure him he forgave him, and
would endeavour to ſave him from publick Juſtice, if he would
confeſs the Fact; but that upon this encouragement, he would
make no Confeſſion, nor ever after offer'd any to him; ſo that
though he ſtill forgave him, yet he did not conceive himſelf bound
to endeavour his preſervation after more than five years obſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Crime.</p>
            <p>There were many other Witneſſes ready to depone, of which
there was no need. One of them could have teſtifi'd, that he
heard him ſay, that he would do the Fact, if it were to be done
again; and another could have depon'd, that he heard him ſay:
let me but ſhoot at him again, and i'le be content to be hang'd, if
I miſs. The Jury, which conſiſted of Fifteen Gentlemen, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
found him guilty; and when ſentence was pronounc'd, that
he ſhould be carried to the common place of Execution, and there
be hang'd, he told the <hi>Juſtitiary Lords,</hi> that he took it as from God,
but not from them.</p>
            <p>Since he was condemn'd, he deſir'd that ſome Conventicle-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that are impriſon'd with him, might be admitted to give
him Comfort, and obſtinately refuſed the aſſiſtance of the Miniſters
of our Church. However one of them went to him to remind
him of the Murder he was guilty of in the eyes of God, though
he ſuffer'd him not to effectuate his deſign. But inſtead of
making any impreſſion upon his hardned heart, or receiving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
acknowledgments for his good will, he received nothing
from him but reproaches, being told by him that he was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of Souls, and had the blood of Souls to anſwer for, with many
more rude and Enthuſiaſtick expreſſions, which would be too long
to relate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49582:6"/>
He was a lean hollow-cheek'd man, of a truculent Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and had the air of an Aſſaſſin as much as a man could have.
He came with his Periwig powder'd to the Bar, and behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
there, with as much aſſurance, as men devoted to do miſchief
by their Principles and Complexion reſolve beforehand always
to do.</p>
            <p>As for his original, 'tis ſo obſcure, that the mean Proletarian
condition of his Parents affords no notice of his birth. And
as for his Education after he had paſſed through the ſubſidiary
part of Learning, he was ſent to the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in
the time of the late Uſurpation; where he made very ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in any part of good Literature, but apply'd himſelf to the
reading of ſuch ſilly Fanatical Books, as were fit for his narrow
capacity, and Enthuſiaſtical temper; So, that the acquir'd, or
artificial part of Fanaticiſm (which <hi>Whigs</hi> call Grace) being
added to his Nature, he might qualifie himſelf for Employment,
and Reputation, eſpecially, among the Remonſtrator-Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who were then the the principal part of the <hi>Kirk.</hi> This Faction,
eſpecially in the Weſt, was advanc'd ſo far towards Enthuſiaſm, that
they deſpiſed and ſuſpected men of Learning, and Sence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to look upon it as a ſtinting of the Spirit to ſpend any ſtudy
or time in preparing themſelves to Preach. The people eſpecially
were ſo poſſeſſed with this opinion, that if they came to know,
that their Miniſters preconceiv'd, much more penn'd their Sermons
in their Studys, they thought it a ſufficient ground of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from them, as believing it utterly impoſſible to receive any
ſpiritual benefit from ſuch carnal Sermons, as were compos'd by
the help of Study, and Books.</p>
            <p>Among theſe people it was, that <hi>Mitchel</hi> deſign'd to Teach, and
Preach, and therefore after he was graduated Maſter, (which is
here at the end of four years) he apply'd himſelf to the Study of
Popular Divinity under Mr. <hi>David Dickſon,</hi> a great Apoſtle of the
Solemn League and Covenant, under whom he continued his
method of Reading modern Fanatical Pamphlets, that he
might be an able Workman, and compleatly furniſhed with all
thoſe <hi>Canting</hi> affected Phraſes, which diſcriminate a Spiritual from
a Carnal Preacher among our Presbyterians, and are Muſick, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49582:7"/>
Charms to their. Enthuſiaſtical Ears. And that he might add the
Practical to the Speculative part of Fanaticiſm, and be perfectly
Maſter of his Trade, he frequented thoſe private Meetings, where
Conferences, Prayers, and Sermons were ſpoken in that Dialect,
and where Tone, Grimace, and Geſticulations are far more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than all the true Learning and Eloquence in the World.</p>
            <p>Having acted ſometime in theſe Nurſeries of Enthuſiaſm, he
thought himſelf fit for any Eccleſiaſtical Employment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
offer'd himſelf to be try'd by the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi>
who rejected him for inſufficiency, as ſome yet alive can teſtifie to
the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this repulſe he began to project ſome other way of living
and was ſhortly after recommended to the Laird of <hi>Dundas,</hi> to
be Pedagogue to his Children, and Domeſtick Chaplain for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extemporary Prayers. He paſſed ſometime in this Family
for a guifted, and very Holy young man, till ſome of the Servants
obſerved an extraordinary familiarity betwixt him, and a young
Woman, who was the old Gardeners Wife. Being poſſeſſed
with this ſuſpicion, they obſerved him the more, and one night as
they were watching, they ſaw his <hi>Miſtris</hi> go to his Chamber,
which was a Summer-houſe built on the Garden wall. The Key
as it happened was left on the out-ſide of the door, which one of
thoſe that watched obſerving, gently locked the door upon them,
and immediatly ran to call his Maſter, who came to the Garden to
ſee what would be the event. After they had been as long as they
pleas'd together, at laſt <hi>Hortenſia</hi> comes to go out; who to her
great confuſion finding the door locked, ſteps back to the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
who, fearing that ſhe ſhould be taken with him, immediatly let
her down the Garden wall, by the help of his Shirt, ſhe hanging
at one end, and he holding the other as naked as when he was
born. His Patron all this while beheld him like a filthy <hi>Priapus</hi>
upon the Garden wall, and the next day in great indignation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
him of his ſervice and houſe: I ſuppoſe this is one of his
particular and private ſins, which you'l find him hereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
in his Speech, deſerved a worſe death than he endured.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he lived ſome years in
a Widows houſe, called Mrs. <hi>Griſſald Whitford,</hi> who dwelt in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49582:7"/>
               <hi>Cow-gate,</hi> and with whom that diſhonour of Mankind Major
<hi>Weir</hi> was boarded at the ſame time. By his Converſation, it may
be preſumed, that <hi>Mitchel</hi> improved much in the art of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and drunk in more deeply thoſe Murderous and Treaſonable
Principles, which he afterwards practiſed in the whole courſe of
his life, and juſtified at his death. Now began he to Converſe
with the moſt Bigot Zealots againſt Auhority, to frequent and
hold Conventicles to Preach up the Covenant, and to the utmoſt
of his power to promote the Schiſm, which was begun in the
Church. By theſe practiſes he much endear'd himſelf to his Tutor
Major <hi>Weir,</hi> who recommended him for a Chaplain to a Fanatical
Family, the Lady whereof was Neice to Sir <hi>Arch. Johnſton</hi> Laird
of <hi>Wareſton,</hi> one of the moſt furious Rebels againſt the late bleſſed
King, and greateſt complyers with the late Uſurpation in the
Three Kingdoms, and whom you may remember to have been
<hi>Preſident of the Committee of Safety;</hi> for all which accumulated
Treaſons he was executed here in 1663.</p>
            <p>During his abode in this Family, broke out the Rebellion of the
Fanaticks in 1666. He no ſooner heard of it, but joyned with
the Robels, who were defeated at <hi>Pentland-hills;</hi> Though Mr.
<hi>Welſh</hi> (as it is reported) during the Fight, prayed with up-lifted
hands to the Lord of Hoſts againſt <hi>Amalek</hi> (as his Spirit moved
him to miſcall the Royal Forces) and had his hands ſtayed up by
ſome of his Brethren, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had his by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> Mr.
<hi>Mitchel</hi> had the Fortune to eſcape from the Field, but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
proclaimed Traytor, with many other principal Actors in
the Rebellion, and afterwards excepted by name in His Majeſties
Gracious Proclamation of Pardon, that he might receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereby. From this time he skulked about, and ſheltered
himſelf among the Rebellious Saints of the Brotherhood, till the
Devil tempted him to Aſſaſſin the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> for which he hath
expiated by his blood.</p>
            <p>Among others of his excellent qualifications, I have told you
what an utter <hi>Ignoramus</hi> he was; I cannot forbear to tell you
further, that <hi>Welſh,</hi> and <hi>Arnot,</hi> and all the reſt of them are full as
illiterate as he, and that their inſuperable ignorance in Divine and
Humane Learning is the Mother of their Murdering Zeal. Indeed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49582:8"/>
all the late Troubles upon the account of Epiſcopacy are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be aſcribed to the ſhameful ignorance of Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, who looking no further back
into the Hiſtory of Religion, than the time of the Reformation,
and ſome of them not ſo far, did either hate Epiſcopacy as an
Uſurpation, or elſe looked upon it as a meer human Conſtitution,
and ſo could not have that particular Veneration for it, that was
due to an Apoſtolical Ordinance ſo viſibly founded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and which was the ſole invariable Government of Gods
Univerſal Church for above 1500 years.</p>
            <p>Of this, that excellent man Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> was a deplorable
example, who though he was a man of great Temper, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and very Learned in his way, yet want of Antiquity,
of which he was ſo ignorant, was the unhappy cauſe, why he
engaged for the Covenant againſt the King, and the Church.
Had he ſpent but half ſo many hours in that, as he did in the
ſtudy of other things, he had never moved ſo excentrically to the
Church, nor done thoſe things, for which he expiated with tears
before His late bleſſed Majeſty at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> afterwards ſpending
the ſhort remainder of his life in a ſorrowful Penitential Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for which he grew ſuſpected by his Brethren of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
who called him Apoſtat from the Cauſe. There are many
perſons yet alive, who can teſtifie this to be true; which may teach
all Divines, how dangerous it is for them to live in ignorance of
Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, which is ſo eaſily acquired, and ſo uſeful
to be known. That comprehenſive Genius Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> wanted
nothing but this to make him as Orthodox, and Conſummate a
Divine as ever was in the Church of God: for had he been but
half as well verſed in the more Primitive Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Writers, as he was in St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> he had
never coin'd the notion of a Lay-elder, defended
the <hi>Horrible Decree,</hi> or been expoſed for ſo many abſurdities by
meek<note n="b" place="margin">In defenſ lib. de offic. Pij viri.</note> 
               <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Pen.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Digreſſion with Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> there were
very few among our Covenanting-miniſters comparable to him
for Prudence and Learning, and yet even the lowermoſt Form of
our former Presbyterians were Great men in compariſon to theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49582:8"/>
of the <hi>Remonſtrator Faction,</hi> who are all burning Zeal, but no
knowledge, as you will perceive, not only by the ſequel of this
Story, but this Letter of an ignorant Miniſter, that lately Revolted
from our Church.</p>

That on the firſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> you are to have a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
(you ought to have termed it a meeting of the Exerciſe)
and on the ſecond <hi>Wedneſday</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a Provincial meeting
with your Biſhop of <hi>Rotheſay;</hi> and once for all I deſire you may
take this for an abſolute Anſwer. Firſt, That God hath of a long
time been dealing with my Conſcience, but eſpecially ſince <hi>October</hi>
laſt, when I was called to <hi>Mul</hi> for Electing Mr. <hi>Andrew Wood</hi>
Biſhop (I confeſs his want of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> language did ſtick with me,
beſides many other things as well now as before, about the Election of
Mr. <hi>James Ramſey,</hi> and all of you, ſave one, did then profeſs, that
they did ſtick with you alſo, though now you have ſwallowed down
that Pill with many more) and that in ſuch an Extraordinary
dreadful, and terrible manner, for my engaging to Prelacy, and a
Lordly Government over the Church of Chriſt (contrary to which
there lie ſo many ties, and obligations on this Land) that with the
Grace of God I would not adventure to abide the terror of the
Lord for all the ſtipends, and preferments in Europe. And truly the
worſt I wiſh to you, or any Prelate in Britain, or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or their
adherents is, that they may have as ſound a yokeing with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
as I have had, if they be not incorrigible Enemies of Chriſt.
Next, upon ſerious ſearch of the word of God, and of <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
I am the more confirm'd in my Reſolution. <hi>Blondellus, Salmatius,

adherence to the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government of

Godly in theſe three Lands, till this very day is; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to the point, that Government of Chriſts Church by an equality,
and parity of Paſtors, and Miniſters, all of them with one ſhoulder
carrying on the work of the Lord, and exerciſing the Keyes of Order,
and Juriſdiction, Doctrine and Diſcipline in <hi>Communi,</hi> according

Witneſsing, and Suffering Servants and people, that have heen, or

Unleſs you are vers'd in our Hiſtorian <hi>Buchanan,</hi> you will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
why this Learned Antiquarian ſhould aſſert, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of our Church was <hi>Presbyterian</hi> from the firſt Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>Palladius</hi> in the middle of the Fifth Century. You muſt know
therefore that all the Authority our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have for this
aſſertion is from <hi>Buchanan,</hi> that furious Enemy of Biſhops, who
in the Fifth Book of his Hiſtory, writes that the Church in the
aforeſaid time was not governed by Biſhops, but by the Monks
or <hi>Culdees;</hi> which were it true, as it is falſe, would prove that
the Government of the Church in that interval was not <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi>

acquaint you with other memorable things, that happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Condemnation, and Execution, which was on Friday,
the 18. of <hi>January</hi> laſt, in the Graſs-market, about Three of the
Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>Some time before the execution, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Annand</hi>
Dean of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> not diſcourag'd with the unthankful returns
one of his Brethren had receiv'd from the Malefactor before, out
of his tender compaſſion to his Soul, wrote him a very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and pious Letter, wherein he endeavour'd to ſhew him
from the Goſpel, how contrary his Principles and Practices were
to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and exhorted him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for that Un-chriſtian attempt, by which he deſign'd to take
away the Life of one Sacred Perſon, and grievouſly wounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all which he return'd this Anſwer.</p>

            <p>The Dean in his Letter urged an excellent argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him, that the impulſe, which was upon him ſo many years
to aſſaſſin the Primate, could not come from God, like the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of <hi>Phineas,</hi> and the <hi>Zealots,</hi> becauſe he fail'd in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
which never any perſon did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or could do, that was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by God to do an <hi>Heroick</hi> Act. But, you ſee, the blind
<hi>Pſeudo-Zealot</hi> takes no notice of this Argument in his Anſwer;
wherein to ſhew what an implacable enemy he was to the Office,
as well as the Perſon of the Archbiſhop, he mentions his Grace
not by his Character, but by his Name.</p>
            <p>Having been told in the Priſon, that he would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſpeak to the People before his Execution, he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
ſeveral Copies of his intended Speech; whereof one
was found in his Pocket, and taken from him before he
was carried out to Execution. It is long, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part containing nothing but Libellous reflections on
the Privy Council, the Juſticiary Lords, and the King's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49582:10"/>
Advocate, I ſhall content my ſelf to ſend you a tranſcript of the
latter.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I</hi> Acknowledge my particular and private ſins have been ſuch as
have merited a worſe Death unto me; but I dye in the hope of
the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, to be freed from thoſe Eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
due to me for ſin. Yet I am confident, that God doth not
plead with me in this place, for my private and particular ſins,
but that I am brought here that the Work of God might be made
manifeſt, and for the Tryal of Faith, <hi>John 9. 3. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 7.
and that I may be a witneſs for his deſpiſed Truth, and intereſt in
this Land, who am called to ſeal the ſame with my Blood. And
I wiſh heartily that this my poor Life may put an end to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of the true Members of Christ in this Kingdom, ſo much
actuate by theſe perfidious Prelates; and in oppoſition to whom, and
in teſtimony of the Cauſe of Chriſt, I at this time willingly lay
down my Life, and bleſs my God that he hath thought me ſo much
worthy to do the ſame for his Glory, and Intereſt. Finally, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Chriſtian Duty in a ſingular extraordinary caſe, and my
particular Judgement concerning both Church and State, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declar'd, and manifeſted more fully elſewhere. So farewel
all Earthly enjoyments, and welcome Father, Son, and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
into whoſe hands I commend my ſpirit.</q>
            <p>As to that particular Chriſtian duty in an extraordinary caſe,
and his Judgement concerning Church and State manifeſted elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he means a larger blaſphemous Libel, which he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, wherein he endeavours to juſtifie his fact. It is very
long, but yet I beſeech you to read it over, and if you have not
read <hi>Naphthali,</hi> nor <hi>Jus Populi vindicatum,</hi> which is a Reply to
the Anſwer, which the Biſhop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> whom this miſcreant

                  <p>ME (who may juſtly call my ſelf the leaſt of all Saints, and
the chiefeſt of all Sinners) hath Chriſt his Son our Lord
called, to be a Witneſs for his deſtroyed Truth and trampled on Intereſt,
by this Wicked Blaſphemous and God-contemning Generation, and
againſt all their other perfidious Wickedneſſes. Sir, I ſay the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
I have in your real Friendſhip and love to Chriſt, his Truth,
People, Intereſt and Cauſe, hath incouraged me, to write to you,
hoping that you will not miſconſtruct, nor take advantage of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
and Weakneſs; you have heard of my Indictment, which I
take up in theſe two particulars. Firſt, (as they term it) Rebellion
and Treaſon, anent which I anſwered to my Lord Chancellor, that it
was no Rebellion, but a Duty which every one was bound to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
in joyning with that party; And in the year 1656. Mr.
<hi>Robert Lightonne,</hi> being the Primate of the Colledge of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
before our Laureation, tendered to us the national Covenant,
and ſolemn League and Covenant, which upon mature Deliberation,
I found nothing in them, but a ſhort compend of the Moral Law only,
obliging us to our Duty towards God and Men in their ſeveral Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and I finding that our then baniſhed Kings Intereſt lay wholly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49582:11"/>
included therein, <hi>viz.</hi> Both the Oath of Coronation, Allegiance, &amp;c.
And they being the then teſſera of all Loyalty. And, My Lord, it was
well known that then many were taking the Tender, and forſwearing
<hi>Charles Stewarts</hi> Parliament, and Houſe of Lords, I then ſubſcribed
them both. The doing of which, My Lord Chancellor, would have
ſtood me at no leſs rate, if alls well known, then this my preſent
adhering and proſecuting the ends thereof doth now; And when I was
queſtioned, what then I called Rebellion; I anſwered, That it is,
Ezra. 7. 26. <hi>And whoſoever will not do the Law of thy God,
and of the King,</hi> &amp;c. But being queſtioned by the Commiſſioner
before the Council there anent; I anſwered, as I ſaid to My Lord
Chancellor before, in the year 1656. Mr. <hi>Robert Lightonne</hi> being
then Primate of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> before our Laureation,
he tendered to us the national Covenant, and ſolemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
where he ſtopped me, ſaying, I wade you are come here to
give a Teſtimony; and then being demanded what I called Rebellion,
if it was not Rebellion to oppoſe His Majeſties Forces in the face, to
which I anſwered, My Lord Commiſſioner, if it pleaſe your Grace,
I humbly conceive, that they ſhould have been with us, meaning that
it was the Duty of thoſe Forces, to have joyned with us, according
to the national Covenant; at which anſwer I perceived him to ſtorm.
But ſays he, I hear that you have been over Seas, with whom did you
Converſe there? Anſwer, with my Merchant, My Lord. But ſaith
he, with whom in particular? with one <hi>John Michel,</hi> a Couſin of
mine, ſaith he, I have heard tell of him, he is a Factor in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi>
to which I conceded; But ſaith he, did you not Converſe with Mr.
<hi>Levingſton?</hi> and ſuch as he? To which I anſwered, My Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
I Converſed with our baniſht Miniſters, to which he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
baniſht Miniſters, baniſht Traytors; he will ſpeak Treaſon at the
very Bar. Then he anſwered himſelf, ſaying, but they would call the
ſhooting at the Biſhop an Heroick Act; To which I anſwered, That
I never told them of any ſuch thing. <hi>Queſtion,</hi> But, where did you
ſee <hi>James Wallace</hi> laſt? Anſw. <hi>Towards the borders of</hi> Germany
<hi>ſome year ago. Queſt.</hi> But what ailed you at my Lord St. <hi>Andrews</hi>
here? pointing at him with his finger. Anſw. <hi>My Lord Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
the grievous oppreſſion and horrid Bloodſhed of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and the eager purſuit after my own Blood, as it appeareth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49582:12"/>
this day to your Grace, and to all His Majeſties Honourable
Council; after which he commanded to take me away, that they
might ſee what next to do with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, the ſhooting that ſhot, intended againſt the Biſhop of
St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whereby the Biſhop of <hi>Orkney</hi> was hurt; to which
I anſwered, My Lord Chancellor in private, <hi>viz.</hi> That I looked
upon him to be the main Inſtigator of all the Oppreſſion and
Bloodſhed of my Brethren, that followed thereupon, and the continual
purſuing after my own, and, My Lord Chancellor, as it was credibly
reported to us (the truth of which your Lordſhip knows better than
we) that he keeped up His Majeſties Letter, inhibiting any more
blood to be ſhed upon that account, until the laſt Ten were Executed,
and I being a Souldier, not having laid down Arms, but being ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my own Defence, and having no other quarrel nor aim at any man,
but according to my own apprehenſion of him, and that as I hope in
ſincerity, without fixing either my ſelf or any one upon the Covenant
it ſelf, and as it may be underſtood, by many thouſand of the faithful;
beſides the proſecuting of the ends of the ſame Covenant, which was
and is in that part the overthrow of Prelates and Prelacy; and
I being a declared Enemy to him upon that account, and he to me in
like manner, ſo I never found my ſelf obliged, either by the Law of
God, or Nature, to ſet a Centry at his door, for his ſafety; But as he
was always ready to take his advantage of me, as it now appeareth,
ſo I of him when opportunity offered; Moreover, we being in no
terms of Capitulation, but on the contrary, I by his Inſtigation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excluded from all Grace and Favour, thought it my duty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
him on all occaſions. Alſo, My Lord, Sir <hi>William Sharp</hi> making
his Apology, anent his unhandſome cheating way, when he took me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretext to have ſpoken with me, about ſome other matter, (I not
knowing him until Five or Six of his Brothers, and his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were laying faſt hold on me, they being armed of purpoſe) he
deſired that I would excuſe him, ſeeing what he had done was upon his
Brothers account; which excuſe, My Lord, I eaſily admitted of,
ſeeing that he thought himſelf obliged to do what he did without Law
or Order, in the behalf of his Brother; much more was I obliged to
do what I did, in behalf of many Brethren, whoſe Oppreſſion was
ſo great, and whoſe Blood he had cauſed ſhed in ſuch abundance;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49582:12"/>
Moreover, he inſiſting in his bloody Murders, as witneſs the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> at his taking of his Emiſſaries, ſome few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that fell out concerning himſelf; now if by any means in taking
him away, I could have put a ſtop to the then current Perſecution:
Thus far I have truly reſumed what paſt.</p>
                  <p>But this anſwer to the ſecond part of the Indictment, may be
thought by ſome to be a ſtep out of the ordinary way, wherefore I ſhall
offer theſe things following, to your Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That paſſage,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 9. Where to me it is manifeſt, That the Seducer or Inticer
to Worſhip falſe Gods, is to be put to death by the hands of thoſe
whom he ſeeketh to turn away from the Lord, eſpecially by the hand of
the Witneſſes, whereof I am one; as it appears, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 9. which
precept I humbly conceive to be Moral, and not merely Judicial, and
that it is not at all Ceremonial or Levitical, but as every Moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
is Univerſal as to the extent of place, ſo alſo as to the extent of
time and perſons; upon which command, Sir, I do really think that
<hi>Phinehas</hi> acted in taking away the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Whore, and him
whom ſhe had ſeduced, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 6. Alſo that <hi>Elijah</hi> by vertue of
that precept, gave Commandment to the people to deſtroy <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts,
contrary to the mind of the ſeducing Magiſtrate, who was not only
remiſs and negligent in executing Juſtice, but became a Protector and
Defender of the Seducers: Then and in that Caſe, I ſuppoſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
duty not to be very dark. Moreover, we ſee what the people
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 1. They deſtroyed Idolatry, not only in
<hi>Judah,</hi> where the King concurred, but in <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eh,</hi>
where the King himſelf was an Idolater; and ſurely, what all the
people were bound to do, as their duty by the Law of God, every one
was bound to do it, to the uttermoſt of their power, and capacity.
And as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 3. Where the Seducers Father and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall put him to death; I take this to be meant of the Chriſtian
Magiſtrate. But when he is withdrawn by the Seducer from the
exerciſe of his Office, and Duty, and he's become utterly remiſs and
negligent in putting the Seducer to death, according to Gods expreſs
Law; which is not to be expected of him (for their be ſhould do
Juſtice upon himſelf) but is become a Protector and Defender of the
Idolater, then I doubt not, but it doth become the Duty of every
Chriſtian, to the uttermoſt of his power and capacity, to deſtroy and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49582:13"/>
cut off both Idolatry and Idolaters. Yea theſe preſumtuouſly-murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Prelates ought to be killed by the avenger of blood, when he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them; by the expreſs Law of God, ſeeing the thing is manifeſtly
true, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 21. and not have liberty to flee to ſuch Cities of
Refuge, as the vain pretext of lawful Authority. But they ſhould
be taken even from the Horns of ſuch Altars, and be put to death.
Moreover, what is ſpoken of concerning <hi>Amalek,</hi> upon the account,
that he deſign'd and reſolved the extirpation of the Lords People and
Truth, who are his Throne, upon which he puts forth his hand, and
becauſe he took occaſion againſt them, <hi>Exod. 17. 15. Numb.</hi> 24. 20.
He endeavouring that God ſhould not have a people to have ſerved
him, according to his revealed will, upon the Earth; and if he could
have effectuated his deſign, they ſhould not have lived, who would
not ſerve and worſhip him, and his Idol Gods; And for the better
effectuating of this his deſign, he took occaſion againſt them when
they were weary, in coming out of <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 25. 17, 18. And
the reaſon there annexed is, That he feared not God. Now, becauſe
I know Biſhops both will and do ſay, That what they did againſt
thoſe of the Lords people, whom they murdered, they did by Law and
Authority, but what I did, was contrary to both. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The
King himſelf, and all the Eſtates of the Land, and every individual
perſon therein, both were, and are obliged, by the Oath of God upon
them, to have by force of Arms extirpted perjured Prelates, and
Prelacy, and in doing thereof, to have defended one another with
their lives and fortunes, the Covenants being engaged into, upon
theſe terms, <hi>viz.</hi> After Supplications, Remonſtrations, Proteſtations,
and all other lawful means have been uſed, now for that effect, as the
laſt remedy, we take up Arms, upon which conditions the Nobility,
and all the repreſentatives of the Nation, according to the national
and Solemn League and Covenant, gave to our King both the Sword
and Scepter, and ſet the Crown upon his head; and he accordingly
received them, according to theſe Sacred Oaths and Promiſes, and
ſwore by the everliving God to uſe and improve them for the end
aforeſaid; and eſpecially, in order to the performing of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<hi>viz.</hi> The extirpation and overthrow of Prelates and Prelacy:
and now the want of what Authority do they mean or ſpeak of? truly
I know not, except it be the Authority of their aggregation of new
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49582:13"/>
Gods, of whom they have their gain, life and ſtanding, <hi>viz. Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh</hi>
or <hi>Bachus,</hi> which with drunken <hi>Moab,</hi> delighted to dwell
within dark Cells, and <hi>Aſhteroth</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> whom they worſhip in
the Female kind, becauſe of their Adulteries and Whoredoms; at
alſo <hi>Milchom</hi> or <hi>Molech,</hi> which ſignifies a Tyrannical King or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
if they will have it ſo, in whoſe arms and power they put their
young Infants and Poſterity to be burnt and deſtroyed, according
to his Luſt and Pleaſure, <hi>Amos 5. 26. Pſal.</hi> 116. 37. and that
Mammon, which they delight to worſhip daily together with their
own bellies, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things,
whoſe end will be deſtruction, except they repent, which there is little
probability of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 19. to which, if we may add their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Pride and Blaſphemous perjury, then their Gods will be equal
in number to the Whore their Mother, from whom they have their
being, ſtrength and ſtanding, and from the Devil their Father, who
was a Deceiver, Lyar, Murderer from the beginning: and now
ſeeing the Prelates poſſeſs whatſoever their Gods <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> &amp;c.
giveth them to poſſeſs, then why ſhould not we poſſeſs what the Lord
our God giveth us to poſſeſs, <hi>viz.</hi> His eternal Truths manifeſted to us,
in his revealed Will, and keep and defend the ſame, from all Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Corruptions and Traditions of his or our Adverſaries, defend our
lives, Laws and Liberties out of the hands of our Uſurping Enemies,
<hi>Jud.</hi> 11. 24. for ſure I am, that God once diſpoſſeſt the Prelates and
Malignants of all theſe, and ſhould they again poſſeſs them, through
our defect, God forbid. But the like of this work, our Murthering
Prelates like not; who plead like the Whore their Mother for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Obedience, and that all the Lords people, who may not comply
with your Idolatries, ſhould lay down their necks to their bloody
Axes; with whom too, too many of our Hypocritical time-ſerving
and perfidious Profeſſors do agree, who would rather abide with
<hi>Ruben</hi> amongſt the Sheepfolds, than <hi>Jeopard</hi> either life or fortune in
the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty, but do not conſider the
bitter curſe pronounced by the Angel of the Lord againſt <hi>Meros,</hi>
to which he immediately ſubjoyns a bleſſing upon <hi>Jael</hi> the Wife of
<hi>Hebar</hi> the <hi>Kenite:</hi> others excuſe themſelves thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Vengeance
is mine, and I will re-pay, but ſo the Throne and Judgement is the
Lords, and by this they would take away the uſe and office of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49582:14"/>
Magiſtracy, which erronious principle I deteſt; for God even in
the working of Miracles, <hi>viz.</hi> in dividing the Red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi>
14. 16. he commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtretch forth his Rod, and
Chriſt when he opened the blind Man's eyes, maketh uſe of clay
and of ſpittle; though indeed, I mean not of any who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have helped, but wanted opportunity, yet there are many
peeviſh time-ſerving Profeſſors, who reſolve they ſhall never ſuffer
ſo long as they have either Soul or Conſcience, to morgage; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they may ſave them from ſuffering: and if it will not
do their buſineſs, it ſeemeth (that before they ſuffer) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to ſell out at the ground. Now, Sir, I have neither miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
Scripture, nor miſ-applyed it, inregard of the Perſons here
hinted at, nor been wrong in the end, which ought to be the glory
of God, and the good of his Church and People. Then I think
that ſome Perſons might forhear to ſcourge me ſo ſore with their
Tongues, while I am not yet condemned by the common enemy,
and my bearing of ſome things reported by ſome behind my back,
hath occaſioned my writing to you at this time. O Sir! be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to pray to the Lord in my behalf, that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of his Mercy and Goodneſs, to ſave me from ſinning under
ſuffering, in this hour and power of darkneſs; for my Soul is preſt
in me, in the ſearch betwixt ſin and duty, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt I ſhould be
too niggard and ſparing of life, when God calleth for it; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other hand, leaſt I ſhould be too Prodigal and laviſh of it,
in not uſing all legal defences, in preſerving of it; and many things
of the like Nature. I am in a ſtrait, O Lord, undertake thou
for me. Sir, I hope you will excuſe me, in ſending you theſe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and irregular lines, when you conſider my preſent condition;
Sir, believe, I would many times, when I am before them, think
a Scaffold a ſweet retirement, leaſt they ſhould cheap and deceive
me; in making me, either to stain the declarative Glory of God,
my own Conſcience, or his People and Intereſt, in wronging of them,
either by opening of the Adverſaries mouths against them, or in
letting looſe their hand upon them; henceforth let the Adverſary
either ſay or do what they can, yet <hi>the Righteous will hold on
their way, and he who hath clean hands will be ſtronger and
ſtronger,</hi> Job. 17. 9. <hi>But he that ſaith unto the Wicked,

for any private Perſon to kill an Uſurper, or Tyrant, <hi>ſine
titulo;</hi> and to kill <hi>Iriſh</hi> Robbers, and Tories, or the like; and to
kill Boars, Wolves, and ſuch devouring Beaſts; becauſe the good
of this action doth not redound to the Perſon himſelf only, but
to the whole Common-wealth; and the Perſon acting incurrs the

<hi>had not only given me Knowledge, and a Tongue, to make known
the Impiety of the Idol, but had given me credit with many who
would have put in execution God's Judgements, if I would only
have conſented thereto.</hi> But ſo careful was I of common Tranquility,
and ſo loth was I to offend ſome, that in ſecret conference with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Men, I travelled rather to ſlacken that fervency, God had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in them, than to animate or encourage them, to put their hands
to the Lord's Work, wherein I acknowledge my ſelf to have done
moſt wickedly; and from the bottom of my heart I do ask my
God pardon, that I did not what in me lay, to have ſuppreſt that
Idol in the beginning. But O! how far are the Men in our time
from ſuch convictions! whoſe work it is to put out any ſpark of
Life or Zeal, which appeareth in any Perſon, againſt Idolatry
and Idol of our times. Now let Men, whether Foes, or Friends,
carp or quarrel never ſo much, yet the purpoſe and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God will not be diſappointed, in living Witneſſes againſt
this miſ-believing Generation, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is both als powerful,
and willing, to deliver one, or more of his People truſting in him,
yea, and that <hi>there is no reſtraint unto the Lord, to ſave by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

all their endeavours unſucceſsful: I mean, the hidden time-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Hypocrites and Murmurers, who have preferred their backs
and bellies, to the Intereſt of God, and their hearts ſtill deſirous
to return to <hi>Egypt:</hi> I ſay, until ſuch Rebels be purged and dye,
we can have little expectation to proſper, in any enterprize or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;
for they have both betrayed and miſ-believed God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
of all his Miracles which he did of old, and which
he has done in our days, for his people, and before their eyes;
yet they are ſo far gone back in a courſe of Apoſtacy and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> of our times, and are become ſo brutiſhly
ignorant, of the expreſs Law of God, and are ſuch enemies thereto,
that they do rather concurr with the ſaid <hi>Canaanites, Judg.</hi> 6. 25. to

expreſs command from God, for throwing down of <hi>Baal's</hi> Altar,
and for cutting down of the Grove, and deſtroying of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites.
Anſwer,</hi> Indeed he had an expreſs command of God
for his encouragement, but he had no new command from God,

by vertue of which every one was obliged to have done what
he did, without any ſuch meſſage from God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 15.

of which I have the honour and happineſs to be one, the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyeſt

found a Lyar againſt the Truth, for I adventured on it, upon
my own pure, and proper motion, without the inſtigation of
any, yea without the privacy of that party; whom therefore I
earneſtly deſire, that none may charge with, and if any ſhall, I
do with the greateſt confidence averr, that they deal with them
moſt unjuſtly; I have, I ſay again, in the ſimplicity of my
heart, with candour and ingenuity, becoming a dying Man, and
a Chriſtian, believing that he muſt be made manifeſt before the
Tribunal of Chriſt, and there receive according to the things
done in the body, whether they be good or evil, given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

to ſo high a Pinacle, and an illimitated and Arbitrary Power, far

whom both by the Oath of God upon them, and by the eminent and

It being moſt well known, that ſuch as were put to death, had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

were as much obliged to have performed as theſe, if the guarders
had been as faithful to God and man as the Pannels were.</p>

what God did to their Predeceſſors, for their Idolatrous Pride
and Wickedneſs; although they knew it, yet they are become more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
in Idolatry and Wickedneſs, and daring againſt God than ever
their Forefathers preſumed to be, in medling with the Veſſels and
Materials of Gods houſe, and with the Crown and Kingly Office of
Chriſt Jeſus, and have appropriate them to their own Idolatrous ends
and uſes, 21. 22. Therefore, when the forbiſhed Sword of the Lords
Indignation and Juſtice breaketh forth to devour, which it may do;
before the dark night of theſe dreadful Diſpenſations paſs over, then
ſhall the time-ſerving Hypocrites of this Generation begin to their
untimely Prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> Hills and Mountains fall upon them, to hide
them from the face of the Righteous Judge, for who may abide the
day of his coming, for Executing of Vengeance on his Adverſaries.
In that day the man ſhall be accuſed who keepeth back his Sword from
blood, and who doth the work of the Lord deceitfully, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 10.
Yea happy ſhall he be that taketh this Curſed Malignant, and prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

their unbelief, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 17. And O Father of Mercy, while I
am toſſed upon the turbulent Seas of manifold troubles, grant that thy
preſence may be with me, and that thy Everlaſting arms may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
me, to ſupport me, for ſure I am, <hi>Moſes</hi> thy Servant had good
reaſon to be importunate in this ſuit, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 2. compared with
14. and 15. <hi>v. Chap.</hi> 34. 9. Seeing no leſs could furniſh him with
freſh ſupplyes in the work he was about. O let thy preſence be with
me, and then my Soul ſhall dig, and ſing, and ſing, and dig through
times of trouble into Eternal Reſt, where I ſhall be admitted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Rock Chriſt, out of whom floweth the pure Fountain and
River of Life and Happineſs, which I may drink and not be damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
through the aſſaults of Satan, or the invaſions of ſin, or of a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49582:19"/>
wicked world any more; now according to thy promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 19.
Out of thy Fatherly Mercy, grant preſent help, ſupply and direction in
this time of trouble, ſeeing it is not in man that walketh, to direct his
own ſteps, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 23. and though it be a hard thing rightly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
betwixt Sin and Duty; yet thy Law, thy Word and thy
Truth which are quick and powerful, dividing aſunder of Soul and
Spirit, and is a director of the thoughts, and thy Law giveth light,
<hi>Pſal. 119. 105. Pſal.</hi> 32. 8. For thy Teſtimonies, O Lord, are ſure,
making wiſe the ſimple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. For thou alone canſt make all
thy Diſpenſations prove profitable, in order to the purging away of
Sin, even when they ſeem to be deſtructive, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27. 9. eſpecially,
when thou intends them not for deſtruction, but for tryal, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.
2, 16. and for further Humiliation, for thou, O Lord, haſt led me for
many years, through a barren and weariſome Wilderneſs, to the end,
that thou mayſt work thy work of Mortification in me, although, if
it had ſeemed good unto thee, thou couldſt have brought me into the
Land of Promiſe and Reſt a nearer way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 17. For thou
by hardſhips, many a time hides Pride from men, and ſealeſt up their
inſtruction, that thou may'ſt deliver his Soul from the Pit, and that
his life may ſee the light, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 17. And although thou, O Lord,
ſhouldſt ſend me the back tract, and tenor of my Life, to ſeek my Souls
comforts, and incouragements from thence; yet I have no cauſe to
complain of hard dealing from thy hand, ſeeing it is thy ordinary way
with ſome of thy people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 6. O God, my Soul is caſt down
within me, therefore will I remember thee from the Land of <hi>Jordan,</hi>
and from the Hill <hi>Hermon,</hi> &amp;c. Yea the laſt time he brought me to the
Banqueting-houſe, and made love his Banner over me (amongſt the
cold <hi>High-land</hi> Hills beſide <hi>Kipper, Nov.</hi> 1673.) he remembred his
former kindneſſes towards me; but withal he ſpoke it in mine Ear,
that there was a tempeſtuous storm to meet me in the Face, which I
behooved to go through with the ſtrength of that Proviſion,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 7. And now, O my Soul, ſeeing it is his ordinary
way and method with thee, to ſend a ſhower, and a ſunblink, and
again a ſunblink and ſhower; therefore, keep thou ſilent to God,
and murmure not, fret not, be not diſquieted, be ſtill, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſeeing all my Perſecutors can do either by fraud, or force,
can neither alter the Nature or kind of my ſufferings, on add

ſo much as a degree thereto, neither lengthen out the time of
them for a moment, <hi>Matthew 10. 29. Exodus</hi> 12. 41. All
<hi>Pharoahs</hi> Power could not keep <hi>Iſrael</hi> one Night longer in

the courſe of his Providence for me, in which there is ſuch an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
as to carry all things to the proper and appointed end: what
an irreſiſtable power? and that I may be <hi>found in him, not as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which
is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of
God by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9. 10. and to reſign up unto God my will
and affections, to be diſpoſed as he pleaſeth, and to ſay with fear,
humility, and reverence, <hi>O Father, not my Will, but thine be
done;</hi> and whether I live or dye, I may be the Lords, that through
his Mercy and Grace, I may attain to his approbation, <hi>viz. Well
done good and faithful Servant,</hi> who hath hitherto ſent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and <hi>ſhut the Lyons Mouth that they have not hurt me,</hi>
Dan. 6. 22. and who hath ſo ſhut the eyes of my Perſecutors with a
Sodomitiſh blindneſs, that hitherto they could not find out the way,
how to break in upon me; and I hope, he will in due time bring
me out of the fiery Furnace, and ſhall not through his Grace,
ſuffer the ſmell thereof to be found upon me; and if not, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
held it to be my duty, to worſhip this rotten and ſtinking I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
of Jealouſie, which theſe Nations have ſet up, who have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
both the Lord Jeſus, and their own Prophets, and have perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
us, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 15. For thou, O Lord, haſt not abhorred nor
deſpiſed my afflictions, when I was afflicted, <hi>neither haſt thou hid
thy Face from me, but when I cryed unto thee thou heardeſt me,</hi>
Pſ. 22. 24. Now, <hi>O Lord God, thou haſt made the Heaven, and
the Earth by thy great Power, and ſtretched out Arm,</hi> Jer. 32.
17. Bring thou me at length to a happy arrival within the Gates
of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where no unclean thing can come; that my
praiſe may be of thee in the great Congregation. And although
as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, 10. 17. That, thou, O Lord, haſt delivered me to
the ungodly, and haſt turned me over into the hands of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49582:20"/>
yet <hi>by this, I know, that thou, O Lord favoureſt me, becauſe
mine Enemies do not triumph over me;</hi> when I ſtand in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thou O Lord, didſt not condemn; and if it pleaſeth thee, thou
will not leave me in their hands, <hi>Pſ. 41. 11. Pſ.</hi> 37. 33. But canſt
bring up my Life from the Pit of Corruption, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 6. And
ſeeing I have not preferred, nor ſought after mine own things, but
thy Honour and Glory, the Good, Liberty, and Safety of thy
Church and People, although I may be now miſ-conſtructed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
yet at length, I hope, thou Lord, will make my Light break
forth as the Morning, and my Righteouſneſs as the Noon-day, and
that Shame and Darkneſs ſhall cover all who are Adverſaries to
my Righteous cauſe; For thou Lord art the Shield of my help,
and the Sword of my excellency, and my Enemies ſhall be found
Lyars, <hi>Amen,</hi> yea and <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>IN ſome parts of this Villainous Paper you find the Author diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
like a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> in ſome like an Enthuſiaſt, and in many
places like both. And from the beginning to the end of it he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
from the ſuppoſed validity of the judicial Law, which God
gave the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> not as their God, but as their Political Sovereign,
and which they on the other hand received from his infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
not on a Moral Account, as his rational Creatures, or the
Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Noah;</hi> but upon the account of the civil Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they had to him as Subjects, or his people in a Political ſence.
For the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government, as all their Writers agree, was a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical
Conſtitution, or the Temporal Kingdom of God; who
was pleaſed to become <hi>Jehovah-Stator,</hi> and dwell among them in a
viſible external manner: in ſo much that the Judges, and Kings,
were but his High-commiſſioners, and Vice-roys, who were choſen,
and depoſed by him at his pleaſure, and like <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> his
firſt two Generals, could neither make War, nor Peace, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49582:21"/>
any State-matter of great moment, without firſt asking
Counſel of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he anſwered them by Meſſengers, or Prophets;
ſometimes by Dreams and Viſions, but moſt commonly in the time
betwixt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Captivity, by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which
was a Political Oracle, appointed on purpoſe for the Judges,
Kings, or Generals, or the whole Congregation to conſult in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State and War. But our Saviour, who came to break
down the wall of partition betwixt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi>
threw his Fathers incloſure into the Common again, and put an end
to his Political Government over the <hi>Jews.</hi> Who had they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
Chriſtianity, and continued in their Country, as one entire
people to this day, would not have been obliged by their ſpecifick
Judgments, and Statutes, wherein their Civil, Criminal, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Laws conſiſt. No, the whole deſign of the Goſpel is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, that it is impoſſible for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to obſerve ſome, ridiculous to obſerve others, and impious
again to obſerve others of their judicial Laws. Of the laſt ſort
are all thoſe which God gave the <hi>Jews;</hi> as <hi>Carnifices Gentium,</hi> or
Executioners of his Wrath upon the Seven Idolatrous incorrigible
Nations, as likewiſe all thoſe Capital Acts againſt <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as High
Treaſon to his Government, and inconſiſtent with the deſign he
had to be King, as well as God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he ſet up as a
light among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſecured them by thoſe great ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
from falling into <hi>Demonolatry,</hi> which was the Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the World.</p>
            <p>This was the general Opinion of all Chriſtians, till the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
began to argue by falſe Analogy from things and perſons in
the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> to things and perſons under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation,
and from them it was, that the Presbyterians firſt of all learn'd to
defend Murders, Aſſaſſinations, Rebellions and Maſſacres, as you
ſee this Villain hath done.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth mov'd the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to cut
off <hi>Luther,</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> becauſe (forſooth) God caſt <hi>Corah</hi>
and his Company down into Hell, and commanded, that all thoſe
ſhould be put to death that would not obey the High Prieſt. And
as <hi>Davila</hi> relates in the Ninth book of his Hiſtory, the Pope
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49582:21"/>
compared the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that Patron of the curſed League, to
<hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> complimented him with the
name of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and bid him go on, and proſper in the name of God.
According to which damnable notion of falſe Zealotry, when they
Conſecrate an Aſſaſſin (as <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> hath proved they ſometimes
do) to Murder an Heretick Prince, they Solemnly Conſecrate him
to the work of the Lord in ſuch a like form as this. <hi>Thou Elect
Son of God, take here the Sword of</hi> Gideon, <hi>the Sword of</hi> Jeptha,
<hi>the Sword of</hi> Sampſon, <hi>the Sword of</hi> David, <hi>the Sword of the</hi>
Maccabees, <hi>go, and be of good courage, and the Lord ſtrengthen thy
Arm.</hi> Can any thing be more like Mr. <hi>Mitchels</hi> Juſtification than
this? would not one think his Soul had entered into that ſecret of
the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> ſeeing he hath not acted only like one of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins,
but written his Apology with their poyſoned Ink. If
Father <hi>Brown</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> that Preach'd among them ſo many
years, had penn'd it, could it have ſavoured ſtronger of the Society
of Jeſus, or become ſuch an Author better than it doth? He
boaſted on his death-bed at <hi>Ingeſtonbrigges,</hi> that he had Preached as
down right Popery in our Field-conventicle, as ever he had
Preached in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; and had he been the Author of this Paper,
he might have alſo boaſted, to the comfort of his departing Soul,
that he had written as true a Papiſtical Pamphlet, as ever was
written in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. I think there is great preſumption
to aſſert, that <hi>the Father</hi> might help to indoctrinate <hi>Mitchel</hi> in this
Myſtery of Iniquity; but if he did not, yet both he and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Naphthali</hi> might invent theſe Doctrines without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jeſuites,</hi> ſeeing it is the <hi>Cabala</hi> of their own Sect.</p>
            <p>For this way of arguing to do miſchief from the judicial Law,
was the Logick of our moſt Primitive Presbyterians, which hath
ever ſince cauſed ſo much ruine and blood.</p>
            <p>For in the Convention at <hi>Edinburgh Jan.</hi> 1560. for Ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a new form of Church-Policy, it was Enacted, that all
Monuments and Places of Idolatry, by name Chappels, Cathedral
Churches, and Colledges, ſhould be ſuppreſſed; whereupon through
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49582:22"/>
the inſtigation of <hi>John Knox</hi> enſued (ſaith my<note n="c" place="margin">Spotsw. <hi>&amp;c. in</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, 1560. L. 3.</note> Author) a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Vaſtation of Churches, and Church-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſo that the Libraries nor Church-regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
nor Sepulchers of the dead were ſpar'd.
And ſome ill adviſed Preachers (ſaith he) did
animate the People in their Barbarous proceedings, crying out, that
places, where <hi>Idols</hi> had been worſhipped, ought by the Law of
God to be deſtroyed, and that the ſparing of them was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of things execrable; as if (he ſubjoyns) the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for deſtroying the places where the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
did worſhip their falſe Gods, had been a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for them to do the ſame.<note place="margin">Can. 62.</note> I confeſs the
<hi>Council of Carthage</hi> in the time of <hi>Honorius</hi>
decreed, that the Emperors ſhould be Petition'd to raze the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and deſtroy the Reliques of Heathen Idols; but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in Maritime, and other places of <hi>Afrique,</hi> Idolatry was yet
profeſſed in them, and not from any ſenſe of Duty incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them from the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law. For that as well as the <hi>Latin</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> Churches had converted the Temples of <hi>Idols</hi> into the
Churches of Chriſt; but as for the ſupernumerary uſeleſs company
of them, which remain'd as Snares, and Monuments of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
which the Devil had had in the World, they thought it
both for the honour and intereſt of Chriſtianity, that they ſhould
be taken away.</p>
            <p>In the following year, 1561. although Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had agreed
with the Council, That She ſhould have her own Service in Her
own Chappel, yet the next day, when the<note n="d" place="margin">Spotsw. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> L. 4. An. 1561.</note>
Tapers were carried through the Court, a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
of Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s Principles fell upon him
that bore them, and broke them all in pieces,
and had not the Tumult been timely ſuppreſſed by ſome moderate
Spirits abominable Barbarites had enſued; for ſome maintain'd, that
if right were done, Her Majeſties Prieſts ſhould have been ſlain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods Law againſt Idolaters. It would be endleſs to
trace theſe Principles down from the time of the Original Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
to theſe unhappy days; you may ſee enough of them in the
Parliament Sermons, and innumerable other Pamphlets of the late
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49582:22"/>
times. How often did the late Presbyterian Preachers Commend
the Houſe of Commons for their Zeal, and ranſack the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for examples and precepts to perſwade the giddy Vulgar,
that the Rebels fought the Lords Battels, and that their cauſe was
his? How often did they compare the moſt active of them to
<hi>Gideon, Samſon</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> and complement the worthies of the
late long Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> Compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the laſt King of <hi>France,</hi> when he raiſed an Army for the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the Proteſtants, in the Glorious name of the Lord of
Hoſts. Did not that darling of the Faction, Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> in the
bloody Speech which he made in 43. at the <hi>Guildhall</hi> of <hi>London</hi>
to the Citizens, (to perſwade them to contribute largely towards
the bringing in of our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army) juſtifie himſelf from the
objection of his own tender Conſcience, that he being a Miniſter
of the Goſpel ſhould ſtir them up to make War; by taking an
Apology from <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. where God ordained,
that the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſts ſhould ſound the Alarm with the
Silver Trumpets, and that the Prieſt ſhould make a Speech to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the people going out to Battel to fight for the Lord of
Hoſts. So that <hi>Naphthali, Nehuſhtan,</hi> and <hi>Mitchels</hi> Papers are
but the laſt improvement of the Presbyterian Logick and Zeal,
which makes our Conventicle-Preachers ride about with Guards,
like petty Princes, and their followers, more like Soldiers than
Chriſtians, come Armed by Thouſands into the <hi>Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are now arriv'd at the higheſt pitch of Enthuſiaſm and
Bigotry, and are as ready upon all occaſions, to do as much for
the Spiritual Crown of Chriſt, which they think inconſiſtent
with the Mitre; as the Men of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> principles,
are ready to do for the Temporal Kingdom of Jeſus. So that if
God in his good Providence had not ſent down the Duke of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi>
among us to prevent the ſtorms that were ready to ariſe;
in all human probability, this Kingdom had been involv'd in ſuch
a violent Rebellion, as could not have been quell'd without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
force. His Grace came hither without any proſpect of
trouble; and the incredible numbers of Nobility, and Gentry,
that throng'd to meet him ſeveral days Journey on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground,
were enough to make him preſume that all would be quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49582:23"/>
But he had not been many days among us, when he was
ſurpriz'd with the news of great inſolencies, and diſorders caus'd
by the Field-Conventicles in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make you underſtand what Wind blew up that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
flame, and how thoſe evil principles probably came to be put
into fermentation, I muſt lead you back to the year 1674. when
ſome, whoſe diſcontents far exceeded their cauſes, under the old
pretence of redreſſing grievances, did deſign ſomething elſe, and
thereby almoſt render'd the Parliament uſeleſs for the publick
ends, for which it was call'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was then His Majeſty's High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
and there was not one real grievance, of which he
himſelf did not propoſe the removal; nor any one pretended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he was not willing to treat: and if it were found
to be really ſuch, to have it redreſs'd in an orderly, fair, and legal
manner, according to the fundamental conſtitutions of the houſe.
But this would not ſatisfie their diſcontents (which enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates,
that ſomething elſe was deſigned beſides the removal
of grievances) whereupon his <hi>Grace</hi> returning to Court to give
an account of affairs to his Royal Maſter, ſuch great confuſions
appeared among us, as naturally follow palliated diſcontents.
Then did <hi>Welſh,</hi> and other declared Traitors, take the confidence
to Preach openly in <hi>Fife,</hi> and <hi>Tiveot-dale,</hi> which before had been
orderly places; and there they were entertain'd and encourag'd to
debauch the People from their Duty to the King, and the Church.
And if theſe bold attempts, and diſorderly practiſes had not then
been timely quell'd by his <hi>Grace</hi>'s care, and conduct, it is eaſie to
Divine to what eminent hazard, our Peace, and Government had
been expos'd.</p>
            <p>Whether our Fanaticks were then under-hand encourag'd to
commit theſe inſolencies, by deſigning malcontents time, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer
of ſecrets may ſhew; but it is beyond all peradventure,
that ſcandalous and unſeaſonable diviſions caus'd by nothing, but
envy, and diſcontent, did then animate, and embolden them to
theſe turbulent practices; and therefore it ſeems not improbable,
that the ſame diſcontented party envying the Duke his glorious
reception, and the juſt eſteem he hath with his Prince, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49582:23"/>
to fruſtrate his beſt counſels, and endeavours for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this, and by conſequence the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in
Peace; have now conjured up the Fanatical Spirit again, to act
in more inſolent irregularities, than at any time heretofore. But
let the cauſe be what it will, the Conventicles were never ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and frequent, as they now began, and ſometime after
continued to be in <hi>Fife, Clidſdale, Tiveot-dale, Galloway, Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Carrict;</hi> the laſt of which Shires had always been
peaceable, and orderly till now, when they all conſpir'd to invade
the publick peace. At theſe Field-Conventicles would meet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
5. or 6. thouſand, ſometimes eight or nine thouſand at a time,
as many of which as were fit to bear Arms, and could provide
them, never fail'd to come appointed into the Field. For this
reaſon our Laws and Proclamations ſtile theſe Field-meetings <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouzes</hi>
of Rebellion, which is as modeſt a Name as they can
deſerve. For moſt of the principle Preachers among them, as
<hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Arnott,</hi> are either attainted or declared Traytors, and
were actors in the Rebellion of 66. and the <hi>Harangues</hi> (for I
will not call them Sermons) which they make to the People,
tend to nothing, but to make them rebel, and poſſeſs them with
hatred againſt the King, and the Church. In <hi>October</hi> laſt at
<hi>Sanchil</hi> in <hi>Carrict,</hi> Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> attended with ſeven or eight ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Preachers, made a preachment to the principal diviſion of
a multitude upwards of 7000. people, upon <hi>St. John</hi> 11. 34. 35.
In this Preachment among much other Treaſonable ſtuff he ſpoke
theſe words. <hi>The King, the Nobles, and the Prelates, are ſure the
Murderers of Chriſt,</hi> and then ſitting down in his chair, he ſaid,
<hi>Oh People, I will be ſilent. Speak O People, and tell me what good
the King hath done ſince his home-coming; yea hath he not done
all the miſchief a Tyrant could do—?</hi> At another Conventicle
not long after, he ſpoke thus, or to this purpoſe; <hi>That he was
confident, that God would yet aſſert the cauſe of</hi> Pentland-<hi>hills,
in ſpite of the Curates (for ſo they call the Orthodox Miniſters)
and their Maſters the Prelates, and in ſpite of the Prelates,
and their Maſter the King, and in ſpite of the King, and his
Maſter the Devil.</hi>

But to proceed, at theſe Field-Meetings they adminiſtred the
Solemn League and Covenant to the People; and made them
ſwear never to hear the Orthodox Miniſters more: and in a moſt
Popiſh manner, gave them the Sacrament thereupon. They alſo
kept Claſſical Meetings, where they ordain'd Ignorant, and Factious
ſtriplings, and by an unparallel'd Act of Schiſm, took the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to re-ordain one Mr. <hi>John Cuningham,</hi> who was formerly
ordain'd Presbyter by the late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Galloway;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
preſum'd to receive the Hypocritical Confeſſions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of ſuch as they had perſwaded, or ſuborn'd to confeſs
the great ſin of joyning in Worſhip with our Church. They
admitted ruling Elders in ſeveral Precincts, and with incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Impudence proceeded to Inſtitute, and induct Preachers of
their Tribe, both into vacant and full Churches; according to
Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s Judgement, who aſſerts in his Apology, that every
Pariſh ought to chooſe its Preacher, and that Patronage is but
a Popiſh Rite. They alſo confiding in their numbers, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in manifeſt contempt of Authority to erect Preaching-Houſes;
particularly in <hi>Carrict,</hi> and <hi>Galloway,</hi> where Perſons of
no mean Quality and Intereſt, harbour'd and careſſed thoſe great
Apoſtles of the Cauſe <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Arnott;</hi> who ride about theſe
diſ-affected Shires in great State, and Security, with Guards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of forty, fifty, or greater numbers of Horſe. From theſe
Inſolencies they proceeded to invade the Houſes, and menace the
Perſons of ſome Orthodox Miniſters, whom Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> declared
either in a Conventicle, or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> ſomewhere in <hi>Carrict,</hi> that
it was a lawful to kill, as for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to kill the <hi>Canaanites,</hi>
if they complained to the Men (for ſo he called the Magiſtrates)
in Power. Theſe out-rages ſo frighted the Orthodox Clergy,
that many Miniſters forſook their charges; and ſome of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
who lived in thoſe diſtracted corners, were forc'd for their
ſecurity, to repair to this Town. Thus all things ſeemed to
run into confuſion; and if excellent methods had not been uſed
to prevent the ſequel of ſuch dangerous beginnings; the faction
by this time had grown into a formed party, and diſputed <hi>the
Cauſe,</hi> with an Army in the Field.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49582:24"/>
The firſt thing the Privy Council did, was to iſſue out Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
for the execution of the Laws againſt theſe Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
and to uſe all means poſſible for ſeizing the Perſons of <hi>Welſh,</hi>
and <hi>Arnott,</hi> and other ſeditious Preachers: but the former were
rendred ineffectual, the Heritable Sheriff, and Bayliffs, and other
Officers of the ſeditious diſtricts refuſing to act; and the latter
could not be brought to effect, becauſe the Preachers are always
ſo ſtrongly guarded in publick; and in private ſhelter themſelves
with ſuch ſuperſtitious adorers of their holy perſons, as none of
the propoſed rewards can tempt to betray. Diſorders thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
the Council acquainted His Majeſty with the dangers they
threatned, and humbly mov'd him to ſend ſpeedy Orders, that a
conſiderable number of his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops ſhould march to the
maritime Borders next adjacent to <hi>Galloway,</hi> and the Weſtern
Shires, to be ready for Tranſportation if occaſion requir'd. His
Majeſty, who was long ſince acquainted with the Spirit and
Principles of our <hi>Remonſtrator-Presbyterians,</hi> in compliance with
the wholeſome advice of his Privy Council, immediately orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that a well-appointed Party, of about 3000. Horſe and Foot,
ſhould be ſent under the conduct of the Loyal, and Valiant Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Granard,</hi> our Countrey-man, to quarter upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Borders, and to march at the command of the Privy
Council here. This particular care of His Majeſty, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Forces, did very much ſurprize the Fanatical party,
who were made to believe by the malcontents, that the Duke had
no intereſt at Court, nor was capable to procure any extrinſical
aſſiſtance, although they ſhould rebel. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces being
arriv'd upon the Coaſts, the Council were reſolv'd to try what fair
and gentle means would do; and thereupon directed Letters to
the Heritors (whom you call Landlords) of <hi>Aire,</hi> and <hi>Ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rew,</hi>
to know if they would undertake by their own power to reduce
theſe diſorders, having the King's Authority for that effect. The
<hi>Heritors</hi> met in a full Aſſembly, and after two days conſultation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
Anſwer by three Noble Lords, whom the Council had ſent
to attend them, that they could not undertake by their own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to keep the Countrey free from Conventicles, or any diſorders
that might enſue thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49582:25"/>
You muſt know that our Landlords have far more Authority
over their Tenants, than yours; inſomuch, that in the moſt diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
places, there are no Conventicles, where the Heritors, and
Superiors uſe their private Authority to keep the people conſtant
to the Church. All the World here knows, that there is not a more
Fanatical ſhire in this Kingdom than <hi>Murray;</hi> and yet by the ſingle
Authority, and Intereſt of that moſt Loyal and deſerving perſon
the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> it is kept in as perfect Order and Obedience,
as if there were no Conventicles in the World. But, as for the
aforeſaid ſhires, the Council expected no ſuch anſwer from them,
becauſe they of all others have had moſt indulgence, as having
Non-conformiſt Miniſters legally ſetled in very many Churches
among them; which one would think, if that party had any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Modeſty, or Conſcience, might have kept them from troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the publick Peace. Therefore the Council having received
ſuch an unreaſonable anſwer from the Heritors of theſe more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
ſhires, concluded what returns they might expect from
others; and therefore began now to think it was high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to their duty by force. Whereupon, knowing that the
body of this Kingdom was Loyal, they reſolved rather to reduce
the Fanaticks by our own intrinſical power, than to call in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces, unleſs there ſhould be abſolute need. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to the Kings ſtanding Forces, they added the <hi>Militia</hi> of the
moſt Loyal County of <hi>Angus,</hi> and admitted the <hi>Auxiliary</hi> Forces,
which ſeveral Loyal Lords that have Intereſt, and Authority in the
<hi>Highlands,</hi> did proffer to raiſe out of their Vaſſals, and Dependents
for His Majeſties ſpecial Service in this critical exigence of Affairs.
And by His Majeſties ſpecial Approbation and Command, they
were all united into one Army, under the Conduct of the moſt
Valiant and Loyal Earl of <hi>Lin Lithgaw,</hi> who towards the latter
end of laſt <hi>Jan.</hi> marched into the Weſtern ſhires.</p>
            <p>And that all things might be tranſacted in a fair, legal, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
manner; there is alſo ſent along with the Army a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the Privy Council, conſiſting of Eleven Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons, who are inveſted with ſufficient power, Civil, and
Criminal, to puniſh all ſorts of Offenders, and are now ſteddily
purſuing thoſe great ends for which they were ſent thither.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49582:25"/>
There's a ſtrict Correſpondence betwixt them, and the Privy
Council, to whom they ſend frequent accounts of their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and from whom they receive ſuch meaſures, and directions,
as may moſt conduce to reduce and ſecure thoſe diſorderly ſhires.
To which purpoſe in the firſt place, they proceed to diſarm them,
cauſing all ſuſpected perſons to deliver their Arms (whereof great
Proviſion was made) to their reſpective Sheriffs upon Oath, who
are to deliver them to the Major General, and to be ſent by him to
His Majeſties Garriſons. They have likewiſe order to plant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
in what places ſoever they ſhall think fit, and have proceeded
to do Execution on the new built Meeting-houſes, thoſe Temples
of <hi>Baal Berith,</hi> by Commanding that they ſhould be pulled
down, and that their Materials ſhould be burnt. They are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to tender a <hi>Bond</hi> to be taken by all Heritors, wherein, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Families, they are to be bound for themſelves, their Wives,
Children and Servants, and, as Landlords, for their Tenants and
Cottagers, that they ſhall not go to Conventicles, nor receive, or
ſupply Conventicle-miniſters, but live orderly in Obedience to the
Law; ſo that if their Wives, or any of their Children or Servants
Tranſgreſs, they will be bound to undergo the legal Penalties for
them. But in caſe their Tenants or Cottagers Tranſgreſs, they
will be bound to preſent them to Juſtice, or turn them off their
Tenements, or elſe to be lyable to the Penalties they ſhall incur.</p>

            <p>This is the tenor of the Bond; and leaſt the force thereof
ſhould be eluded, the Privy Council have declared, That every
Heritor, that ſhall receive into his Lands, or Service any Tenants,
or Servants of any other Heritor, without a Certificate from him,
or the Miniſter of the Pariſh where they liv'd, that they lived or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
as to this matter, ſhall be ſubject, to ſuch Fines as the Privy
Council ſhall think fit to inflict to puniſh them for their Crime,
and repair the damage that ſhall accrue to the Heritor, or Maſter
whoſe Tenants or Servants they did receive. All the Lords of
the Privy Council, and the Judges (whom we call the Senators of
the Colledge of Juſtice) together with the Advocates Writers,
and all others belonging to the Society of the Lawyers, have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this Bond, as alſo the Lords of the Exchequer, and the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary
Lords, which is a very prevalent example, and little doubt is
made, but the generality of the Subjects of the Nation will chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſign it; as being ſo beneficial to Authority, and ſo proper
an expedient to recover the common people into their Wits. And
it cannot poſſibly give the leaſt umbrage of ſcruple to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of the moſt weak, or peeviſh Diſſenter; being nothing
but a purely civil alternative Obligation, to do what the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
or ſubmit to the Penalties therein contained. Perhaps it
may ſeem ſtrange in <hi>England,</hi> that a Landlord ſhould be bound in
this manner for his Tenants; but there is nothing more reaſonable,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49582:26"/>
and cuſtomary here; becauſe our Heritors have ſuch a deſpotic
power over their Tenants, as you cannot well imagine, unleſs
you had lived here.</p>
            <p>And in caſe any perſons ſhall finally refuſe to take this Bond
(as ſome <hi>Fife,</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Gentlemen have made difficulty at it)
The Privy Council (according to the legal and uncontroverted
Practiſe of that Bord in all ages) hath ordained, that Letters ſhall
be directed to them, to charge them forthwith to give in Security
to His Majeſties Privy Council, that They, their Wives, Children,
Tenants, and Servants, ſhall keep His Majeſties Peace, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that they ſhall not go to Conventicles, nor harbor Rebels,
nor intercommuned perſons, and that they ſhall keep the Perſons,
Families, and Goods of their Regular Miniſters harmleſs, under
the double of every mans valued yearly Rent, if he have any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or
of ſuch Penalties as ſhall be thought Convenient by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Council, or their Committee, if they have none; which if
they ſhall refuſe to do within Six days next after the charge, they
are to be declared His Majeſties <hi>Rebels</hi> (as the manner is here)
with the ſound of an Horn.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the Committee is to proceed to the condign
Cenſuring of ſuch, as ſhall appear upon proof to have harbored
<hi>Welſh,</hi> or <hi>Arnott,</hi> or other intercommuned perſons, and ſuch alſo
as have invited, or convocated the ſilly people unto the Field-Aſſemblies,
under pretence of hearing Sermons, and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
by Money, Work, or Materials to build the new <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Synagogues; two of which the Earl of <hi>Caſſels</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to demoliſh in <hi>Catrict,</hi> as was his duty to have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>All this hath been done under the wiſe Conduct of the Duke
of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> to whoſe preſence among us, next under God, this
poor Church, and Kingdom are redevable, that they have been
preſerved from Confuſion, and blood. And I queſtion nor, but
his Vigorous endeavours to ſuppreſs this Schiſm (the like whereof
in all reſpects was never yet heard of in any Age, or Nation)
have by this time effectually. Confuted all the lying reports that
were ſent into <hi>England</hi> by our men of Schiſm, and Faction, with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49582:27"/>
a deſign to render him odious in our Neighbour Country, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
his adminiſtration here.</p>
            <p>But I beg Mr. <hi>Mitchels,</hi> and your pardon, for leaving him ſo
long. I could not forbear to interſert this account of his Weſtern
Brethren, whoſe Confeſſor he liv'd, and whoſe Martyr he dy'd.
I'le now return to viſit him again, and leave him no more, till I
ſee him in his Grave.</p>
            <p>In the interval betwixt his condemnation, and execution, he
ſeldom ſpoke of his approaching Death, but as of a Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Murther; and glory'd that he was accounted worthy to
ſuffer for Chriſt. This is the ſtile of his ſhort Speech, and the
frequent Viſits, Papers and Meſſages that he received from the
Brotherhood to dye with Courage in the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and to ſeal the
Truth, that is, the <hi>Covenant,</hi> with his Blood; together with the
frequent debauches which he made with Ale, Wine, and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
contributed very much to heighten his obſtination, and make
him inſenſible of his crime.</p>
            <p>You cannot imagine how much the Fanaticks of all parts were
concern'd about him. From the Weſt, a private meſſage was
ſent to the Archbiſhop, to aſſure his Grace, that if Mr. <hi>James
Mitchel</hi> were hang'd, another ſhould not fail to execute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
His Majeſty's Advocate, who purſu'd him, receiv'd a
threatning anonymous Letter, and the common talk of this Town
was, that Mr. <hi>James Mitchel</hi>'s Blood ſhould be reveng'd upon
the whole Order; and truly I doubt not, but if all the Fathers of
our Church, and all the Clergy under them had but one Neck, that
there are at leaſt 300. Covenanted <hi>Mitchels</hi> behind, that would
ſtrive to cut it off.</p>
            <p>In the Year, 1668. when he made the attempt, the Fanatical
Party made a ſport of it; and as if the ruine of the Church were
ſure to follow upon it, many fair pretenders, that out of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to Authority, had hitherto given our Biſhops that particular
veneration that was due to their Character, began now to ſlight
them, and would ſcarce give them that common reſpect which
was due to other Men. The like change was obſerv'd upon the late
inſolencies of the <hi>Whigs</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the reſpect of our Biſhops,
and Epiſcopal Clergy, began viſibly to decay, and ſome that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49582:27"/>
were then in a condition to do the Faction a kindneſs, had the
confidence to ſay, that they knew no reaſon there was to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the inclinations of the people, to ſupport about a <hi>dozen
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And while this Martyr of Iniquity lay in Goal, the mouths of
our Fanaticks were full of railing againſt the Biſhops; and the
Raſcality, who are often taught to ſpeak the ſence of greater
Perſons, were heard to ſay, that it were better the Primate ſhould
be hang'd than he. In the <hi>Octave</hi> betwixt his ſentence, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he receiv'd, as I was credibly inform'd, 400. Dollars in
private gifts, which was interpreted by the Party for the particular
care that God had of him, who never ſees the Righteous forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
nor his Seed begging their bread.</p>
            <p>The day before his Execution he ſent to the Provoſt, or May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to deſire a Stage larger than ordinary, becauſe
he had a great number of Friends, that intended to appear at his
Execution in Mourning: but his Lordſhip was more honeſt, and
prudent than to grant the vain-glorious Villain his deſire. When
he was upon the Ladder, he called the <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be ſung,
which if you do not remember, I deſire you before you proceed,
to conſult. When the <hi>Pſalm</hi> was ended, he took out of his
<hi>Pſalm</hi> Book two Copies of his intended Speech, which he threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people, for there had he put them to elude the ſearch. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Body was cut down, it was conveighed to <hi>Magdalen</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
from whence it was carried to Burial in great Pomp, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with at leaſt 40. Mourners, whereof the <hi>Juſtice General's
Gentleman</hi> was one. Tis reported alſo that the Herſe-cloth was of
Velvet, but certain it is, it was more than ordinary brave.</p>
            <p>The Evening before his Execution, Information was brought
to the Provoſt, that the Women of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (I mean the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
part of them) had enter'd into a conſpiracy to reſcue
him between the Priſon and the Gallows; which obliged his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to provide extraordinary Guards, capable to prevent any
ſuch deſign. This Information was well grounded, if it were
not true, for there was never ſeen ſuch an appearance of that
Sex at any Execution, as was at his, where a Body of at leaſt
ſeven hundred Siſters ſtood together almoſt in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Eile.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49582:28"/>
The next Morning after his Execution there were ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of his Speech, and ſeveral Libellous Verſes put up in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places of the City, one Copy whereof made by ſome Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Poetaſter, and fixed upon the great Croſs, I here ſend you,
with an Anſwer in another Column, which was made about
two or three days after, by a better Poet, and better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled

            <p>YOu ſee the <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes take notice of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> as a place
above all others of this Kingdom, wherein Fanaticiſm moſt
abounds. This muſt needs awaken your curioſity to enquire from
what magnetiſm it is, that our Conventicle-preachers have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd
ſuch a ſtrong verticity to that point. Truly, the reaſon is the
ſame for which yours haunt <hi>London,</hi> and the moſt opulent Towns,
and Countys of <hi>England,</hi> even the Riches of the place; for where
the Silver is, there are the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> where the Carcaſe is, there are
theſe Vulturs gathered together. There's a neceſſity laid upon
them to Preach the Goſpel there; yea, woe unto them if they
Preach it not in <hi>Fife</hi> and the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where ſo many Rich Traders,
and Heritors live. But as for the <hi>Highlands,</hi> and other poorer
Countys, they have no Chriſtian compaſſion for them, but let them
live and dye in <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> becauſe their Souls are not
ſo precious for want of Silver and Gold. I remember when I
was at <hi>London</hi> in 76. I heard a famous Conventicle-miniſter ſay,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49582:30"/>
That if it were not for the Non-conforming-miniſters, thouſands
of Souls in that populous City would ſtarve for want of the
Word. I very much wondered to hear him ſay ſo; conſidering
how many hundred Sermons were Preached every week by the
Orthodox Miniſters, and the beſt I thought, that ever I had heard.
But being the next day in ſome Company, which was diſcourſing
about Conventicles, one or two of them began to tell of the
great ſtore of Mony the Conventicle-preachers had in the <hi>Banks,</hi>
and how ſome of them kept their Coaches, and he believ'd it would
not be long er'e their Wives kept their Chairs. Then I began to
underſtand the reaſon of the great care thoſe Gentlemen had to feed
the Souls of the good Citizens; and was very glad that to keep a
Coach was no longer a ſign of <hi>Prelatical Pride.</hi> When I return'd
home, I told our <hi>Whigs,</hi> that the Non-conformiſt-miniſters of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
began to keep Coaches, but the greateſt part of them would
not believe me; and thoſe that did, ſaid with ſighs, they were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that there were <hi>Diotrepheſes</hi> among them, that loved the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
and that God would have a controverſie with them for
their <hi>Prelatical Pride.</hi> The like I have ſeen in a Preface
to a Presbyterian Treatiſe of Divinity, Printed about that
time, wherein the anonymous Author (whoſe name I have been
told) complains of the <hi>Prelatical Spirit,</hi> that began to ſhew it
ſelf among the Non-conforming-miniſters; whereof ſome living
in great Plenty, and State, contemned others who were poor, and
whoſe lot was fallen in places, where Perſecution did abound.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> which you will call the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſes, you ſee
the Poet upbraids their Baptiſmal Vow with the Covenant; not,
as I conceive, upon the common account, as another Poet may do,
but becauſe 'tis the frequent practiſe of our <hi>Whig-preachers</hi> to
Baptize the Children of their Diſciples into the <hi>Solemn League
and Covenant,</hi> as well as into the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> He alſo
takes notice of the intimate Familiarity betwixt Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> and
Major <hi>Weir;</hi> and unleſs you will be at the pains to read the life of
the latter, as well as the former, you'l never be able to underſtand
the Satyr, nor know whether the Satyriſts indignation be juſt, or
unjuſt. He promiſe you beforehand, That the Narrative ſhall
affect you both with Wonder, and Indignation; though for the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49582:31"/>
honour of our Nature, and Religion, I wiſh no ſuch ſtories were
extant in the World. Nay confident I am, that when you have
conſider'd it in all the circumſtances that attend it, you will
ſay, that he who is the ſubject thereof, was one of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
ſinners that ever was extant of humane race. For there's
nothing in Hiſtory comparable to him, nor I hope will ever
be; and had not our bleſſed Saviour told us, that Men may be
ſo wicked, as to ſin beyond forgiveneſs, I could ſcarce have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that any Man, much leſs a Chriſtian, could have
committed uncleanneſs in all ſpecieſes, with Women, Devils, and
Beaſts.</p>
            <p>But ſuch a Monſter was this <hi>Phariſee,</hi> of whom I am going to
give you an account; which is partly taken out of the publick
Regiſter of our criminal Court, and where that cannot relieve
me, from common fame, the notoreity of the things related, or
the Authority of Perſons of known Integrity, and great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World.</p>
            <p>He was born, and bred in the Weſtern parts of this Kingdom;
which, as it appears from the preceeding Narrative, hath ever
been the moſt Fanatical part of our Country, and moſt diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the King, and the Church. There he was early pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
with the principles of Schiſm, and Rebellion, which he
ſhew'd upon all occaſions, particularly in the beginning of the
late Rebellion, wherein he was a forward ſtickler, and by his
extraordinary zeal for the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> raiſed himſelf to a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in ſome Troop, or Company, than Men of his mean O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
uſe to arrive unto here. About the Year 1649. he had
the great truſt of the Guards of this City committed unto him
under the quality of <hi>Major,</hi> and from that time, to the day of his
Infamous Death, was always called by the Name of <hi>Major Weir.</hi>
He behav'd himſelf in this Office with great cruelty, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
towards the Loyal party, being very active in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and apprehending the Cavaliers, and bringing them to be
arraign'd, and try'd for their Lives. He uſed to inſult and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over them in their miſeries, and perſecute them with all
manner of Sarcaſms and Reproaches, when they were led out
like Victims to publick Execution; as many yet alive can teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

to the World. In particular, the barbarous Villain treated
the Heroick Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> with all imaginable inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and inhumanity, when he lay in Priſon, making his very
calamities an Argument, that God, as well as Man, had forſaken
him, and calling him <hi>Dog, Atheiſt, Traytor, Apoſtate, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Wretch,</hi> and many more ſuch intollerable Names. This
cruel manner after which he uſed to outrage the poor Royaliſts,
paſs'd among the people for extraordinary zeal; and made them
conſider him as a ſingular Worthy whom God had raiſed up to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> He ſtudyed the Art of Diſſimulation, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
always affecting a formal gravity, and demureneſs in
his looks, and deportment; and employing a vaſt and tenacious
memory, which God had given him, in getting without Book
ſuch words, and phraſes of the Holy Scriptures, as might ſerve
beſt in all companies to make him paſs for an Holy and gifted
Man. He had acquir'd a particular gracefulneſs in whining
and ſighing, above any of the ſacred Clan, and had learn'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
himſelf upon all ſerious occaſions in a far more raviſhing
accent than any of their Miniſters could attain unto. By theſe
and other Hypocritical Arts he had got ſuch a name for ſanctity,
and devotion, that happy was the Man with whom he would
converſe, and bleſſed was the Family in which he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to pray.</p>
            <p>For he pretended to pray only in the Families of ſuch as were
Saints of the higheſt Form; inſomuch, that the Brethren and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of theſe Precincts would ſhrive who ſhould have him to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
in their Houſes, and of thoſe that liv'd at a greater diſtance,
ſome would come forty or fifty miles to have the happineſs to hear
him pray. He had indeed, but by what aſſiſtance will be ſeen
hereafter, a wonderful fluency in extemporary Prayer, and what
through Enthuſiaſtical phraſes, and what through Extaſies, and
raptures, into which he would appear tranſported, he made the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
people preſume he was acted by the Spirit of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
praying, he uſed to exhort, and bleſs the Families in which
he prayed; but he never undertook to Preach in them, for fear
of invading the Miniſterial Province; which certainly would
have offended the <hi>Kirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49582:32"/>
After this manner, and in this mighty reputation he lived till
the Year 1670. which was the <hi>70th.</hi> year of his Age. When
like the Tyrant <hi>Tiberius,</hi> after ſo many Murthers, and ſorts of
unnatural Luſts, he was no longer able to endure the remorſe of
his awakened conſcience, but to eaſe the inquietudes of his guilty
mind, was forced to accuſe himſelf; which he firſt of all did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of his own party, and deſired them to bring him to
publick Juſtice to expiate for his abominable crimes. But they
conſidering what a confounding ſcandal, and diſhonour the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
of ſuch an eminent Profeſſor would reflect upon the
whole Sect, did with all poſſible care and induſtry ſtrive to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the Major's condition, which they did for ſeveral months;
till one of their own Miniſters, whom they eſteem'd more forward
than wiſe, revealed the ſecret to the Lord <hi>Abbotſhall,</hi> then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who judging humane Nature uncapable of
ſuch horrid crimes, as the Miniſter told him the Major had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
concluded he was fallen into a phrenzy, or high degree of
melancholy, and therefore courteouſly ſent ſome Phyſicians of
his own perſwaſion and acquaintance to viſit him, and Phyſick
him for his diſtempered Brain. But the Phyſicians returning to
the Provoſt, aſſured him, that the Major was in good health,
and that he was free of Hypocondriack Diſtempers, and had as
ſound intellectuals as ever he had had, and that they believed his
Diſtemper was only an exulcerated Conſcience, which could
not be eas'd till he was brought to condign puniſhment, as with
cryings, and roarings he deſir'd to be. Afterwards the Provoſt
for his further ſatisfaction ſent ſome Conventicle-Miniſters, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into his condition, and make a report thereof; who finding
it impoſſible to diſguiſe the matter, which now was Town-talk,
told his Lordſhip that the Major was not affected with melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but that the terrours of God which were upon his Soul,
urg'd him to confeſs, and accuſe himſelf. The Provoſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
began to conclude, that he had good grounds to take pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
notice of this affair; and therefore without further enquiry
ſent the guards of the City to ſeize upon the Major, and his Siſter,
who was involv'd in his confeſſions, and carry them both to the
publick Goal. There they were viſited by Perſons of all Sorts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49582:32"/>
and Qualities, Clergy-men, Lay-men, Phyſicians, Lawyers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
and Non-conforming Miniſters, who all flocked thither
to ſee this Monſter, and diſcourſe with him about his horrible
crimes.</p>
            <p>They had not been long in Priſon before they were brought to
Tryal, which was on the ninth day of <hi>April,</hi> in the aforeſaid
year, 1670. They were try'd before that Learned Civilian Mr.
<hi>William Murray,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Preſtoune</hi> Advocates, who were
made Judges by Commiſſion for that time. They were purſued
by his Majeſty's laſt Advocate, Sir <hi>John Nisbett,</hi> and the Jury
by which they were try'd, was <hi>Gideon Shaw,</hi> Stationer; <hi>James
Penderer,</hi> Vintner; <hi>James Thomſon,</hi> Felt-maker; <hi>Robert Brown,</hi>
Stationer; <hi>James Brown,</hi> Felt-maker; <hi>Robert Johnſton,</hi> Skinner;
<hi>John Clighorn,</hi> Merchant; with many more ſufficient Citizens
of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> moſt of which, together with the greater part of
the Witneſſes hereafter mentioned, are yet alive.</p>
            <p>The Court being ſet, the Majors Libel was read, the ſum of
which was contain'd in theſe four particulars. <hi>Primò,</hi> That he
entiſed and attempted to defile his <hi>German</hi> Siſter, <hi>Jane Weir,</hi> when
ſhe was but ten years old, or thereabout, and that he lay with her
when ſhe was ſixteen years old, while they both dwelt in Family
with their Father; and afterwards had frequent carnal dealing
with her in the Houſe of <hi>Wicket-Shaw</hi> in her younger years; and
laſtly, that after ſhe was 40. years old, he liv'd in a ſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
with her, in his houſe at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they dwelt
together many years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secundò,</hi> That he committed Inceſt with <hi>Margaret Bourden,</hi>
Daughter to <hi>Mein,</hi> his Deceaſed Wife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertiò,</hi> That he committed frequent Adulteries, during the
Life of his ſaid Wife, both with married, and unmarried Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and particularly with <hi>Beſſy Weems,</hi> his Servant Maid,
whom he kept in his Houſe for the ſpace of twenty years, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time he lay with her as familiarly as if ſhe had been
his Wife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quartò,</hi> That to his Fornications, Adulteries, and Inceſts, he
proceeded to add the unnatural Sin of Beaſtiality in lying with
Mares, and Cows; particularly in polluting himſelf with a Mare,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49582:33"/>
upon which he rode into the Weſt Country, near <hi>New Mills.</hi>
All which crimes particulariz'd in manner aforeſaid, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
judicially at the Bar.</p>
            <p>The ſum of <hi>Jane</hi> his Siſters Libel is reducible to theſe two
Heads. Firſt to the charge of Inceſt, which ſhe committed with
her Brother; and Secondly, to the charge of Sorcery, and
Witchcraft, but moſt eſpecially of conſulting Witches, Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers,
and Devils; and yet more particularly for keeping, and
converſing with a Familiar Spirit, while ſhe liv'd at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi>
which us'd to ſpin extraordinary quantities of Yarn for her, in a
ſhorter time than three or four Women could have done the
ſame. All which ſhe judicially confeſſed in the Face of the
Court.</p>
            <p>Then they proceeded to ſwear the Witneſſes, which the Lord
Advocate call'd for further probation againſt them both. Of
theſe <hi>John Oliphant, Wiliam Johnſton,</hi> and <hi>Archibald Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Bailies, <hi>i. e.</hi> Aldermen of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> depon'd, that on the
Monday preceding the Majors Arraignment, he did freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
and declare unto them, that he had committed frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts
with his Siſter <hi>Jane;</hi> divers Fornications, and Adulteries
with other Perſons; and Beaſtiality with a Mare, and a Cow. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>John Sinclar,</hi> a Conventicle-Miniſter depon'd, that the day
before his Tryal he freely confeſſed unto him, that he was guilty
of Adultery, Inceſt, and Beſtiality, and that his Siſter had often
been taken out of Bed from him: whereupn asking him if he
had ever ſeen the Devil, he anſwered, that he had felt him in
the dark. But as to his converſation with the Devil, the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
might have declared more; for he had confeſſed to him and
many others, particularly to the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> then
Miniſter of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that he had lain with the Devil in the ſhape
of a beautiful Woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret Weir,</hi> Wife to <hi>Alexander Weir,</hi> Bookſeller in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
teſtify'd, that when ſhe was of the Age of 27. years, or
thereabouts, ſhe found the Major her Brother, and her Siſter
<hi>Jane,</hi> lying together in the Barn at <hi>Wicket-Shaw,</hi> and that they
were both naked in the bed together, and that ſhe was above him,
and that the Bed did ſhake, and that ſhe heard ſome ſcandalous
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49582:33"/>
Language between them in particular, that her Siſter ſaid, ſhe
was confident ſhe ſhould prove with Child. Furthermore, ſhe
Deponed that <hi>Catherine Cooper</hi> a Servant of the Majors, told her,
that he had layn with <hi>Margaret Bourdon</hi> his Wives Daughter, ſo
that ſhe would ſtay no longer in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne</hi> Wife to <hi>James Simpſon,</hi> Book-binder in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That on <hi>Monday</hi> preceding, and that day in the morning,
that he confeſſed to her he had committed Inceſt with his Siſter
<hi>Jane,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Bourdon</hi> his Wives Daughter; as likewiſe
beſtiality with a Mare in the <hi>Weſt</hi> Country, and that he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
converſed with his Maid-ſervant <hi>Beſſy Weems</hi> for two and
twenty years.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Archibald Nisbett,</hi> Writer to the Signet, declared, That in
the year 51 or 52. it was reported in the Country, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
had committed Beſtiality with a Mare near <hi>New Mills,</hi> and
that he heard it reported the ſame day, in which it was ſaid he did
the Fact. Mr. <hi>John Alexander</hi> of <hi>Leith</hi> deponed the ſame, and
ſaid he was then but half a mile from the place. After theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
the Major being examined about his act of Beſtiality;
declared, That a Gentleman having given him a Mare, he rode
upon her into the <hi>Weſt</hi> Country to ſee ſome Friends, and dealt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
with her near <hi>New Mills,</hi> and that a Woman ſaw him in the
Act, and complained of him to Mr. <hi>John Nave</hi> the Miniſter of
<hi>New Mills;</hi> at whoſe inſtance he was brought back to the place by
ſome Soldiers, but was there diſmiſſed for want of further probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And further being asked about the time, he anſwered, That
to the beſt of his remembrance it was when the Lords, Gentlemen,
and Heritors were taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Elliot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for probation againſt <hi>Jane Weir,</hi> the Lord Advocate inſiſted
on her own Declaration, and all the Depoſitions, in which as a
party ſhe was involv'd. And being asked if ſhe knew any thing
concerning the Correſpondence that was ſaid to be betwixt the
Devil, and her Brother; ſhe declared, that ſhe had a long time
been jealous of it, but was not certain; and that ſix or ſeven years
before ſhe had found a mark upon his ſhoulder, like that which is
called the Devils mark, at which ſhe was ſore afraid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49582:34"/>
The Proceſs being thus ended, the Jury did unanimouſly find
the Major guilty of Inceſt with his Siſter, and Beſtiality with a
Mare, and a Cow, and found him guilty of Adultery, and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by a plurality of Votes. They alſo unanimouſly brought
in <hi>Jane</hi> guilty of Inceſt with her Brother; whereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Judges Sentenced him to be ſtrangled at a Stake betwixt
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> following, the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Body to be burnt to Aſhes; and condemned her to be hanged
on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following in the <hi>Graſs-market</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far have I given you a <hi>juridical</hi> Account of the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
crimes of this Hypocritical Monſtrous Man; I now proceed
to acquaint you with other particulars, no leſs ſurprizing than the
former; which upon ſtrict enquiry I have reaſon to believe to be
as true, as thoſe that are judicially prov'd.</p>
            <p>When they were ſeized, ſhe deſired the Guards to keep him
from laying hold on a certain Staff, which, ſhe ſaid, if he chanc'd
to get into his hand, he would certainly drive them all out of doors,
notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance they could make. This Magical
Staff was all of one piece, with a crooked head of Thorn-wood,
ſhe ſaid he received it of the Devil, and did many wonderful things
with it; particularly that he uſed to lean upon it in his Hypocritical
prayers, and after they were committed, ſhe ſtill deſired it might
be kept from him; becauſe if he were once Maſter of it again,
he would certainly grow obdurate, and retract the Confeſſions
which he had ſo publickly made. <hi>Apollonius Thyaneus</hi> had ſuch
a Magical Staff as this, which I believe was a Sacramental Symbol
which the Devil gave to the Major, and the Court had ſome ſuch
apprehenſions of it, for it was ordered by the Judges to be burnt
with his Body.</p>
            <p>She alſo confeſſed in Priſon, that ſhe and her Brother had made
a compact with the Devil; and that on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1648.
they were both Tranſported from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to <hi>Muſſelborough,</hi>
and back again, in a Coach and ſix Horſes, which ſeemed all of
fire, and that the Devil then told the Major of the defeat of our
Army at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> which he confidently reported in
moſt of its circumſtances ſeveral days before the news had arrived
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49582:34"/>
here. This Prediction did much increaſe the high opinion the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
began to have of him, and ſerved him to make them believe, that
like <hi>Moſes,</hi> he had been with God in the <hi>Mount,</hi> and had a Spirit of
Prophecy, as well as of Prayer. But as for her ſelf, ſhe ſaid, ſhe
never received any other benefit by her Commerce with the Devil,
than a conſtant ſupply of an extraordinary quantity of yarn,
which ſhe was ſure (ſhe ſaid) to find ready for her upon the Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
what ever buſineſs ſhe had been about.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Beſtialities which the Major judicially acknowledged
he had committed with the Mare, and Cow, he confeſſed he had
done the ſame Abominations with three Species more; and the
Woman that delated him for the Fact near <hi>New Mills,</hi> was by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lanerk</hi> whipped through the Town
by the hand of the Common Hangman, as a ſlanderer of ſuch
an eminent Holy man.</p>
            <p>The Fornications, and Adulteries which this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as
Buggerers are called by the Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi>)
Committed with the moſt Sanctimonious,<note place="margin">Can. 16.</note> and
Zealous Women of the Sect, are too numerous
to be related here. He had got himſelf the Priviledge, under a
pretence of Praying and Exhortation, to go to their Houſes, and
into their Bed-chambers when he pleaſed; and it was his practiſe to
viſit married Women at ſuch times eſpecially as their Husbands
were from home: One eſpecially, who lived in the Street called
the <hi>Weſt-bow</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he had ſeveral times ſollicited in her
Husbands abſence to gratifie his unclean deſires; till at laſt wearied
out with his importunity, ſhe told him how much ſhe abhorred
his deſign, and charged him never to come more to her Houſe.
Upon this he forbore to viſit her for ſome time, till one night,
when ſhe was undreſſed and ready to ſtep into Bed, the Major ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
appears ſtanding by her, at which ſhe was ſo extreemly
frighted, that ſhe fell into a ſwoun; ſhe had no ſooner recovered,
but the Major endeavored to comfort, and aſſure her, and confirm
her againſt that ſtrange ſurprize; and renewing his addreſſes, he
Tempted her with many Arguments, and filthy Speeches, and
Geſticulations, telling her he had taken that marvelous way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in private with her, on purpoſe to ſecure her Reputation;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49582:35"/>
that he would go out of her Houſe in a manner as inviſible as he
came in. But ſhe by this time having recovered her uſual courage
and ſtrength, puſhed him off with violence, and cry'd out for
help to her Maid, upon which he immediately diſappeared. The
Windows, and Doors were all cloſe ſhut; and I make little doubt,
but his Coachman to the fiery Coach conveighed him in and out
through the Chimney, or perhaps by the Door, which the curſed
Familiar might open and ſhut again, as well as the Angel of the
Lord did unlock, and lock the Priſon Door, wherein the Apoſtles
were put.</p>
            <p>As for the miſerable Woman, ſhe was never well after this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
manner of Addreſs, which the luſtful Satyr made unto her;
but immediately fell into a deep Melancholy, which ended in a
languiſhing Sickneſs, whereof not many weeks after ſhe died;
and when ſhe was upon her death Bed, ſhe declared this ſtrange
Story to many perſons yet alive, of great Integrity, Wiſdom, and
Fame.</p>
            <p>I have already told you what an active Rebel this Multiform
Sinner was; but I forgot to tell you, that he was an eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
of the <hi>Weſtern Remonſtrance,</hi> in the year. 1650. To theſe
principles he ſtuck as cloſe, as to the Devil himſelf; inſomuch, that
when the Government of our Church was reſtored, he avowedly
renounced the Communion of it, and endeavored to widen the
Schiſm to the utmoſt of his power. He could not ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to look upon an Orthodox Miniſter, but when he met any of
them in the Streets, he would pull his Hat over his eyes in a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
kind of indignation, and contempt.</p>
            <p>While he was in Priſon, he acknowledged his Hypocriſie, by
which he had deluded men, and mock'd God; declaring, that in all
his life he had never prayed to God in private, nor had any power to
ſpeak when he attempted to do it; although he had ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and charming utterance in his ſolemn Conventicle-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
He alſo confeſſed, that he never bow'd his knee to God at
his own, or other mens Prayers; which exactly agrees with his
Siſters Relation, of his leaning at his Prayers on his Magical Staff,
and none of his own party can remember that at any Devotion,
even when he ſeem'd moſt Rapturous, they ever ſaw him kneel.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49582:35"/>
Nay, furthermore, he confeſſed, which I cannot mention without
horror, that his fluency in Prayer, by which he raviſhed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
proceeded from the aſſiſtance of the Devil; who, he ſaid,
helped him to the words and phraſes in which he expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
This hath given ſeveral men ſeveral ways of Conjecture
how it could be done. Some who knew him better than I ever
had the unhappineſs to do, are of opinion that he was the Praying-Oracle
of the Devil, out of whom he perſonally ſpoke. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which they alledge for their conjecture is, that ſometimes the
ſound of his Voice, like the ſight of Spirits, had ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
in it, as if it had not been form'd by the Organs of
Speech.</p>
            <p>Others think it reaſonable to believe, That he ſaw all the
words, and expreſſions in his Prayer ſucceſſively written by the
Devil in the air. But upon enquiry, I find that he, like moſt of
the <hi>Extemporarians,</hi> commonly Prayed with his eyes, ſhut; which if
it be true, this Hypotheſis will never be able to ſolve thoſe Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the Air.</p>
            <p>Some again think, that the words and expreſſions of his Prayer
were repreſented by the Devil upon the Stage of his Fancy, after
the ſame manner, as when a man dreams he reads ſuch a Letter, or
Book. But he never was affected with any Conſternations,
Tremblings, or Abreptions of mind, which both in true, and falſe
Prophets were the conſtant effects of ſuch ſtrong and violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
as were required to exhibit ſuch unwonted repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Imagination: nor after his long Prayers were ended
were his natural ſtrength or Spirits exhauſted, as, if his Devotion
had been <hi>Viſionary,</hi> they muſt have been.</p>
            <p>Others therefore conſidering him as an Apoſtate from God, and
as a Vaſſal and Apoſtle of the Devil, think it very agreeable to
Divinity to aſſert, that he was immediately, but yet without much
violence, inſpired by the Devil, and helped by him both in the
Conception and utterance of his Prayers. This they conceive
the Evil Spirit might do, like an <hi>aſſiſtant form,</hi> by impregnating
his Fancy with Enthuſiaſtical conceptions, and thereby rendring
his Imagination very turgent, and ready to ſwell above its banks;
which being done by the immediate Operation of the <hi>Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49582:36"/>
the wretched <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> could not fail to burſt forth <hi>in flumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Orationis,</hi> or a full Torrent of Prayer; and likewiſe be affected
with ſuch moderate Raptures, as yet left him in a condition to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what he ſaid. Furthermore, to prevent all poſſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
they ſay, That if God ſuffered the Devil to counterfeit
Prophetical Viſions, or the true Spirit of Prophecy under the Law,
then they know no reaſon why it ſhould be thought inconſiſtent
with his goodneſs, or diſagreable to his infinite wiſdom, to permit
him under the Goſpel, to counterfeit Inſpiration, or the true Spirit
of Prayer. But for my own part, had not the Monſter himſelf
aſcribed his fluency in Devotion to the aſſiſtance of the Devil, I
ſhould have wholly aſcribed it to the vigour of his own Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Imagination, without any Foreign Force. For not only his
fluency in Prayer, but the moderate Raptures, and little extatic
fits, into which he was Tranſported, are explicable by the natural
power of unaſſiſted Imagination, as I could make it out by many
examples; and where a natural cauſe alone is ſufficient to account
for any effect, I am always ſparing to joyn with it a ſupernatural
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>All the while he was in Priſon, he lay under violent apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heavy Wrath of God, which put him into that which is
properly called Deſpair; a Deſpair which made him hate God, and
deſiſt from Duty to him, and with which the Damned Souls in
Hell are reaſonably ſuppoſed to be conſtantly affected. In this
ſence he was deſperate, and therefore would admit neither <hi>Church,</hi>
nor <hi>Conventicle-miniſters</hi> to pray for him, or diſcourſe with him
about the infinite mercy of God, and the poſſibility of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of his Sins. Much leſs could he endure to be exhorted
to repent, or be brought to entertain any thoughts of Repentance,
telling all the World, that he had ſinned himſelf beyond all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Repentance, and Pardon; that he was already damn'd,
that he was ſure his Condemnation to Eternal burnings was already
pronounced in Heaven, and that the united Prayers of all the
Saints in Heaven, and Earth would be vain, and inſignificant, if
they were offered to God in his behalf. So that when ſome chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Miniſters of the City, by name the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Galloway,</hi>
and preſent Dean of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> were reſolved to Pray before him
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49582:36"/>
for his Repentance, and Pardon, againſt his conſent, he was
with much difficulty withheld from interrupting of them in their
devotions, and the poſture he put himſelf in when they began to
pray, was to lye upon his Bed in a moſt ſtupid manner, with his
Mouth wide open; and when Prayers were ended, being ask'd
if he had heard them and attended to them, he told them, <hi>They
were very troubleſome, and cruel to him, and that he neither
heard their devotion, nor cared for it, nor could be the better for
all the Prayers that Men or Angels could offer up to Heaven
upon his account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was his Intereſt to believe there was no God; and therefore
to eaſe the torments of his mind, he attempted now and then to
comfort, and flatter up himſelf into this abſurd belief. For he
was ſometimes obſerv'd to ſpeak very doubtfully about his exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence;
in particular to ſay, that if it were not for the terrors
which he found tormenting him within, he ſhould ſcarce believe
there was a God.</p>
            <p>Being with great tenderneſs and compaſſion beſought by one
of the City-Miniſters, that he would not ſo reſolvedly deſtroy
himſelf, by deſpairing of God's Mercy, which upon Repentance
had been granted to Murtherers, Adulterers, Sodomiſts, Beſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
nay, to thoſe that had denyed Chriſt; he replyed in anger,
<hi>Trouble me no more with your beſeeching of me to Repent, for I
know my ſentence of damnation is already ſeal'd in Heaven; and
I feel my ſelf ſo hardned within, that if I might obtain Pardon
of God, and all the Glories of Heaven for a ſingle wiſh that I
had not committed the ſins, with the ſence whereof I am ſo torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet I could not prevail with my ſelf to make that ſingle wiſh.
And were your Soul in my Soul's ſtead, you would find your exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
impertinent, and troubleſome, for I find nothing within me
but blackneſs and darkneſs, Brimſtone, and burning to the bottom
of Hell.</hi> I have been told by very credible Perſons, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of this unclean Beaſt gave manifeſt tokens of its impurity, as
ſoon as it began to be heated by the Flames; and certain it is, that
after it was burnt, a report was preſently ſent from hence to the
Brethren in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> that the Malefactor, who was burnt for ſuch
execrable crimes, was not <hi>Major Weir,</hi> but another Perſon who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49582:37"/>
exactly reſembled him, and whom the wicked <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
had bribed to perſonate the Godly Major, (who was ſaid to
be gone with a contribution to the exiled Brethren in <hi>Holland</hi>)
and call himſelf by his name. This report was believed in the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> for ſeveral Months, till time diſcover'd that the Major was
no more.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Jane,</hi> this incarnate Devils Siſter, ſhe was very inſenſible
of her great ſins, and was ſo far from remorſe of conſcience for
them, and deſpairing of the mercy of God, as ſhe did, that ſhe
preſum'd too much upon it; placing a great deal of confidence in
her conſtant adherence to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which ſhe call'd in her
Brother <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s ſtyle, <hi>the Cauſe and Intereſt of Chriſt.</hi> She
confeſſed indeed, as he did, that her ſins deſerv'd a worſe death
than ſhe was condemn'd to dye; but ſhe never ſhewed her ſelf in
the leaſt concern'd for what might enſue after death. When ſhe
was upon the Ladder ſhe beſpoke the people in the following
words, <hi>I ſee a great croud of People come hither to day to behold
a poor old miſerable Creatures Death, but I trow there be few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, who are weeping and mourning for the broken Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi>
and having ſo ſpoken, ſhe threw her ſelf in greater haſt off
the Ladder, than a Perſon ſhould have done, who was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prepar'd for another World.</p>
            <p>I could tell you many more remarkable ſtories of our <hi>Fanatick
Zealots,</hi> that have been put to death for lying with Beaſts, and
other unnatural crimes. One not many years ſince was put to
death at <hi>Sterling,</hi> for committing uncleanneſs with five Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
among which there were four ſpecies of irrational Animals;
and immediately before his Execution, the unclean Wretch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
againſt the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and boaſted of his conſtant zeal for
the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and ſo without declaring any deteſtations of his
crimes, or deſiring the people to pray for him, went off with all
aſſurance into the other World. I ſhould not have related any
of theſe ſtories, with reflection on the Schiſmatical party, but
that nine parts in ten of the horrid ſins, ſuch as <hi>Witchcraft,
Beſtiality,</hi> and <hi>Inceſt,</hi> are found among them; which hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
a Proverbial Sarcaſm in our Language againſt them,
<hi>that the Whigs ga to Heaven a Gate of their own.</hi> This is no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49582:37"/>
Hyperbole, but a plain Hiſtorical Truth, which our Judges can
teſtifie, and which may be confirm'd by the Regiſters of our cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Courts.</p>
            <p>And then as for Adulteries, and Fornications, thoſe common
failings of theſe Phariſees; there are more of them committed,
and more Baſtards born within their Country, the <hi>Weſtern Holy-Land</hi>
than in all our Nation beſides. This is evident, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Pariſh-Regiſters, and the Regiſters of the Presbyterys
or Rural Deaneries of thoſe Shires, with the reſt of the Pariſh,
and Presbytery Regiſters in every Dioceſs of the Church. Not
very long ſince in a Pariſh within the Presbytery of <hi>Paſeley,</hi>
there were no fewer than 17. <hi>Whigs,</hi> who did publick Penance
for Fornications and Adulteries, at one time. The Pariſh is very
diſaffected; ſo that on that Lords-day, wherein this Herd of Goats
did ſtand in the Seat of Publick Repentance; there were but two
Regular Perſons, beſides the Miniſter and Precentor in the Church.
I know you are already wondering, that Fanatical Sinners will do
Penance in the <hi>Kirk,</hi> which is as ſerious, and ſolemn a piece of
Worſhip, as any belongs to the Service of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore to unriddle the <hi>Paradox</hi> unto you, be pleas'd to take
notice, That if any Fornicator, Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contumaciouſly
refuſe to ſubmit to Church-Cenſure, his Majeſty's Advocat is to
purſue him before the Supream Judicature, or Lords of the Seſſion;
who upon Evidence of his Contumacy, iſſue out Order for having
him declar'd the <hi>King's Rebel;</hi> that is to be ſolemnly denounc'd an
<hi>Out-Law,</hi> with the ſound of an Horn. After the Horning, (for
ſo we call the Denunciation) Letters of Caption, are direct againſt
him; ſo that if he be taken, he muſt be put in Priſon; and although
he be not, he forfeits his Perſonal, and the Annual Revenues of his
real Eſtate, and becomes altogether <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Theophilus</hi> the
<hi>Greek</hi> Civilian calls <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Minors,</hi> and all that are <hi>Civilly
dead.</hi> Hence an <hi>Out-law</hi> is almoſt in the ſame Condition with us,
as <hi>Deportatus in Inſulam,</hi> was among the <hi>Romans;</hi> he is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of all Civil Employments; he hath no <hi>Head</hi> in Law: He
can make no Will, or Teſtament of his own; nor receive any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by any other Man's. So that our <hi>Whigs,</hi> (like yours, who
will be Married by the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>) chooſe rather to mock
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49582:38"/>
God, and offend their tender Conſciences ſometimes, than forfeit
their Liberty, and Eſtates.</p>
            <p>I am very well ſatisfy'd in my own Conſcience that I have done
nothing againſt the ſtricteſt Rules of Chriſtian Charity, in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the impious Principles, and Practiſes of this Sect: I have
done it upon the ſame grounds and motives, that the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
publiſh'd the Wicked Lives and Opinions, of the more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<hi>Hereticks;</hi> particularly of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who were the
Archetype of our <hi>Whigs:</hi> And the Parallel in moſt Particulars runs
ſo exact between them, that I cannot abſtain from comparing them
together.</p>
            <p>Firſt then as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> were ſo call'd from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or Knowledg; falſly ſo call'd, and boaſted, that they were
the moſt Knowing; although they really were the moſt Ignorant
of the Chriſtian Religion of any Sect in the World: So our <hi>Whigs</hi>
ſtile themſelves the Knowing Chriſtians; and look upon us, who
adhere to the Church, but as ignorant, ſilly, formal People, that
underſtand not Goſpel Myſteries, but are ſpoil'd after the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, As the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> pretended to underſtand the
Scriptures better than all other <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and yet did moſt abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and blaſphemouſly interpret them, as <hi>Epiphan.</hi> hath ſhew'd in
many particulars: So our <hi>Whigs</hi> pretend to this gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, as their own
peculiar Talent; and yet interpret the Word of God as abſurdly,
to make it comply with their wicked Opinions; as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>
did to make it countenance theirs. Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s Papers are full
proof of this Charge, beſides the Books I mention'd before. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
As the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> ſpoke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or mighty high things of <hi>Simon
Magus,</hi> equalling him with God. So our <hi>Whigs</hi> ſpeak big-ſwelling
words, of <hi>Baal-berith,</hi> or the Solemn League and Covenant; to
which they ridiculouſly apply, whatſoever is ſaid of the Covenant
of Grace, which God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and of that Political
Covenant which he made with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and of the counterpart
of it; which the <hi>Jews,</hi> or any of their Kings made, and renew'd
with God; baptizing their Children into it, as into the Covenant
of the Goſpel, and making it the cauſe, and Intereſt and Truth
of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49582:38"/>
In the fourth place, As the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> pretended to be <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
and yet in many things comply'd with the wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them in raiſing Perſecution againſt the Church: ſo our
<hi>Whigs</hi> pretend to be the pureſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the World; and yet in
many things are real <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and now joyn moſt cordially with
them to overthrow both our and your Church; which the <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
acknowledg to be the ſtrongeſt Bulwarks againſt themſelves, that
are in the Proteſtant World.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> contumeliouſly uſed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Presbyters of the Primitive Church, hating them with
the Malice of <hi>Cain,</hi> and gain-ſaying them among the People after
the impudent manner of <hi>Corah,</hi> and oppoſing them, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and
<hi>Jambres,</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> ſo our <hi>Whigs</hi> treat our reverend
Clergy, with all imaginable contempt and barbarity; hating our
Biſhops with a mortal hatred, calling their Government an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
over God's Heritage; and rail at his Majeſty, and all other
Magiſtrates that ſupport them; binding and re-binding themſelves
by a ſolemn Oath, to extirpate the Apoſtolical Function, though
in doing of it they ſhould ſhed an Ocean of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Blood.</p>
            <p>To proceed, as the Gnoſticks were raging Waves of the Sea,
<hi>i.e.</hi> a fierce, tumultuous, and troubleſome people; ſo are the
Whigs; As they deſpiſed Dominions and ſpoke evil of Dignities,
ſo do the Whigs; as they were murmurerers and complainers, ſo are
the Whigs, who by their Principles can never be ſatisfied with any
conceſſions, nor obliged by any favours; but muſt murmur and
complain againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> as long as there's a King, and
Biſhops in the Land.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as the Gnoſticks ſcorn'd and deſpiſed the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Chriſtians, and ſeparated from them, calling them Carnal, but
themſelves Spiritual men; and yet were Senſualiſts, defilers of the
Fleſh, and like the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and <hi>Gomorrheans,</hi> given to unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Luſts: So our modern Phariſees ſcorn us, calling us Carnal,
or at the beſt, but moral men, and while they pretend to be Holier
than the People that adhere to the Church, they fall into all ſorts
of impurities to the great ſcandal of the Proteſtant name. I
could run the parallel in more particulars, but I remember I am
writing a Letter, wherein a man is not bound to exhauſt his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49582:39"/>
but rather to hint, than to write. And I need not ſuggeſt
unto you, that I am not ſo uncharitable, as to conclude every
individual among our Whigs in this comparative Character, for
doubtleſs, there are many well meaning people among them, but
you muſt underſtand me ſo, as our Saviour is to be underſtood,
where he deſcribes the general Hypocriſie of the Phariſees, among
whom notwithſtanding were many ſincere, and Pious men.</p>
            <p>In this ſence, it was that St. <hi>Paul</hi> charg'd the whole Nation of
the <hi>Cretians,</hi> with the Character of one of their Old Poets, That
they were Lyars, evils Beaſts, and ſlow Bellies; and for my own
part, I believe that among the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> themſelves, there were a
conſiderable number that liv'd free from thoſe portentous Sins,
with which St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> charges the Sect.</p>
            <p>I Am now drawing near the end of this tedious Hiſtorical Letter,
in which I hope I have made you ample amends for my ſix
moneths ſilence, for which you chid me again in your ſecond Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I received by this days Poſt. You alſo tell me in it
what Tragical Stories are reported at <hi>London,</hi> concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unhappineſs of this Kingdom, and the Tyrannical Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Affairs therein. In particular you ſay, tis reported by
ſome of our own Countrymen, that the Nation is enſlav'd, that
there is nothing among us but Plunderings, Burnings, Murders,
Raviſhing of Women, and all other ſorts of devaſtation, which
hath made conſiderable perſons fly the Country, particularly <hi>D. H.</hi>
who, I aſſure you came to Town from his own Houſe but three or
four days ago. You alſo tell me, there are reports of a ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence,
betwixt the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the Viſcount
of <hi>Granard</hi> on the <hi>Maritime</hi> borders, whoſe real deſign, they ſay
it is, to advance the Presbyterian intereſt, all that hath already been
done under his <hi>Graces</hi> conduct againſt them, being nothing but
for ſhew, and pretext. I need but deſire you to recollect, what I
have already written concerning the occaſion of our preſent
Diſorders, and the <hi>Faction,</hi> that ſupports the Schiſm to make you
Divine from what Original theſe lying Stories proceed, and for
what end they diſperſe them about the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49582:39"/>
I imagine by this time you are very weary, but though you be,
you muſt put your ſelf to the Penance, I always enjoyn you to read
my Letters once for the Authors ſake, as well as for your own.
You know I came to <hi>England</hi> the laſt time upon no other account,
but to learn the Language, and promiſed to keep correſpondence
with you upon this condition, that you would make remarks upon
my Letters, and faithfully Admoniſh me of all the <hi>Scoticiſms,</hi> or
all the Words, and Phraſes that are not current <hi>Engliſh</hi> therein.
I confeſs I have a great Veneration for our own
and the Northern <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, upon the
account of the<note n="a" place="margin">Preface to Mr. <hi>Liles</hi> Saxon Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
               <hi>Anglo-Saxon,</hi> to which they
are ſo nearly ally'd; but yet I think it prudence
to obſerve that rule in <hi>Macrobius Loquere cum praeſentibus verbis
praeteritis moribus vive.</hi> And therefore am as ambitious to write
modern <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as any <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> or <hi>Provencal</hi> can be to write the
modern <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may communicate this Letter to as many of your Friends
as you pleaſe; but you muſt take care to conceal my name, leaſt
if it be known, I paſs for an Enemy to <hi>the People of God;</hi> and
thereupon another <hi>Mitchel</hi> ſend me out of the World for a <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite</hi>
or <hi>Egyptian</hi> with a brace of Bullets, or a <hi>Durke.</hi> The
Narratives, I humbly conceive, are very profitable to be known:
one of them affords an excellent example of counterfeit zeal, and
the other of Hypocriſie, or <hi>Phariſaiſm;</hi> which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of things hath always been the moſt powerful Engine,
which the <hi>Corahs</hi> of all Ages, and Nations have uſed to draw the
multitude into Faction, and Schiſm. Beſides, the knowledge of
theſe things will move all good Chriſtians to pity the miſerable
condition of our Church, and to pray for her both to God, and
the King, and likewiſe undeceive all ingenuous Spirits, that have
had the unhappineſs to be miſguided by the falſe Informations
which our Fanaticks ſend to yours. There is a more ſtrict, and
Myſterious correſpondence betwixt them, than the preſent pains,
in which I write, will permit me to relate. But by that time I come
next to <hi>London,</hi> I ſhall be able to diſcover the <hi>Cabala</hi> unto you,
which I ſhall better talk in half an hour, than write in many days.
In the mean time let us love, honour, and remember one another
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49582:40"/>
with pleaſure and reſpect: let us pray for the improvement of our
Church, the preſervation of yours, and ſerve them both in our
ſeveral ſtations to the utmoſt of our power.</p>
            <p>I have no more to add, but to deſire you to remember that my
Style is <hi>Advocate, and not Counſeller at Law;</hi> there's almoſt none
here knows what that Title means; So that the Poſt-maſter kept
