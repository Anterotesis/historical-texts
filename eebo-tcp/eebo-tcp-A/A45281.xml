         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account
OF THE
Famous Prince GIOLO, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THis famous Prince that has been ſo often ſeen by the
curious with a great deal of admiration, though they
could behold nothing but his outſide; ſo taking
was the rarity and niceneſs of the figures printed on
his body: But it troubled ſome of the more ſenſible that for
want of an interpreter none could conſider him within, both
as to know from his own mouth the fortunes he had run
through, and what his ſentiments were of his preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from whence they might make a probable Gueſs, whether
he were really a Man of that Birth, which thoſe that were
new proprietors of his perſon gave out, or elſe ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſlave, who gain'd the Reputation of a Prince in his eaſy
Captivity for his maſters advantage: Some few weeks ſince
a Dutch Merchant that had reſided ſometime at the Dutch
factory, in the Iſle of <hi>Celebes,</hi> which is the next Iſland to the
Weſt of <hi>Gilolo,</hi> the place of the Nativity of this Prince,
happen'd to go with ſome other friends, and acquaintance of
his to ſee him, and had the good fortune to have a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the language of the <hi>Celebeans,</hi> which the Prince alſo
underſtood, having been Captive there ſome years before he
was Tranſported for <hi>England:</hi> This accident was not a little
ſatisfaction to a Gentleman of my acquaintance, who was
by chance to ſee him at the ſame time, and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward evening, and the laſt time he ſhould be ſhown that
night, my friend profer'd the Dutch Merchant, his friends
and thoſe that ſhowed the Prince, a Collation, that they
might make ſome enquiry into the truth of his ſtory; which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59279:3"/>
motion being accepted by all parties, the reſt of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
being now gone, and having a Room to themſelves, they
proceeded to ask him ſome queſtions: So ſoon as the Prince
perceiv'd one that he could underſtand, he ſeem'd a little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
for a while, but then preſently ſomething Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſighed very much; which the Dutch Merchant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into; He returned him this anſwer: <q>I was I confeſs
ſomething pleas'd after ſo long a Conſinement of my mind,
as well as perſon, to meet with one that underſtood me;
but when I thought to unboſome my thoughts and griefs to
you, I reflected it was but a fruitleſs happineſs to diſcover
that to one that had not the will to hear me for any thing,
but the Satisfaction of his own Curioſity, without any deſire
for my redreſs: Which ſtopt the Current of what I had
to ſay, and added to my former griefs, that though I had
now ſound one that underſtood me, yet I could not to
any purpoſe diſcover my ſecret ſorrows to him with any
hopes of Relief, and for a wiſe man to do an unprofitable
action, levels him to the Capacity of Women that little
conſider the conſequence of their Words or Actions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had ſaid this he held his Tongue, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeveral times, with a great deal of Ardour; and before
the Merchant had interpreted this to the company he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him, and ask'd what part of his World he had been
in, that he ſpoke the language of his Enemies the <hi>Celebeans,</hi>
and how long he had been from thence? He anſwered him,
near five years. Ah then return'd the Prince, you can't tell
me any thing of my unhappy Princeſs of <hi>Tominec,</hi> nor how
ſhe bears the loſs of her wretched <hi>Giolo?</hi> The Dutch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
having not that tender ſympathy for the misfortunes
of a lover, as this diſcover'd the Prince to be, had much ado to
forbear laughing aloud, but fearing that might hinder him
from what he deſir'd, he check'd his unreaſonable mirth,
and told him he had never been at <hi>Tominec,</hi> having reſided all
his time in <hi>Gioan</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of the Iſland, whereas
<hi>Tominec</hi> was on the Eaſt, which is now call'd <hi>Sion</hi> ſince the King
of that part was a Chriſtian; but was ſorry he could not give
him ſome information about that he ask'd. As ſoon as he had
given the Company an account of this, my friend deſir'd him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59279:3"/>
to aſſure him he would take care to ſend to the Dutch Factory
on that Iſland, to make an enquiry about it to his ſatisfaction,
on condition he would gratify the Company by him, with
the Relation of his Birth, and Fortunes, and the Religion,
and Manners of his Native Country.</p>
            <p>Though it be no comfort to me to refreſh my Memory with
the thoughts of what I was (reply'd the Prince) which I ought
rather for my own ſatisfaction to endeavour to forget in my
preſent Circumſtances, yet in hopes of ſo great a reward as
to hear from my Adorable Princeſs, I will make all my wounds
bleed afreſh, nay and my heart too, if that would ſatisfy
you.</p>
            <p>The Place of my Nativity, you muſt know then, was

much reſembles your Engliſh Mutton. We have a Tree too of
great uſe and beauty, which affords us Bread and Drink; for

that brought us to the Knowledge of one God, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
tho an innovation in our Belief and Cuſtom, bore ſo
much of Reaſon, that it eaſily gain'd admittance with the

how inconvenient it would be in Heaven to have many
commanders, ſince our own Iſle had ſuffer'd ſo much under
Civil diviſions by having more than one (and at that time it
had a great many) from this new Prophet we have this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Creation of the World (which we knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of before) that God proceeding from himſelf, for his
own ſatisfaction and Glory, Created certain Spirits call'd
Angels, in number thirty three; their names were, 1 <hi>Bhamun,</hi>
2 <hi>Aeudibeheſt, 3 Sheherever, 4 Asfendemud, 5 Khordaad, 6 Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daad,</hi>

being <hi>Bhamun,</hi> to him is delivered the charge of all living
Creatures, man excepted: The next to him in eſteem is <hi>Aeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibeheſt,</hi>
who has the charge of fire; to the third, all ſorts
of Metals are Committed; the fourth has the charge of the
earth, and ground; the fifth is Lord of all the Watry World

the preſerver of Trees.</p>
            <p>Man, and the charge of all mankind, God has reſerv'd for

the 10th has charge of the Sun, as the 11th has of the Moon;

has the charge to ſtand on a great bridge call'd <hi>Chawood
Pulſeraunt,</hi> over which the ſouls of all that dye are to paſs,
but when they came there this Angel ſtops them, and calls
them to an account for the Tranſactions of their lives, and
with a pair of ſcales in his hand weighs their good deeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their bad; if the good out-weigh the bad one hair of
of the Eye lid, he ſends them to Heaven, for 'tis hard that a
man ſhould be condemn'd to puniſhment, who in his life has
done more good than harm; but if their evil deeds be more
ponderous, he ſends them to Hell.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> having prepar'd this Army, 'twas time for God
to look about him: Whereas I have ſaid, he ſent the four
Angels to Fight him; who after a ſharp Battle took the great
<hi>Devil <hi>Aſemau</hi>
               </hi> priſoner, and brought him to Heaven, from
whence he broke priſon, and run away. Upon which another
ſharp War enſued, wherein the <hi>Devil</hi> was brought to terms
of extremity. He deſired Quarter, and yielded himſelf up to
the Mercy of the Conqueror. Upon which God conſidered
with himſelf, That if he ſhould utterly deſtroy the <hi>Devil,</hi> and
all his generation, his own Glory and Mercy would not ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear, as it would if he ſuffered the <hi>Devils</hi> darkneſs
and cruelty to have a being; elſe that there could be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59279:5"/>
between Good and Bad, Vice and Vertue. On theſe
conſiderations God did not utterly deſtroy the <hi>Devil,</hi> but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to have a being in the world, on this Account,
That whatſoever Good ſhould fall out, or be done in the
world, ſhould be attributed to God; and whatſoever Evil,
ſhould be charged on the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, as for the time of the continuance of the <hi>World,</hi> and
the <hi>Devil,</hi> we hold, that it was ordered by God, the World
from the firſt Creation, ſhould continue twelve thouſand Years;
three thouſand then being expired at the Conqueſt of the <hi>Devil</hi>
and his <hi>Angels;</hi> the remaining nine thouſand Years, God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three parts, and holding up three of his Fingers,
ordered the <hi>Devil</hi> to chooſe which he would. The meaning
was, what time he would chooſe to exerciſe his cruelty in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Mankind. The <hi>Devil,</hi> after a ſeeming pauſe, choſe
the middle finger of the Three, and conſequently the middle
Time. Wherefore, by the fatal neceſſity of this decree, all
humane affairs are ſubject to inconſtancy; nor can there be
any ſettled ſtate of things for any long duration. In the firſt
time, Juſtice, Moderation, Temperance and Piety to God; and
man flouriſhed, when the world enjoyed Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
From which, by the temptation of the <hi>Devil,</hi> through
Faſe, Peace, and Pride, falling and rebelling againſt God, the
<hi>Devil</hi> is permitted to infect and diſturb the world with Vices,
contrary to thoſe former Vertues; as Injuſtice, Violence, Pride,
Luſt, and Avarice: And all manner of Impieties, both to God
and Man, ſwell to the greateſt exorbitancies; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the effects thereof, Wars, Diſtractions, and the other
ſcourges of God, as Famine, Peſtilence, and Deſolation: Which
God, out of his infinite mercy and pity to Mankind, and the
World, will not ſuffer to rage for ever; but bridles the fury
and malicious envy of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and interpoſes a breathing
time of happineſs and tranquility. Of the twelve thouſand
Years firſt decreed for the duration of the World, nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſixty-two remain, when we expect a day of Judgement of
all Mankind, and the diſſolution of the World. And then as
ſoon as all the dead ſhall have riſen, and received their doom,
the Righteous ſhall immediately enjoy the Heavenly Viſion of
God, and be placed in glorious manſions, proportionable to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59279:6"/>
their good deeds and merits on earth; and the Wicked having
in their ſouls received condign puniſhment for their Sins, in
thoſe ſeveral torments which were appointed them by the
Angels <hi>Mehur,</hi> and <hi>Vumudſittur,</hi> ſhall at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alſo riſe, and their ſins, by the infinite mercy of God, be
pardoned, and themſelves be admitted into certain outward
manſions, where they ſhall at a diſtance, be bleſſed with the
Heavenly Viſion; only they ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from the
Juſt, by certain Spots, which ſhall be mark't in their Foreheads.
At the day of Judgement, the <hi>Devil</hi> and all his <hi>Angels,</hi> ſhall
be Judged, and their Kingdom utterly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The World was created in this order: The Heavens in forty
five dayes; The Water in ſixty; The Earth in ſeventy five;
The Trees in thirty; The Creatures in eighty; Man in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
five dayes. <hi>Yaxatend</hi> was the Name of our Prophet,
from whoſe death we begin our <hi>Aera,</hi> which is now 1052.
Years.</p>
            <p>We Believe alſo, That to do any Injury to another, is a
hainous crime, and not to be pardoned without an equivolent
Reparation; That Ingratitude out-weighs at <hi>Pul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all ones good Works; eſpecially if we preſevere in it
till our death. We Believe a private ſin againſt another more
hainous than a publick one; And that he that betrayes under
the name of a Friend, is certainly damn'd to the loweſt of
the ſeven Hells I have mentioned. For our duty to God, we
are not oblig'd to many Prayers; only that we make all our
Actions ſuch: Fine words are not likely to prevail with God,
when the actions contradict his pleaſure. Praiſes we are bound
to thrice every day, for the benefits of preſervation; The
paſt night for Food, and Preſervation the paſt day. Prieſts
we have but three in the Iſland, one to each Kingdom; who
is employ'd continually in Praiſing the God of Heaven and
Earth, without any regard to the goods of this Life; and
when any publick benefit accrues to the whole Kingdom, then
this Miniſter appears in a pompous and ſolemn manner, and
returns (in the preſence of the chief of the Nation) Thanks
as publick as the favour Receiv'd. As for other occaſions, we
are every one his own Prieſt: And our Parents are obliged
under pain of death, to inſtruct us in the Law of our Prophet;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59279:6"/>
ſo that when we appear before the Judges of the Country,
we may be able to give a full account of all its parts. We
are of Opinion, that as Ingratitude weighs heavier than an
abundance of good Works; ſo Generoſity, and the doing
good to thoſe in diſtreſs, will countervail all the ill Actions
of our Life, provided they be not injurious to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
in wronging them in their Eſtates, Poſſeſſions, and
Reputations. 'Tis an offence againſt our Laws, alſo (for
the ſame are the Laws of our Religion as of our State) for
any Parent for any intereſt whatever to force the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Children; that ſo as they have no other bond
but Love, the Husbands and Wives might continue together
during their Life with Pleaſure and Content, and beget
Children that ſhould inherit the Virtues and Beauties of
their Parents, who are led to Generation by the Dictates of
Love, not Duty. Diſſimulation in Love is accounted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardionable
fault, and which by our Laws is Puniſhable
when diſcovered, which after poſſeſſion cannot well be hid.
Parents are obliged to give Satisfaction for all the Crimes
their Children commit till they die; becauſe if they gave
them a ſevere and virtuous Education, they would not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſuch extravagances; and Maſters that are cruel to
their Servants, are obliged to be publick Slaves for a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
time, till they are better inſtructed in the chances
of Human Life. Servants that are refractory and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
are put to death, as are all Rebels without any Tryal;
every Man being free to deſtroy ſuch diſturbers of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have given you an account of the State, and my
Birth and Place of Nativity, and wiſh you cou'd diſpenſe
with a more particular account of my Life, becauſe it will
ſet before my eyes the remembrance of what I have been,
and render my preſent Captivity the more inſupportable.
The Merchant gave the Company a particular account of
all the Prince had ſaid, which my Friend took in Short-hand,
and then begged him to preſs <hi>Giolo</hi> to give them an account
of his Life and adventures, ſince by his unwillingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
them, made them ſuppoſe contain'd ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and ſurprizing. The Dutch-man, tho' not ſo deſirous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59279:7"/>
of hearing any more as the reſt, was yet prevailed upon to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the common ſatisfaction, which with ſome importunities
he obtained. And thus the Prince begun.</p>
            <p>I have already informed you, that the Iſle of <hi>Gilolo</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three parts, which were once three diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and that my Fathers Predeceſſors had ſubdued one of
the other two; in the third, that is called <hi>Batachina, Verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>had,</hi>
an Old Warlike Prince, that had loſt all his fourteen Sons
in the Wars and incurſions that had been made into his
Country by the Kings of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,</hi> who had formerly great
part of that Kingdom in their Poſſeſſions; but by the Proweſs
of this Prince were driven out, and after many attempts to
recover their ſooting there, finding it to no purpoſe, gave it
over; tho' in thoſe long Wars he had loſt his Sons, yet he
had two Daughters, one very Beautiful, whom in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his reſolution of caſting off the Forreign Yoak, was
Married to my Father, to joyn him to his intereſts, whoſe
power was ſufficient to obſtruct all his deſires of freedom:
She bore my ſelf, and another Brother, that I hope lives ſtill
to keep up the Honour of our Kingdom, and one Daughter
Beautiful as her ſelf had been, but not ſo ſweet and candid
a humour, being too much a lover of her ſelf, and revengeful,
not eaſily forgetting what ſhe thought an injury done to her
Father and my ſelf, as the ſequel of my Story will make
evident. By that time we were grown up to Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
eſtate, the King of <hi>Batachina,</hi> our Grandfather by my
Mother, had loſt all his Sons in the Wars I have mentioned,
who had left no Iſſue among them all but one Daughter;
ſo that in all probability that Kingdom would fall to my
Father in the right of his Wife, upon the Death of his
Father-in-Law <hi>Giolo</hi> (for that was his Name, and for his
ſake, had it conferr'd upon me) who was now very Old; and
his other Daughter died for grief of the loſs of ſo many of
her Brothers, whom ſhe tenderly loved. But the Old King
finding he had no Iſſue Male to ſucceed him (and unwilling
to have his Family and Name bury in another that was a
Stranger, only by the Marriage of his Daughter, which
Match he had not conſented to, had it not then been neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for his Intereſt ſo to have done) reſolved to Marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59279:7"/>
to ſee if he could get a Son of his own in his Old
Age to inherit his Name, and that Kingdom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by the loſs of ſo much of his own and Childrens
Blood from the hands of inſulting Forreigners. He Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
therefore a young Beautiful Lady of but a mean extraction,
for the Bed of a Prince; by her had none but Girls,
and thoſe of a very ſhort Life: Therefore finding Fate
had ſo Ordained it, that my Father ſhould infallibly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him in his Crown (his Grand daughter, and all being
now dead) he ſeat to have him remove to his City of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,
called <hi>Batachina,</hi> as the whole Kingdom was, that
he might in his Life-time make him acquainted with, and
eaſie to the People. The time of our departure being come,
my Brother was to be left <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of his Kingdoms, tho'
he included he alſo ſhould go with him at this time to pay
his reſpects to his Grand-father; but God ordered it for
his happineſs, that the day that we were to go, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ill, and obliged by that to ſtay behind; therefore my
Siſter and I were to accompany my Father and Mother by
Sea in a ſmall Veſſel, in which being invited by the calmneſs
of the Weather, he was reſolved to coaſt along the ſhore to
<hi>Batachina,</hi> ſecure of any danger in the midſt of ſo great an
attendance as went along with him in ſeveral other ſmall
Boats. But after the firſt dayes Journey, when it grew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Night, my Father commanded the Maſter of the
Veſſel to ſteer farther out to Sea, and ſo cut off a great
nook that bent in ſeveral Miles into the Land; and ſo before
it was very late hoped to reach the Cape where he intended
to go aſhore, and paſs ſome days till he had diſpatched ſome
Meſſengers before to the Court of <hi>Giolo,</hi> to inform him of
his coming; and if the Weather altered, deſigned to go
from thence by Land. But ſo it was, that the Heavens had
decreed my misfortune; and in that my Fathers, Mothers,
tho' not my Siſters. Night came farther on than the King my
Father imagined; and that which hapned, was the riſing of
the Clouds, and with them a Wind and Storm, which bore
our Veſſels out to Sea farther than we deſired, and by the
next Morning, after, with a great deal of pains and difficulty,
we had kept the Royal Veſſel above Water all Night, we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59279:8"/>
found our ſelves far from any ſhoar, and out of ſight of
any Land, all alone without any Boat near us to bring us
any relief, if we ſhould be attacqued by any Pyrate, which
happened ſoon after we began to fear it; for thoſe of the
Iſle of <hi>Celebes</hi> being great Pyrates, happened to have a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of theirs come in ſight of us, by the firſt approach of
day, whether driven that way by the force of the Storm,
or by their own uncertain rowings in ſearch of Prize, I know
not; but in ſhort, made up to us, and ſoon took us, and
with us ſail'd home to <hi>Tominec,</hi> of which City they were.
And being come thither, by the ornaments of our Fleſh they
perceived we were of the Royal Family, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
us to the King, who being a haughty proud Man, had
no regard to our Birth and Quality, but deſpiſing us in our
preſent misfortune, uſed us like Slaves; but he had caſt
an Eye of regard on my Siſter, whoſe Beauty indeed was
extraordinary, and daily ſolicited her to yield to his embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which with ſome little opportunities ſhe yielded to,
and was delivered from the troubles of a Captivity to live
a Queen, as ſhe was born a Princeſs. But now, neither Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nor Honour made her remember her Parents or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
preferring a little pet ſhe had taken againſt us, to all
the duties of a Child and Siſter; ſhe rather contributed to
our Miſery, than ſought us any relief, which ſoon broke the
heart of her Father and Mother, to whom I took care with
my own hands to give a Decent, tho' not Royal Burial.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to tell you the misfortunes of my Love,
it would be ſome eaſe to me to breath a little, and to give you
ſome account of the place of my Captivity, where I was not
confin'd, as I am here from ſight of the Country.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59279:8"/>
rich, the Soil thereof exceeding fertile, the People tall and
comely, of a curious Ruddy Colour much given to Piracy.
The whole Iſland is Governed by many Kings, and with as
many Gods, which is the cauſe of much Contention, and
many Quarrels. The People of the Kingdom of <hi>Tominec</hi>
have very little notion of a Deity, ſo that you will find no
tract of Religion among them, Sacrifices and Prayers they
know not. They ſay the Earth is their Indulgent Mother,
who furniſhes them with all things neceſſary for Life, yet they
are not contented with that, but ſeek the increaſe of their
Wealth, as Slaves by Piracy. If any one diſcourſe to them
about a God and the Myſteries of Religion; they anſwer, as
if they thought it a Jeſt, <hi>Friend thou art very eloquent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
I wiſh I could talk as well as thee: Nay, they ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that if they ſhould be perſwaded by ſuch Diſcourſes,
their Neighbours would laugh at them; yet for all this, they
have a Natural ſentiment of ſome Divinity or Superior Power
that hath its reſidence in Heaven, which they ſay is content
to enjoy quietly the delights of his own Felicity, without being
offended at the ill actions of Men, and is endued with ſo
great goodneſs, as not to take any Revenge even of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which makes them render Heaven neither Honour nor
Adoration; interpreting its literality, and long ſufferings as an
effect of its weakneſs or indifference towards Mankind; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that there are a number of good and evil Spirits; the
good being their Gods, and every one imagines, that he has
one deſigned for his conduct, yet will not acknowledg them
the Creators of the World; and when I have told them,
that I adore that God which made Heaven and Earth, and
cauſeth the Earth to bring forth Fruits and Herbs for our
Nouriſhment, and binds the Divel from doing us too much
harm, they will only laugh at me for my pains. When they
recover from any Diſeaſe, they ſet a little Table, and upon
one end of it their Offerings, but without the leaſt Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Prayers; yet ſometimes they invocate their Gods;
but by proxy, that is by their Prieſts, and that upon four
occaſions; to demand Revenge; to be healed of Diſeaſes;
to know the event of their Warrs; and to invocate them
to drive away their great Devil, for they never Pray to him:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59279:9"/>
His Invocation is by ſinging ſome Words, and burning ſome
herbs, the ſcent of which is ſo pleaſant, that it makes this
Devil appear: And as their ſeveral Prieſts invocate their
ſeveral Gods at one time, theſe Gods or rather Devils, rail,
quarrel, and ſeem to ſight with each other. Theſe Devils
ſuffer themſelves ſometimes to ſee bones of dead men taken
out of the Graves, and wrapt in Cotton, and thereby give O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
ſaying 'tis the Soul of the deceaſed Perſon; they make
uſe of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerer wrapping
up theſe bones, with ſomething that belongs to the Enemy.
Theſe Devils do ſometimes too enter into the bodies of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ſpeak by them, clearly anſwering all Queſtions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
After the Boy or Prieſt is retired, the Devil ſtirs
the Veſſels, and makes a Noiſe with his Jaws, as if he were
eating and drinking the preſents prepared for him; but the
next day they find he has not meddled with any thing:
Theſe poor Wretches complain, that ſometimes the Devil
beats them, and ſhew on their bodies the viſible marks of
the blows they have received; ſometimes they make horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Complaints of his Cruelty.</p>
            <p>You muſt not expect any great Morals from them that have
ſo ill a Guide as the Devil. Rapine, Injuſtice, and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
are the Ingredients that compoſe them: The Nobler ſort
of Women are very beautiful, particularly the Princeſs of
<hi>Terhenahete</hi> Siſter to the King of <hi>Tominec,</hi> whoſe Slave it was
my fortune to be, not only by the will of that King, who
preſented me to her, but alſo by Love, which had added a
great deal to my Captivity. I know not how it came to paſs,
but this lovely Princeſs, after I had ſerved her ſome time,
begun to ſhew me a more favourable aſpect than uſually, and
would often make me tell the Adventures of my Life, and
the unlucky Accident of my Fathers Royal Voyage, which
he ſeem'd, as I did my ſelf, both to pity and rejoyce at; the
more ſhe admitted me to her Converſe, the more I was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
of her Perfections, and forgetting the condition For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had now reduc'd me to, thought I might have the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to diſcover my Paſſion to her; which being over-heard
by one of my Fellow Slaves, was immediately carry'd to the
King, who finding his Siſters Inclinations not much averſe to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59279:9"/>
me, ſtorm'd not a little, and immediately caus'd her to be
remov'd into the Country to a ſolitary Caſtle of his, and
order'd none but Women to be about her: He ſeparated me
from her, and diſpos'd of me to a Favourite of his, who us'd
me with all the ſeverity imaginable, which made me reſolve
to venture at my Eſcape, at leaſt into the Neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where, if I gain'd not my Liberty, I was in hopes I
ſhould much lighten my Captivity: I furniſh'd my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with what Weapons I could get, and when I found an
Opportunity, I got a ſmall Boat, and put to Sea, which by the
Morning drove my Boat upon a Rock, and broke it all to
pieces near the ſhoar, whither with my Arms I ſwam; and
coming to Land, I found my ſelf on a great large Heath or
Wilderneſs, on which I travell'd as Chance directed me, till
I began now to be faint for want of Food, and Night apace
coming on, but no ſight of any houſe to ſhelter my ſelf in,
till it now being dusky, I ſpy'd to the Eaſt a ſmall Cottage,
whither I made with all my Force, leſt I ſhould loſe it by the
haſtning darkneſs: But the ſpeed of the Night was nimbler
than mine; however, by the great earneſtneſs, with which
I made toward this Cottage, I had imprinted in my mind the
place of its ſcituation ſo ſure, that guided by that, or Chance,
or ſome Diviner Power, I at laſt came to it, and from one of
the Loop-holes ſpying a ſmall Light, I thought it convenient
to peep in firſt, and ſee if with ſafety I might venture in, or
whether it were the by-retreat of ſome Robbers: But the
Object that preſented it ſelf to my eyes, did not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
me, when I ſaw my beautiful Princeſs in danger, and
ſtruggling with the mighty Onſets of a bold Raviſher, whilſt
an old Hagg ſat hard by without bringing her any Relief:
I ſtaid no longer to conſider, but immediately burſt into the
place with my Weapon in my hand; they expecting no ſuch
bold Intruſion, had not faſtned the door, and were not a
little ſurpriz'd to find their deſigns prevented: I gave the
Villain no time of Conſideration, but ſtuck him to the heart,
and made him fall at the feet of my beloved <hi>Terhenahete,</hi> with
his Life to attone for his ſacrilegious intentions. I had no ſooner
diſpatched him, but I found another Enemy call'd in by the
old Hagg I mention'd, who made at me with a long Fork
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59279:10"/>
he us'd about his Employments, but leaping on one ſide, he
run it into the Wall with ſuch a force, that it ſtuck there
beyond his power to pull it out if he attempted it; at the ſame
time I wounded him, but not effectually enough to deprive him
of doing us any further Miſchief; for quickly diſengaging
himſelf, he run to the Window, under which lay an Ax, with
which he us'd to fell Wood in the Forreſt; and at the ſame
time the old limping Hagg had got another ſmall Hatchet,
and with it was making toward my adoreable Fair One; here
diſtracted betwixt both, I knew not which to prevent, till
ſoon perceiving the danger nearer her, (the other now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſtagger, and come on but ſlowly with his new acquir'd
Weapon) I with all my force ſtruck at her Legs, unwilling to
kill a Woman, in any ſhape; ſo that I cut off one of her Legs
with the vehemence of the Blow, which made her tumble
down, curſing both me and the gods too; and I over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſelf, with that Ardour (my Foot hitching in the
Cloaths of the Villain I had ſlain) fell down too; before I
could get up, the other Rogue was come to me, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Axe, with all the force he had, let it fall; but by
good luck, I had ſo much time as to clap my Sword betwixt
it and my Body, ſo obliquely, that it carryed his ſtroak from
me to the old Hagg, and ſlit her Wind-pipe, piercing part of
my ſhoulder as far as the Bone; before he could recover his
blow, I was got upon my knees, and thruſt him into the heart,
as he was going to lift up his Arms to mend his Errour; but
death ſeiz'd him before he could effect it.</p>
            <p>Thus having delivered my fair Princeſs from an odious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
fate, I was going to offer her my farther ſervice to
wait on her that night, and from thence conduct her to what
place ſhe pleaſed: But I ſaw that which did not a little daſh my
ſatisfaction for my Victory; for ſhe lay ſtretcht out upon the
floor as if dead: I ſtaid not long contemplating, but with all the
haſt imaginable ran to her, and catch'd her up into my arms,
and with a thouſand ſoft ſayings preſſed her to my boſom, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then one gentle kiſs from her dear lips; when at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
I found ſhe began to revive, I bended her a little forward,
and ſo at laſt ſhe came perfectly to her ſelf. I queſtion'd her
if ſhe had received any hurt during the encounter, that had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59279:10"/>
cauſed this Swound I found her in? She anſwered, not that ſhe
knew; but that ſeeing me down, and the Villains Ax juſt ready
to fall on me, ſhe fainted away, as giving both her ſelf and me
too for gone. Having removed her from this place, I took the
bodies of the dead, and carryed them out of the houſe, that ſo
unpleaſant a ſight ſhould not offend her; which when I had
done, I return'd into the Cottage to my Princeſs; I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to find my ſelf ſomething faint, for I had bled all that time;
ſo I begg'd her to lend me ſomething to bind my Wound cloſe,
the piece not being cut off from the reſt; but ſhe obſerving me
very pale, made me ſit down, and with her fair hand bound it
up: And I remember I felt ſome drops fall on my ſhoulder, as
ſhe was doing it, which I perceived were Tears ſhed from her
dear precious Eyes: which I obſerving, <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>Let
not your being alone with me trouble you, for I have not deliver'd
you from theſe Villains, to offer any injury to you my ſelf: No, the
Heavenly powers forbid I ſhould give way to the leaſt diſhonourable
thought in ſo ſacred a concern as my Love. No Madam, my paſſion
for you is above being brib'd by its Violence, and deſpair to attempt
its ſatisfaction against your will; I aſpire to the Name of your
Husband, and not to the Infamy of your Raviſher: which ſince I
find I ſhall not be ſo happy as to obtain, I am now in my way
from this unlucky Country, to ſome remote place, where the name
of</hi> Giolo <hi>is more a ſtranger, there to wear out my Life in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſighs for my unhappy Fate that gave me ſo much love, and
ſo little power to make it ſucceſsful. And I will now ask no other
favour of you, than what I am ſure you may and will grant, and
that is, That you permit me to guard you here this Night, and
conduct you to your Abode to morrow, where having ſeen you
ſafe, I'll only beg ſomething that belongs to you, to keep that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time that fleeting Life remains, which I am ſenſible will not
be long, ſince that which ſhould nouriſh it, is denyed me: And that
is, your Smiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giolo, (return'd ſhe and ſigh'd</hi>) I did little think I ſhould
ever have been thus much oblig'd to you, or that I ſhould ever have
had cauſe to think I could uſe you too ſeverely for pretending Love
to me; but ſince the juſt Gods have ſo order'd it, that I muſt
owe my Life, and what is dearer to me, my Honour, to you, let
me intreat you not to deſert this Country for my ſake; for tho'
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59279:11"/>
I muſt own, that I have hitherto had a great averſion to any thoughts
of Love, yet rather than be guilty of ſo great an Ingratitude, as
to make him a wandring unhappy wretch, that has ſerv'd me with
this hazard of his Life, I will promiſe you thus much, that I will
no more fly you, but give you all the Opportunity to win my heart
that you can deſire; for I confeſs you deſerve it, though I cannot
yet prevail with my ſelf to give it you; and if I can at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with you, let me conjure you not to leave <hi>Tominec</hi> without
me. I would contribute to your Liberty, but I think the ſafeſt
way is to follow my Advice: I have an Vnckle retir'd from
Court, that loves me well, and much reſented your hard uſage, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will go, and there provide for our further Eſcape, whoſe
abode is ſomething more ſecure than that where I have been ſent
by my Brother; for the Opportunity of this neighbouring Deſart to
that, gave riſe to theun happy Adventures of yeſterday; for on the
farther end of this Forreſt, near ten miles, as well as I can gueſs,
from hence, is the Caſtle whither my Brother ſent me from your
Addreſſes.</p>
            <p>You may better imagine, than I declare in Words, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports
that ſeiz'd me, at theſe unexpected Words of Comfort,
which rais'd me from the depth of deſpair, to the height of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
happineſs, and made me for the preſent loſe all thoughts
of a farther Eſcape: 'Twould be too much to tell you all the
paſſionate Vows and Proteſtations I made to her that Night,
which as long as ſhe was able to watch, was ſpent in Addreſſes
of that nature, without giving my ſelf leiſure to ask her what
brought her into theſe unlucky Circumſtances I found her in:
At laſt, overcome with ſleep, I ſaw her ſhut her eyes, and ſo I
drew nearer, and plac'd my ſelf cloſe to her, and gently laid
her head into my lap, and ſoon after fell my ſelf into a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
in which I had this pleaſant dream: Methought the King
of <hi>Tominec,</hi> and my Siſter, conſented to our Marriage; which
done, they withdrew and left me alone with her, and methought
with a modeſt down look, ſhe preſs'd my hand, and ſaid, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
my dear <hi>Giolo,</hi>
               </hi> I <hi>never intended it ſhould come to this;</hi> with
that, impatient for my coming Bliſs, I graſp'd her in my long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arms, when ſhe with equal Ardour ſir'd, claſp'd me ſo
cloſe, methought I wanted breath: And ſo I wak'd, and found
my dream thus far certify'd, That I had my Arms about her,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59279:11"/>
and ſhe hers about me: I would not wake her from that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
Poſture, and yet I would fain have had the content
to have her find her ſelf ſo: I had not long enjoy'd my ſelf
thus, but ſome body fell a rapping at the door, as if they
would have beat it down, which made her ſtart out from her
loving poſture, and ſoon wake; I jump'd up, and caught hold
of my ſword, fearing ſome more of the Gang was coming in
upon me; but by good luck, we had ſo fallen'd the door,
that no body could get in to us. I therefore demanded who
was there, when one anſwered, that he was a poor Traveller
that had loſt his way in the Forreſt, and had wandered about
it all the Night till then, and deſir'd that he might only come
in to reſt his wearyed Limbs. The Princeſs hearing his Voice,
knew him to be one of her Servants that were lately reſtor'd
her, and therefore deſired me to let him in, which in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to her Commands, I did: But when the poor ſlave came
in, and ſaw his Miſtriſs there, and with me, he could not tell
what to ſay or do; but ſhe inform'd him, that by my help
ſhe was alive, which ſatisfying him, he fell at her feet for
joy to ſee her ſafe, and could not be got away from that
humble poſture, thanking the Gods and me, for her delivery,
till day now began to peep, and ſhe unwilling to ſtay any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in that diſmal place, we ſet forward: On the Way ſhe
ask'd him how he came thither at that time of night: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
her, that after ſhe went out the day before, and that
her Maids had eſcap'd home to tell the Servants of what had
befel her, ſeveral of them came out in purſuit of the bold
Raviſher, but as they were ſearching about, they ſaw him float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the River, and making to Land as faſt as he could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almoſt ſpent; that they, not out of any Love to him, but
only to know what was become of their Lady, dragg'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
and upon Examination, had learn'd the truth of
the Tranſaction betwixt them; and then flung him as far as
they could into the River again, and ſaw the ſtream bear him
away out of their ſight; ſo they diſperſed themſelves ſeveral
ways in the ſearch of her, appointing to meet all at her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
again, and that he wandring till night about the Forreſt,
unwilling to go out on't till he had found her, was benighted,
and ſo at laſt happened accidentally to light upon that Hut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59279:12"/>
where he ſo happy to find her: In this, and ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
we arriv'd in ſight of her Unckles, and when we were
come within a quarter of mile, we ſent the Slave before to
inform her Unckle privately of our coming: And being come
to the Houſe, the Old Prince was amaz'd to ſee me lead in
my Princeſs, of whoſe Eſcape he had already heard; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me with that reſpect that was due to my quality, as
the Son of a King, not a Slave: As ſoon as we were enter'd, he
had not patience to ſtay till we had repos'd our ſelves, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
enquir'd into our Adventure. As far as I knew of it,
I told him; but deſir'd, before he put the Lady to the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that ſhe might be conducted to a Chamber, and there a
little refreſh'd, having had but a very bad Nights Lodging
laſt Night; which being accordingly done, and the Prince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
me with himſelf, ſhe thus began:</p>
            <p>Yeſterday morning (being a very inviting day) I took a walk with
two of my Maids, into the Grove which you know is adjoyning to my
Caſtle, deſigning not to ſpend above a quarter of an hour there;
when we had reached the lower end of the walk, which is but ſhort,
there ruſht a fellow out upon us; the Maids frighted, ran one, one
way into the Wood; and the other, another: the Villain made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to me, and ſeized me before I could make many ſteps away
from him. Looking upon him, I found it was young <hi>Teyas,</hi> Prince
of <hi>Tabuco,</hi> that had formerly made Love to me; but being denyed,
and forbid our Kingdom, now hearing I had retreated to that lone
abode, ſo near the frontiers, ſecure of a ſafe retreat, watched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
for this opportunity, which I ſuſpect was given him by one of
my Maids, that put me mind of taking that Walk. He had no
ſooner ſeized me, but he forced me away from my Caſtle towards
the Forreſt, and putting a Dagger to my Boſom, ſwore by all the
Gods, that he would before we parted, Murder me, or Enjoy me.
Surpriz'd at ſo ſudden an accident, and the impending danger, I
was at a ſtand to think how to eſcape both of theſe Evils; the leaſt
of them [Death] being terrible enough to a Woman, at laſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
that a little further there was a narrow Bridge that croſſed a
very rappid Stream; and therefore he having dragg'd me ſo far,
I told him, if he would not be ſo rude, I did not know what I might
conclude in his favour; that gifts of that nature were better beſtow'd
on Kind words, than Threats, and fear of Death; that I could go
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59279:12"/>
more peaceably with him, if he would go my pace. With words tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
like theſe, I got liberty to go leiſurely along, till we came to
that Bridge. I deſired him to lead me over it, which he very readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did; but he was no ſooner upon it, but I gave him a little twirle
(the wood being ſlippery with ſome rain that had fallen in the night)
and his feet ſlipt; and endeavouring to ſave himſelf, he plunged
farther into the River; but I ſtaid not to ſee what became of him,
but took to my heels, and ran as faſt as I could towards my Caſtle.
I had not run a furlong, but <hi>I</hi> found my ſelf very weary; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he might get out (the River being but narrow, tho ſwift) <hi>I</hi> begg'd
a Country fellow that at that diſtance came by, to take me up behind
him; inſtead of going thither, he gallopped away with me into the
Forreſt, to that little Hutt where you <hi>Giolo</hi> found me; all <hi>I</hi> could
do, could not get away from him he held me ſo faſt: But being come
to this little Cottage in the midſt of the Forreſt, he took me off, and
the old Hagg came out to him with her Rogue, and forced me
in; when <hi>I</hi> was there, it being day-time, they carryed me into a
little Hole within their Room, and having gagg'd me, they made me
remain till night; when that was come, and there was now no
more fear of Travellers to interrupt them in their deſign, they
took out the Gagg and treated me a little more civilly, and the
deformed Monſter that brought me there, took me by the hand,
and told the old Witch <hi>I</hi> was his Wife, and that he muſt bed
me there that night, having newly Marryed me; which ſhe ſeem'd
to believe, and therefore wiſh't him Joy: <hi>I</hi> did what <hi>I</hi> could to
undeceive her, asking her if it were a likely matter that <hi>I</hi> ſhould
marry ſuch a Beaſt as he; Yes marry Mrs. Flirt, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> why
not? Why not ſo proper and well-built a Man as he? <hi>I</hi> told
her who <hi>I</hi> was, and promiſed her <hi>I</hi> would give her a better Houſe,
and a good Reward too, if ſhe would deliver me from the Clutches
of that Villain; but all was in vain, they either would not truſt
to my promiſes, or believed his, who aſſured them of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſwearing all the while he was Married to me, and that they
ſhould ſee him injoy me before their Faces, and preſently began to
be very rude with me, endeavouring to gain a Kiſs from me; but
<hi>I</hi> ſtruggling ſo ſtrongly, it was more than he could effect at the
firſt On-ſet; but fearing to be overcome by his robuſtuous ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>I</hi> began to, ſpeak him fair, and argue the eaſe with him and them,
ſometimes aſſuring them <hi>I</hi> was not his Wife, other times begging him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59279:13"/>
to defer his cruelty, if he would not wholly give it over. In the
midſt of my entreaties which would do no good, he endeavoured again
to raviſh a kiſs from me, and <hi>I</hi> had quite ſpent my ſelf with ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
when you burſt in upon us, and by his death delivered me
from him. <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe his deſign was to have raviſhed and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, elſe to have ſold me for a Slave, when he had obtained
his deſire, if he had not been prevented by you. The reſt you have
heard (<hi>concluded ſhe</hi>) from the mouth of the Prince <hi>Giolo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was extreamly pleaſed to find her give me the Title
due to my Birth and Quality, ſince that ſhewed ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſome eſteem for me. Now it being high time to
leave her to her repoſe, we retired. The next day ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
free acceſs to her, I preſſed my cauſe to her with all the
Ardour I could. Nor did ſhe deny, but that gratitude obliged
her to yield to my deſires, but only fear of my ſafety,
made her oppoſe my eagerneſs; ſhe therefore only asked time
to bring my content about, without hazarding her ſelf or me
any farther. She informed me that ſhe was of opinion, that
the Prince her Uncle was too much diſguſted by her Brother;
that he would contribute all he could to the furthering of my
eſcape, and that he would perhaps be brought to go with
me, for he was very much my Friend, as indeed I ſoon found.
For one day taking me aſide, he ſaid, Prince <hi>Giolo,</hi> I am not
ignorant of your former pretentions to my Neice, who I
believe is not wholly averſe to you. I know alſo upon this
account ſhe was ſent away from Court to the remoteſt part
of this Kingdom, to prevent your coming near her, but your
eſcape before this time is known all over <hi>Tominec,</hi> which
will I ſuppoſe make the King ſend for her back: Nor will
it be ſafe for you to remain here, for tho' I believe you
are not known perſonally to any one of my Slaves, yet thoſe
that belong to the Princeſs are well enough acquainted with
you, and may for all't we know make their eſcape to the
City, and inform againſt you. I would therefore have you
think of perfecting your delivery, and out of hand endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make away to your own Country, from whence you
may demand the Princeſs in Marriage, or revenge your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
received here: I promiſe you the aſſiſtance of a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
to convey you home:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59279:13"/>
Ah Sir, returned I, I cannot go and leave my Princeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and if ſhe will be obſtinate, and ſtill reſiſt my paſſion,
I muſt ſtay and periſh; for till ſhe is mine, I am reſolved
not to go from this Country what danger ſoever attends
me. You may, return'd the Prince, tempt your fate too
far, and loſe this happy minute it has allowed you to gain
your liberty. But ſince you are reſolved not to go without
her, I will ſtill contribute to your happineſs, and ſince by
ſo doing, I ſhall incur the greateſt danger my ſelf; I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
accompany you in your ſlight, for the cruelty of the King
has made me abhor the ſight of him. Go you therefore, and
ſee what you can prevail with the Princeſs to do, and I
will ſecond your endeavours. I returned him a thouſand
acknowledgments for the unexpected civility, in a place where
I had met with the greateſt Barbarity in the World; and
according to his directions, I went to the Princeſſes Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment;
and being admitted, I after ſome other precious
diſcourſe, ſaid to her:</p>
            <p>I bleſs my good fortune, that has thus after ſo many ſighs, and
tedious days, and anxious nights, brought me into your preſence once
more, and I thank your condeſcending goodneſs, that has ſo far
forgiven the boldneſs of my Tongue, in repeating the tale of my
Love as often as <hi>I</hi> ſee you; but ſo it is, that <hi>I</hi> cannot but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
the ſame way again, and once more lay open to your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Compaſſion, the trueſt, and moſt violent flame, that ever
reigned in a poor Lovers breaſt. <hi>I</hi> confeſs, <hi>I</hi> cannot plead any
other Merit, than the reality of my Love, eſpecially in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<hi>I</hi> am in at preſent; nor do <hi>I</hi> deſire to gain you on any
other account; all my actions proceeding from that alone, as a due
Homage to her that commands my Soul: That, that alone is my
all, and my only hopes, for in that <hi>I</hi> excel all Mankind. There
may be greater Princes, and there are more Fortunate that make
their Addreſſes to you, but there can't be a greater Lover; for
ſhould <hi>I</hi> find an abſolute and fatal repulſe, Death would ſoon put
a Period to my Miſery, and rob your generoſity of my relief.
Speak, thou Faireſt, ſpeak, and let me here know my Doom, from
thoſe dear Lips, which ſure are more in love with Mercy, than
to utter any deſtroying Sentence. Speak, that <hi>I</hi> may no longer

               </gap>ubt or hope, but end the tortures of a Wretch, whom only fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59279:14"/>
and imaginary bliſs have thus long kept alive; Methinks
thoſe lovely eyes againſt your will, confeſs approaching pitty.</p>
            <p>I would have gon on, but that the Princeſs (whoſe Love
now could be no longer diſguiſed) thus interrupted me, more
out of cuſtom, than doubt of the reality of my Affections.</p>
            <p>Ah! <hi>Giolo, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi>
               </hi> why ſhould you ſtrive to gain a heart,
which I fear you value chiefly for the benefit it may bring you,
in reſtoring you to the Favour of my Brother, and your own
Kingdom. But Oh! If that be all your aim, and that you make
my heart but the medium of your fortune, let me tell you, it is
too Noble a Prize, and cannot brook after ſlightings, no more
than hear ſuch Words, and ſo much ſeeming Truth, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
<hi>I</hi> have given you the freedom to purſue my heart; but
do it fairly, and with a juſt regard, or as you love your own
repoſe and mine, preſs on my fall no farther.</p>
            <p>Ah, Sweet Princeſs! <hi>returned I, (and ſent out a ſigh, as if
my Soul would have parted from my Body)</hi> You wrong my
honeſt Soul: By thoſe bright Eyes you do, to think me guilty of
ſuch ſlaviſh double-dealing Arts. My Fortune has not changed
my mind. That ſtill is free, and think, what a Prince ſhould. I
have no reſpect to any by advantage that your Love may bring.
No, by all the Sacred Powers above, mine is a Noble Flame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with Self-intereſt. If my Words will not convince you of
the truth of this, my Death ſhall—</p>
            <p>As I was going to proceed, I was interrupted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Prince, who had over-heard all that had now
paſt betwixt us, and obſerving that all this conteſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from her unwillingneſs to own her Love, ſtopt me in the
carrier of my Paſſion; and with all the grave Authority of
his Perſon and Speech, aſſured her, that what I ſaid, he
durſt be pledge, I meant: and that therefore ſhe might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me without ſo much unneceſſary caution; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
as Generoſity, Gratitude and Juſtice required, put an
end to my ſufferings, by complying with my deſires, ſince
without a favourable Anſwer he would certainly die, which
would bring too great a ſcandal on their Country, to have
the Cruelty of the Women, perfect the Miſery, the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that the Men had began—<hi>No, let him live</hi> (ſaid ſhe,
and ſtopt as aſhamed of what ſhe had ſaid, and directing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59279:14"/>
the diſcourſe to the Old Prince, ſhe thus replied) <hi>But why
Sir do you thus force me to diſcover my own weakneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
Love after ſo many reſolutions</hi> I <hi>have made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
You who ought to have propt my ſinking Virtue: Could
it not ſuffice to have gathered it from my treacherous Eyes, but
that he muſt hear it too from my Tongue?—Bluſh not</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the Prince) <hi>for why ſhould you be aſhamed to own a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Son of a Greater King than your own Father! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me give you immediately to him</hi> (for that is the Cuſtom
of that Country). <hi>Here, take from me this hand, <hi>Giolo,</hi>
               </hi> (ſaid he
to me) <hi>if</hi> I <hi>thought thee not Honourable and Brave,</hi> I <hi>would not
beſtow this gift on thee elſe. And <hi>Terhenahete,</hi>
               </hi> I <hi>dare engage
to you, you'll not repent your choice.</hi> With theſe words, he
ſeized her hand, and gave it to me; who parting as it were
out of a Trance into which theſe unexpected Joys had caſt
me, I eagerly caught hold on't, and after ten thouſand kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which I gave it, I thus cryed out; <hi>Thanks Noble Prince,
all your Gods has not ſuch another Gift to beſtow.—Ah dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Princeſs! if you would but confirm, I were entirely bleſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, <hi>I</hi> muſt yield (<hi>ſaid ſhe, and bluſhed</hi>) but uſe your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
with moderation, and ſhew by your after-Love, that what
you have ſaid, is true. My Vncle has too much Authority over
me, for me to diſlike his Choice.</p>
            <p>Thanks my Dear Princeſs (<hi>returned I with all the eagerneſs
of Love and Succeſs</hi>): And thanks ye Heavenly Powers; Thanks
to you Renowned Prince; And by my Charming Fair, I here, if fate
ſo proſper us to carry us ſafe into <hi>Gilolo,</hi> I'll ever honour you as
my Father: Nay what's more, as the Father of my <hi>Terhenahete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, we paſſed that Night in all the Joyes of Love,
and I forgot that I was in an Enemies Country, where I was
in danger of being diſcovered to Death, or perpetual Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
In the mean time the Prince, by ſome he could confide
in, had ordered a Veſſel to be got ready; but all theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
could not be carried on with that ſecrecy, but ſome of
the Slaves had knowledge of it, which was confirmed, when
the next day but one, Two of them were miſſing. The
Prince came to us with ſurprize, and informed us of the
whole matter; on which we reſolved to go upon our intended
Voyage immediately; for tho' he had not laid in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59279:15"/>
he intended, nor got that ſtrength of Men he hoped by
his Agents to have procured in a few days, yet we thought
it ſafer to venture away without them, than expect a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ruine there, by a farther delay; but it was now too late
to think of going that Night, nor did we think we ſhould
have any come to prevent our eſcape ſo ſoon as the next day.
But the Slaves wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed with hopes of reward for their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
had made ſuch had that by that time the Morning
came, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> came for the Princeſs immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the Court, and the Prince to yield himſelf a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
And for me, to bind me; if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſiſted, to kill me. But
with this Meſſenger (who was not able to do all himſelf)
were ſent about thirty more; but he had out-gon them all,
which made us bind him firſt, and immediately make haſt
to our Ship, into which we had ſcarce got, when we ſaw
them that were in purſuit of us come to the ſhoar; we hoiſt
our Sailes, and got clear of all the Ships there, ſo out to Sea,
and had it not been for the Treachery or Ignorance of the
Seamen, had been by the next Morning, ſafe out of danger.
We got out of ſight by Noon, ſo fare a Wind we had;
and then I began to think again of Love, and would not
loſe any hours I could ſpend in the injoyment of my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Princeſs; little thinking how little a time I was to be
ſo happy: For reſolving to ſail all Night for the greater
ſpeed; the Pilot, or by chance, or deſign, ſteer'd back di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the place from whence we came; ſo that when we
waked in the Morning, we were ſurprized to behold the Land
and Place from whence we came. The Old Prince ſuſpecting
Treaſon, immediately ſlew the Pilot, and had him hoiſted
over board; and tacked about again, but to no purpoſe; nor
Wind nor Tide aſſiſted us; and to add to our Affliction we
ſaw two of the biggeſt Ships make to us; but reſolving not
to be taken lamely, we made reſiſtance, till the Poor Old
Prince was ſlain, and I extremely wounded; upon which
we were both carried aſhore, and the Princeſs raviſhed from
my Arms, with ſcarce leiſure to wiſh me well, or give a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
look; and I was by another party carried away to <hi>Buta,</hi>
and ſold there to a Forreign Merchant, I know not of what
place; with whom I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to another Country I was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59279:15"/>
ignorant of, and by my New Maſter ſold, I ſuppoſe to thoſe
that brought me hither.</p>
            <p>Having thus repeated my Misfortunes to you Sir, I hope
you will be ſo juſt to your word, as to make enquiry, what
became of my Princeſs? Whether ſhe out-lived it? Or has
at laſt forgot her <hi>Giolo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutch Merchant was now quite tired with the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and could not be prevailed with to give an account
of it to the Company, but told my Friend, that if he would
go with him to his Lodgings, he would over a Bowl of
Punch, by parcels, give him the whole Narrative, which he
did, unwilling to loſe any part of ſo admirable a Story of
ſo Unfortunate as Prince.</p>
            <p>As to the particular deſcription of his Body, the Pictures
that are Publiſhed of him, give a large account of that: But
to compleat the Hiſtory of his Life, I will add ſomething of
that nature. This Prince is about the Age of Thirty, Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and well proportioned in all his Limbs, extreamly Modeſt
and Civil; and, as this account ſhews, of a very good Senſe.
He is all over curiouſly Painted both before and behind, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
demonſtration of his Quality. Thoſe Nations who
uſe that Art, never permitting the inferior ſort to ſee any
regular forms in their Bodies.</p>
