            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE FRIENDLY READER.</head>
            <p>THE Method I propoſe in this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſet down the ſaid <hi>Queries</hi> mentioned in the Title-Page. <hi>Next,</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers given by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and ſome of his Brethren, and Sign'd by them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Anſwers I have faithfully and ſincerely collected out of the Printed Books of <hi>George Whitehead, William Penn,</hi> and <hi>John Whitehead,</hi> that ſhew the great Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Contradiction of their preſent late Anſwer to the expreſs Words and Sentiments of their Printed Books. The which Anſwers will alſo give a farther Account of their vile and pernicious Errors, oppoſite to ſome Fundamental Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And here I would have the Reader to underſtand, That if theſe Men had by their late Anſwers contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted their former Sayings and Sentiments, from any ſincere Conviction, and profeſſed Acknowledgment of the vile and groſs Errors boldly aſſerted by them in their Printed Books, I ſhould have been ſo far from charging of them with Hypocriſie for their ſo doing, that I ſhould have commended their Ingenuity. But they are ſo far from any ſuch Acknowledgment, that in their late Anſwer they referr to the Anſwer given by them in Publick, to the Objections made againſt them in Publick: Now it is plain, that by their Anſwer made in Publick, they mean their Anſwer and Doctrine, Sayings and Sentiments contain'd in their Printed Books;
<pb facs="tcp:101188:3"/>
ſo far are they from profeſſing or owning any real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction they are under of their former vile Errors. Though it is not improbable that ſome of them, and particularly <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> hath ſome contrary Apprehenſions and Sentiments in divers of theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Matters, to what he hath formerly, with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence aſſerted in Print; as not only being his own Principles, but the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles. (Tho' I thank God, thoſe Vile Errors aſſerted by him in divers of his Printed Books, and particularly in that moſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Book, call'd, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> &amp;c. in Anſwer to <hi>William Burnet</hi>; and which he calls the <hi>Quaker's Principles,</hi> were never my Principles; and in Charity I am apt to believe, nor the Principles of divers others that have with me, gone under that Deſignation.) But it is eaſie to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Reaſons why, on ſuppoſition that <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and ſome other leading Men among them, have chang'd their Sentiments of latter times to what they formerly Printed, yet they are not ſo ſincere as to own it, and to retract in Publick their Errors expos'd in Publick, even leſt ſuch Retraction or Correction ſhould leſſen and abate their Honour and Eſteem among their too credulous Followers and Admirers; who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt have taken things too much on Truſt from them, and ſuffer'd themſelves to be too much influenc'd and led by them into the ſame Errors; as I have found by ſad Experience, how too many of them are guilty of the ſame Errors with their Leaders. And <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and ſome others ſo highly pretending to the infallible Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit, both in what they have Preached and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they loving the Praiſe of Men, and ſeeking the Honour from below, (Phariſee-like) and not regarding
<pb facs="tcp:101188:3"/>
the Honour of God, nor the Danger of Souls by thoſe hurtful Errors wherewith they have poiſoned Thouſands. If they ſhould Retract or Correct what they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Printed, and is on publick Record, wou'd ſeem ſo greatly to reflect on them, and their high Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they will rather ſeek to uphold their Honour and Repute among their Followers, than Honour God, or reſcue Souls out of the Snare they have brought them into, by a free Acknowledgment and Retraction: But until they ſo do, they can never have any true Character among ſincere intelligent Perſons, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Books, but that they are great Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. And however in ſome things of weight, it is poſſible that <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and ſome others have chang'd their Sentiments, yet I have no ground or reaſon to think otherwiſe, but as touching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers weighty Matters of the Chriſtian Doctrine and Faith, he and they are ſtill under great Blindneſs, Darkneſs, and Error: Which that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd from, and brought to a true Senſe, and ſincere Acknowledgment of, is my real and ſincere Deſire. And though ſome of them, and particularly <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> notwithſtanding his pretended Smoothneſs at times, have utter'd not only moſt bitter and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speeches aginſt me, but falſe and lying Prophecies, with a <hi>thus faith the Lord,</hi> yet I can truly ſay, I never felt any thing either in my Mouth or Heart, to riſe against any of them, to render them Evil for Evil, Curſing for Curſing; but Good for Evil, Bleſſing for Curſing; knowing, that all ſincere Chriſtians are call'd not to Curſe, but to Bleſs; tho' it hath been too familiar with them ſo to do to many others in this, as in other things, wreſting, and perverting, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying ſome places of the Holy Scripture, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:101188:4"/>
the ſharp Words and Woes that Chriſt and ſome of the Prophets and Apoſtles gave forth againſt ſuch as deſerv'd them. As if becauſe Chriſt, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, did ſo Propheſie from an infallible Knowledge, that theſe Perſons againſt whom they ſo declared were guilty, and the Woes they pronounced were really Prophetical, that therefore they may do the like. But as the Gifts, and Miracles, and Tongues are not <hi>George Whiteheads</hi> attainments, ſo nor has he any juſt Ground to profeſs ſuch an extraordinary Spirit of Diſcerning and Propheſie (nor any at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I know on Earth.) Although the infalliable Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Inſpirations of the Holy Spirit, I own with all true ſincere Chriſtians, to teach us all Truth, and lead us into all Truth that concerns the Salvation of our Souls, as the common and univerſal Privilege of all the Faithful; but not that Men ſhould lay claim to ſuch extraordinary things, which they can give no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Evidence of; far leſs to pour out bitter Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Woes, and Propheſies againſt them who have deſerv'd no ſuch things. But notwithſtanding his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Words, and falſe Propheſies againſt me, I have great Comfort that I feel the Bleſſing of God upon me, and the Witneſs of his good Spirit in my Heart, ſealing to the Favour of God towards me, and his favourable accepting my Service, and publick Oppoſition to thoſe vile Errors, that not only too many in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> did hold, but <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and other leading Men among the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> are as much guilty of; and which by their unſound and hurtful Books, they have led them in <hi>America,</hi> and many others elſewhere, into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101188:4"/>And here in the Cloſe of this <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> I think fit to add that which commonly goeth for <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Curſe he ſent to me in Writing, the ſame Day Month he and others gave out their Falſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt Sentence of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which by his means was gone abroad, and was clandeſtinely handed about againſt me, before I gave forth any Copy of it to any. And let the Spiritual Reader, that hath Salt in himſelf to ſavour withal, ſavour and judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this his Propheſie or Curſe, as it may be called, hath not come from a malicious Spirit, full of Wrath and Enmity, and doth not greatly bewray and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his great Hypocriſie as well as Malice, in charging me ſo much (as he and they have in their Bull of <hi>Excommunication</hi>) with bitter Expreſſions, while he is ſo extremely Guilty himſelf; perſiſting in his old way he hath uſed againſt ſome others that differed from him in other Matters, calling them <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Devils, Wolfs, Dogs,</hi> &amp;c. But I am ſure neither he, nor any, can give any ſuch Inſtance of my bitterneſs, as he hath done in this his pretended Propheſie; wherein I do really judge him as falſe a Prophet as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was; and they may be aſhamed, and he in particular, to give theſe odious and uncharitable Names to many others (having better Works and Fruits of Chriſtianity than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) of <hi>Baal's Prophets</hi>; while ſeveral of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do more deſerve ſuch Deſignations.</p>

                  <p>But becauſe we wou'd not willingly take an Account of you only from your Adverſaries; no nor yet the Advantage which may be had from ſome of your own Apologiſts.</p>

That the outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Blood of that Man <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which was ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was not the Propitiation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God for our Sin, But only the Spiritual Blood ſhed inwardly within us.</p>
                  <p>And by theſe means, when you are ask'd, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he Dy'd for our Sins,
<pb facs="tcp:101188:6"/>
Roſe again, and Aſcended; That by his Blood we are ſav'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You can anſwer Yea, That you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all this; and yet mean it all in an Inward and Allegorical Sence; that is, The Blood ſhed within you, the Light, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffering within you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby deceive others, and your ſelves, and keep your Meaning hidden and double, that the Truth of what you hold may not be known; which, if in plain Terms told and aſſerted, wou'd grate all Chriſtian Ears, and ſhew you to be thoſe miſerable <hi>Heraticks</hi> before-told, who brought in Damnable Doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> denying the Lord who bought them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, that you may clear your ſelves from this grievous Charge, you are deſir'd to give a plain, poſitive, and direct Anſwer to theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Queries.</hi> Your Reaſons or Explanations are not requir'd, this not being intended for a Diſpute; but only your plain <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> to each of theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> that your Doctrine and Faith may be known.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Do you believe in a Chriſt without you, now in Heaven?</hi>

                  <p>HAving received a Paper of great Objections againſt Us, the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> with Seven <hi>Queries</hi> therein, ſubſcrib'd <hi>William Lancaſter,</hi> directed to our Yearly Meeting in <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſun-Week,</hi> 1695. and deliver'd to ſome of Us very near the Concluſion thereof, and therefore only read in the ſaid Meeting; which not having any further Time to conſider the Contents thereof, or to give any particular Anſwer thereunto; it was by the ſaid Meeting left to a few to conſider and anſwer, as in the Fear of God, and Meekneſs of Wiſdom we ſhould ſee Cauſe. Wherein we obſerve is noted, <hi>Great Objections have been made against <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, by thoſe who have departed from our Communion, as by others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we reply, That's True, and they have been anſwer'd, to which we referr.</p>
                  <p>And we obſerve in the ſaid Paper it's ſaid, <hi>We would not take an Account of you only from your Adverſaries,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>We have choſen this Solemn Time</hi>; and again, <hi>And We have choſen this most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and convenient Opportunity,</hi> &amp;c. And then ſtates the ſeveral Queries, and ſays, <hi>Theſe Queſtions may be propos'd, and their Anſwer demanded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Objections having been publick, and our Anſwers publick, we deſire to know who the <hi>Wee</hi> are, that are intended in this Paper; that we may
<pb facs="tcp:101188:9"/>
apply our ſelves to them, or give ſuch Scriptural Anſwers as we hope may tend to Satisfaction. But to repeat Anſwers in Writing or Print, to we know not who, ſo often as demanded, to the ſame things already anſwer'd, we think it not needful. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have herewith only ſent thee a few brief Lines, being groſly wrong'd and miſ-repreſented in the ſaid Objections. And divers of the Queries contain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Queſtions in them, in different Terms (and ſome Unſcriptural), ſo not plain and direct Queries, therefore cannot positively be anſwer'd by our ſingle <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> to each Query, as deſir'd. We therefore at preſent ſend this general Anſwer to the Queries for thy Information as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſincerely believe and profeſs <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> according to the Holy Scripture-Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to that meaſure of Underſtanding which God hath been pleaſed to give us by his Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>We ſincerely believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of the Living God, both as He is True God, and Perfect Man, our <hi>Emanuel</hi> and Mediatour; and as in the Fulneſs of Time, he was Conceiv'd by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> of <hi>Judaea</hi>; Suffer'd under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was Crucify'd and put to Death; was Buried, Roſe again the third day, and viſibly Aſcended into Heaven, and was received into Glory; and that this ſame <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that was crucify'd, ſhall ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come (as he was ſeen to go into Heaven) in Power and great Glory, to judge both the Living and the Dead according to their Works, at the laſt and great Day of Judgment, in that great Harveſt which is the End of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:101188:9"/>And that by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> there ſhall be a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, both of the Juſt and Unjuſt unto the Righteous Judgment of the great Day; conſequently, That the Reſurrection is not paſt, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                  <p>And that the Dead ſhall be rais'd Incorruptible, every Man in his own Order; and that our low Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be chang'd, and made like unto Chriſt's glorious Body; The Reſurrection of the Bodies of the Saints (we believe) ſhall be Spiritual and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and that the Sons of God, and of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſhall be equal to the Angels of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father: and yet there is ſuch a great Myſtery in the Reſurrection, as that <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption, inherit Incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
                  <p>The whole Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (whereof his Blood outwardly that was ſhed was a Part) was of great Price with God for Man's Redemption. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood that was ſhed without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> together with the whole Sacrifice of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both of Soul and Body, was a true Propitiation and Atonement for Man's Reconciliation and Peace with God, for Remiſſion of Sins, through a living Faith, and true Repentance (in his Name) given and wronght by his Spirit and Word of Power in Mens Hearts, whoſe ſincere Obedience to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and walking in his Light being required of them, in order to experience <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Author of their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, and to waſh them from their Sins in his own Blood; for without this true Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Men loſe and forfeit the great Benefit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings,
<pb facs="tcp:101188:10"/>
and deprive themſelves of that Eternal Redemption and Salvation which he hath thereby obtained for Us, tho' he dy'd for all Men, taſted Death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, and gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtify'd of in due Time, being a true Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Delivered to the Yearly Meeting of the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>met at</hi> Grace-Church-Street <hi>Meeting-Houſe, the</hi> 15th. <hi>Day of the third Month,</hi> 1695. Signed <hi>by</hi> William Lancaſter, <hi>with theſe Words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd to his Signing,</hi> Theſe Queries may be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Aſſembly, and their Anſwer demanded, by <hi>William Lancaſter,</hi> Chaplain to the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London; Anſwered plainly and directly out of the Printed Books of</hi> George Whitehead, <hi>and</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Pen.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>Query I. DO <hi>you believe in Chriſt without you now in Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To this <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Words in his Anſwer to <hi>William Burnet,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> &amp;c. Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1668. may be a proper Reply to ſignifie his Perſwaſion, touching this weighty Queſtion. I ſhall firſt recite the Words of <hi>William Burnet,</hi> as I find them quoted by <hi>Geo. Whitehead,</hi> in the 38<hi>th. page</hi> of his Book, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> Baptiſt. <hi>Now the</hi> Quakers <hi>would be ſo far from directing Men to go to the Material Temple, That they make it a vain thing to look to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of that Temple</hi>; viz. <hi>To Jeſus Chriſt as he was there Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or unto that Blood that was there Shed for Juſtification,</hi> p. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> anſwereth. The <hi>Quakers</hi> ſee no need of directing Men to the Type for the Antitype; <hi>viz.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the outward Temple, nor yet to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; either
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101188:11"/>
to Jeſus Chriſt or his Blood; knowing that neither the Righteouſneſs of Faith, nor the Word of it doth ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And a few Lines after he ſaith, And where do the Scriptures ſay, The Blood was there ſhed for Juſtification, and that Men muſt be directed unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> for it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Query II. <hi>Hath he now in Heaven the ſame Body (though now changed in Qualities and Glorify'd) which he aſſum'd in the Womb of the Bleſſed Virgin, in which he Suffer'd, Died, was Buried, Roſe again, and Aſcended outwardly</hi>?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, take <hi>John Whitehead</hi>'s Words, in his Poſtſcript to a Book call'd <hi>The Quakers Refuge,</hi> pag. 90.41.
<q>I have ſeveral times, ſaith he, deny'd that Chriſt hath now a Body of Fleſh and Bones, circumſcript, or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that Heaven which is above and out of every Man on Earth.</q>
Again he ſaith, <hi>ibidem,</hi>
               <q>Chriſt hath a Body, or is in a Body ſuitable to his Spirit, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Heavenly Fleſh and Bone. Alſo he ſaith, Whereſoever the Spirit and Life of Chriſt is, that is in the Body of Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> As he owneth that Chriſt has a Body that is not the Church, yet he owneth no other Body of his beſides his Church, that is circumſcript, or limited, out of every Man on Earth. Now by <hi>John Whitehead</hi>'s Words it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, either that Chriſt hath not that real Body he had on Earth, which was Crucify'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if he hath, it is ſuch as not only every one of the Saints, but every Man, yea and every Creature hath, he denying it to be circumſcript or limited. And is not this a fair Inlet to the Popiſh Doctrine of the real Preſence of Chriſt's Body that ſuffered, to be in the conſecrated bread, as they imagine?</p>
            <p>Query III. <hi>Will he return in that ſame Body Outwardly, or without Men, to judge the World,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To this <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Words, in his Book before-mentioned, call'd <hi>The Life and Light of Chriſt within,</hi> page 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>1. are a fit Reply, whereby to give us an Account of his Belief, or rather Unbelief, in this weighty Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith.
<q>But three Comings of Chriſt, (ſaith <hi>George Whitehead</hi>) not only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101188:11"/>
that in the Fleſh at <hi>Jiruſalem,</hi> and that in the Spirit, but alſo another Coming in the Fleſh yet to be expected, we do not read of; but a ſecond Coming without Sin unto Salvation; which in the Apoſtles Days was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And one <hi>John Newman</hi> (whom <hi>George Whitehead</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Book call'd <hi>Chriſt aſcended above the Clouds</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Thoſe that pierced him in his Body of Fleſh, ſhall ſee that Body viſibly come again.</hi> To this <hi>George Whitehead</hi> anſwereth.
<q>Theſe are not the Words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but added; although to add or diminiſh be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden under a Penalty, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. yet this Man's Preſumption leads him to incurr that: See alſo for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7, 8. and 13, 14, 16. in none of which is Jeſus Chriſt either call'd or repreſented as a Body of Fleſh viſibly to come again; but that he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt. And Chriſt in the Days of his Fleſh, wherein he viſibly appear'd to the World, ſaid, <hi>Yet a little while and the World ſeeth me no more, John</hi> 14. and 19. But his ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and Appearance without Sin unto Salvation, I own and witneſs <hi>page</hi> 21, 22, of that Book, and <hi>page</hi> 23. So where they add the Word <hi>Perſonal, or his coming again,</hi> or <hi>Perſonal Being,</hi> do they not herein ſhew their carnal Expectations, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>George Whitehead</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>William Burnet, The Light within,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 40. replyeth to two places of Scripture, brought by <hi>William Burnet,</hi> to prove Chriſt's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming again without us, to judge the Quick and the Dead; where he anſwereth in theſe expreſs Words,
<q>And as to that 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. which <hi>William Burnet</hi> brings to prove that Chriſt ſhall come in the latter end of the World from Heaven above the Clouds. Now, in <hi>p.</hi> 15. it's ſaid, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of our Lord: now I ask, (ſaith <hi>George Whitehead</hi>) if they did live and remain to a Perſonal Coming of Chriſt in the Clouds, yea or nay; or can it be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably thought to be a Coming that is not yet, that they lived and remained unto, <hi>&amp;c. And in Anſwer to that other place of Scripture which</hi> William Burnet <hi>had brought
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101188:12"/>
to prove the Reſurrection of the deceas'd Saints after the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Death. George Whitehead</hi> ſaith again, that the Dead in Chriſt ſhall ariſe firſt, we own to be an Effect of Chriſt's Coming, and know that there is a Dying in Chriſt, and being Baptized unto his Death, before a Coming forth, or Riſing in the likeneſs of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
And a little after ſaith,
<q>But to know the ſaid States, what it is to Die with Chriſt, to be conformable unto his Death, and to partake of the Power of his Reſurrection; theſe things are hid from that Eye that is Carnal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> He groſly perverteth and miſapplyeth theſe Scriptures only to an inward Dying, and Riſing with Chriſt, and to his inward Coming into the Saints. But though the inward Work of Mortification, and an inward Death and Riſing is to be own'd, and which I find not that <hi>William Burnet</hi> in his Words deny'd, and is according to the Scriptures Teſtimony, and the Saints Experience, yet ſurely to underſtand theſe above-mentioned places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, of that inward Dying, and Riſing, and inward Coming of Chriſt in the Saints, is a groſs Perverſion and Miſapplication of Scripture; yea, and a groſs Abuſe of it, eſpecially when it is brought by <hi>George Whitehead</hi> on purpoſe to contradict <hi>William Burnet</hi>'s Aſſertion, held in common by all ſincere Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt is as viſibly to Come again as he did viſibly Aſcend; and that the Bodies of the Dead Saints ſhall be Raiſed: And <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Reaſon that he brings to refute <hi>William Burnet</hi>'s ſound Aſſertions in this matter, is moſt weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. As becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 14.19. <hi>Yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while and the world ſeeth me no more</hi>; which he brings to contradict Chriſt's coming againg in Perſon, without us, to judge the World. It proveth no ſuch thing as that he ſhould never at any time appear to the World; for he limits it for a little time that they ſhou'd not ſee him. And the <hi>Greek</hi> Word or Particle may be well tranſlated <hi>not as yet,</hi> as it is elſewhere tranſlated: And what a trifling and empty Reaſon brings he to prove that 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. is not to be underſtood of Chriſt's Perſonal Coming yet to be; as becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>we that are alive and remain,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101188:12"/>
as if therefore <hi>Paul</hi> did not mean any Outward or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Coming of Chriſt in that place. <hi>George Whitehead</hi> asking, If they did live and remain to a Perſonal Coming of Chriſt in the Clouds, yea or nay? or can it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably thought to be a Coming that is not yet, that they lived and remained unto: For if <hi>George Whitehead</hi> had not been greatly blinded and darken'd with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt this great Fundamental Doctrine of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> The Coming of our Lord in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Perſon and Body, he might have eaſily perceived how the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſed the Word <hi>Wee</hi> for <hi>They,</hi> by a common <hi>Enallage Perſonae,</hi> that is uſed both in Scripture elſewhere, and in other Writers commonly; as when <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>herewith</hi> (ſpeaking of the Tongue) <hi>curſe we men</hi>; and yet <hi>James</hi> himſelf was no Curſer: Like to this place in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. is that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a myſtery; we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>; which place, however ſome pervert and miſapply, as if the Change of the living Saints at Chriſt's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance at the end of the World were not there meant; but ſome inward Change that the Saints had witneſſed before Death, is certainly to be underſtood of the Change of the Saints Bodies; who then ſhould be found alive at Chriſt's outward Coming? as generally all found Chriſtians have underſtood theſe places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and as I deſire to praiſe God I have always ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them. And it is too great Evidence of <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s not being taught and guided by the Spirit of Truth in his oppoſing ſuch ſound Chriſtian Doctrine, and plain Teſtimonies of the Holy Scripture, which every Babe in Chriſt doth better underſtand than this high Pretender to high Divine Illuminations. <hi>George Whitehead</hi> by his thus oppoſing found Chriſtian Principles belonging to the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion, hath laid great Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Blocks in the way of many that read his Books, who conclude, it cannot be that <hi>George Whitehead</hi> is ſo taught and led by the Spirit of Truth as he pretends, ſeeing he contradicts ſuch manifeſt Truths, ſo plainly laid down in Scripture. And <hi>George Whitehead</hi> would do well to conſider his own Words, <hi>pag.</hi> 36. of that oft-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101188:13"/>
Book, <hi>The Light and Life, &amp;c.</hi> where he ſaith
<q>The Spirit brings to the fulfilling of the Scriptures, and doth not deſtroy the Truth contain'd in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
Therefore, I ſay, the Spirit that ſet him on Work to deſtroy the Truth of Chriſt's outward Coming to Judgment at the great Day, and other great Truths declar'd in the Scriptures, is not the true Spirit that gave it forth.</p>
            <p>And here again I cannot but a little take notice, how, though very ſeverely, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> blamed <hi>I. N.</hi> for affirming, <hi>That thoſe that pierced Chriſt in his Body of Fleſh, ſhall ſee that Body viſibly again</hi>; alledging, <hi>that theſe are not the Words of Scripture, but added; although to add or diminiſh be forbidden under a Penalty, yet this Man's Preſumption leads him to incurr that.</hi> And yet <hi>George Whitehead</hi> in his late Anſwer to theſe Queries, uſeth the Word <hi>Viſibly,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt's Aſcenſion, ſaying, <hi>Article</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>That be,</hi> to wit, Chriſt, <hi>visibly Aſcended into Heaven, and was received into Glory.</hi> Now I am ſure there is the ſame ground in Scripture for his viſible Appearance and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming again, as there is for his viſible Aſcending. But it is worthy of Obſervation, that though <hi>George Whitehead</hi> profeſſes in his late Anſwer to theſe Queries, his belief that Chriſt viſibly Aſcended into Heaven, yet he no where in all the Paper, nor any where elſe that I find, doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and plainly declare his Faith, that Chriſt ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly or outwardly appear at the Day of Judgment, ſo as to be ſeen as an Object without Men. And though his Words in this his late Anſwer, would ſeem to imply, that he did ſo now believe; for he ſaith, <hi>and that this ſame Jeſus Chriſt that was crucified, ſhall ſo in like manner come,</hi> (as he was ſeen to go into Heaven) <hi>in Power, and great Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c. Were <hi>George Whetehead</hi> ingenuous, and not too much given to Equivocation in his way of Writing, this might paſs currant, they being ſound Scripture Words, and according to Scripture. But when we ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how when both <hi>John Newman</hi> and <hi>William Burnet</hi> did formerly bring theſe Words for a Proof of Chriſt's Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Perſonal Coming yet to be, how <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> turn'd off this very place of Scripture from Chriſt's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and Outward Coming <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101188:13"/>
it to his inward Coming, Allegorizing the Clouds to Clouds of Ignorance, and Sin in Mens Hearts: And that I do not find that <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hath made any publick Retractation of his ſaid Perverſion of this and other places of Scripture, we have but too great ground not to judge this his Confeſſion in his late Anſwer to be ſincere: For if he meant not in this his late Anſwer, Chriſt's Outward and Perſonal Coming, he but deceives his Reader, and eſpecially him or them who ſent theſe Queries. And if he means really Chriſt's Outward and Perſonal Coming, he contradicts his former Prints, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath ſo manifeſtly oppos'd it; and yet he is ſo extremely confident of his former Books, that he referrs to them and others, for an Anſwer to theſe Queries; as if all were ſound wholſome Doctrine contain'd in them, and as if he were not changed from his former Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the leaſt Tittle or Punctilio. But let us hear his own Words, in Anſwer to <hi>John Newman,</hi> in his Book call'd <hi>Chriſt aſcended above the Clouds,</hi> page 22. <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
               <q>But, (ſaith <hi>George Whitehead</hi>) the ſame Jeſus (as he was ſeen Aſcend when a Cloud came and received him out of their ſight who ſtood gazing, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. it is ſaid) ſhall ſo come in like manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, tho' every like manner is not the ſame, nor all the Clouds the ſame, yet the ſame Jeſus certainly cometh in like manner, his Coming being in the Clouds.</q>
And to let us know in what Clouds he meaneth Chriſt is Aſcended above, and in what Clouds he will appear above, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this Title in his Book, in Anſwer to <hi>John Newman; Chriſt aſcended above the Clouds</hi>; i. e. <hi>in his Divinity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vindicated from the Cloudy, Erroneous, and Blaſphemous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of</hi> John Newman <hi>and his Brethren.</hi> And all this wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the plain Scripture Words, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. which <hi>John Newman</hi> brought to prove his Perſonal Coming and Appearance without Men, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> makes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, if he could, the Faith of that great Truth of Chriſtian Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Outward Coming in his Glorify'd Nature and Perſon of Man, to judge the whole World. Therefore ſince <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hath told in Print, in Anſwer to <hi>John Newman</hi>'s bringing that palce of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101188:14"/>
               <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>This ſame Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall ſo come in like manner: That every like manner is not the very ſame, nor all Clouds the ſame</hi>; and ſeeing <hi>George Whitehead</hi> has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppos'd Chriſt's Perſonal Coming, or his Coming in Perſon without us, as a thing yet to be expected, he ought to clear it, what <hi>manner of Coming, and what ſort of Clouds he doth now underſtand to be intended in theſe Words, Acts</hi> 1.9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For though it be a real Truth, that Chriſt is Aſcended above all Clouds of Sin, and Ignorance, and Errours, as well in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> as in others, yet I am well aſſured that was not the Senſe intended by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth in theſe Words; nor was it the Senſe of them that ſpoke theſe Words to the Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Query IV. <hi>Will our Dead Bodies then ariſe the ſame Bodies in Subſtance (though altered in Qualities and Properties) which we now have?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Hear what <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hath ſaid in Print, in his Anſwer to <hi>Mat. Coffin</hi> about the Reſurrection: That may be a proper Reply to this Query, in ſhewing <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Unbelief and Errour, as touching the Reſurrection of the dead Bodies of Men. See his Book call'd <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> page 69.
<q>There is (ſaith <hi>George Whitehead</hi>) a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body; and there are Bodies Celeſtial, and Bodies Terreſtrial: The Sun, Moon, and Stars are Celeſtial Bodies; but Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes are Terreſtrial. <hi>Now you</hi> might reckon him a very Blind and Ignorant Man, that ſhould put no difference between the Bodies Celeſtial, and thoſe that are Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial; or that ſhould reckon the Bodies of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the Bodies of Birds, Beaſts and Fiſhes, to be all one in Matter and Subſtance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> At this rate Chriſt's Body now in Heaven is not the ſame Body he had on Earth, in no reſpect; for if it be not the ſame in Subſtance, <hi>i. e.</hi> Being or Eſſence, it is not the ſame any other way conſidered. For a great difference it is if one thing differ from another in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Properties, or in their Modes and Modifications; and one thing may differ from it-ſelf with reſpect to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Times, States, and Conditions. But to ſay a thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101188:14"/>
is changed Subſtantially or Eſſentially, is to ſay that thing is no more that thing in any reſpect, but is annihilated: For whatever Heavenly Excellency and Dignity Chriſt's Body had when it was upon Earth, which may be in a true Senſe acknowledged, being Miraculouſly and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally conceiv'd and form'd by the Power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, yet ſeeing Chriſt did both Eat and Drink, and did Sleep, and Hungred, and Thirſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is certain his Body had the Properties and Qualities of our Earthly Bodies, otherwiſe how could he be ſaid to be made like to us in all things, but without Sin? And ſeeing Mens Bodies are univerſally nouriſhed with what they eat and drink; and their Food by certain Digeſtions, becomes a part of their Bodies, (the Excrementitious part being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) we muſt needs think that Chriſt's Body was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Terreſtrial, <hi>i. e.</hi> had Terreſtrial Qualities when it was upon Earth: But now it is Heavenly, endu'd altogether with Heavenly Qualities, as the Bodies of the Saints will be at the Reſurrection. And it is falſe Philoſophy to ſay the Bodies of Sun, Moon, and Stars are in kind quite other Subſtances from Earthly Bodies. The more true Philoſophy and Knowledge of Natural Things, is, that the Bodies of Sun, Moon, and Stars, differ not Subſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Eſſentially from Earthly Bodies, otherwiſe they cou'd not nouriſh Earthly Bodies as they do. Yea, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> in his Book call'd <hi>The Malice of the Independent Agent rebuked,</hi> page 17. Treating on the Body, of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>And we believing ſuch a Change of the Glorious Body of Chriſt; we do not thereby (nor never did) believe that the Body of Chriſt which ſuffer'd, was annihilated, and that his Fleſh ſaw Corruption — No ſuch matter. May there not be then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a very wonderful Change in the Body, and yet the Subſtance not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated nor deſtroyed?</hi> Note here, how <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hath contradicted <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and how inconſiſtent is he with himſelf: One while he is a very blind and ignorant Man, (according to <hi>George Whitehead's Philoſophy</hi>), That a Body that is Terreſtrial, and a Body that is Celeſtial are one in Subſtance. Another while again by <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> There may be a very wonderful Change in the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt, and yet the Subſtance not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101188:15"/>
annihilated nor deſtroy'd. And then, I ſay, why not alſo may there not be ſuch a wonderful Change in the Bodies of the Saints, and yet the Subſtance not annihilated nor deſtroyed? And though the Scripture diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Bodies Terreſtrial and Celeſtial, yet it doth not ſay theſe viſible Bodies of Sun, Moon, and Stars differ in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from Earthly Bodies. <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hath not learned this ſort of Doctrine either from the Letter of the Scripture, or the Spirit of God that gave it forth, or from true Reaſon; but hath it either from his own dark Imagination, or from the dark Imagination of other Men, as dark and ignorant as himſelf. I had not been ſo large thus to correct his falſe Philoſophy, but that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of it here, and elſewhere, to overthrow the Faith of that great Article of Chriſtian Doctrine, plainly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd in the Holy Scripture, <hi>to wit,</hi> The Reſurrection of the Body. But ſeeing <hi>George Whitehead</hi> in his Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Malice of the Independent Agent,</hi> owneth, or ſeemeth to own, That Chriſt's Body he had on Earth, is now in the Heavens, and is not annihilated, nor the Subſtance of it deſtroyed; how comes it that he ſo peremptorily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputeth <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See his Book call'd</hi> Chriſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended above the Clouds. <hi>pag.</hi> 21.24.</note> againſt Chriſt's Perſonal Exiſtence, and his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Coming again, or Appearance, or Perſonal Being? alledging, <hi>it implies him to be a Perſonal God or Chriſt; like the</hi> Anthropomorphites <hi>and</hi> Muggletonians <hi>conceit of him; and he Argues againſt any Limitation of Chriſt's Perſonal Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, or being at the Right-hand of God without all Men.</hi> But how <hi>George Whitehead</hi> will reconcile this to his Aſſertion in his Book call'd, <hi>The Malice of the Independent Agent,</hi> where he owns that Chriſt's Body of Flesh ſaw no Corruption, but is in Being, and not annihilated. And in his Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to the ſaid Book call'd, <hi>The Malice of the Independent Agent,</hi> he ſaith of Chriſt's Body, <hi>Though it be Spiritual and Glorious, yet a Body, and therefore not in every place where God is. To be Omnipreſent is only proper to God, and not to Bodies.</hi> In my former printed Treatiſe, call'd, <hi>A ſhort Liſt of ſome of the Vile and Groſs Errors of</hi> George Whitehead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Contradiction to <hi>John Whitehead,</hi> about the Body of Chriſt. But here I would have the Reader notice <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Contradiction to himſelf,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101188:15"/>
in the two above-mention'd Books; as if <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> ſince he argued againſt the Perſonal Being of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out every Man, had turn'd <hi>Anthropomorphite</hi> and <hi>Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian,</hi> for aſſerting that Chriſt hath a Body in Heaven, that is not every-where. But to aſſert that Chriſt hath a Body in Heaven that is not every-where, is neither <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphiſm</hi> nor <hi>Muggletoniſm,</hi> but found Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, according to Scripture: For the Errour of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites</hi> and <hi>Muggletonians</hi> was, and is, That the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is a Body, and circumſcript, and limited to one Place, and not Omnipreſent. — But the true Chriſtian Doctrine is, That Chriſt, as God, is no Body, and yet that the Godhead of Chriſt dwelleth in that Body, and is moſt gloriouſly united to the Soul and Body of Chriſt's Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood now in Heaven; and yet that the Godhead is not circumſcribed within that Body, but is every-where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and by ſpecial Manifeſtations and Operations of his Spirit, dwelleth in the Saints.</p>
            <p>But again, That it was, and, for ought I know, now is the Mind of <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> That the Bodies of the Saints are not to riſe again, to be re-united to the Souls with which they were formerly joined. Let us hear what he ſaith in his part of the <hi>Chriſtian Quaker, page</hi> 153, <hi>where</hi> he hath theſe Words,
<q>Both <hi>Calvin, T. D.</hi> the <hi>Schools,</hi> and divers <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are miſtaken in this very Matter, and ſee not with the Eye of true Faith, either that the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Soul is not perfect without the Body, or that the Soul hath a ſtrong Deſire to a Re-union to the Body, while they intend the Terreſtrial and Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Bodies: For this implies the Soul to be in a kind of Purgatory, or diſquietneſs, till the ſuppos'd reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Body. And their Aſſertion and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination herein is contrary to what the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> From <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s own Words here cited, the Argument is as much againſt the Souls of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints now in Heaven having a deſire to be united to any Body whatſoever; for ſuppoſe they now deſire and expect to be united to a Heavenly Body they were not formerly united to, this would as much imply that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101188:16"/>
are in a kind of Purgatory, as to ſuppoſe them to deſire to be united to that Body they formerly had. But it is diſingenuous and unfair in <hi>George Whitehead</hi> to repreſent it as the general ſenſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Schools, That the Body to which the Soul of a deceas'd Saint hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Re-union, ſhall be Terreſtrial and Elementary, ſuch as it was on Earth. For the more Judicious of all ſorts hold, That the Bodies of the Saints at the Reſurrection ſhall be changed in Qualities and Properties, from Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial to Celeſtial, and from Animal to Spiritual, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſame Subſtance and Eſſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> Let us hear <hi>William Penn,</hi> in his Anſwer againſt <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> call'd, <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing</hi>; treating on the Eſtate of the deceaſed Saints, <hi>page</hi> 138.
<q>Is the Joy of the Ancients now in Glory (ſaith he) imperfect, or are they in Heaven but by halfs? If it be ſo unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that the Body which hath ſuffer'd ſhou'd not partake of the Joys Celeſtial, is it not in meaſure une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual that the Soul ſhould be ſo long rewarded before the Body?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This brings to the Mortality of the Soul (held by many <hi>Baptiſts</hi>) or I am miſtaken. But why muſt the Felicity of the Soul depend on that of the Body? Is it not to make the Soul a kind of a Widow, and ſo in a State of Mourning and Diſconſolateneſs, to be without its beloved Body? which State is but a better State of Purgatory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Here he plainly maketh his Ignorance and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to appear, concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the deceaſed Saints. By his Arguing, all the Saints between deceaſed <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> got all the Reſurrection they expected, either in the Mortal Body, or immediately after Death; and ſo Thouſands were raiſed from the Dead before Chriſt; quite contrary to Scripture, that ſaith, Chriſt ſhould be the <hi>firſt</hi> that ſhould riſe from the Dead; and he is the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> of them that <hi>ſleep.</hi> And it is not Chriſtian in <hi>William Penn</hi> thus to ridicule that great Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Chriſtian Faith, and to Argue againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of Divine Providence, if the Soul ſhall be ſo long rewarded before the Body; whereas the full Reward
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101188:16"/>
is reſerved for both at the Reſurrection of the Juſt. And yet this neither proveth the Mortality of the Soul, or that it is in a State of Purgatory before the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>And as I have noticed in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> the like I wou'd have the Reader to notice in <hi>William Penn,</hi> who as they both deny the Reſurrection of the Body, as a thing which the deceaſed Saints wait for; ſo they both Argue againſt it from: falſe Principles of falſe and ſpurious Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy: As that a Body that is Earthly, and Groſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put off its Earthlineſs and Groſſneſs, without any change of its Subſtance or Eſſence; a thing ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, not only among Chymiſts, but to all ordinary Stillers, who know by daily Experience, how groſs Bodies are changed from their groſſneſs in great part, and made Subtile or Volatile, and yet remain Body ſtill, and the ſame Bodies in Subſtance: And if the Operation of Fire and Mens Art have this Effect upon groſs Bodies of Herbs, Stones, and Fleſh, to change them in great part; how much more ought we to acknowledge the Wiſdom and Power of God, not only can, but will change the Bodies of the Saints from all Groſs and Terreſtrial Qualities, to be Heavenly and Spiritual; the Husk, or droſſy part (that is no more the true Body than Droſs in a Lump of rich Oar of Gold is Gold) being excepted.</p>
            <p>Query V. <hi>Do ye believe that Chriſt, or the Eternal Word, was ſo made Fleſh, that he truly and really became Man; as truly Man as he was God,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, let us hear what <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſaith in his Book above-cited, <hi>The Life and Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 39.
<q>As for thoſe Expreſſions, (ſaith he) God-man being born of <hi>Mary,</hi> we do not find them in the Scriptures; nor do we read that <hi>Mary</hi> was the Mother of God, but in the Pope's Canons, Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>page</hi> 47. he ſaith, What Nonſence and Unſcripture Language is this, to tell of God being Co-creator with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or that God had Glory with God; doth not this imply two Gods, and that God had a Father, let the Reader Judge.</q>

               <hi>Note.</hi> Is not this the very Argument of <hi>Arians, &amp;c?</hi> I wonder what <hi>George Whitehead</hi> will make or hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt at laſt. One while that viſible Man, born of the Virgin, was not the Chriſt; for Chriſt was never ſeen with a Carnal Eye: Which Expreſſion <hi>George Whitehead</hi> defends, <hi>The Light and Life, page</hi> 62, and brings that place in <hi>John</hi> 14. to defend it. <hi>He that ſeeth me, ſeeth my father alſo:</hi> Where it is plain, by ſight, in that place, Chriſt meant a Spiritual Saving Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt, which whoever have, they know the Father alſo. But Chriſt told the <hi>Jews</hi> they did ſee him, and did not believe in him. Another while with <hi>George Whitehead</hi> to ſay, <hi>Chriſt, or the Word, was with God, and had Glory with God before the World was, or was a Co-creator with God, is to imply two Gods.</hi> Thus by <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s way of Reaſoning, Chriſt was neither viſible Man, nor the inviſible God; but what elſe he cannot tell. It is ſtrange that he ſhould thus Argue againſt Chriſt's being God with God, when the Scripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>The Word was with God, and that Word was God.</hi> And Chriſt ſaid, he was glorify'd with God before the World was: And was he not the Son of God by an Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and yet One God with the Father? If Chriſt had only a Father as he was Man, then he was not God by Eternal Generation.</p>
            <p>Query VI. <hi>Is Chriſt now at this day, and for ever to come, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really a Man, in true and proper Humane Nature without all Men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a Suitable <hi>Reply</hi> to this, hear <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> who, if he hath not denied him to be Man, yet whether he hath not denied him as Man without us, to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith, let the Judicious Reader judge, in his Book call'd <hi>The Light and Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 61.
<q>Another while (ſaith he) People muſt ſeek their Saviour above the Clouds and Firmament, contrary to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. Another while they muſt ſeek to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for Juſtification, to the Blood that was there ſhed, contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.13, 14. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And in <hi>page</hi> 45, 46. he ſaith, But if he ſay he hath ſought Chriſt at ſuch a Diſtance by Faith.</q>
[<hi>He goes on</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:101188:17"/>
               <q>I ask, if the Object or Foundation of Faith be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Faith; or if the living Faith doth not ſtand in the living Power of God? And whether the Righteouſneſs of it doth tell of ſeeking and finding Chriſt above the Clouds, Stars, and Firmament? But why tells he ſo much of <hi>above the Clouds</hi>; are not the Clouds and Circumference of the Heavens as well under us as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> It is evident here from <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Words, That to him Chriſt without us is not the Object of Faith; and to direct Men to Chriſt above the Clouds, is contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. and oft he pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this place of Scripture in that and other his Books, and hath led many into the ſame groſs and vile Errours with him; as if it were contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. to direct Men to Chriſt without. But no ſuch thing doth ſo appear either from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. or <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. or from any other place of Scripture. But on the contrary, there is a plain Direction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.10. to Chriſt without, as well as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.7, 8. to Chriſt within: For the one doth not exclude the other, and yet Chriſt is but One. For though we have not his Perſon and Body as Man within us, yet as he is that Word that was with God in the beginning, and is God, he is in all Men. But there is a plain Direction in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. to Chriſt as he roſe again from the Dead; and to be ſure that was without us. And a great ſtreſs the Scripture layeth on the true Faith and Confeſſion of that great Truth, as being a neceſſary Terms of Salvation. <hi>If thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with thy Mouth, and believe with thine Heart, that God hath raiſed Chriſt, from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This is more than a bare Hiſtorical Faith: It muſt not be a Faith, or a bare Notion of Faith, only in the Head and Brain, but it muſt be in the Heart, and have its Root and Riſe from the Word of Faith in the Heart: And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. as in many other places, there is a Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt without us, as the Object of Faith; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with God, and Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as without us in Heaven, but every where preſent as well as within us. And to deny that both God and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101188:18"/>
Chriſt, conſider'd as without us as well as within us, is the Object of our Faith, is not only great Unchriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but worſe: For to deny God to be the Object of our Faith without us, is as much as to ſay, God is not without us; or if he be, we are not concern'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. But did not Chriſt direct his Diſciples to pray to God, ſaying, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven</hi>; and was that only within Men? It is ſtrange how he would li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and confine the Object of Faith only to God and Chriſt within. This has given great Occaſion to ſome to charge <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and others with Idolatry: For if the God and Chriſt, that is the Object of <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Faith be only within, and not without, he has not the true God and Chriſt for the Object of his Faith. — But if this be an Inadvertency in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> he ought to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it, and remove the great Offence he hath caſt in the way of many; who have occaſion given them by his unſound Words, to think he, and many of his Brethren, neither worſhip the true God, nor the true Chriſt, who would confine the Object of Faith only to be within. And for <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſo to taunt <hi>William Burnet</hi> for his ſaying, <hi>Chriſt is to be ſought and found above the Clouds, Stars, and Firmament,</hi> beſpeaketh him that he was then, at leaſt, when he ſo wrote, too much leavened and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with <hi>Ranter</hi>'s Notions, that held God and Chriſt, Heaven and Hell, and Devils, to be no-where but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men; or at leaſt as ſome of 'em held, That God is no-where to be minded but as within: For though no Man can have a true and ſaving Knowledge of God, and true and ſaving Faith in him, but as it is wrought in him by the Spirit of God within, yet that true Faith and Knowledge reſpects him as Omnipreſent, as well as Omniſcient and Omnipotent, and in his other infinite Perfections: And it is a miſerable wreſting and perverting of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, as if Chriſt were not as really to be minded as an Object of our Faith in Heaven without us as within us; whereas it is plain that place is to be underſtood of Chriſt's Body: So that we are not to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall bring it down to us from Heaven</hi>? and the <hi>Jews</hi> were not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Chriſt in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, nor long after, ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101188:18"/>
come down from Heaven, to aſſume and take a Body until the fulneſs of Time: And now that Chriſt's Body is aſcended, that we are not to ſay, Who ſhall bring him down to us in that Body? But this doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that by Faith and Meditation we ſhould reſpect him now in Heaven, as the real Object of our Faith, Love, and Obedience; or that we ſhould not in Faith hope for his real Coming again in his Glorify'd Body in the time appointed.</p>
            <p>And his Philoſophy, wherein he would ſeem to be ſome Body, is falſe and vain, in taking <hi>William Burnet</hi> to Task, for telling of Chriſt ſo much above the Clouds, and querying, Are not the Clouds, and Circumference of the Heavens as well under us as above us? I ſay, to ſpeak properly, according to the beſt Rule of either Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or Divinity, or Aſtronomy, the other Hemiſphere of the viſible Firmament is not under us, but above. <hi>Above</hi> hath relation to the Earth, as the Centre; and ſo whatever is remote from the Earth, more or leſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this or the other Hemiſphere of the Heavens, is above. And the Scripture alſo teacheth us this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4.</p>
            <p>Query VII. <hi>Was his outward Blood outwardly ſhed at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>the true Propitiation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the World, and is Faith in that Blood,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Query</hi> we have full and plain Anſwers from <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> out of their Printed Books, ſufficient to ſhew their Unbelief, and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine, directly contradicting the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures in this great Fundamental Article. Let us firſt hear <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> in his Book call'd <hi>The Light and Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is confeſſed (ſaith he) <hi>page</hi> 56. That God by his own Blood purchas'd to himſelf a Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. — Now the Blood of God, or that Blood that relates to God, muſt needs be Spiritual, he being a Spirit:</q>
And the Covenant of God is Inward and Spiritual, and ſo is
<q>the Blood of it, <hi>George Whitehead, page</hi> 56. <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within</hi>; and <hi>page</hi> 55. Where do the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures uſe thoſe Expreſſions, and ſo much vary about
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101188:19"/>
the Blood of Chriſt, as one while to ſay, that the ſhedding of that Blood Outwardly was the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe of Salvation: Another while the Word <hi>ſhedding</hi> to be left out, and the ſtreſs laid only upon that <hi>Blood</hi> it-ſelf, which the Soldier ſhed or let out of his Side with a Spear; which was after he was put to Death: And <hi>page</hi> 59. of the ſame. To ſay that Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Blood, (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Sacrifices under the Law) was a Type of that which was Material, <hi>viz.</hi> the Viſible and Material Blood of Chriſt, ſhed upon the Croſs. This is to give the Subſtance no Preheminence above the Type, (eſpecially if neither of them be Myſtical nor in Being) or like as if one ſhould ſay, one Type was a Type of another; and <hi>page</hi> 38. of that ſame Book. And where do the Scriptures ſay, the Blood was there ſhed for Juſtification; and that Men muſt be directed to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to it, when as that Blood ſhed is not in Being?</q>
citing <hi>page</hi> 40, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>William Burnet</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>William Burnet</hi> had ſaid in his Book as cited by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> The Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, the Material Blood, meritorious to Salvation, ſprinkles the Conſcience, Sanctifies us, Juſtifies, Redeems; <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> anſwereth in theſe expreſs Words following:
<q>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here a twofold ſtreſs is laid upon that Blood; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Merit to Salvation; <hi>Second,</hi> Works of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo he hath ſet it up above God; for God could not ſave, he ſaith, and yet is not in Being: [<hi>groſs Abſurdity</hi>!] whereas Sanctification being a real Work inward, that is certainly in Being which Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> Here it is plain that <hi>George Whitehead</hi> doth altogether deny Juſtification by that Outward Blood, or that it was the meritorious Cauſe of Salvation. And in this he agreeth with <hi>William Penn,</hi> that ſaith, <hi>One outward Thing cannot be the proper Figure or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of another; nor is it the way of Holy Scripture ſo to teach us. The Outward Lamb ſheweth forth the Inward Lamb. page</hi> 97. of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s part of the <hi>Chriſtian Quaker.</hi> And thus by his Doctrine, the Prieſts, or High-Prieſts under
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101188:19"/>
the Law, were no Type of Chriſt without; and we have no High-Prieſt without us in any Heavens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us: And that moſt Holy Place, made without Hands. into which the Man Chriſt is enter'd, that was ſignified by the High-Prieſt going once every Year into the moſt Holy Place, made with Hands, is not any Place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. The Body that Chriſt offer'd on the Croſs no more than the Blood, was no real Sacrifice without us, that made any real Atonement: But that only Sacrifice and Blood that makes the Atonement, is the Body and Blood of Chriſt within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note again.</hi> But why ſhould there be any Sacrifice or Atonement made by Chriſt within, to make Mens Peace with God, or ſatisfie Divine Juſtice; according to the Doctrine both of <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> more than without?</p>
            <p>It is altogether vain and ſuperfluous. Firſt let us hear <hi>William Penn</hi>'s <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing,, page</hi> 91.
<q>And forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors; where (ſaith he) nothing can be more obvious, than that which is forgiven is not
paid: And if it is our Duty to forgive without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction received, and that God is to forgive us as we forgive them; then is a Satisfaction <hi>totally excluded.</hi>
               </q>
Mark theſe Words; they deſerve to be put in Capital Letters. But if a Satisfaction be totally excluded, then there is no Satisfacton made by Chriſt within more than by Chriſt without, by his Doctrine. And again, Let us hear <hi>George Whitehead, page</hi> 51. <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within</hi>;
<q>Is it good Doctrine to ſay that God pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd God when he ſaw himſelf angry? <hi>For,</hi> ſays the Baptiſt, <hi>it was God-Man that did it,</hi> &amp;c. But tho' <hi>George Whitehead</hi> finds fault with the Expreſſion <hi>God-Man,</hi> as not being Scripture, yet <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> owneth it, ſaying, <hi>page</hi> 138. in his <hi>Collection</hi>; We prize the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man, to be precious unto us.</q>
And if <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſay by God-Man, <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> meaneth not Chriſt without, but Chriſt within, as I will not contradict that to be his meaning; for he blameth <hi>John Buni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> for ſaying, <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt leadeth to Chriſt without</hi>; and ſaith it is contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101188:20"/>
asketh his Reader whether this be not near to Popery, <hi>p.</hi> 306. But allowing that by <hi>Chriſt, God-Man, Edward Burroughs</hi> meant only Chriſt within. Where doth <hi>George Whitehead</hi> find ſuch an Expreſſion in Scripture for Chriſt his being God-Man within, but not God-Man without? And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according both to <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> no Satisfaction is needful to ſatisfie God for the Debt of Men's Sins, for that would hinder free Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Why do they both juſtifie <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Saying, <hi>Chriſt in us offereth himſelf a living Sacrifice to God for us, by which the Wrath of God is appeaſed to us</hi>? See <hi>George Whitehead, page</hi> 44. <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within</hi>; and <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Rejoinder to <hi>John Faldo, page</hi> 284. where he not only juſtifieth <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Words, but labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to confirm them, ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt offers himſelf in his Children, in the Nature of a Mediating Sacrifice.</hi> But here it is fit to ask <hi>William Penn</hi> ſome Queſtions: If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be totally excluded, becauſe a Sin or Debt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both paid or forgiven, what need is there of a Mediating Sacrifice of Chriſt within Men more than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Seeing it is the Nature of all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for Sin, that they be ſlain, and their Blood ſhed, how is Chriſt ſlain in his Children, and when? for we read in Scripture, that Chriſt liveth in the Faithful, as he did in <hi>Paul,</hi> but not that he is ſlain in them. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> If any ſlay the Life of Chriſt in them by their Sins, doth not that hinder the Life to be a Sacrifice by <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi>'s Argument; That the killing of Chriſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly being the Act of wicked Men, could be no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Act? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Where doth the Scripture ſay Chriſt offers up himſelf in his Children a Sacrifice for Sin? <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Is not this to make many Sacrifices, or at leaſt to ſay that Chriſt offers himſelf often, yea Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of times; contrary to Scripture, that ſaith, <hi>Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up himſelf once? Sixthly,</hi> Why could no beaſt under the Law that had a Blemiſh be offer'd, but to ſignifie that Chriſt was to offer up himſelf in no other Body but that which was without all Sin? <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Why was it propheſied of Chriſt, <hi>A Body haſt thou prepared me</hi>; why not <hi>Bodies many,</hi> if he offer up himſelf in the Bodies of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101188:20"/>
all the Saints? <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Is not this to make the Sacrifice of Chriſt in his own Body of leſs Value and Efficacy than his Sacrifice in <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Body? Becauſe the Sacrifice of Chriſt in that Body that was offer'd at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> was a Type, but this in <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Body the Antitype; That the Hiſtory, This the Myſtery <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>As he calls it in. Anſwer to</hi> John Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note>. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Doth not this ſtrengthen the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their falſe Faith, That Chriſt is daily offer'd in the Maſs and unbloody Sacrifice? But <hi>whereas William Penn</hi> argueth, That as Chriſt, or the Spirit, Prayeth, or maketh Interceſſion in the Saints, why doth he not alſo offer up himſelf in them? The Anſwer is eaſie; The one is expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Scripture: The other not; nor is ſo much as to be proved by any juſt Conſequence, in a ſtrict ſence of the Word <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; for it is not the Work of the Mediatory Spirit of Chriſt in the Saints, to offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice in Men, but to apply the Vertue, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Efficacy of that Sacrifice of Chriſt outwardly offer'd to the Souls of Men for the Remiſſion of Sin, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification before God, and Peace with God. And tho' it is ſaid in Scripture, that <hi>Chriſt remaineth a Prieſt for ever, and he is the Propitiation for our Sins,</hi> yet it is not ſaid he is ſo in us, but with the Father in Heaven: And we <hi>have a High-Priſt that is gone into Heaven.</hi> Nor do I judge it ſafe to allow any ſuch Unſcriptural Phraſe or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That Chriſt offereth up himſelf in us a Sacrifice in us, to appeaſe the Wrath of God, though Chriſt's Mediation in the Saints may be allow'd in a qualified Sence, but not in the nature of a Sacrifice, but in other reſpects, unleſs the Word <hi>Sacrifice</hi> or <hi>Offering</hi> be taken not to be an Offering for Sin; but more generally, and by way of Allegory, as the Prayers and Alms of the Saints are call'd Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> That in the Book of Homilies, <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Chriſt's Satisfaction for our Sins, is effectually anſwered at large, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in the <hi>Sermon of Salvation,</hi> Firſt Part. Where the Objection or Argument of <hi>William Penn,</hi> is in Matter and Effect duly and fully anſwered, according to Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That God by his great Wiſdom in this Myſtery of our Redemption, hath ſo tempered his Juſtice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101188:21"/>
and Mercy together, that he would neither by his Juſtice condemn us unto the Everlaſting Captivity of the Devil and his Priſon of Hell; Remedileſs for ever without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: nor by his Mercy deliver us clearly, without Juſtice or Payment of a juſt Ranſom. But with his endleſs Mercy he joined his moſt upright and equal Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> in his Reply to <hi>W. Burnet</hi> as above-cited, blameth him for attributing to the Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed upon the Croſs Firſt, <hi>Merit to Salvation,</hi> Secondly, <hi>Work to Sanctification.</hi> It is evident he owneth it to be neither.</p>
            <p>But as he is moſt highly jurious to that precious Blood, and to him that gave it for us; ſo he moſt unfairly chargeth <hi>W. Burnet</hi> with ſaying, <hi>God could not ſave, and ſo ſetting up that Blood above God.</hi> For <hi>W. Burnet</hi>'s plain Senſe was, as is obvious, (more eſpecially to him that ſhall read his Book), That Chriſt as God, <hi>without being Man as well as God,</hi> could not ſave us; he having appointed to ſave us, not without, but by the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Scripture teſtifieth, which chargeth no Imperfection or Impotency any more upon God, than to ſay God cannot lye, nor do any thing contrary to his Holy Council and Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And it is groſs Ignorance and Errour in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> to make it a Contradiction in <hi>William Burnet</hi> to ſay, as he chargeth him, <hi>p.</hi> 8.
<q>Men ought to look to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as he was there crucified, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to that Blood that was there ſhed for Juſtification.</q> And again to ſay, <q>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> that reſtoreth Man's Loſs, is both to be ſought and found in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> above the Clouds and Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this is no Contradiction, but a moſt neceſſary and comfortable Truth, as well as that God and Chriſt are to be found in our Hearts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it is wonderful Blindneſs and Inconſiderateneſs in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> as well as in many of his ignorant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom he hath been a great Means, by his unfound Books, to darken rather than to enlighten; not to conſider, That as God hath appointed divers ſubordinate Cauſes to work together in the producing of Natural Effects, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in Harmony together with himſelf, the greateſt and ſupreme Cauſe above all, who is in all, and through all:

So in the Work of our Salvation, God hath appointed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with himſelf, divers ſubordinate concurring Cauſes, to effect and perfect it; ſo as that God himſelf is our Saviour, ſo he hath appointed Chriſt, even the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to be our Saviour together with himſelf; and the Blood, Death, and Sufferings of Chriſt, and his moſt Holy and Perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience teſtified thereby; alſo his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Mediation, without us, as well as the Work of his Spirit in us, together with the other much more inferiour, but yet greatly valuable and profitable, outward, inſtrumental Helps and Means, as the Holy Scripture, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in harmony to concurr together in the Work of our Salvation.</p>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Take notice of a late Book publiſhed againſt me by <hi>Th. Elwood</hi> call'd, <hi>Truth defended,</hi> &amp;c. (but whoſe true Name ſhould be <hi>Falſhood and Hypocriſie weakly defended</hi>) being a pretended Anſwer to my two late Books; the one detecting the Injuſtice of of their Excommunication againſt me, who were a leading Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Yearly Meeting of them call'd <hi>Quakers;</hi> the other detecting the unjuſt Proceedings of that Party at the ſaid Yearly Meeting, and giving a Liſt of the vile and groſs Errors of ſome of their principal Teachers, as <hi>George Whitehead, William Penn,</hi> &amp;c. To the which pretended Anſwer of <hi>Th. Elwood</hi> abovemention'd, as alſo to ſome of the chiefeſt of his Forgeries and Pretenſions, and groſs Abuſes in his former Book, call'd, <hi>A farther Diſcovery;</hi> it is probable a due Anſwer may be given in due time. But I thought it not proper to meddle with his ſaid Book in this Treatiſe, farther than to ſhow briefly in a few Lines, two or three ſilly Juggles which <hi>Thomas Elwood</hi> uſeth to cloak and excuſe ſome of his guilty Brethren.</p>
            <p>The firſt is in <hi>page 108.</hi> of his late Book, call'd, <hi>Truth defended,</hi> where to excuſe and cloak <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s moſt unſound and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Doctrine, ſaying, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>ſee no need of directing Men to the Type for the Antitype,</hi> viz. <hi>neither to the outward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor yet to</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>either to Jeſus Chriſt, or his Blood.</hi> He alledgeth it ſhould have been printed either <hi>for</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, or his Blood; the Word <hi>(to)</hi> there next before <hi>(Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> being through miſtake ſet inſtead of <hi>(for),</hi> which it ſhould have been; and in the Book, he ſaith, which he hath, he finds it hath been ſo amended with a Pen, and the former part of the Anſwer ſhews it ſhould have been ſo: But that this is a dull and ſilly Juggle, is eaſie to perceive; for, firſt, whereas he ſaith the Word <hi>(to)</hi> was through Miſtake ſet inſtead of <hi>(for),</hi> Who hath told him this? If <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> why did he not Name him? for he was the only proper Perſon to tell him this, being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe Words; and every Man is the beſt Corrector of his own Words. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who mended it in the Book he hath, and when was it amended? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why was not this Amendment made
<pb facs="tcp:101188:22"/>
in all the other Books or Copies, as well as that one? And how is it, that after Sixteen Years the Book hath been in print, we never heard of ſuch Amendment till now? And why was it not put in the Book as an Errour of the Preſs, ſeeing many leſs Errours are uſually corrected? But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Seeing not only we find the ſame Expreſſion elſewhere in that Book, but that it is a principal part of the Deſign of that whole Book, to take off People from looking to Jeſus Chriſt without, as be ſuffer'd at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to his Blood, as it was ſhed there for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as any will perceive that either ſeriouſly conſiders the Book it-ſelf, or the Paſſages cited out of it, it is manifeſt it was no Miſtake or Errour of the Preſs. Now that the ſame Expreſſion is elſewhere in that Book, ſee <hi>page 61.</hi> where he blames <hi>William Burnet</hi>'s Doctrine in theſe Words: <hi>Another while People muſt ſeek their Saviour above the Clouds and Firmament,</hi> page <hi>33.</hi> contrary to the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom. 10.6.</hi> Another while, <hi>they muſt look to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for Juſtification</hi> to <hi>the Blood that was there ſhed,</hi> page <hi>24. contrary</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to</hi> Deut. <hi>30.13, 14. and</hi> Rom. <hi>10.</hi> Note how he uſeth the Word <hi>to</hi> here, and in the ſame ſence as in <hi>page 38.</hi> And why did not <hi>Thomas Elwood</hi> tell us that place was alſo mended in his Book. And, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Amendment made by him helps not the Matter, the Word <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>for,</hi> in this reſpect and caſe having one ſignification: For to all true Chriſtian Ears, it is as offenſive to ſay, <hi>We are not to be directed to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the place where Chriſt ſuffer'd, for Jeſus Chriſt, or his Blood,</hi> as to ſay, to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, and his Blood</hi>; for all true Chriſtians, by Faith and pious Meditations, (though not by the Bodily Eye, which was not intended by <hi>William Burnet</hi>) are directed to look as well <hi>for</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as to him, as he suffer'd at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for their Sins, that God might pardon them upon ſincere Repentance, and Faith in Chriſt. And though the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a Type of Chriſt's Body, yet I no where find either in Scripture, or in any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Author, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, but it was the place whereabout he ſuffer'd and where he was ſentenc'd to Die; which is a weighty Circumſtance, neceſſary to be believ'd by them to whom it is preached, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt ſuffer'd for our ſins without the Gates of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> And though the Types are not to be practiſed, as ſome of the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> have in their Declarations ſhowed, how ſome of the Types pointed at the Spirit's Teachings, and inward Operations; and in that reſpect directed to the Type for the Antitype, why alſo may not, and ought not the like Directions or Inſtructions be uſed, to ſhow how the Types pointed to Chriſt without, us well as ſome of 'em pointed to the Spirit of Chriſt within, and to his inward Operations.</p>
            <p>A Second dull and ſilly Juggle of <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> and of <hi>George Whitehead</hi> alſo is, in their excuſing <hi>Solomon Eccle</hi>'s Blaſphemy, in ſaying, <hi>The Blood that was forc'd out of Chriſt's Side by the Spear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was no more than the Blood of another Saint</hi>; which they both ſeek to excuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and whoſe Excuſes I have ſhewn to be deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb facs="tcp:101188:23"/>
and may further ſhow): And to blind and hoodwink the Reader, they bring ſome of <hi>Solomon Eccle</hi>'s Words, wherein they ſay, he did ſpeak highly of the Blood of Chriſt, and new Covenant, as more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and Living, and Holy, and Precious, than is able to be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>&amp;c. and this,</hi> ſaith <hi>George Whitehead, might have ſatisfied any Spiritual or unbyaſſed Mind.</hi> But that this is thick and palpable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in <hi>George Whitehead</hi> firſt, and next in <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> is plain, becauſe in that very letter of <hi>Solomon Eccle</hi>'s cited by <hi>George Whitehead, Solomon Eccles</hi> maketh a diſtinction of Blood; and ſo doth <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> calling the Blood of the new Covenant, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> and <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> expreſly denieth that Blood that came out of Chriſt's Body, after he was dead, to be the Blood of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: So when he affirmeth the Blood of Chriſt to be more excellent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he tells plainly his meaning, that it was not that Blood that came out of his Side after he was dead; ſo this thick and palpable Deceit of both is diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what a poor and ſilly Off-come makes he to excuſe that moſt unchriſtian Saying of <hi>William Penn,</hi> viz. <hi>This Seed muſt be inward and Spiritual, ſince one outward Thing cannot be the proper Figure or Repreſentation of another; nor is it the Way of Holy Scripture ſo to teach us: The Outward Lamb ſhews forth the Inward Lamb:</hi> And whereas in Anſwer to this, I ſaid, <hi>If this be not a plain Denyal of Chriſt to be any outward Being, having any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Exiſtence without us, I know no Engliſh.</hi> All his Anſwer I can find to this, is a ſilly Joke: ſaying, <hi>For a</hi> Scotchman <hi>not to know</hi> Engliſh, <hi>is not ſo great a Wonder as it would have been if he had ſaid, he knew no</hi> Scottiſh: But until he give a better Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it remains as a great Reflection he caſts on the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> That the outward Types of the Law, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Sacrifices and Paſcal Lamb, were not Types of Chriſt without, but of the Lamb within; which, I am ſure, is not true Doctrine, neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor <hi>Scottiſh.</hi>
