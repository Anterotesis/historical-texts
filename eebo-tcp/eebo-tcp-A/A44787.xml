            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
Upon a late LIBEL, called
A Letter from a Person of Quality to his
Friend, concerning the
Kings Declaration, &amp;c</head>
            <p>WE live in an Age where ill humor and Malice to the Government do
so prevail, that men rail without any manner of distinction, and
without examining what things are good or bad in themselves;
there seemeth to be no other Rule allowed by one sort of Men,
than that they cannot Err, and the King cannot be in the Right:
This general Maxim is so easie, by taking the trouble of any further enquiry, that no
wonder if it is cherished and entertained; and those who are so prepossessed, are ready
to turn the best things to a wrong sense, and to receive such an interpretation of every
thing that comes from the Court, as their Misleaders are pleased to impose upon them.</p>
            <p>The Wiser sort of them knowing nothing is so destructive to their ends, as that the
Government should take such measures as might silence their Objections, have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to blast every thing that is done on that side, and to disfigure with the colours they
put upon them, all such things as might undeceive the People, and reconcile them to the
Crown; for at the same time they appear so eager to have Grievances redressed, their
more secret Prayers are that they may be increased: If the Court maketh any false steps,
or giveth any provocation, it raiseth Noise and Clamour, the voice against it is loud;
but the killing grief that afflicteth them inwardly, and galleth them to the soul, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when the King doth a gracious or a plausible Act to the Publick.</p>
            <p>Of this there cannot be a greater instance than their being so afflicted at the Kings
late Declaration: It was an evidence of their grief, that it was so long before they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
it: It was received with a silent indignation that the Court should presume to
out-argue them; and though they had rage enough to rail, yet they were for some time
restrained from their usual Dialect by the reverence that is due to Reason, even when it
is contrary to our Passions or Interests.</p>
            <p>At last when they saw the effect it had in the Nation, and being not without reason
apprehensive, that mens eyes might be so opened as to see them through their popular
Disguise, they thought of two ills, it was advisable to chuse the least; and rather than
lie under the general reproach of having nothing to say, they chose to venture a Reply,
though they could not make a good one, presuming upon the success they had met
with in their imposing upon the world, and believing it would be so favourably dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on their side, that where their false Arguments could not pass, they would at least
be connived at.</p>
            <p>This being after more than one Meeting resolved at a Consult, out cometh a Letter to
a Friend, which of late signifieth little less than a Proclamation set out by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the high and mighty Conservators of <hi>England,</hi> there is only this difference
which is for their advantage, that if these Letters take in the world, they are imputed
to the wisdom of these great Governors; if not, they are easily laid upon some foolish
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52153:2"/>
fellow that would be scribling; by which means the veneration due to these Princes
of the People remains unblemished and entire.</p>
            <p>This coming with other Pamphlets to me in the Country, I was tempted to make
some short Observations which are submitted to the censure of the unbyassed Reader.
First they are troubled, that though Parliaments are frequent, they are short and useless.</p>
            <p>The King hath done his part in calling Parliaments often, for which he is to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
except it can be made evident it was his fault that they were of no longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance:
so far from that, it is plain these men who complain have been so much the
cause of the late Dissolutions, that one would swear they designed to provoke the King
to them, and that he hath had in these cases so much patience, he can hardly answer it
to the Nation, whose peace he is entrusted with and bound to preserve.</p>
            <p>The Excesses of the Commons were beyond the cure of lower Remedies, and there
was no other choice left, than either to part with the Parliament, or let the two Houses
continue sitting in a state of Hostility hardly possible to be reconciled; of which the
consequences are so obvious, and might have been so fatal, that we are to thank God
the Constitution of the Government hath lodged this necessary Power in the Crown to
preserve us from Ruine upon such occasions.</p>
            <p>But fain they would have Parliaments sit as long as they please, and I cannot blame
them, Authority is sweet; and a Member of Parliament that would have us believe he
bringeth all the sense of his Country or Corporation along with him, cometh to teach
the King better manners, and to advise him to keep better company. I say for such a
dignified Creature as this is, by one word of the Kings mouth to be reduced into his own
single self again, is so cruel a change, that no wonder if men so degraded are angry at
it, and would be glad, instead of being as little men as their Neighbors, to gain that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
which Nature denied them, by virtue of an Authority to continue for their
lives.</p>
            <p>It seemeth then by this, that a long Parliament is not in it self a Grievance, for now
they would have one that they think their Party shall prevail in it.</p>
            <p>And it is observable that those who were for the first Long Parliament, and against the
second, are now the chief men that would have a third: How far this should recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the opinion either to the King or the Nation, I leave every man to judge; but
to do these men right, they are for the present so modest they will not speak out, so I
will do it for them.</p>
            <p>The little thing they would have is a House of Commons that may do what they will;
how they will, and as long as they will, that is for ever, whether the King liveth or
dieth, they must not be discomposed, nor their Authority interrupted, for I would fain
know where lieth the real difference between having a Parliament sit for ever, or till all
Grievances are redressed: the distinction will be very nice in an Age where it is Treason
against the People not to grumble against the Government. These rich Mines of Fears
and Jealousies can never be exhausted in our time, so that the Workmen are sure not
only to be employed for their lives, but to secure their Posterities being so after them.</p>
            <p>The Monarchy in the mean time would be in a good case to be under the continual
Wardship of such severe Guardians; and these very Gentlemen who have upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
occasion affirmed that the very name of King must of necessity carry the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
along with it, would not fail to give a full instance to the contrary, if they could
ever catch our Master in the Net of a Perpetual Parliament.</p>
            <p>They are troubled that the Declaration should be read in Churches, from which this
Observation naturally ariseth, that they apprehend the making it so publick, may both
expose them, and do the King right to the People; else sure they would not of a suddain
be so well natured, as to discourage the reading it, if they had thought the weakness of
the Argument might have brought any disadvantage upon the King.</p>
            <p>This Paper hath laid down Maxims that are very new in our Constitution, <hi>The King
can make no ill Orders because they must be by advice of his Council.</hi> This is a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Monarchy put so much into the <hi>Venetian</hi> shape, that a man would have
much ado to distinguish them.</p>
            <p>It will be granted that the King is to hear the Advice of his Council, but for him to
be bound by it, would make that greater than the Parliament; where if the King hath
right to refuse any Bill that is offered, sure he may in Council reject any Opinion. I am
confident it is not their meaning to attribute such an Authority to the present Council;
I am persuaded it is far from their thoughts to wish the King should be swayed by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52153:2"/>
of men who are so little in their favour, and especially since it wanteth the help of
those whose abilities and other Vertues in their opinion did formerly support it. This
Complement must therefore be intended for another Council, a confiding Council
that is to be made up with the rest of the New Model, we may suppose is prepared
against the <hi>Bill of Exclusion</hi> is pass'd, and then they do not care how much power they
give to themselves, or take away from the King.</p>
            <p>To excuse the not giving Money for <hi>Tangier,</hi> they pretend they could not be secure
of its being disposed to that use. It is hard they should expect the world should believe
them in this, when it is certain they do not believe themselves. The experience we have
had in our own time may sufficiently convince them of the injustice of that Objection;
and to say Paper Laws are nothing, is to say our Liberties and Properties are nothing,
since we hold them chiefly by that tenure: But the truth is, these men would impose upon
us, that an Act of Parliament will secure nothing they do not like, and do every thing
they have a mind to: For instance, <hi>An Act for excluding the Duke is all-sufficient. An
Act for limiting him Impossible. An Act of Exclusion will secure all. All other Laws are but
Cobwebs not to be relied upon.</hi> These Riddles are delivered to us with such authority, that
we are to receive them as Oracles, and it is become a mortal sin for any man to question
the sense of them.</p>
            <p>This slender way of reasoning being so openly liable to consutation, and the disguise
so thin that every body must see through it, they have recourse to that common place,
the <hi>PLOT,</hi> for a Butteress and a support to Arguments that are too weak to bear up
themselves.</p>
            <p>It is a retreat when they are beaten in Dispute, an answer to any question at a pinch;
it is but saying there is a horrid Plot against our Religion, the Kings Life is in danger,
the Pilgrims are coming from St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is to be murthered,
and the Popular Champion triumpheth without the help of Sense, against his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
That there hath been a Plot, is as certain, as that the men who most exclaim against
it are of all men living the most unwilling to part with it: they cherish and nurse it up
with more care than the Jesuites themselves; they hug it so fast, that it sheweth how
much they value it, as the dear instrument they make use of to destroy the Government.
The Day of Judgment would not be much more terrible to some men, how little soever
they are prepared for it, than that day which should wind up the bottom of this beloved
Plot, that men might come into their wits again. Ungrateful men then, that speak ill
of the only thing in this world that supporteth them; But the good men in their hearts
are far from meaning it any harm. Were the Plot once over, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
would be quite degraded, lose his respect at <hi>Wapping,</hi> and his authority in the Coffee-Houses.
His Lordship would put off his dissembling-shape, and in this be a true mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
for never man could have a greater loss, and no doubt it would out of grief make
him retire into some hidden corner, rather than see himself reduced to the miserable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of being quiet for want of sufficient matter to trouble himself and the world
with; so that when these men pretend to desire an end of the Plot, it is a Jest fitter for a
Smile than an Answer.</p>
            <p>It is said <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was a Rogue, granted, and yet as I hear, this Rogue was
brought into both Houses just before the Debate, to whip them up into the <hi>Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>
but now they tell a very strange thing, which is, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is become
truly honest. It is much, and in my opinion, it is a lower kind of Transubstantiation
to believe <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is honest, when nothing in visible but the Knave. That this man
should be made honest would be a mighty Cure, and such a one as some of his Doctors
would be loth to work upon themselves. In the mean time I cannot but put them in
mind that it looketh a little Popish, not only to give a general Indulgence to such a
known sinner, but immediately to make a Saint of him. If the Gathered Churches can
do such Miracles, it is well, but if they should endeavour to put false ones upon the
world, it might disparage their prudence, and lessen their reputation; of which I am so
tender, that in kindness to them I give them this warning of it.</p>
            <p>It is true that in some respects the Maxim is not inconvenient for these good men,
<hi>That there can be neither Fools nor Rascals on their side, and that the being of their opinion, like
the Crown, taketh away all Defects:</hi> By virtue of this charm Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> is a Divine, Mr.
<hi>Mountague</hi> a Protestant, Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> a Saint, Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> a Patriot, and Sir
<hi>Harry Capel</hi> a Statesman.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of the fears the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> hath for himself, and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52153:3"/>
good nature would be glad to ease him of them; in order to it, I beg of him to believe
the Papists are as tender of his life, as his Lordship is of the Plot: and for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because he is of use to them, he hath absolutely saved them by spoiling a good Plot,
and dressing it so scurvily by the help of his under-Cook, that now it maketh even the
best mens stomachs rise at it. He serveth up things so much above the strongest digestion,
that few men can be persuaded to swallow them. So that a man may affirm, that if it was
a folly in the Papists to kill Sir <hi>Edmond Godfrey,</hi> it would be a madness in them to hurt
the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Gentlemen are angry with the Guards which are so illegally kept up. Pray
since when are they judged so? is it only since the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was put away
from them? strange! that since that time there must be such a change, that he must be
made lawful, and they illegal. It must be confessed, that next to the Laws, the Guards
are the things of the world these men most hate: Fie upon them naughty fellows, rhey
stand between them and home. The good men would fain have a safe victory, and do
their business without venturing their skulls. For would it not be a cruel thing for an
honest well-meaning Mutineer for his Zeal to destroy the Government, whilst he is about
it, to have his brains knockt out; and so lose the benefit of spoiling the Aegyptians.
Verily it is much better to have the Guards down, that he may walk into <hi>Whitehal</hi> with
less peril of his person, and help to remove the Dukes Creatures out of all places Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and Civil.</p>
            <p>For be it known to all men by these presents, that the Duke is more dangerous to us
as he is the Great Minister of State, than as he is the next Successor. Say you so, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
men guessed before this was your meaning; but I am sorry for your sakes you
are so unwary as to discover it: Why such earnestness to remove the Successor, when
the danger is confessed to be greater from the Minister? Come, speak out, the Position is,
The Duke governeth all; consequently every man in employment is his Creature,
for that they are to be turned out, and these Gentlemen taken in: the design is well
enough laid, and would to them more good than the <hi>Bill of Exclusion,</hi> which is but a
pretence, and a thing fitted for other ends: But they did not do well to blab this out
before it was time, it is a thousand pities the Scheme should not take, but I very much
doubt it as things now stand, which is to be lamented, that the good men should have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
so much pains, and all likely to be to so little purpose.</p>
            <p>After having arraigned the Declaration, they come to justifie the proceedings of the
Commons in the two last Meetings, and speaking of some of their Addresses, say,
<hi>The nature, and true state of Affairs would not bear a milder way of representing things to
his Majesty.</hi> Let them speak truth, was it not rather the nature of those men, whose
pride and anger made them delight in handling the King roughly, and persuade the
House, when they were asked what should be done with <hi>Tangier,</hi> to answer with Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and a Remonstrance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I admire the caution of those <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good Men,</hi> who as the Paper
saith, <hi>thought the Commons had gone too far, insomuch as mentioning Money till our safety was
fully provided for.</hi> They must be very jealous that could suspect any such danger; for besides
that we are very safe in the management of those that led the House, who no doubt will
ever have a most particular care of us in these cases; one may assure the <hi>Wise and Good
Men</hi> of a further and better security, which is, that the Government is not yet so low as
to sell it self so cheap. As for what the Commons proposed, when-ever they have a
mind to deal, it is to be hoped they will offer some more equal Bargain, than to demand
from the King the whole power of the Crown both Civil and Military, and to propose
from themselves things so general, and so low, that the Supreme Wisdom of the Nation
could hardly be thought in earnest when they offered them.</p>
            <p>It is added for a further excuse that jealousies easily arise amongst Numbers, which is
enough to hinder any intended Agreement. The answer to this is, that it is true, there
did arise some jealousies, that the Promoters of an Agreement with the King did not
forget themselves in it; but the Gentlemen who were concerned being sensible of it,
did for their Vindication procure a solemn Vote, That no Member of the House should
receive any place from the King <hi>without the leave of the House,</hi> which was so perfect a
cure for jealousie, that they are unjust to be against all expedients, after this had been so
prosperous. I am half in a rapture, when I think of this glorious Vote, worthy to be
written in Letters of Gold, and impossible ever to be enough commended: By the first
part of it they shewed their self-denial, and by their second their deference to a House
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52153:3"/>
they thought at least they governed. Great men sure they must be, and blessed with so
happy genius, that could so mingle their Discretion with their Generosity, as at once to
gain honor, and provide for their interest. The answer to the Kings Charge upon them
for their Arbitrary Orders, is so weak and faint, that it cometh very near a confession of
their guilt in it, and it would be unkind to press them too hard in that which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
seem to be ashamed of. I will only take notice of one expression, which is, <hi>That
they have erred with their Fathers.</hi> If this is not true, it is no good Argument: and if it is
true, they must allow it to be as good a one for the Papists, as it is for the Commons.</p>
            <p>They come next to support their Votes against particular persons, and do very boldly
assert it may be made good by Law; <hi>The King ought to have no person near him who hath the
misfortune of such a Vote upon him.</hi> Great Lawyers no doubt have their part in this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but they who in so many cases dispute the Authority of the Crown, must allow men
in this to demur to theirs; and I am troubled that a Vote of the Commons must be
called a Misfortune; because it looketh as if chance or sudden heat, rather than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
Debates and Justice of the House had produced it. Where there is a setled Rule,
and that Right only prevaileth, as mens guilt maketh them fall, so their innocence ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth
them. But if men must depend upon their good or ill Stars, or upon the wasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
humor of an Assembly when an angry Planet reigneth, the consequence is, that a man
though never so faultless may by misfortune without guilt be transformed by a Vote, into
an enemy of King and Kingdom; that is to say, into a man fit to be knocked on the
head, and the Murtherer to be rewarded as the Law formerly directed for killing a Wolf;
and yet God forbid one should think the Commons intended him any harm.</p>
            <p>Well, but if the House declareth they have just reason to fear such or such a person
dangerous, must there be Order and Process of Law before he can be removed?</p>
            <p>When the Commons have just reason to fear such a thing, it is to be hoped the whole
House knoweth that just reason, or else they would not Vote it: when-ever therefore
they will tell that just reason to the King, he is to blame in case he findeth it so, if he
doth not comply with them; but if he judge otherwise, he hath as much right to refuse,
as they can pretend to have to ask. But if it must be so, that not only the real, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
fears of some angry men, who may have influence enough to mislead an Assembly
not sufficiently informed, are to have such an Authority, that the Kings Negative to them
is disallowed, it is such a change of the Constitution, that the Legislative Power is
wholly melted down into one of the parts that hath yet no power to do any Act that is
binding without the concurrence of the Lords, and the Kings Royal Assent.</p>
            <p>This doth so much out-go even our modern <hi>Plato,</hi> that it will be a harder matter than
perhaps these Gentlemen think, to get either the King or the Nation to consent to it. Men
are not so well edified with the practice of the Commons in this last Age, or the justice
that hath been usually distributed by their Sovereign Committees, as to devolve the
whole power into their hands, thinking it much better lodged where it is by the present
Constitution. But it is said the Commons by their late Methods do not fine men, nor
deprive them of Life, Liberty, Lands or Offices beneficial. I would first ask, is it not a
Fine, and to many men the worst kind of Fine, to be excluded from the lawful advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
every Subject is born to. Would not a Merchant think it a Fine, if he were sentenced
never to go to Sea again? Or to come nearer, Would not these very men of Law who
will have this pass upon us, take it unkindly, and think it a Fine, if they were excluded
from all Practice? 'Tis true, if they would always argue for their Clients; as they do now
for the Commons, their loss perhaps might not be very great; but presuming better
things of them, I conclude the sentence would be very heavy, and that they would think
it so.</p>
            <p>Concerning Life, if the definition of an enemy to King and Kingdom is certain crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is not fit to live, then the Commons have done all they can to take away the
lives of those they have so sentenced, except they had sent a select Committe to strangle
them, which had not been so convenient till the Laws are removed, which would have
made it Murther; so that they must either say that a man who doth what lieth in him to
kill me, meaneth no hurt to my life, which is but indifferent sense; or they must confess
there was plain Murther in the intention of those Votes.</p>
            <p>For to borrow their own stile, it may be resolved by the authority of impartial reason,
that whosoever Voted any of those persons enemies to King and Kingdom with any
other intent than that the said Persons should be absolutely destroyed, is a Mad-man, an
Ideot, a Promoter of Lunacy, and an enemy to Common Sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52153:4"/>
Then for Liberty, see whether that is touched or no. If Liberty signifieth a power
of doing every lawful act, and that it is a lawful act for every Subject to have access to
his Prince, then without some act committed to forfeit that common right, it is a wrong
in any one man, or any number of men to Address to the King for the incapacitating any
one man in this case. Sure men will not say our Liberty is not invaded except we are
thrown neck and heels into a Dungeon. It is a tenderer thing than that cometh to, and
it hath been formerly judged even by a House of Commons, that mens being sent away
against their wills upon Forein Employment, was a Confinement. By this it may appear
that it is possible to make an unjust Demand as well as to give an unjust Sentence: And
though the King hath power to refuse any thing that is asked of him, whatever some
men would persuade us to the contrary, yet that doth neither absolve the Commons,
nor any other man from the guilt of making a request that is not just, nor from the folly
of making one that is not pertinent.</p>
            <p>Let us see now whether even mens Lands would not have been reached by these Votes,
if these good Gentlemen might have had their will; for by the same rule that a true
Protestant Jury must have been directed by them not to find it Murther in any man to
kill an enemy to King and Kingdom, they must upon any dispute of title of Land, give
it without going from the Bar against any man so branded and proclaimed. Sure a <hi>French</hi>
or <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> at a time when they are in open War with us, would hardly hope to carry
a cause against an <hi>English-man</hi> in <hi>Westminster-Hall;</hi> no more is a man to pretend, whilst
under a Character that putteth him into a state of Hostility with <hi>England,</hi> to keep up a
suit against a Neighhor, or expect the benefit of the Law, which is to give no protection
to publick Enemies.</p>
            <p>As to Offices beneficial, it must be confessed they shew some gentleness at last, and give
so much indulgence to those they have displaced by their Votes, that I do not see but any
of them may upon due application, and expressive and fit remorse for the insolence of
resisting their high and mighty pleasure, be admitted to be a Constable or Headborough
in <hi>Wales</hi> or <hi>Cumberland,</hi> or some such unexpected Office in which <hi>the Publick State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
are not immediately concerned,</hi> where they may exercise their Magistracy, and enjoy
their dignity without prejudice to the Nation.</p>
            <p>This Grace seemeth the fitter to be acknowledged, not only because it is perhaps the
first evidence that party hath given of their good nature, but because they do in this
deal more gently with those against whom they have Voted, than they do with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
himself as well as they love him; for by what I can perceive, the King is only to eat
and drink, and perform some offices of nature. They are kind men; but it was not arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
done to leave it out, that <hi>A King is to have some Pocket-money for play things,</hi> since
it is but reasonable for them to use a thing kindly, which if they can have in their power,
they intend to make so good use of.</p>
            <p>That wise and great Princes have sometimes hearkened to Addresses of this kind, is
not truer, than that they have oftner denied them: for the King to do in all cases like a
wise and a great Prince, as it is a general proposition, all who do not know him have
reason to wish it, and all who do have very good grounds to hope it. But as far as one
sort of men may be concerned in their own particulars, I guess wrong, if it would not
be too fatal a thing to them ever to joyn in Prayer for it.</p>
            <p>The Votes to forbid men to lend the King money, are to these mens thinking not only
justifiable, but very wise ones too. These are Epithetes which it seemeth belong to every
thing they do, or else I would ask where is the Justice of doing that for which they
have no authority, or the Wisdom of doing that which hath no effect; only it sheweth
their good will, by throwing the greatest indignity they could upon the Government.
Men will lend still notwithstanding this mighty Vote, and perhaps upon easier terms
than these Gentlemen would require for any money they part with in Parliament. In the
mean time would these equitable men take it well, if by their example the King should
send to all the Burroughs and Counties in <hi>England</hi> not to chuse such and such men, nor
to trust those with a share in making Laws, who have in the late Parliaments assumed to
themselves the priviledge of breaking them? The argument is at least as strong on the
Kings side, without any Complement to Majesty, as they can pretend to make theirs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the pretence of distrust, or the mis-application of the Publick Money: and yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
my self, they would hardly allow such a proceeding, or commend it, as they do
their own, to be wise and justifiable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52153:4"/>
They take so much care of the Houshold, that one would ordinarily suspect they had
some Correspondence with the discontented Reformadoes of the <hi>Green-Cloth.</hi> I who live
in the Country will never speak against the smell of Beef, no more than I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that of Match to be at <hi>White-Hall</hi> instead of it: But I am far from apprehending
the Country Farmer to be concerned in the late Retrenchments; for ever since the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
were removed out of the Hall, and the Brewis turned into Fricassees, they have lost
their part in them, and especially since the Kings coming in, not only the Country Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but the Country Gentleman; and if you will the Country Lord too might have
been shrewdly disappointed if they had depended upon the Hospitality of the White-Staves
for a Dinner: That whole business was brought into so unpopular a shape, that
the Nation will hardly take up Arms to restore three or four Tables; they are rather
pleased to see them put down, since they were so transformed, and wholly altered from
their first institution.</p>
            <p>The Bankers are called the Bane of the Nation; if so, I have a great mind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
if it was possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was for that reason alone, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> broke them.
I never was partial to that sort of men, and so will leave them to make their own Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies:
but I must say, it seemeth a little hard to me to make these Positions, <hi>The Bankers
nor any body else must lend the King Money. The Kings Wants are only to be supplied by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Parliament is not to give the King a farthing.</hi> These laid together, have in my
judgment a very odd appearance: <hi>Ay, but the King shall have money enough upon good terms
from the Parliament:</hi> Shall he so? These good terms are to come; for those that have
hitherto been offered are so far from tempting, that they may rather fright the King
from dealing with the same Chapmen. Would these Gentlemen grow a little kinder and
treat for a Mortgage of the Crown, allowing equity of Redemption, it might incline
the King to hearken to them; but by all that appeareth yet, we may conclude nothing
less will satisfie than a total surrender and passing away his title to them.</p>
            <p>In the case of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it is pretended the Commons did not assume the power of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending
Acts of Parliament: what was it then? They did a thing they had a mind
to in a manner they cannot justifie; they have as much right to make a Law, as they
have singly to declare what is Law: but because they seem to give up the cause by
the flatness of their answer, I will only add, that as their zeal in this case transported
them beyond their bounds, it is to be hoped, time and second thoughts will reduce them
to a better temper against the next Meeting.</p>
            <p>In Mr. <hi>Fitz-barrls</hi>'s Case it is said the Commons could not come to a Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to a Resolution: suppose it, what then? must that Resolution of necessity
produce such Votes? If they had upon a cool Debate resolved that they were in the
right, and sent to confer with the Lords either to have brought them to their opinion,
or laid it aside if the Lords could have used arguments strong enough to convince them,
they had prevented all objection. But to say the Commons could not resolve this amongst
themselves without such injurious and unparliamentary terms as they were pleased to
make use of in their Votes, is to say, if I have a difference with another man, and would
discourse with him to compose it, I must needs for the better asserting my own right,
send him word beforehand, he is a Rogue and a Villain, as a fitting Preliminary for a
friendly Conference in order to an Agreement. For their Votes upon this occasion have,
as much as in them lay, put the House of Lords under an Interdict, and fixed such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
upon their whole Body, that if were not a little sanctified by that chosen Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Protesting Lords, I do not know but it might bear an Action, to be called by the
Scandalous name of a Peer, after a Sentence that putteth all the Lords in as i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as those few that in the former Parliament they bestowed their Votes upon. How
much soever these Gentlemen may flatter themselves in this matter, I can assure them,
we in the Country understand it otherwise than they would have us: for by the infinite
heat and strugling to put off his Tryal both in and since the Parliament, and by the
Character of the Persons who principally appear in it, we are apt to conclude so warm a
Contention must be grounded upon something very considerable; and we take it to be,
that could this point be gained, men might either speak or act Treason with impunity;
and that would be of such excellent use to some men, that no wonder if they are very
earnest to compass it.</p>
            <p>I am very glad to hear there is nothing to be said for those angry Men who have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
designs; if any thing could have been said, I am confident it might concern some
of those who have had a hand in this Paper, so far as to have persuaded them to venture
at their Apology.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52153:5"/>
There is an Assertion made with the modesty and truth which belongeth to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz. That all who are out of their places might have kept them.</hi> If I am either rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
or may be allowed to guess from what they deserved, it is perhaps the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
those men have for their ill manners, that from the prospect they had of being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, they chose to prevent the Kings Justice, and to gain popularity, by endeavouring
asmuch as in them lay to threw the affront upon him.</p>
            <p>The Court hath long lain under the scandal of Popery, but it was news to me
that they were for a Common-wealth too: This is so very unlikely, that for the sake of
our Religion which dependeth so much upon their credit, I must give them warning to
be a little more cautious in their Accusations, and take care that one part of their charge
may agree with another; else as it happeneth to their <hi>Mufti</hi> Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> men will be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
by their alledging things impossible, to have doubts even of that part of their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which may be true.</p>
            <p>The last Paragraph telleth us <hi>how we shall be happy; and the King be himself.</hi> I was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to know this receipt, having a great mind for my own sake, and for every bodies else,
to have such a thing compassed; but by taking the sense of the words as well as I can,
it is no more than this in short: All will be well if the King will be entirely governed
by the House of Commons; for we know they alone signifie the Parliament, as they
have more than once given us to understand by their Votes: and that their Advices are
to be Commands, is no more a doubt, than that their Orders are to be Laws. I shall
give no answer to this, but may be permitted to guess the Kings will be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

In the mean time I have so great a desire to be happy my self, and that the Nation may
be so too, that if any thing may be received under the unwelcome name of Expedients,
I would beg leave to offer a few to their better consideration.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That no man who hath by notoriety of the fact within seven years last past promoted or
connived at Popery, be thought now in earnest when he bawleth against it, or ever be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Publick Employment.</item>
               <item>II. That no man who hath Principles against all Kings, may pretend to advise Ours.</item>
               <item>III. That none who would have Places for themselves, shall have any Vote to put others out
of them.</item>
               <item>IV. That none who have thought fit to leave the Council, should ever so disparage themselves
as to return into it.</item>
               <item>V. That none may ever be thought fit for Counsellors, or any other Employment, who have so
little wit as to expect the Nation should be angry with the King, because they are afraid
for themselves.</item>
               <item>VI. That no Member of either House who in former Parliaments never consulted his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
be now allowed to be a Martyr for it.</item>
               <item>VII. That no man who is a known Ass in his own business, may be thought fit to meddle
with the Kings.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These things being granted, it is clearly my opinion, the King should stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the next Parliament can ask of him. Mens minds would be so quieted when
they saw a Foundation laid of such impartial Justice, that we might hope for Peace and
Union; and when the Vizzard of Popularity is taken off, to see <hi>England</hi> look like it
self again. This is to be desired for many reasons; and besides those which relate to
the Publick, I wish it for a particular satisfaction to my self, who being void either of
the ambition or the merit of pretending to any share in business, should think my self
very happy in the enjoyment of those mens Conversations, whose Politicks I cannot so
well agree with, being confident that this would be a kind of Act of Exclusion upon
these measures, and that the greatest number of the complaining men would be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and unemployed.</p>
