            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEcauſe the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> is a weighty thing; and there have been (and ſtill are) ſo many Errors about it, and the Errors therein are of ſuch dangerous conſequence, both in relation to mens Eternal Eſtate hereafter, and to their right Conſtitution, Peace and Welfare in this World: and becauſe I have had deep experience concerning the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> from a Child, having travelled in ſpirit with my God for the right knowledge thereof, and in ſingleneſs of heart giving up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, according as he hath taught and led my poor, needy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ſoul: I ſay, Therefore is it on my heart, to anſwer ſome few <hi>Queſtions</hi> concerning the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> for the ſervice of ſuch, as both deſire and need inſtruction therein.</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">

                  <hi>Queſt. 1.</hi> Who is the Worſhipper, the acceptable Worſhipper in the ſight of God? Or whom hath God choſen out, to hold forth his Worſhip in the ſight of the World, ſince he rejected the Jews with their Worſhip.</head>
               <p>That God hath appointed a choſen People to Worſhip him, that I preſuppoſe: though, if need were, the proof thereof might be ready at hand. It is not every man that would thruſt himſelf upon the Lord, whom the Lord will accept: but <hi>the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> John 4. 23. There is a capacity to be found in man, to make him a Worſhipper, even ſuch a capacity, as may enable him to perform that Worſhip, which God requireth of him. Now that is the thing to be enquired into, <hi>What this capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is, and who are the perſons that are found in this capacity?</hi>

that is drawn out of the dark ſpirit of this World, and formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in the light of God's Spirit. He that is a <hi>Jew inward,</hi> he that hath the Uncircumciſion of his heart cut off by the power of God. This is the Worſhipper, whom <hi>the Father ſeeks to worſhip him.</hi> This is the ſort of Worſhippers God choſe, when he caſt off the Jews. God did not chuſe any one Nation, or many Nations, inſtead of that one which he caſt off: but he ſent his Apoſtles and Miniſters among all Nations, to gather a Spiritual ſeed inſtead of the natural. And theſe alone are capable of ſetting up, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his ſpiritual Worſhip unto the World, and to provoke them to wait for, and preſs towards the capacity of coming into the ſame ſpiritual Worſhip with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The only place of Worſhip in the New-Teſtament, is where the Spiritual Worſhippers meet together. The place is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. As the Worſhip is ſpiritual: ſo is the place where it is to be offered. It hath a ſpiritual conſideration, not outward as under the Law. It is to be offered in the Spirit, that's the place. Where doth my ſoul offer its private Worſhip to God? Hath it relation to any outward place? Or is it in the building, which God hath reared up in my heart by his Spirit? which building ſtands in, and is comprehended in his Spirit. And I can offer his publick Worſhip in no other place, but in a building of the ſame nature, in an houſe built of more of the ſame Stones. This then is the way of Worſhip in the true Light; Divers living Stones meeting together, every one retiring in Spirit into the living Name, into the Power which begat them, they all meet in one and the ſame place, in one and the ſame Power, in one and the ſame fountain of Life: and here they bow down to the Father of Life, offering up living Sacrifices to him, and receiving the bread and water of Life from him, and feeding in the rich paſtures of his infinite Fulneſs. In the holy City, in the living Temple which is built by God, of the Stone which all other builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, is the place of the Worſhip of the living God, where the true Jews meet to offer up their ſpirits, ſouls and bodies, a living Sacrifice to the Father of Life, and where they meet with ſuch a glorious preſence and power of the Father, as none but the true Jews were ever acquainted with.</p>

               <head>Queſt. 3. <hi>What is the Worſhip, or what are the Sacrifices, which the true Worſhippers offer up to God, in this holy place?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Gifts of his Spirit. Theſe they offer up, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. The breathings which the Father gives into the heart of the Child, they are breathed back unto him in the ſame ſpirit of Life, in the living Senſe, in the quickening Power. Nothing of Man's Wiſdome, nothing of Man's Invention, nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Man's Will, nothing that would pleaſe the Fleſh, or ſeem glorious in its Eye, is offered up here: but the Exhortations or Directions, or Reproofs that ſpring up in God's Light, in God's Wiſdom, they are given forth in the Leadings, and by the Guidance of his Spirit, and they reach to the hearts of thoſe, to whom he pleaſeth to direct them. And this is the ground of ſuch meltings, and breakings, and convictions of ſoul (and ſuch like inward operations) as are frequently found in ſuch Aſſemblies. For the living God is there, and the dread of his Power over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads the hearts of ſuch, as are gathered into and aſſembled in his Name; and the Life ſprings in the earthen Veſſels, and the favour is precious to all that have their ſpiritual Senſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſeaſons of the true Worſhip ſtand in the Will of God. They are Gifts, and the time of them ſtands in the will of the Giver. <hi>Prayer</hi> is a Gift. A man cannot pray when he will: but he is to watch and to wait, when the Father will kindle in him living breathings towards himſelf. So the <hi>Word of God</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Exhortation or Inſtruction) is a Gift, which is to be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and then to be given forth in the life and ſtrength of that Spirit, which cauſeth it to ſpring. Indeed it is an hard matter either to ſpeak the Word of the Lord, or to hear the Word of the Lord. A man may eaſily ſpeak what he invents, and another may eaſily hear and judge of ſuch words: but to ſpeak the VVord of Life, requires the Tongue of the Learned in the language of God's Spirit; and to hear the VVord of Life, requires a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ear: and to know the times and ſeaſons of the Spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires both being begotten of the Spirit, and being acquainted with it.</p>
