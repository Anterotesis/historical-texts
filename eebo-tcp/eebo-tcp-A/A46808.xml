         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <opener>Moſt humbly Sheweth:</opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioner, is unfainedly ſorrowful for all his late miſcarriages, whether teſtified againſt him, or acknowledged by him, and for the great and ſinfull unſuitableneſs of them to his Calling and Condition. That upon earneſt ſeeking of God, and diligent inquiring into his will, your Petitioner is convinced, that the alteration of Civil Governments, are ordered by, and founded upon the wiſe and righteous Providences of God, who removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Kings, ruleth in the Kingdomes of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he will.</p>
               <p>That the providences of this God, have in the judgment of your Petitioner, as evidently appeared in the removing of others from, and inveſting your Honours with the Government of this Nation, as ever they appeared in the taking away, or beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Government in any Hiſtory of any Age in the world.</p>
               <p>That he apprehends that a refuſal to be ſubject to this preſent Authority, under the pretence of upholding the Title of any one upon Earth, is a refuſal to aquieſſe in the wiſe and righteous pleaſure of God, ſuch an oppoſing of the Government ſet up by the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and earth, as none can have peace, either in acting in, or ſuffering for; and that your Petitioner looks upon it as his Duty, to yeeld to this Authority, all active and chearful Obedience in the Lord, even for Conſcience ſake, to promiſe (he being required) truth and fidelity to it, and to hold forth the Grounds of his ſo doing to any, as God ſall call him thereunto.</p>
               <p>That though an Impriſonment, accompanied with the loſs of eſtate, and to be followed (without your gracious prevention) with a ſpeedy Arraignment, before an High and Eminent Judicatory, are farre from being pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood; and though the enjoyment of your Grace and Favour be a bleſſing moſt deſerving to be reckoned among the beſt of Temporals, yet that neither the feeling or fearing of the former, nor the expectation of the latter, could have induced your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt the light of his own judgment, and the prepondering part of his own Conſcience to have made, or preſented this acknowledgement; he ſadly forecaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a whole skin is but a contemptible recompence for a wounded Conſcience.</p>
               <p>That nevertheleſs (he truſteth) he ſhall be excutable in tendring thus far, even his outward condition, as to repreſent to your Honours, that he is in moſt apparent danger of his irreparable loſs of his health (the ſweeteſt of outward bleſſings) unleſs by your gracious Grant, be may ſpeedily enjoy a more free and open Ayre, then this his cloſe confinement will allow him.</p>
               <p>And this Chriſtian Favour (which even for Chriſts ſake your poor Petitioner moſt humbly begs) your Honours are as able to enlarge, even to a pardoning of his offences, and a perfect releaſing of him, from his impriſonment, as he is ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward in deſiring them, though confeſſedly far from deſerving them.</p>
               <p>He nevertheleſs promiſing, that your compaſſionate affording hereof, ſhall be a ſtrong and ſtanding engagement upon him, dayly beſeeching the heart-making, and heart-changing God, that all thoſe who either through former accuſtomedneſs, or preſent inadvertancy, do not clearly diſcern the minde of God concerning the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of this Government, may by obſerving your prime and pious induſtry, to advance throughout this Common-wealth, the power of godlineſs, a Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the Truth as it is in Jeſus, be won to a yielding to your Honours, conſcionable obedience, and not only in word, but in heart and life, may be true and faithful to this preſent Government.</p>
