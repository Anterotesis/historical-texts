            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Honest Answer to the late published <hi>Apologie for private Preaching.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO you whose ambition (not conformity) aimes to be the Elect) I write this Answer to your late printed Apology; with the confidence of <hi>Democritus</hi> I can as justly laugh at you, as hee did at the egregious crimes of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and (since you have with serious folly and devout ignorance) made your selves ridiculous, <hi>I</hi> hold it altogether unnecessary to write or speake of you but in the way of Mirth, which if your large eares will attend, you shall have so to the purpose, that if you were wise enough, you should laugh at your selves, at least at your follies.</p>
            <p>I commend your wisdome in forsaking Churches, for (as you have wisely chose it) a stable is fitter for you; and (to speake truth) a Tub is more necessary for a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler then a Pulpit, thus farre I hold with your Apologie; but, notwithstanding, if I prove you not all <hi>Mad men</hi> and <hi>Fooles,</hi> to maintaine the Proverbe, I will give you leave to ride me; the wisest man thinkes hee hath no knowledge, because there is so much to know: there were some hope of your Reformation, if you were but wise enough to know you are fooles: First, I will prove you <hi>Mad men;</hi> I shall make <hi>Fooles</hi> of you hereafter: (and that you'l say is impossible.) in the first place (according to my observation of the times; let a fellow come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb facs="tcp:65728:3"/>
you with some humourous <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> wherein <hi>Round-heads</hi> are mentioned, though there be neither Name nor Trade specified, nor no mans private Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrong'd, without <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> by a crew of men he knowes not, he must be beaten or kicked (as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moves you) from the place; and if such unlawfull violence have any relation to <hi>Religion</hi> I am an <hi>Heretick,</hi> all actions that tend to the maintenance of true piety are performed by Order; the Elements observe their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the Sunne, Moon, and Starres keepe their direct motions, (Creatures onely by <hi>Nature</hi> instructed) but <hi>Zeale</hi> in a <hi>Round-head</hi> is like fire given to a <hi>Granado,</hi> the strange Materials in disordered Flight, hazzard both Friend and Foe.</p>
            <p>Your desires and hopefull intentions to alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this glorious Kingdome, with the Lawes and Liberties of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> long since begun, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, confirmed and established by many pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will appeare like some curious and transcendent well erected Pallace, whom ignorance would race in hope to raise it better; but beware lest whilst you are delving in the Foundation, the loftie Structure fall not heavie on you; To you and none but you, whose unhallowed throats have belch'd profanenesse to the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi> doe I direct this language; to you that are uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed men, yet would confine a <hi>Monarch;</hi> what <hi>Order Rule, Edict,</hi> or <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> had you for your tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Confluence at <hi>Westminster?</hi> when men of all sorts and sizes that bore disorder in their expedition in a confused March were arm'd with hasty weapons of such various formes, as if they had newly come from the valiant <hi>Robbery</hi> of some old Magazine? when as <hi>I</hi> passed by them muffled in my Cloake unarmed (fearing no danger, cause <hi>I</hi> meant none) <hi>I</hi> heard them aske each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether or to what purpose they were going,
<pb facs="tcp:65728:3"/>
which question could scarce be resolved by one amongst ten; what was all this but madnesse, and what hath the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it beene but desolation ever since to all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties loyall and filiall fearing Subjects?</p>
            <p>But I am too serious; I have spoke so honestly, that I feare you understand me not: I shall now begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute your Apologie.</p>
            <p>Must knowing wel-bred men whose sacred houres have beene spent with much industry in the search of Holy Fathers for their Comments on the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be now (by ridiculous counsaile) brought to heare the Doctrine of an inspired <hi>Cobler,</hi> because he is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be at the mending hand, and brings his worke to good ends: or a <hi>Weaver,</hi> becaus Mans life is compared to a <hi>Shuttle;</hi> or a <hi>Tallow-chandler,</hi> because our lives goe out like a snuffe.</p>
            <p>Then againe, is there no difference betwixt Churches and Tavernes, Ale-houses, private Chambers, Stables, and such like places, is the <hi>Church</hi> lesse sacred, which is made odoriferous with the perfume of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall balme</hi> of <hi>Sinners teares, accepted Sighs</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Vowes;</hi> when our Saviour said, <hi>My House is called the House of Prayer, but you have made it a den of Theeves:</hi> Hee spoke neither of a Taverne, nor an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, but a <hi>Temple,</hi> consecrate to his <hi>Divinitie:</hi> What a ridiculous thing is it to see a Fellow with a starcht face scrue his body into twenty postures, sitting in a Tub, as if hee were moulding of Cockle-bread, yet is as zealous in this serious folly, as if hee thought he should goe quick to <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>Elishaes Chariot;</hi> but let me tell you that know not, this word <hi>Zeale</hi> doth not signifie <hi>Religion,</hi> but an Ardencie to any thing; I remember two Lines of my old Friend, Mr. <hi>Tho. Randolph,</hi> who sayes thus in a well-penn'd Poem of his:</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65728:4"/>
—where Heresie gets in,</l>
               <l>Zeale's but a coale to kindle greater Sinne.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Such Zeale is theirs, I'le not beleeve every man that dyes in the confirmation of his profession departeth tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious, because I see men daily more violent in the maintenance of unjust actions, then men Religious, whose patience is sufficient Fortitude, and can gaine a conquest without fury. I will now answer their plea of Divine Inspiration.</p>
            <p>They manifest to the world, that any Lay-man may be inspired by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Teach,</hi> and no man must be this Sanctified Temple but a Trades-man; they hold it almost impossible for a <hi>Scholler,</hi> indued with Coelestiall Knowledge, acquainted with the sacred lives of <hi>Saints,</hi> delivered to him by the pretious benefit of <hi>Study,</hi> in which the <hi>Arts</hi> assist him, to have the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of this <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> yet they are sure on't, that they dare judge and justifie; which rather shewes them fill'd with spirits diabolicall; since the sacred hand of the <hi>Eternall Maker</hi> hath rrevocably set downe, <hi>Iudge not lest you be judged;</hi> Let any honest man inform me what affinity there is with <hi>Divine Inspiration</hi> and these following Actions:</p>

With many great ills more, too tedious to relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to grievous too hear; if any man wil maintain these to be righteous actions, my reason is in a laborinth, and I shall be engaged to him for any light to lead me out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now I shall as well and as briefly as I can shew you the nice distinction between a Papist and a Brownist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Neither of them will take the Oath of Allegeance and Supremacy, there methinks they might agree like Traytors, and hang together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have both the trick of wresting Scripture to their own use.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Fryar is cut as <hi>Round</hi> as a <hi>Round-head,</hi> and hath as much Souse at each side of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Papist set up the picturcs of S. <hi>Augustine, S. Bernard,</hi> S. <hi>Chrisostome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Brownists</hi> wil set up <hi>St. B. St. Ba. St. P.</hi> Marry he will not come to auricular confession, as the Papist doth; because of an old proverb, <hi>confesse, &amp;c.</hi> I would the Land were clear of both, we might live all in peace, and in the true fear and worship of God, and observation of the Kings lawes; for to speak indifferently, they are equall Disturbers of the state, and a great injury to the weak and ignorant who are so distracted betwixt them both, they know not which side to hold with: so that some are to chuse their Religion, when they should be established, and confirmed in it, and able to instruct others?</p>
            <p>I will now conclude with a Comment on these lines, which are in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> in the administration of the old law.</p>
            <q>

What a strange contradiction is this Age guilty of, that is so far from the observation of this law, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily they conceive a man to be a <hi>Ruffiian</hi> or <hi>Reprobate</hi> that wears long haire.
