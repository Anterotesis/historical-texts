            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <item>1. <hi>That there is little hope for us in theſe times to prevail againſt Images, when as the Learned Writers in former times have ſo little prevailed againſt them.</hi>
               </item>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108755:4"/>
by them, that they have mouthes and ſpeak not, eyes and ſee not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it can be but a frivolous (fantastical, iconoclaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>piece of work to make any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe about ſuch poor things.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That now in the time of the Goſpel, the Church of God is at more liberty for the uſe of Images than it was in the time of the Law.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>That the preſent people of</hi> England, <hi>are of better strength and judgement than to worſhip Images, or to take any harm by them.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>That if any amongst us do ſometime a glance of honour unto Images, ſo it be but a Civil honour and not the Divine,</hi> (dulia <hi>and not</hi> latria) <hi>no juſt exception can be taken thereat.</hi>
               </item>

               <p>To the firſt, which pleadeth <hi>how little hope there is for us in theſe times to prevail againſt the ſtrong holds of Images</hi>; we anſwer, Firſt, That not onely a hope to prevail, but alſo an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of duty is a fair (if not the better) motive unto the attempting of buſineſſe: it being no diſpenſation unto the Dog to give over his barking becauſe the Thief will not be gone, but rather it lying upon him to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his barking, ſo much the more;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.5, 7.</note> and the Lord appointing his Prophets to ſpeak his words unto the people, whether they will hear them or not. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conſidering how the light fallings of weak water (<hi>Gutta cavat lapidem,</hi> &amp;c.) do in time make hollow the hardeſt flint; it is not a thing to be deſpaired of, but that our weak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations, if we can rightly level them upon the faces of theſe Images,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108755:5"/>
which the over-flowings of others have already ſo well waſhed upon, may pit and fret into them a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facement than hitherto hath befallen them; the latter droppings alwaies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the firſt dint in the flint, though never a whit more piercing than thoſe that fell before. Thirdly, one good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect we are ſure ſhall follow upon our pains, whether it be by writing or ſpeaking (yea, though it be but babling or ſcribling) and that is this; That in the mean time Falſhood ſhall not be able to preſcribe any peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion againſt the Truth, as long as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt us ſhall, though with never ſo ſtammering a tongue but babble, or never ſo ragged a quill but ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt the ſame. Yea, the perverſe world it ſelf ſhall reap ſome benefit by our ſuch babbling and ſcribbling; there being good hope for them, that the Lord will not come himſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to vindicate the Truth (which when he doth, fire and brimſtone muſt follow) as long as he ſhall obſerve any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108755:5"/>
of the ſons of men fighting for it, and that we have not utterly forſaken the field. And as for us the <hi>puſillus grex,</hi> and ſorry company of theſe babblers and ſcribblers (for ſo the induſtrious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders for the Truth uſe to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;) beſide the reward which the God of truth hath laid up for thoſe <hi>that ſell all they have</hi> toward the purchaſing of this <hi>pearl,</hi>

               <head>The <hi>2.</hi> Argument anſwered.</head>
               <p>The ſecond allegation toward the favouring and bearing with Images, is this, <hi>That every child being able to diſcern how ſuch kind of things have mouthes and ſpeak not, eyes and ſee not, &amp;c. it can be but a frivolous piece of work to make any buſineſſe about ſuch poor things.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer: If the Lord our God be a jealous God, and withall eſpecially jealous againſt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; what mortal man ſhall once dare to term it a frivolous piece of work to be never ſo cautelous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Images? For can we be too cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous or too timerous, how we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the jealouſie of the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God?

we admoniſh the Sonnes of men thereof.</p>
               <p>Touching therefore the firſt of them, namely, That the Lord is a jealous God; it is no more than the Scripture every where ſuppoſeth: And the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> when he ſaith that <hi>he putteth on Jealouſie like a Cloak,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us fairly to think, not only that the Lord is a jealous God, but alſo that he will be known and plainly profeſſe himſelf to be: the Cloak of a man being his moſt outward garment, and which doth, livery-wife, beſt make a man known from other men. Yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> goeth further, and maketh it no leſſe than one of the names of God, to be a Jealous God: For thus he ſaith, <hi>The Lord whoſe name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</hi>

                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 14.</note> Whereof alſo, finally, good reaſon may be given: For what more fit to make the name of a thing than that which is ſufficient to diſtinguiſh the thing from all other things of the ſame kind?

and that with the higheſt degree of love, the love of Jealouſie: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whatſoever the cauſe be; whether it be becauſe he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze the ſonnes of men with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitie of his love, or whether it be to make them the more watchfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver every thing that offereth to get into their love; whatſoever the cauſe be, ſo it is his pleaſure, and ſo he hath determined, even with no leſſe love than the love of Jealouſie to embrace the ſonnes of men.</p>
               <p>But now concerning our ſecond ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, namely, That the Lord is ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially jealous againſt Images: that we grant may well ſeem ſomthing ſtrange, eſpecially conſidering what a world of creatures there are which both have Images as well as theſe (whatſoever the eye ſeeth being an Image) and all ſuch kind of Images as may far better raviſh the beholders than theſe counterfeits poſſibly can. Notwithſtanding, firſt, thus much we are ſure of, That none of the Commandments are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108755:8"/>
upon his Jealouſie but onely that which is againſt Images; Thou ſhalt not make any kind of Images, &amp;c.— <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a Jealous God.</hi> Secondly, all the falſe Gods that ever were, what were they elſe (ordinarily) but Images? Thirdly, not onely the Images of honourable Creatures (as of Saints, Princes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, &amp;c.) and of profitable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as Kine, Oxen, Sheep, Horſes, Fowles, &amp;c.) but alſo of terrible and hatefull Creatures (as Lions, Dragons, Serpents, &amp;c.) and even of noyſome, common, and vile Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as Mice, Rats, Cats, Dogges, Worms, &amp;c.) have been made Gods of: Which may the more plainly convince, that not onely the thing ſignified by the Image, but alſo the Image it ſelf was the thing ſo deified and regarded. For though it be never ſo manifeſt that ſuch kinde of things have mouths and ſpeak not, eyes and ſee not, &amp;c. yet ſuch (who knoweth not?) is the perverſeneſs of man, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108755:8"/>
that if he once ſetteth on it, he will maintain, that not onely the thing that hath eyes and ſeeth not, &amp;c. but alſo the thing which neither ſeeth, nor hath eyes, nor any ſimilitude of eyes, is notwithſtanding a God: witneſs not only thoſe old Heathens, which made a plain ſtone their God,<note place="margin">Liv. dec. <hi>3.</hi> lib. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> and which alſo they called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem Deûm,</hi> the Mother-God; but alſo the Diſciples of Trent at this very day, which maintain that to be the very true God, which hath the perfect ſimilitude (at leaſt the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) of a Cake of Bread. For though all their wits and ſenſes do never ſo ſtrongly reclaim againſt ſuch monſtrous Poſitions; yet if they once ſet on it, they will be ſo far from relenting thereupon, as that they will rather double their reſiſtance ſo much the more, and make that a Principal argument that it muſt be ſo, becauſe their common ſenſe ſaith it cannot be ſo: Even juſt as they which <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>qui in illo figmento nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108755:9"/>

                  <hi>quia vitalem in eo motum non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debant</hi>; which kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument none but ſuch as had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be wilfully mad would ever make. Fourthly, we find, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture farre more frequent in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the making gods of Images and worſhipping them, than in making gods of any other kind of things and worſhipping them: And yet the making gods of other things is as much forbidden as the making gods of Images; even in the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other gods but me.</hi> A fifth reaſon why the Jealouſie of God may ſo eſpecially ſet it ſelf againſt Images, may be this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no kind of falſe gods be ſo fit for the purpoſes of falſe-prieſthoods as Image-gods be; namely, becauſe ſuch kind of gods may both be moſt eaſily contained in their Temples, under their locks and keye, and ſhall put them to little or no charge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to guard them (for they are not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108755:9"/>
worth the ſtealing away) or to find them daily meat &amp; drink (for there is no life in them;) they having alſo many concavities &amp; cells fit for wire-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, jugglings, and ſuch miraculous feats; and finally, being apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their full glitterings and beauties, and to make as fair a ſhew when they are rotten as when they were firſt made. Sixthly, there is no kind of falſe god which doth beget the mind of man with a more groſſe opinion of God and Religion than an Image-god: And that may be a ſpecial cauſe why the true God doth take ſuch indignation againſt Images. For when ſuch kind of things are eſteemed for gods as have eyes and ſee not, mouths &amp; ſpeak not, &amp;c. the beholders are given to think, that either there is not any true God at all; or if there be any, that he is ſome poor, brute, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thing, and ſuch as can do little good or harm: And thus much alſo a mere natural man, <hi>Varro,</hi> could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, when he ſaid, <hi>that the firſt ſetters
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108755:10"/>
forth of Gods by Images, did not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe errour, but alſo take away all fear of religion:</hi> whereof <hi>Auſtine</hi> giveth this fair reaſon,<note place="margin">Auguſt. De Civ. Dei <hi>4.31.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Quia facilè dii poſſunt in ſtoliditate ſimilacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum contemni,</hi> i.e. Becauſe the ſtolidity of Images made men think accordingly of their Gods. Moreover, there is no kind of falſe God ſo hard to be diſpoſſeſſed and caſt out of the heart of Man as theſe Image-gods. For whereas all men are at the firſt in the ſtate of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and ignorance, and Children and ignorant Perſons are moſt eaſily taken up with theſe Image-Gods: it ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that they take up the firſt and deepeſt rooms in the hearts of men; and ſo muſt needs be moſt hard to remove and caſt up again. Again, there is no kind of falſe God that doth more ſtrongly reſiſt the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the true God than theſe Image-gods: which may well be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecial cauſe of the true Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt them. For the true
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108755:10"/>
God being altogether inviſible, and taking up his manſion onely in the heart; and theſe Image-gods being nothing but viſible, and having no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidance but in the outward eye; it muſt needs be, that ſuch as have once been taken up with them, will very hardly be brought to brook and put confidence in the inviſible God. And though at length they be brought to acknowledge, that the true God is altogether inviſible; yet will it be a hard matter for them to put up a Prayer to that inviſible God, but theſe old wonted Images will obſtruct and infect the ſame: It being a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which <hi>Auſtine</hi> giveth, why the Heathens did rather direct their Prayers unto the Images of the Sunne or Sea, than unto the real Sunne or Sea it ſelf;<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. <hi>113.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe (ſaith he) they might think it more likely that the things which carry the ſimilitudes of men (as thoſe Images of the Sun and Sea, called <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> and <hi>Neptunus,</hi> did) ſhould hear
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108755:11"/>
their Prayers, than ſuch kind of things as had no ſimilitude, but either of an Orb, as the Sun hath; or of a wavie and undeterminate nature, as the Sea hath. Finally, when men will not ſtick to give incredible ſummes of mony for Images,<note place="margin">Plin. hist. Nat <hi>35.10.</hi>
                  </note> as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time twenty talents of gold, ſometime thirtie, fortie, fiftie, ſixty, eightie, and an hundred for an Image; hath not the Lord great reaſon to be Jealous of Images? For what more likely to become an Idol, than that which men eſteem at an unreaſonable rate; and that alſo notwithſtanding the Lord hath pronounced of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa</hi> 44 10.</note> that it is profitable for nothing? But to conclude, (for it would be an endleſſe piece of work to heap up all the probabilities that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for this purpoſe:) That which one of the Fathers affirmed of his times,<note place="margin">Lact. <hi>2.7.</hi>
                  </note> when he ſaith, <hi>Tanta homines imaginum cupiditas tenet, ut jam viliora ducantur illa quae

vera ſunt,</hi> i. e. So greatly are men enamoured upon Images, as that now-a-dayes the more true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things are, the more vile and baſe they are eſteemed: what age hath not found it true in their particular times? As if the ſonnes of men had a deſire to compare with their Maker, and to finde more excellencie in their own works than in his. Surely (may we not ſay?) the true and real Servants and Saints of God were not more eſteemed and reſpected when they lived, than their Images have been: And no doubt it will eaſily be granted, that when poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> himſelf would not be ſuffered to peep in at the doors, the picture of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall be advanced in the parlour. Laſt of all, Not only the Heathens in their times, but alſo the very people of God in their times, have they not continually doted upon, and run a Whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Images? Yea, and that alſo as well in the time of the Goſpel as in

For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the determination of God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his Church into a ſtate of mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a ſtate of maturity, and the ſtate of minority being that which was under the diſcipline of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; the Lord di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, when the time of the old Law began firſt to exſpire, we do not find that the primitive Church did take any more liberty for the uſe of Images than it did before; or that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry was eſteemed a leſſe ſin than it was before, but rather a greater;<note place="margin">Rev. <hi>21.8.</hi>

                  </note> the Church of God (as our Homilie at large declareth) would not endure ſo much as the ſight of Images in places where Gods name uſed to be called upon. Fourthly, the founder part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church have alwayes eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Decalogue to be of eternal force, and to be rooted in the Law of Creation, before any poſitive or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical legiſlation was: as alſo Gods puniſhing Idolatry in the old Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites which lived before the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and his promiſe to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand generations (the tenth part of which time the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not in force) may import. Finally, the Church of <hi>England</hi> at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually publiſheth a Law againſt the worſhipping of Images; and in her Commination pronounceth the firſt and laſt curſe againſt them that ſo do.

               <head>The <hi>4.</hi> Argument anſwered.</head>
               <p>The fourth allegation is this, <hi>That the preſent people of</hi> England <hi>are of better ſtrength and judgement than to worſhip Images, or to take any harm from ſuch kind of things.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer, Firſt, That ſo alſo ignorance and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conceit are far enough off from worſhipping Images, or taking any harm by them; witneſſe the brute Beaſts: it requiring oftentimes a good degree of underſtanding, to be ſo much as capable of ſome kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Yea, profaneneſs and irreligion will alſo neglect, deride, and ſpoyle Images as much as this ſtrength and judgement; witneſs <hi>Dionyſius, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh, Nero,</hi> and thoſe like Atheiſts.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108755:15"/>
For as when profane perſons hear one another ſwear by the blood and wounds of God, and are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereat; the cauſe why they are not moved, is not any ſtrength of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but only their ſympathizing with one another in profaneneſſe and irreligion. So likewiſe if any proceed not ſo far as to do reverence unto ſuch kind of Images as repreſent the wounds and paſſions of God, there is no neceſſity to think them ſo ſpecially ſtrong in religion; it being no more than incredulity alſo and irreligion may withhold them from. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ignorance, profaneneſſe and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, ſo alſo carnal policy and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation will make a ſhew of this kind of ſtrength; witneſſe thoſe Manichees in the time of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which out of this carnal policy, to win the Pagans unto their ſide againſt the ſound Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Contra Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. cap. <hi>13.</hi>

                     <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> which out of an affectation to be thought ſtrong men, would needs make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it to be preſent at thoſe Idol-feſtivals. Thirdly, admit it were out of ſome degree of ſound ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that our people at this day are ſo far from worſhipping Images; yet muſt this ſtrength needs be general? Shall we ſuppoſe that there are not any weak ones or little ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us? Or ſhall the weakeſt of our times be ſuppoſed wiſer and ſtronger than the wiſeſt or ſtrongeſt in former times? Thoſe antient <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians, Perſians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> from whom we have received our principal arts and ſciences; yea, the very people of God, unto their wiſeſt <hi>Solomon</hi>; yea, at this preſent day, the Papiſts (whoſe abilities in all kind of faculties, arts and ſciences, languages, antiquities, ſubtilties and policies, who doth not acknowledge?) have not all theſe fallen by Images?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108755:16"/>
And muſt all theſe, for ſtrength of brain and ripeneſſe of judgement, needs come ſhort of our little ones and very vulgar? For what though the truth be never ſo abundantly preached amongſt us? is every child as ready to hear a preacher as to gape and gaze at a picture? Admit alſo that preachers ſhould at all times ſo abound, and withall find ſo little to do, as to never leave calling upon men to beware of thoſe blocks which they wittingly caſt in their own way. Fourthly the Scripture (we know) judgeth covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be a worſhipping of Images;<note place="margin">Col. <hi>3.5.</hi>
                  </note> and the mere coveting of Images is a kind of covetouſneſſe no doubt: And are there none amongſt us which are culpable of that kind of covetouſneſs? Fifthly, admit that none of our people be obſerved to do any perceivable worſhip unto Images; no more doth the covetous man do any perceivable worſhip unto his money, but uſeth it as familiarly as any thing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108755:16"/>
in his Houſe; And yet the Scripture maketh him an Idolater. Finally,<note place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>5.5.</hi>
                  </note> if none of our people may be ſuppoſed to be ſo fooliſh or ſo weak as to worſhip I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, why do our Laws ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily and continually forbid them ſo to do? <hi>Thou ſhalt not bowe down to them, nor worſhip them,</hi> ſaith our Law; and, <hi>Lord, incline our hearts to keep this Law,</hi> anſwereth the people; and yet none of our people muſt be ſuppoſed ſo fooliſh as to break ſuch a Law! Surely, ſuperfluous muſt the Law needs be, and moſt frivolous the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of the people; or moſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous the Suppoſe. We conclude therefore, that as the Suppoſe is not eaſie to be granted, That our people are ſo far from worſhipping Images; ſo alſo were it granted, it would not thereupon follow, that therefore our people are of ſuch ſpecial ſtrength and judgement; it being no more than ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, profaneneſſe and irreligion, carnal policy and affectation have brought men unto.</p>

               <p>Touching the firſt ground of this our demonſtration, namely, That the Lords proper due muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of but by vertue of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs appointment: It is no more then the Law of the whole world doth acknowledge; no man upon earth eſteeming himſelf an owner of that which any beſides himſelf hath power to diſpoſe of: And therefore we ſhall not need to make any more words toward the eſtabliſhing of this ground, which the free-hold of the whole world is grounded upon.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe alſo our ſecond ground, namely, That all honour, glory and praiſe is due only unto the Lord; is as clear a principal, and needeth no more words to eſtabliſh it: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture every where ringing it in our ears, that unto him all honour, glory and praiſe is only due; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108755:18"/>
of his honour of neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing as much: For the honour of God cannot be infinite (as of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it muſt be) if any jote or ſcrat or ſcruple of any kinde of honour could be found not to belong unto him. Notwithſtanding, becauſe we finde in the Scripture how the Lord appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to give honour unto men; as namely, unto Parents, Maſters, Kings, Governours, &amp;c. whereby it may be imagined, that perhaps the Lord hath diſpoſſeſſed himſelf of ſome kinds and portions of honour: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for that it may be thought that ſome kindes of honour are too little, or common, or baſe to be preſented unto the Lord; and that therefore the ſonnes of men are at liberty to diſpoſe of thoſe kindes of honour as themſelves think good, and ſo (final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to their Images as they liſt: we therefore purpoſe to ſtay a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon this point; namely, untill we have declared, That neither Gods appointing us to give any kinds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108755:18"/>
unto men, is of force to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe himſelf thereof; nor again, that the littleneſſe or ſmallneſſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſſe of any kind of honour may be of force to exempt the ſame from belonging unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Touching then the firſt of theſe, namely, That the Lords appointing us to do any kinds of honour unto men, is not of force to diſpoſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereof, we prove; Becauſe the reſt of his gifts which he daily giveth unto men, as wiſdom, riches, power, authority, &amp;c. do not thereupon ceaſe to belong unto the Lord, but do ſtill remain in his dominion and property nevertheleſſe; even as the ſeed which the Husbandman ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in his field, doth nevertheleſſe belong unto the Husbandman. For as thoſe gifts of wiſdom, ſtrength, riches, &amp;c. ſo alſo the gifts and portions of honour which God beſtoweth upon men, both may be, and alſo muſt be improved unto the Lords final ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage: That being (no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108755:19"/>
doubt) the reaſon why our Saviour appointeth us to give unto <hi>Ceſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Ceſars</hi>; Becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe our <hi>Ceſars</hi> and Governours be ſtocked and furniſhed with ſuch por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of honour, authority, &amp;c. they ſhall not be able to bring up whole Kingdoms, Cities, Towns, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies unto the Lords final honour, as their office is to do. Secondly, if it had been the intent of the lord, to part finally with thoſe kinds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he appointeth us to give unto men; it had been neceſſary that thoſe kinds of honour ſhould have been ſpecified and laid out and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from thoſe kinds which were to be reſerved only unto the Lord: for elſe the ſonnes of men might hap in their mutual honouring one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to go beyond their bounds, and make bold with the Lords peculiar honour: But as we no-where find any ſuch ſpecification or partition; ſo alſo we may every-where find, how thoſe kinds of honour which are moſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108755:19"/>
likely to be proper unto God, as <hi>might, majeſty</hi> and <hi>dominion, fear and trembling, ſingleneſs of heart, &amp;c.</hi> are notwithſtanding allowed to be given unto men: As on the other ſide, thoſe kinds of honour which may be thought of a more common and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour nature, as <hi>obedience, love, ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thankfulneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding uſually called for to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto God. Thirdly, if thoſe kinds of honour which God alloweth us to perform unto men ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ceaſe to belong unto the Lord, by that means neither the honour of the eye, the tongue, the knee, yea nor of the heart, nor of the ſingleneſſe of the heart ſhould belong unto the Lord; becauſe with all theſe we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour men. We conclude therefore, That the Lords appointing us to give any kinds or portions of honour unto men (whether Kings, Parents, Maſters, &amp;c.) muſt not be of force to make us think that thoſe kinds of honour do thereupon ceaſe to belong unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:108755:20"/>And that the commonneſſe of any kind of honour is not of force to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it, or diſmiſſe it from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentable unto the Lord, even no more then the commonneſſe of coin doth make the coin leſſe preſentable unto the King, it will eaſily be granted. For as our receiving the Sacrament with that mouth wherewith we receive common meat, is no diſhonour unto the Sacrament; we having Gods Ordinance ſo to do: ſo likewiſe our honouring God with thoſe kindes of honour wherewith we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour men, needeth not to be feared as any diſhonour unto God; we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ordinance of God to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us ſo to do. But rather, as the money which we pay unto our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours aſſignees both may be and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt be as good money (for the quantity of it) as that which we pay unto the Creditour himſelf. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the honour which we perform unto Gods aſſignees (as Parents, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Maſters, &amp;c. are) both may be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108755:20"/>
and alſo muſt be (for the quantity of it) as good and ſound as that which we perform unto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Finally, that neither the littleneſſe (no more than the commonneſſe) of any kind of honour may be of force to diſmiſs it from preſenting it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, it is as eaſie (and no leſs material) to declare. For, firſt, if the littleneſſe of any kind of honour might be of force to put it by from being preſented unto the Lord; it would thereupon follow, that no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at all ſhould be preſented unto the Lord from the ſonnes of men. For all the Nations of men (the Scripture ſaith) are not onely mean and little,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17.</note> but alſo <hi>as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> yea, <hi>leſs than nothing</hi> in his eyes. Secondly, the Lord eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where profeſſeth himſelf the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Creatour of all things; and ſo ſtrictly ſtandeth upon his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive therein, as that (when time was) he would not ſuffer the pooreſt kinde
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108755:21"/>
of creatures that are (even lice) to own their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from any ſinger but his own.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.17, 18, 19.</note> Thirdly, the leaſt degree of humane honour (whereof only our queſtion is) doth it not of neceſſity contein the honour of the heart? it being ſcarce worthy the name of an honeſt action, much leſſe of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable action, which proceedeth not from the motion of the heart. But the heart we know, though it goeth alone, and is not accompanied with either knee, or tongue, or eye, or any bodily parts (for theſe are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes faſt bound by ſickneſſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, or neceſſary callings) yet is it allowed to have acceſſe unto the Lord, and to preſent him with ſuch ſighs, and grones, and ejaculations, and thanks, as it thinketh good. Fourthly, (that no ſacrilegious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may take up this trick of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Lord, by excuſing the neglect of it, by the littleneſſe or poorneſſe of it) the Lord himſelf hath ſaid it and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108755:21"/>
ſworn it, that <hi>unto him every knee ſhould bow:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45 23.</note> Which alſo he Apoſtle extending to the knees of <hi>things in Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. <hi>2.10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and things on Earth, and things creeping under the Earth</hi>; he giveth us fairly and plainly to know, that the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the nature of man, not onely may, but alſo muſt find a knee to bend unto him; our leaſt muſcles and knuckles, inclinations and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, having more compoſition than the nature of Angels, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than the nature of Worms and creeping things have. Yea <hi>the very hairs of your head are numbred,</hi> ſaith our Saviour:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30.</note> And therefore if the Lord keepeth a reckoning of our hairs, ſhall we think he will neglect the excellencies and honours of our ſubſtantial abilities? the leaſt lifting up of the eye, or the leaſt motion of the lip, being able to do God more honour then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of our hairs, who knoweth not? It is true indeed, the Lord
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108755:22"/>
ſometime rejecteth ſome kinds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the honour of the lips, the tongue, the eyes, &amp;c. but it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be ſmall and little, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that offer them are falſe and double, and think with their lip-labour to be quit of the Lord, and ſo to keep their hearts and ſubſtantial parts to themſelves: Even like unto deceitfull debtours, which with the tendring a ſmall ſum of money, intend to defeat their creditours of the main. For elſe, as the penny being as good ſilver as the pound, and having the Kings ſtamp as well as the pound, may not be rejected from bearing a part in the Kings tribute no more than the pound: So the tongue and the lips, and never ſo outward abilities, being the Workmanſhip of God, no leſſe than the parts moſt inward and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, may not be debarred from tendering their offices and ſervices unto the Lord, no more then the parts never ſo able and ſupreme: the withholding the leaſt of them being of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108755:22"/>
force to make our greateſt honours imperfect (as the want of a farthing may hinder the clearing of the debt;) and their acceſſe being of force to make the greateſt honours the greate; as the leaſt digit is of force to give an augmentation to the greateſt number. We conclude therefore, That as the Lords appointing us to perform di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of honour unto ſundry ſorts of men, is not of force to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe himſelf of thoſe honours; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, neither is the commonneſſe or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe of any kind of honour, of any force to exempt or diſmiſſe the ſame from belonging unto the Lord And ſo the firſt ground of our Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt certain and manifeſt, namely, That all kind of honour, glory and praiſe, of what degree or kind ſoever, is wholly and perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due only unto the Lord; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, That no degree or kind of honour whatſoever, may be given to any kind of creature (much leſſe to the Image of any kind of creature)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108755:23"/>
but only by vertue of the Lords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and ſpecial appointment; even no more than a creditours money may be payed unto any but ſuch as the creditour hath aſſigned to receive it.</p>
               <p>Now, that the Lord never aſſigned nor appointed any kind of honour to be done unto Images, we muſt take it for granted, and aſſuredly believe it, until we find his expreſſe word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand-writing for it. And leſt any ſhould buſie themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, and miſpend precious time about ſeeking for ſome Texts and parcels of Scripture to prove ſuch a matter, we ſhall give them a ſufficient <hi>Item</hi> to ſave them that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that is this: That unleſſe the Scriptures which they bring for the honouring of Images, be far more plain, peremptory, and abundant than any that can be brought for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of men (as Parents, Princes, Maſters, &amp;c.) they muſt not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And the reaſon of this our <hi>Item</hi> and <hi>Caveat</hi> is this; Becauſe men
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108755:23"/>
being reaſonable and underſtanding Creatures, and ſuch as are able to improve the honours that are done unto them, unto the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord; it is a thing not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible unto fleſh and blood, that ſome degrees and kindes of honour ſhould be done to them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few words from the mouth of God, or under his hand-writing, might be ſufficient for ſuch a purpoſe. But now for Images, which are moſt palpably void of all underſtanding, and utterly unable to improve the honour that is done unto them unto the Lords final advantage; it muſt needs be a thing moſt incredible unto fleſh and bloud, and contrary to all the rules of reaſon, that any honour ſhould be done unto them; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs we have moſt peremptory charge from God ſo to do, and that far more abundantly than ever we had for the honouring of men, it muſt not be done. But ſo far is the Scripture from ſuch ſuper-abundance of charge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108755:24"/>
for the honouring of Images, as that whereas it every-where (and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the Commandments) teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the honouring of men (as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Maſters, Kings, &amp;c.) it ſcarce once affordeth any ſhadow of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the honouring of Images: And therefore we may ſecurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the Lord did never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any jote or ſcrat of ſcruple of honour to be done unto them. And ſo our Demonſtration againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of civil honour unto Images, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant and compleat; The force whereof by the ſtrings of art may thus be contrived;</p>
               <p>That kinde of honour which the Owner of all honour did never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point us to give unto Images, muſt not be given unto Images.</p>
               <p>But the Civil honour is ſuch a kind of honour, as the Owner of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did never appoint us to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Images;</p>
               <p>Therefore the Civil honour muſt not be given unto Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108755:24"/>But becauſe every capacity is not apt to be faſtned upon by Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor ready enough to gather negatives from the the want of affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matives (though in all kinde of grants and conveyances betwixt man and man, the want of an affirmative is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſufficient) it hath therefore ſeemed good unto the indulgence of God, to declare his mind in this point to be expreſly negative: and that not only in general, when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the worſhipping of any thing <hi>which he hath not commanded</hi>;<note place="margin">Deut <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8.</note> 
                  <hi>My glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to graven Images</hi>; but alſo moſt eſpecially, and with his own mouth from Heaven, when he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bowe down to them nor worſhip them</hi>; there being no kind of honour, whether actual or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, real or perſonal, corporal or ſpiritual, natural or moral, domeſtick or civil, divine or humane, but may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108755:25"/>
eaſily be found moſt palpably forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in that ſhort clauſe. Yea, what kind of honour can be imagined but may be found denyed unto Images in the firſt half of that clauſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bowe down unto them</hi>? For all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being <hi>teſtimonium excellentiae,</hi> and attributing ſome degree of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the perſon unto whom it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it muſt needs be, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver giveth honour, doth with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome degree of <hi>bowing down</hi>: the attributing of excellency of neceſſity implying ſome bending, ſtouping and ſubmiſſion of the mind at leaſt. For though ſome degrees of <hi>bowing down</hi> do not proceed ſo far as to be viſible and outward, yet may they be true and real bowings down nevertheleſs: Even as well as there be many kinds of knees which are not bodily and viſible (as the knees of Spirits, Hearts, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) and yet are true and real knees even by the judgement of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, admit there were ſome kindes of honour which did not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108755:25"/>
imply a <hi>bowing down</hi> (at leaſt in the judgement of ſuch weak ones as know not bowing down, but that which is outward and viſible) yet when the Commandment addeth further, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou worſhip them,</hi> what could be ſaid more toward the barring them all poſſible honour whatſoever? Thirdly, in our Engliſh ſtyle, the title <hi>Worſhipfull</hi> is more common than the title <hi>Honourable,</hi> and inferiour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And therefore the things which muſt not be worſhipped, much leſſe may be honoured. Fourthly, if all honour include either <hi>a bowing down,</hi> or <hi>a doing worſhip,</hi> then much more muſt the Civil honour be found ſo to do: it being a neceſſary condition in the Civil honour, That it be not onely a true and real honour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that it be an outward and viſible honour; for elſe it cannot ſerve to diſtinguiſh one perſon from another, as the intent of Civil honour is to do. Fifthly, if by <hi>Civil honour</hi> we mean thoſe kinds of honour which paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108755:26"/>
man and man; ſo we ſhall both bow down to Images and worſhip them alſo, if we give them Civil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in that ſenſe: For unto men we uſually bow down, and term them <hi>Worſhipfull, Honourable, Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Majeſtical,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, Proſtration and Adoration (<hi>Nam civilis eſt adoratio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Andrews, Reſp ad Ballarm. Apol. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>quis neſcit?</hi>) have been eſteemed allowable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men. Sixthly, if by <hi>Civil honour</hi> we mean thoſe kinds of honour which are due to the Civil body, and the heads thereof; ſo the Civil honour ſhall contain a principal kind of honour. For if Parents and Maſters, which are but members of the Civil body, muſt be honoured with fear and trembling, and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart; then much more muſt the Civil body it ſelf, or ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſame, be ſo honoured. Again, if by <hi>Civil honour</hi> we mean only ſuch forms of honour as by local and civil Conſtitutions do paſſe for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of honour; ſuch as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108755:26"/>
peradventure the uncovering of the head may be eſteemed: (for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the head is not in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from the Woman-kind in no Nation, eſteemed as a doing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) yet we muſt know, that when once any ceremony is admitted for a form of honour, and is habituated thereunto, it muſt be eſteemed as a Civil <hi>knee</hi>; and the doing ſo much unto an Image, muſt be judged a <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down thereunto,</hi> and that of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler kind of knee. Finally, they that ſet forth the Civil honour by the term of <hi>dulia,</hi> with telling us that it is no Idolatry, unleſſe <hi>latria</hi> be given unto Images; they do but give us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of words, Greek and forein terms, for familiar and modern; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo the truth being obſcured and pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the means, their Idols may the better give us the ſlip. For the word <hi>dulia</hi> ſignifying <hi>ſervice,</hi> and all ſervice implying a bowing down; it is plain, that the giving ſo much unto Images, is a palpable bowing down
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108755:27"/>
unto them. Secondly, the word <hi>latria</hi> ſignifying only ſuch a kind of ſervice as conſiſteth in <hi>famulation</hi> and <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> which is the moſt eaſie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral kind of ſervice; it is plain, that if the giving ſo much unto Images be granted to be againſt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the giving ſo much as <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> is apt to ſignifie, is much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commandment. Thirdly, it is manifeſt in the Greek text, that <hi>dulia</hi> and <hi>latria</hi> are ordinarily uſed as words of one and the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that <hi>latria</hi> as uſually given unto men, and <hi>dulia</hi> as uſually unto God.<note place="margin">Repl. art. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> So as well might B. <hi>Jewel</hi> compare this diſtinction to that of the Phyſicians Wife, who when (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) ſhe had maintained that Pepper. was cold, and thereupon was oppoſed by ſome of the Wives, that it was hot enough in the mouth: ſhe ſalved the matter with this diſtinction, That though it was hot in <hi>working,</hi> yet it might be cold in <hi>operation</hi>; and ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108755:27"/>
with her learned diſtinction put all the women to a ſtamme, and with a ſtrong hand carried the cauſe: And ſo we may well think, that when this Image-worſhiping (or Image-honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) was firſt commended unto the world, and withall was oppoſed by thoſe that were faithfull unto the Commandment; the maintainers of it, partly being too great and too head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong to mend their errour, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not being impudent enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Commandment, and partly (finally) not being allowed to work otherwiſe than by Argument, at length drew forth theſe diſtinctions, That it was but a <hi>Civil</hi> honour, and not the <hi>Divine,</hi> only <hi>dulia</hi> and not <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> which they allowed unto Images: And ſo by the means of ſuch new and ſtrange terms, they put many of their oppoſers to a ſtamme; eſpecially ſuch as more loved the peace of the World than the peace of Conſcience, or thought it an imputation to their learning, not to underſtand Greek,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108755:28"/>
and far-fetcht diſtinctions, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſenſeleſs and impertinent. But when at length it grew moſt manifeſt, that through the gap of theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Commandment of God was not only notoriouſly incroached upon, but alſo in a manner trodden under foot; it was time for the ſervants of God to ſtand in the gap, and to reſiſt ſuch incroachers to the face. And for this cauſe, we for our part have taken the more pains about the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing up theſe diſtinctions; which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have been the ſpecial Ivy-tods where theſe Images have a long time harboured themſelves and bred their paddocks in; and whereunto, when at any time they have been cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, they have uſed to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as their onely ſanctuary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: which after they ſhall be once finally put by, they ſhall be plainly diſcovered to be ſtark-naked ſtocks and blocks, and not onely unworthy of any honour, but alſo moſt worthy to be thrown into the fire.</p>

               <p>The ſixth allegation is this; <hi>That Images are profitable for many good and holy uſes.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer, That Satan alſo may be found profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for many good uſes;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</note> for he is able <hi>to change him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an angel of light</hi>: and yet the children of God muſt have nothing to do with him.

                  </note> Yea, the principal advancers of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages (the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) will not admit of this kind of argument in their behalf; For though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Scripture to be both profitable and divine, yet will they not ſuffer thereupon that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be publiſhed. And yet the profitableneſs of the Scripture is incomparably more (were it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to make ſuch compariſons) than the profitableneſs of Images; and the danger incomparably leſſe; every Childe and Innocent being in danger to take harm by Images, whereas none but the perverſely minded are in danger to take harm by the ſincere, milken, divine, and grace-miniſtring Scriptures. Secondly, there being ſuch a profaneſſe in the heart of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108755:29"/>
man to ſin by Images, even to the making gods of them, or the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping them; it had need be ſome great weight of profit (no leſſe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture than the weight of neceſſity) that may make the uſe of them be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſo much as profitable. For though a man may catch fiſh with a golden hook, yet who will judge it a profitable courſe to fiſh with a golden hook? the loſſe of one golden hook being more than an hundred catchings will countervail. Yea, <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it were,</hi> ſaith our Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that the arts of painting,</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108755:30"/>
well aſſured whether the Jealouſie of God be not likely to be offended with our converſing with ſuch kinde of things. For the jealous Husband is not content with this, That his wife is a profitable wife, and a thrifty wife, and a chaſte wife, unleſſe ſhe alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraineth the companie of the man which her Husband hath profeſſed his jealouſie againſt; for the Husband that is not jealous, will expect ſo much at his wives hand, that ſhe be both profitable and chaſte alſo; And therefore the jealous Husband (and conſequently the Jealous God) muſt be further gratified than ſo. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it be found that the Lord is not only a Jealous God, but alſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Jealous againſt Images; then the profit which may (though lawfully) be made of Images, not onely ſhould be of no force with us to admit of them, but ſhould rather be of force with us to abandon them. For as a Subject whoſe Prince holdeth him in jealouſie concerning his Crown, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108755:30"/>
more good parts he hath, and the more popular he is, the more haſty ought the true ſubjects be to ſuppreſs him or abaſe him, rather than to make any ſpecial reckoning of him: So alſo theſe Images, it once it be found by them that the Lord ſtandeth in Jealouſie of them concerning his Honour and Throne, the more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and plauſible things they are ſuppoſed to be, the more ſpeedy ought the ſervants of God be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face them, rather than for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed uſefullneſſe to regard or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them.</p>

               <p>The ſeventh allegation is this; <hi>That Images are ſpecial good to give inſtruction.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer, That there is nothing in all the world ſo ſilly or ſo barren, but that ſome kernels of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction may be picked therefrom:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and lo, nettles had covered the face thereof,</hi> &amp;c.— <hi>I looked upon it, and received inſtruction.</hi> So that a very net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-buſh may prove a book of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that can turn ſuch kind of books: the wit of man being as apt to ſack intellectuals out of every thing it lighteth upon, as the Bee is able to contrive honey out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weeds. And ſo, no doubt, theſe Images may occaſion good meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſerve to put us in mind of things moſt excellent and divine; even as the ſight of a Stable or a Manger may move us to think upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and the conſideration of Sin or Satan may incline us unto devotion and thankſgiving: But that Images are <hi>ſpecial good to give inſtruction,</hi> (which is the queſtion) that we deny. For firſt, all the inſtruction which they afford is only concerning matters of fact; namely, that ſuch a thing was done (or ſuppoſed to be done) or that ſuch a perſon or creature there was: but whether the fact, perſon, or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108755:31"/>
creature, &amp;c. was good or bad, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be imitated or avoided; and what were the cauſes, ends, effects, and conſequents of ſuch things (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which kind of knowledge there can be no edifying inſtruction) they cannot ſay. Secondly, as the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Images afford, is only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of fact; ſo alſo do they not declare ſo much with any certainty, but rather they make things more uncertain than they were: things comming within the compaſſe of fables and fictions after once the Painters and Carvers (which think they may lye by authority) have had a hand in them. Thirdly, the inſtruction which they afford is only ſuch as the outward eye is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: For neither the ear (which is the principal door of inſtruction) nor any of the other ſenſes, are ſo much as capable of Image-inſtruction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is ſome kind of knowledge (we may grant) which cannot ſo readily be had as by Images: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108755:32"/>
what kind of countenance <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or the dead had; or perſons far remote have: But yet, as ſuch kind of knowledge can have no certainty in it (and what goodneſſe in knowledge without certainty?) ſo alſo were it never ſo certain, what is the beholder the better for it? For is he able to make his countenance according? Or if he could, what ſhould he be the better? For a fool may reſemble a wiſe man in the outward counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; a wicked man, a Saint; a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, a Prince; and yet remain wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, baſe, and fooliſh nevertheleſſe. Fourthly, as the inſtruction which Images afford, is common, uncertain, and ſuch as the outward eye only is ſenſible of; ſo alſo for the moſt part it is ſuch as none can make any thing of, but ſuch as knew the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For as one that is dumb, may perhaps with his becknings and nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and putting out his finger, do ſome common intelligence to ſuch as have wit enough to underſtand him:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108755:32"/>
ſo theſe Images, if they meet with one that loveth to ſtand ridling and ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſomething out of a wall or a gay, like enough they may ſeem to ſay ſomething;<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> hom. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> but elſe (as our Homily noteth out of <hi>Hierom</hi>) they do but <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze and dull the understanding of the unlearned, with their golden ſentences and eloquences,</hi> and ſo leave them. Fifthly, theſe Images do take up a great deal more roomth and breadth in the fanſie and outward ſences than needeth: For ſuch, we know, is the agility of humane capacity, as that it can upon the leaſt ſight of ordinary things (though it be but a ruſh about the finger, or the leaſt ſerole of letters upon a paper) be put in mind of things never ſo diſtant and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: ſo far is it from needing cluſters of Images, or whole pourtraitures, to be put in mind of common things. Sixthly, theſe Images do fret and eat into the fanſie and outward ſences more deeply and indelibly than other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108755:33"/>
courſes and means of inſtruction uſe to do. For as our table-books, the more deeply and hardly they be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon, the ſooner they are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and worn away: ſo our fanſie and outward ſenſes, the more deeply that notions be imprinted in them, the ſooner will their abraſity, voydable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and receptivity (which are the peculiar conditions of thoſe outward ſenſes) be diſtempered and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now, whereas voyces, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and other means of inſtruction (which do not wrap up their notions in Images) do readily paſſe through theſe common ſenſes; and having preſented their matter to the inward ſenſes, preſently vaniſh away; theſe Images do not ſo: but being ſuch kind of things as the fanſie and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes are apt to be tickled and pleaſed withall, they dally and play with them, and ſoke into them. And as idle Travellers turn their Innes into dwelling-houſes; ſo do theſe turn our table-books into paper-books,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108755:33"/>
and make (in a manner) their final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in thoſe faculties which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only for paſſage and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Moreover, by reaſon of this over-deep inheſion of theſe Images in the fanſie and outward ſenſes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe outward ſenſes are attrited, diſtempered and perverted by the means, but alſo the inward ſenſes are wronged and defrauded. For as our bodily meat, if it ſtick over toughly in the ſtomach, our inward veins and appetites muſt remain ſo much the longer empty and unſerved; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the nutriment of the mind (which is nothing but notions) the longer it is reteined in the outward ſenſes, the longer muſt our inward ſenſes remain jejune and without their ſuſtenance: It being a good reaſon which <hi>Seneca</hi> giveth, why he would have us well to <hi>digeſt</hi> our reading, Becauſe, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>84.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>alioquin in memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ibunt, non in inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi> i. e. otherwiſe they will ſtuff
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108755:34"/>
the memory, but the wit and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they will augment little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Yea, finally, by ſuch tough cleaving of the notions unto the fanſie and outward ſenſes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes ſhall not only be delayed and defrauded, but alſo vitiated and infected. For the inward ſenſes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to ſuſtein them but that which is conveyed unto them through the paſſages and conduits of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, if thoſe outward ſenſes be ſo ingrained and dyed (or rather daubed over) with thoſe glaring and infective notions, how ſhall it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, but that all the notions which paſſe through them will alſo taſt of the cask, and ſo feed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes with the like kind of gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, groſs, impure, fantaſtical, and in the end Idololatrical notions? So as this ſuppoſed moſt excellent property of Images, namely, for that they can ſo deeply imprint their notions in the memory and outward ſenſes, may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be eſteemed as a principal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108755:34"/>
againſt them, and enough to make all thoſe that deſire to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely (or but intellectually) mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to abandon them.</p>

               <head>The <hi>8.</hi> Argument anſwered.</head>
               <p>The eighth allegation is this; <hi>That they are ſpecial quickners of devotion.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer; If the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they afford, be ſo groſſe, common, uncertain, impure, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as we have declared; how can the devotion be any better which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth therefrom? For if we ſhould ſuppoſe that without the means of foregoing inſtruction they are able to beget us with devotion, ſuch a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were a right-down making gods of them; it being the property of God only, <hi>illabi menti,</hi> to touch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the ſoul without the means of ſome foregoing inſtruction preparing thereunto. Secondly, when at any time the Saints and Servants of God in their hymnes and ſongs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108755:35"/>
did cite <hi>all the works of God to bleſſe and praiſe the Lord,</hi> yet never did they ſay, <hi>O ye Images, bleſſe ye the Lord</hi>: though Images, being apt to make as fair a ſhew as the beſt, if they had been thought ſuch ſpecial quickners of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, how could they have been left out in thoſe general muſters, where not ſo much as <hi>Nights,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Worms</hi> are allowed to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Thirdly, the life and apple of true devotion conſiſting in nothing ſo much as in the immediate fruition of God; it muſt needs be, that the things which are moſt apt to further our devotion unto God, ſhould have moſt congruity with the nature and properties of God: But ſo have not Images; but are rather more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant from the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God than any other kinds of things whatſoever. For while the Lord calleth one way, what do they but call another way? while the Lord calleth inwardly, they call outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: while the Lord calleth to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108755:35"/>
they call to the circumference: while the Lord ſtandeth knocking at the door of the heart, they ſtand rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the door of the outward eye, and playing upon the ball thereof; whereat unleſſe they enter, their very life and being is at an end: Whereas the Lord, on the contrary, is ſo far from entring at that kind of door, as that when once he ſpake to his people face to face, the outward eye was not vouchſafed the leaſt glimpſe of his countenance, but a perpetual <hi>memento</hi> was given to the contrary,<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>4.12.</hi>
                  </note> that then they <hi>ſaw no ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi> but <hi>only heard a voice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

Yea, finally, not only in their conditions, operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and habitations, but alſo in their very natures, what more contrary than God and Images? For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord is altogether inviſible;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108755:36"/>
theſe Images are nothing elſe but viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Whereas the Lord is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible; theſe Images every childes eye can comprehend: As alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord is Almighty; theſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are the moſt mightleſs things that are: The Lord again is all Spirit and Life; but Images are worſe than dead; for the dead were once alive: Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord is all truth, but Images are all falſe and counterfeit: thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counted the moſt excellent Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which come neareſt unto the Life; and the nearer a thing commeth to the Life when it is moſt void of Life (<hi>mendacium quò veriſimilius eò nequius)</hi> being ſo much the worſe. But very like it will be anſwered againſt all that we have hitherto ſaid, That though Images have no congruity with the divine nature of God, yet well may they reſemble his humane nature, and ſo in that reſpect become ſo eſpecially operative unto devotion. Whereunto we anſwer; That if very living man upon earth doth incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108755:36"/>
more lively repreſent the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of God than any Image poſſibly can, then how can any Image be ſo ſpecial good for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Secondly, admit ſome picture could ſet forth the natural counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our Saviour more peculiarly than the countenance of any living man ever did (though who can be certain of any ſuch matter?) yet, we know, the vertue and efficacy of our Saviours incarnation did not conſiſt in this, that he was a man of ſuch or ſuch a countenance; but only in this, that he took mans nature upon him. Thirdly, the Scribes and Phariſees did well know his natural counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance indeed; as alſo they that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him: and yet they had no more devotion toward him than they that moſt mortally hated him. Fourthly,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> telling us, that <hi>if we had known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now muſt we know him ſo no more</hi>; even ſo much might be of ſufficient force to put us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108755:37"/>
beſide this groſſe conceit, That the picture of our Saviours natural coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is ſo ſpecially operative unto devotion. But (once more) very like it will be alledged, that the efficacy of ſuch a picture doth not conſiſt ſo much either in that it ſo repreſenteth his humane nature, or in that it ſo lively expreſſeth his natural counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as in this, that it ſetteth forth his death and ſufferings: And ſuch a kind of Image (called the <hi>Crucifix</hi>) hath been found by experience to be ſo powerfull unto devotion, as that many beholders have not been able to withhold from tears at the ſight thereof. Concerning which kind of Image, we deſire to be endured a while, until we make ſome what a large anſwer. Firſt therfore we demand who they are that ſuch kind of Images do ſo work upon, are they believers, or are they unbelievers? As for the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it is moſt like that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpiſe him that ſo ſuffered, than be moved to regard him (much leſſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108755:37"/>
to put confidence in him) thereupon: It being moſt likely in the eyes of fleſh and blood, that the perſon which ſo ſuffered was not ſo much as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon: or if ſo; yet that he was rather ſome poor wretch that was not able to ſave himſelf from the fury of his enemies, then ſuch an one as could with the leaſt breath of his mouth have deſtroyed all his enemies; there being nothing in the picture to lead him unto any better conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yea, if the unbelieving beholder be a malicious Infidel, the picture may move him to inſult over the God that ſo ſuffered, and to carry ſuch I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages about in his proceſſions and triumphs, the better to pleaſe and magnifie his own falſe gods. But if they muſt be onely believers which ſhall be ſo edified by thoſe kind of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; yet if there be other courſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nearer hand, which may more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abundantly put us in mind of thoſe ſufferings, then is not thy <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix</hi> ſo ſpeciall good for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108755:38"/>
which is the queſtion. For that ſhort Article of our Creed, <hi>He was crucified, dead, and buried, deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell,</hi> doth it not far more readily, plainly, certainly, abundantly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, and wholeſomely ſet forth the ſufferings of our Saviour, then the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage poſſibly can? Firſt, more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it doth: in that every child can have the Article ready at his fingers end; whereas the Image, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo portable, cannot alwayes be at hand. Secondly, more plainly it doth: in that it expreſſely telleth us who it was that ſo ſuffered; whereas the Image doth onely preſent unto us a man faſt nailed to a croſſe, but who the man was, or whether he was ſo much as an innocent or a malefactour, it is not able to ſay. Thirdly, more certainly it doth: in that the Article is the voice of God and of the whole Church of God; whereas the Image is but the device of men, and of ſuch kind of men as challenge a liberty to deceive. Fourthly, more abundantly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108755:38"/>
it doth: in that it informeth us that he was both <hi>crucified, dead</hi> and <hi>buried,</hi> and withal <hi>deſcended into Hell</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Image doth onely declare his crucifying, and no more. Finally, more ſecurely and without indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beholder it doth: namely, for that it preſenteth all theſe ſufferings and undergoings onely to the eare; whereas the Image preſenting them to the outward eye, and withall ſtill remaining conſtantly in ſight without vaniſhing away, is apt to detein the fancie of the beholder, and allure him to dwell upon it, and to imbrace, and perhaps to bemone it, and bedabble it with carnall tears, and to ſpeak unto it, and call upon it, and, Pigmalion-wiſe, to wiſh it alive, and in the end to bow down unto it, and worſhip it, and make a perfect Idol of it: For what more apt to become an Idol then ſuch an Image as is ſuppoſed to be a ſpeciall Image of our God, and from whence (as it were from a pap) men are appointed and wonted to ſuck their daily devotions!
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108755:39"/>
Moreover, as theſe kind of Images can adde nothing to the knowledge of the weakeſt believers concerning the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Saviour; ſo do they alſo greatly diſhonour, profane and vilifie thoſe infinite and unexpreſſable ſufferings of our Saviour: namely in this; in that they make no more of them then may be made of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of mortall men. For all they that at any time ſuffered the like death of the croſſe, if they had been pictured as they hung in their ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and torments, would they not have been more dolefull ſpectacles then any <hi>Crucifix</hi> did ever repreſent! The more wicked alſo the perſon is that ſo ſuffereth, the more diſmall and wofull the outward appearance of his pains being likelie to be. Yea, not onely the moſt precious ſufferings of our Saviour are profaned, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vilified by ſuch kind of vulgar and common expreſſions, but alſo his Majeſtie and Perſon is plainly belyed and blaſphemed by the means:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108755:39"/>
namely in this; that his perſon is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the view of the world, as hanging actually dead upon a croſſe, and double gibbet, whereas he now actually is, and for ever ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of God in the ſtate of eternall glory. And ſhall then ſuch kind of Images not onely be made of him, but alſo be commended unto his ſervants as the ſpeciall motives unto devotion? Or ſhall the tears which (belike) do flow from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of ſuch Images, be eſteemed ſuch undoubted arguments of ſuch devotions? As if there were not falſe tears, as well as true tears; blind and ſuperſtitious devotion, as well as that which is ſound and good! For if the Heathen, when they were at their ſuperſtitions, could <hi>mutuum stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porem alere,</hi> ſtupifie and amaze one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to ſee <hi>linteatum ſenem mediâ lucernam die praeferentem</hi>;<note place="margin">Seneca, De vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta beata, <hi>27.</hi>

alſo in the Church of God will be as active to caſt themſelves into the like ſits and pangs of Devotion, and that even to the expreſſion of tears! Or, at the beſt, is it not very like that ſuch kind of tears have no better Original then the tears of thoſe women had which ſo lamented when they ſaw our Saviour go to his Suffering? which, if our Saviour ſo rejected, when be bade them <hi>not weep for him, but weep for themſelves</hi>;<note place="margin">

But if thou haſt a deſire, O man, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thy God with a drink-offering of acceptable tears indeed; follow that counſel which he gave thoſe women, and weep not for him, but weep for thy ſelf. And if thou haſt a deſire to weep for thy ſelf, enter into thy ſelf, and behold thy ſin; for thy ſin is the onely Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108755:40"/>
of acceptable tears. And within thee thou maieſt moſt lively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy ſin flouriſhing in all the quarters and regiments of thy whole man: yea, if thou doſt but deſcend into the cellars of thine own hard heart, thou mayeſt ſee how from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the flintſtone thereof thy ſin bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth up, and fometh out, and playeth forth, and ſtreameth along continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So as, if thou haſt a deſire to weep rivers of tears for ſin, there thou ſhalt find continual materialls for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And in compariſon of this courſe, thy going to thine Image to help thee to weep for thy ſin, is a plain going about the buſh, and all one as if thou ſhouldeſt go to thy Phyſicians picture to move thee to lament thy ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, when as thou haſt a burning ague gnawing upon thee, which is the natural daughter, ſcourge and monitour of that thy ſurfeting and drunkenneſs. We conclude therefore, That as no kind of Images are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good (if any way good) for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108755:41"/>

(which kind of Images our Homilie judgeth to be moſt dangerous) are more like to bring us into the pits of perdition, then unto the ſprings of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and to plunge us in the lakes of Idolls, then to further us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fruition of the inviſible God: Whoſe <hi>coming,</hi> we know, <hi>is not with obſervation,</hi>

Spirit ſhall have lighted thee a candle therewith; and then thou ſhalt ſoon be able to kindle ſuch a fire in thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man, as the Almighty God (whom the Heavens cannot contein) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend unto, ſit with thee at, and ſup with thee by; and finally, prefer before all the flaſhes and wild-fire-works of mortal mans diviſing whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And now, Chriſtian Reader, you have as much as we promiſed in the beginning; namely, our Anſwers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Allegations in the behalf of Images which we then ſpecified. There be other arguments alſo which uſe to be made in their behalf, which deſerve to be no leſſe excepted againſt, and which we hope our ſelves to find a time to do; our Title, <hi>Toward the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Second Commandment,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes our door open for ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Theſe anſwers which we have premiſed, we take to be both ſound and ſafe, and agreeable with the Church of England; as alſo we are perſwaded that the Almighty God

will be pleaſed with the publication thereof: And therefore we commend the peruſal of them unto ſuch as have authority in that kind of buſineſs. And ſo we finally commend them, and our ſelves, and every indifferent Reader unto the Grace of God.</p>
