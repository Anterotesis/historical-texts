            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have Elected you as Members of the Common Councell of this City for our ſeverall precincts, to preſerve our Liberties, not inthrall them; to advance the Publique, not your private Intereſts: and therefore may juſtly challenge from you an Account what (as our Proxies) you have done to theſe Ends.</p>
            <p>We find the whole Kingdome groaning under the burden of an oppreſſing Army, preſenting their grievances to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whilſt our ſelves (as if the Intereſt of this City were diſ-joyned from the publique Concernment) is ready to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged againſt them; or (at leaſt) to ſtand Neutrall: and after ſo late a threatning of Fire and Plunder, to ſatisfie our ſelves with a <hi>ſhadow of ſecurity,</hi> by a pretended putting the <hi>Militia</hi> in the hands of the City, which is indeed, into ſuch hands as we, the Commoners of the City, cannot confide in: The Commander in chief being a Member of that Army, which ſo lately threatned us. And many others ſo particularly intereſſed, that we have much reaſon to doubt, they intend their owne, rather then the publique profit and Security.</p>
            <p>We therefore require you, in the Names of us, the <hi>Free-men</hi> of this City, by whom you are intruſted; forthwith to preſent to the Lord Major, Aldermen, and reſt of the Common Councell, theſe our deſires, and to endeavour to effect them:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they make a ſpeedy humble addreſſe by Petition to the two Honourable Houſes of Parliament, that all <hi>further effuſion of bloud,</hi> and Engagement in a New war be prevented, by a timely conceſſion to the cries and humble deſires of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>His Majeſty</hi> may ſpeedily be brought to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with Honour, Freedome, and Safety, to Treat Perſonally with His two Houſes for a ſafe, wel-grounded Peace, and ſetlement of Religion, according to His Majeſties preſentation made by the <hi>Hollands</hi> Ambaſſadours to both Houſes, 24 <hi>February.</hi> 1644. which we conceive to be agreeable to our Covenant, <hi>viz. That a Nationall Synod ſhall be Called, and all other Christian Churches admitted to ſend their Deputies; and what in our Religion ſhall be found diſconſonant to the Word of God in part, or whole, to be reformed according to the Word of God, and beſt Reformed Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Army under the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> may be forthwith Diſ-banded, their Arrears Audited, all juſt ſatisfaction given, and a generall <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> be ſought from HIS MAJESTY.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Country may be eaſed of Taxes, Aſſeſments, and Free-quarter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Exciſe and Aſſeſments of this City be either eaſed, or for the preſent, imployed onely for the ſecurity of the City.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Militia</hi> of this City be put into ſuch hands as this City ſhall confide in for their ſecurity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Colonels and Captains of the Trained Bands, and Auxiliaries, be Choſen by the Free-men of the City that are to ſerve under them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That none of the Trained Bands or Auxiliaries, of this City, be forced, or ſuffered to march out of this City, to engage in any New war, but to remain within the City for the defence of it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That no more Ingagements may be brought upon us, either to Combinations, Warre, or other Supplies thereon depending, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then according to the Laws and Statutes of the Land, and antient Cuſtomes of this City; and that ſuch tranſactions as have been contrary to the ſame in theſe late times of diſtractions may be Cancelled out of the Regiſter, and an Act paſſed, That they ſhall never more ſerve for a Principle to poſterity.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That there may be no more Liſting of our Children and Servants: for as we deteſt that late hypocriticall fiction of their private Liſting, ſo we utterly diſlike the publick Liſting of them, in regard we conceive thereby our Rights, and preſent ſubſiſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed, and the peace and Safety both of City and County endangered.</p>
            <p>Of theſe our Deſires, we expect a ſpeedy Account from you, or otherwiſe ſhall declare, That you have broke the truſt repoſed in you by us. And therefore we may, and ought to revoke our Election, and proteſt againſt whatſoever you ſhall doe or Act by vertue thereof, and conceive the ſame contrary to our peace and ſafety, who do find our ſelves bound by Chriſtian duty to provide for our Families by the peaceable following of our ſeverall vocations, which by lamentable experience we have found wofully obſtructed by the late Wars, which a Rebellious generation do now again indeavour to foment amongſt us; from whoſe wicked practiſes, we hope under God, by your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and provident indeavours to be preſerved.</p>
