            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>

            <p>THere are none so capable to judge of the truth of this <hi>Napolitan</hi> Story as your selves, who have so frequent Intelligence from that Countrey where it was acted; Therefore, I presume, no man will question my judgment for making this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I had some particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that induc'd me thereunto, in regard of those helps which I received from some Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Members of that <hi>Society,</hi> who favour'd me with the sight of divers of their <hi>Letters</hi> from time to time, and furnish'd me with
<pb facs="tcp:32004:3"/>
other <hi>advantages</hi> towards the compiling of this <hi>Piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Part you formerly had attended the <hi>Fisherman</hi> to his <hi>Greatness,</hi> and this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies him to his <hi>Grave.</hi> That blind instable <hi>Thing</hi> which we call <hi>Fortune</hi> never shew'd Her self more like Her self then She did in the handling of this man, whom in a very few days She rais'd to such a prodigious alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that the Great <hi>Turk</hi> was not more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> then he was in <hi>Naples.</hi> But afterwards, like a Statue of some course Stone, set up upon a high Marble pedestal or frame, she suffered him to fall down and dash himself to pieces.</p>
            <p>This second Part is nothing inferiour to the first in strangeness; and he who with a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous well-weigh'd judgment will meditate on the passages thereof, will confess that <hi>Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> never appeared more like <hi>Romances</hi> then in this Story: For it will tell you of above a hundred several Fights and Skirmishes that happen'd in <hi>Naples</hi> within the compass of about two Months time; how every Street was made Frontier one to another, and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by inches; how above fourscore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Cannon-bullets were shot from the three Castles, and twenty thousand from the
<pb facs="tcp:32004:3"/>
Town; A great number of stately Palaces, with invaluable rich Furniture, all turn'd to ashes by the fury of the <hi>Fire,</hi> and of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who may be said to be the more furious of the two. And indeed it cannot be denied but the people had some reason to be <hi>incens'd,</hi> in regard of those multitude of <hi>Gabels</hi> that were impos'd upon every thing; which <hi>Gabels</hi> had flown so high, that they had got up to the tops of the very <hi>Trees,</hi> among all sorts of Fruit; Insomuch that one may well say, the <hi>Napolitan Coursier</hi> was almost <hi>rid</hi> quite off of his <hi>legs,</hi> and his <hi>back</hi> so <hi>gall'd</hi> that upon the least <hi>rubbing</hi> he could not choose but <hi>winch, kick</hi> and <hi>flounce,</hi> which he did to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so that he had almost quite orethrown his <hi>Rider.</hi> Now, if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had lost <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> you know better then I, what an infinite detriment it had been unto him, it being one of the fairest <hi>Flowers</hi> in his <hi>Garden,</hi> one of the best <hi>patches</hi> upon his <hi>Pilgrims coat,</hi> as the <hi>Frenchman</hi> compares the <hi>squandred Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> For it is to be seen upon good account, how that this King and his Father have had above a hundred millions of crowns in meer Donatives from that Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the stable Rents and Perquisites of the Crown, which comes to near upon three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb facs="tcp:32004:4"/>
               <hi>per annum.</hi> Insomuch that it had been more advantagious for <hi>Spain</hi> that <hi>Massaniello</hi> had not been kill'd so soon; for had he lived a few days longer he had taken a course to raise five millions for the King in compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Gabels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, desiring again your gentle acceptance of this now<hi>-compleated Story,</hi> as a further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my respects unto you, I rest,</p>

            <p>IT is well known to the world what a high pitch of Power, and vast latitude of Dominion, the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> hath arriv'd unto in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a few years: The first step into this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was the Conjunction of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> by Marriage. The second was the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> which happen'd a little after. The third was an Alliance 'twixt the Houses of <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> whereby all <hi>Belgium,</hi> viz. <hi>The seventeen Provinces of the Low-Countreys,</hi> or the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> came to be united in a joynt Subjection to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles the Fifth,</hi> who attempted to heighten those Provinces to the Title of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but He, and his Son <hi>Philip the Second,</hi> after him, fail'd in the Design. The fourth step was the Conquest of <hi>Portugal</hi> (though an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Title was pretended) whereby <hi>Spain</hi> came to be Mistress of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and part of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> with sundry Islands in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, and divers strong Maritim holds in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32004:5"/>
Now, since the time that <hi>Spain</hi> came to this height by such a marvellous Celerity (for all these Accessions happen'd in less then fifty years, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Alliances,</hi> partly by <hi>Succession</hi> and <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> partly by <hi>Donation,</hi> and partly by right of <hi>Discovery</hi> and <hi>Conquest)</hi> I say, since these huge Accumulations of <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Territories,</hi> both in the old and new world.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The first Countrey that rose up and revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was <hi>Holland</hi> with her five considerate Provinces, which happen'd a little after the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The second was <hi>Catalonia,</hi> some twelve years since.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The third was the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which entirely fell off from him a little after, and setled it self under another King in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few dayes, in such a quietness as if it had been twenty years a doing.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> The last that banded against him were the Kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> which happen'd about four years since; but the fire of the first was quickly extinguisht; yet the flames there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of flew ore the <hi>Phare</hi> of <hi>Messina</hi> into <hi>Calabria,</hi> and so to <hi>Naples,</hi> where they grew to such a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that an utter revolt was intended.</p>
            <p>Touching the falling away of <hi>Holland,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:32004:5"/>
kept such a stirre in the world, the causes thereof may be comprehended in two words, <hi>viz. Inquisition</hi> and <hi>Imposition,</hi> the latter whereof conduc'd to wring the <hi>Purse,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catalonia</hi> flew off in regard of the free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Castilian Souldiers took, with other Insolencies they committed in their march to imbark for <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portuguais</hi> unyok'd himself, not so much for the extraordinary Taxes, but that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having so many irons in the fire, could not, or at least neglected to protect him against the <hi>Hollander</hi> in <hi>Brasile,</hi> and elsewhere in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the causes of the Risings of <hi>Naples</hi> have much Analogy with all the former, for they proceeded from the multiplicity of <hi>Gabels</hi> that were laid upon every thing both for Back and Belly: Add hereunto the forced Services that were so frequently impos'd upon the Subjects to go to hazard their lives in other Countreys; And lastly, the Rapine of the Viceroyes (with the <hi>Gabelliers</hi> or <hi>Customers)</hi> It being a kind of Proverb in <hi>Italy</hi> touching the Governour of <hi>Milain,</hi> the Viceroy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and he of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> that the one <hi>eats,</hi> the other <hi>gnaws,</hi> and the third <hi>devours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

These Commotions came at last to such a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that the whole Kingdom was upon the point of an utter defection, having introduc'd the <hi>French</hi> for Protector, and trac'd the form of a Common-wealth: but the soft <hi>Napolitan</hi> was not, it seems, so constant to his ends as the <hi>Hollander</hi> or <hi>Catalon,</hi> and other tougher Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <head>A HISTORY Of the late REVOLUTIONS IN THE KINGDOM of <hi>NAPLES,</hi> And how suppressed and ended.</head>
            <p>BEfore we fall upon the second and third <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi> that happened in the City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> it is not amiss, for the more regular proceeding in the series of the Story, to make a succinct recapitulation of what succeeded in the first tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, wherein some signal passages shall be imparted, which were omitted in the former Narration, for want of better Intelligence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gabel</hi> of <hi>Fruit,</hi> and the Act confirmed, newly impos'd upon the most faithful people of <hi>Naples,</hi> was insupportable; to which purpose the Viceroy made the Lords of the Customs to Convene divers times herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; and it was at last determined, that it should be utterly abolished; and that the said Lords should find
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32004:7"/>
some means where another Imposition might be laid for satisfaction of those moneys which the Royal Court had rais'd upon the credit of the foresaid <hi>Gabel.</hi> The people were also mightily discontented for other Taxes which were laid upon every edible thing; for there was scarce any commodity scap'd, but the Imposition did countervail well near the value of the thing; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most faithful people did conform a long time, as holding it necessary for the support of the Catholick Monarchy, by stooping their heads to the pleasure of him who Reigned over them, and preserv'd them in peace.</p>
            <p>The foresaid Lords often met to take off the new <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel;</hi> but for want of money, and for the calamities of the times, they knew not where to turn themselves: Besides, the people grew to be wonderful impatient; whereupon one day as they were exacting the said <hi>Gabel</hi> in the Market-place, a shrewd clash happened 'twixt the Farmers of the said <hi>Gabel</hi> and the Fruiterers, to whom the Costermongers did closely stick; and the business being aggravated by multiplication of words, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect was lost unto the said Farmers; insomuch that the Toll-house was burnt to the ground, with all the Writings therein, by the fury of Boys, and others of the poorest sort of people; among whom <hi>Massaniello,</hi> a poor bare-footed retailer of Fish, was chief. The Lord <hi>Andrea Anaclerio,</hi> the Elect of the people, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd to appease the tumult; but finding the business too hot for him, he withdrew himself, and with much difficulty and danger scap'd away in a <hi>Feluca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rabble of the common people being further ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated hereby, the boys went up and down with Canes in their hands to all places where the said <hi>Gabel</hi> was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32004:7"/>
rais'd, and burnt the houses and goods of the Gabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers, as also of the Farmers of all other kinde of Tolls.</p>
            <p>A little after two Companies well armed, but all masqued, pass'd by <hi>Jesu-street,</hi> and another Brigade of 300. foot, with above four thousand Boyes. By the Market of Saint <hi>Elino</hi> two Companies more met, who broke through the Court of Guard which was before the Castle Court, hurling two of the Souldiers into the di ches thereabouts. Afterwards they ran towards the Palace, where they furiously entred: The Viceroy hereupon found himself in no small danger, therefore throwing handfuls of Gold among them, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to take off <hi>Gabels</hi> they were aggriev'd at, he stole away with much ado to Saint <hi>Francisco.</hi> Many of the Nobles endeavoured to pacifie the tumult, and, among others, the Prince of <hi>Bisignano Carafa,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Satriano</hi> labour'd very hard herein, but it was in vain, so that they incurr'd some danger of their lives.</p>
            <p>The rabble went afterwards to the Prison of Saint <hi>James,</hi> and forcing it violently they released all the Prisoners, whereof there were some in for their lives; and they burn'd to Cynders all theWritings and Leger books, as also all the goods of the Gaoler. They did the like in all other Prisons, excepting that of the <hi>Vicaria,</hi> in regard of the reverence they bore to the holy Church.</p>
            <p>This made the Viceroy change his lodging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Hereupon the bread rose to thirty two ounces upon a sudden, which gave a general discontentment.</p>
            <p>That night there was nothing but beating of Drums, as if some Enemy were in the Field, or the <hi>Turk</hi> upon the Coasts ready to invade.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy thought it expedient in policy to release from prison the Duke of <hi>Matalone,</hi> which was detained in <hi>Castelnovo;</hi> who mounting on horseback rode up and down <hi>Naples</hi> well accompanied, asking the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with all mildness what they would have: they cried out, That they would have all the <hi>Gabcls</hi> to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished that were imposed upon them since the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and that all the priviledges should be renewed, &amp; punctually observ'd, which were granted to the most faithful people of <hi>Naples</hi> by that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The Viceroy with all meekness said it should be done; therefore he suddenly caus'd a <hi>Pragmatica</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> to be printed and publish'd to that purpose, with the advice of the <hi>Collateral Councel.</hi> Yet this would not satisfie, but they cried out that the Duke of <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luni</hi> had couzen'd them; therefore they took him for one Hostage, and shut him up in the <hi>Carmine</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> whence he afterwards fled.</p>
            <p>After dinner the Prior of <hi>Rovella</hi> procur'd another Proclamation to be stamp'd in Parchment, all in <hi>Letters of Gold,</hi> and carrying it about the <hi>Streets</hi> of <hi>Naple</hi> on horseback said, <hi>That his Excellency the Viceroy had done them the grace, in his Catholick Majesties Name, to take off all the Gabels:</hi> Hereupon an infinite number of Boyes danc'd and leap'd up and down about the Priors horse, crying out, <hi>Let the King of</hi> Spain <hi>live, who hath abolish'd all Gabels;</hi> and so went to the Market place: But this neither would give full satisfaction; but they went more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32004:8"/>
violently to work, running to the house of <hi>Hieronym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Letitia,</hi> where they hurl'd out all his goods at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and burnt them in the midst of the <hi>Street,</hi> taking special care that nothing should be pilfer'd away, but that an entire sacrifice should be made thereof to <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> Then they ran to <hi>Felix Basil's</hi> house, and us'd him with the same punctuality: Thence they steer'd their course to <hi>Antonio d' Angelis,</hi> and did the like; Thence they went to <hi>Andrea Anaclerio's</hi> Palace, who was the Peoples <hi>Elect;</hi> and though 'twas late, yet they us'd his house as they did the rest.</p>
            <p>The next day the Viceroy commanded to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd by sound of Trumpet, that all <hi>Gabels</hi> should be abolish'd that were impos'd ever since the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, which Trumpeters went up and down the places, as well within the City as towards the Sea side where the <hi>Gabel</hi> houses stood: Yet for all this they ran to the house whete the Magazine of Powder was, and took away what proportions they pleas'd: nor would this serve the turn, but they set fire to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, with the death of forty men; which made such a hideous noise, as if not only one City, but the whole world did tremble: Hereupon every one did put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Arms, and the women were as busie as any.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Sellaria</hi> they planted five pieces of Ordnance, six hundred Foot pass'd by <hi>Magdanela</hi> bridge, to be imbarked in some Gallies for the Kings service; but the rabble fell upon them, and took away their Arms for another use. The Nobility fail'd not ever and anon to court the Viceroy in behalf of the people, who now began to prohibit things to pass to his Palace. One would think now that he had been in <hi>Cocagna</hi> or Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, for every thing entred into <hi>Naples</hi> without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32004:9"/>
paying the least toll; nor could a Sergeant be scarce seen in the streets, nor any Officer that had any thing to do with the Farmers of the <hi>Gabel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning the rabble went to the Lord <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio Mirabello</hi>'s house, whom they took in bed, and he hardly scap'd away in his shirt; they presently burnt all his movables, which made a rich bonefire; thence they went to Duke <hi>Caviano</hi>'s house, and used him alike, with many other sair Palaces,: Then they came to <hi>Caesar Librano</hi>'s house, where scarce a pin scap'd the fury of the fire: In the same manner they came to the Duke of <hi>Ostuin</hi>'s house, and to Dr. <hi>Tavaglo</hi>'s, where they did the like. They sent to <hi>Andrea Mazzola</hi> for fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Muskets, but denying he had any, they put fire to his house, and took out the said Muskets: Every House-keeper in <hi>Naples</hi> was commanded to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Arms immediately, under pain of having his house burnt. There were some sixty <hi>Spaniards</hi> in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison about the Tower of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> but the rabble ran thither with two Cannons, where they disarmed and thrust out the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and possess'd themselves of all the ancient Records that were in those Archives, so they plac'd presidial Forces of their own there. Then they put fire to <hi>Biasio de Balsamo</hi>'s house, whence they pass'd to <hi>Bartholomeo d' Auqino</hi> of <hi>Chaia,</hi> and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him as they did all the rest; but they spared the house he had in <hi>Pizzifalione,</hi> which they turn'd to a fortress: <hi>Jeronymo Nacarella</hi> had his share in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, who had a sumptuous new Palace made level with the ground: Then they flew to Baron <hi>Valentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s house, who was Farmer of the Corn; from him they passed to <hi>Pietro Florio,</hi> who was Cash-keeper to the Royal <hi>Dogana</hi> or Custom-house; and because it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32004:9"/>
was fitting that at such a holy day a Minister of the Chamber should have some share, they went to <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cenano,</hi> to whom they did the like curtesie as they had done to others. It was admirable what a regular method they observed in their fiery executions; for they used first to take all the goods out into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place to be burnt, crying out <hi>it was the blood of the people of</hi> Naples, and 'twas death to embeazle the least thing; insomuch that one who had stoln but a peep of Sausage was like to be hang'd by <hi>Massanicllo;</hi> nor did they spare either gold, silver or jewels, but all was thrown into the flames, as also coaches and horses were burnt alive, most rich Tapistries and Pictures; but they saved all books and pieces of Piety, which they sent to several Churches; and in <hi>Fclix Basils</hi> house they burnt a huge proportion of bisket, which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be sent to the Gallies for the Kings service.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy ordered that some Companies of High-Dutch who were in Garrison at <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> should come to <hi>Naples,</hi> the rabble having notice hereof ran out of <hi>Gratta,</hi> and meeting them they disarm'd them all, and brought them prisoners to the Market-place.</p>
            <p>When they entred into Saint <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> they found there the picture of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried round about <hi>Naples</hi> with twenty thousand souls, who accompanied it, crying all along, <hi>Viva il Ré di Spagna,</hi> May the King of <hi>Spain</hi> live.</p>
            <p>After this they went to <hi>Cornelio Spinola's</hi> House, where it was expected they would have used the same Complement as they did to others; but he told them that he never had any thing to do with the <hi>Gabels,</hi> but he was there for the service of <hi>Genoa</hi> only, thereupon they chose him for <hi>Grassiero,</hi> or superintendent of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32004:10"/>
Flesh-Market, and lest in his house the picture of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. One may easily conjecture in what pickle the poor <hi>Genoway</hi> stood all the white.</p>
            <p>They placed up and down the City five and twenty great Cannons in the most necessary Advenues; and the busiest man who was employed herein was <hi>Joseph Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> a notorious <hi>Bandito,</hi> whom they appointed to be Captain of the Guard in the great Market-place, who dispensed his commands with that reservedness and punctuality that 'twas wonderful, but some under-dealings of his being detected, he and his brother were hackt to pieces by the fury of the people, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for publick satisfaction and example, were dragg'd up and down the Streets, and hurl'd afterwards into the Common Ditch.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Mataluni,</hi> for the safeguard of his house assembled his outlaws, and other desperate persons, but the people haivng notice thereof kill'd five of them, and took one, alive, the rest sav'd themselves by flight: Thereupon the great Bell of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> rung out to give notice that every one should be ready in Arms, which had not been done a hundred years before. <hi>Massaniello</hi> now grew higher in Command, yet he would not alter his habit, but went still barefoot, and in Mariners ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; so that the common cry was, <hi>Viva Dio, Ré de Spagna, &amp; Massaniello,</hi> Let God live, live the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Massaniello,</hi> and there was such an opinion conceiv'd of him, that they thought him to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspir'd, so that every nod of his went for an absolute Command: This opinion was confirm'd by a strange Passage, which was, That certain Banditos and Outlaws intending to murder the said <hi>Massaniello,</hi> they discharg'd divers Muskets at him, but they did
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32004:10"/>
no execution, which was held a notable miracle, eight of the said Banditoes were slain, the rest sav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Church of <hi>Carmine;</hi> The whole City was cut out into Trenches, and all Coaches were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The foremention'd <hi>Joseph Caratta,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Mataluni,</hi> who had retir'd into Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church, and thence into the Monastery, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered the Monastery; whereupon he thinking to flee under a disguised habit, was betrayed, and his head chopp'd off, with three servants more, as enemies to the people; his brother the Duke, hereupon took a fair pair of heels, and fled towards <hi>Rome,</hi> as 'twas thought.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Massaniello</hi> began now to send out his Commands very magisterially, and the penalty of his Commands were, <hi>Sotto pena della vita, &amp; incendio,</hi> under pain of life and firing: he commanded that every Window should have lights in them, which was punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, which seem'd to embellish the City, and make the streets as lightsome by night as by day.</p>
            <p>Another peremptory Command of his came out, that all should go <hi>en cuerpo</hi> without Clokes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Priests and Bishops, who went up and down only in Cassocks, Ladies and Gentlewomen were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden likewise to go abroad with wide-hoop'd Gowns or Kirtles, and the reason was, that they might carry no arms underneath. A report did fly, that the Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi> had poison'd the waters of <hi>Formali,</hi> which serv'd the City, this made the rest of the Nobles to be so ill look'd upon, that happy was he who could fly away first from the City. The women up and down did wonderfully encourage their husbands, and all traffique except Market-solks was quite down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32004:11"/>
There came in the heat of this hurly-burly eight <hi>Napolitan</hi> Gallies, which were missing a long time; the Viceroy commanded they should not enter into the Port, but that they should stay 'twixt St <hi>Vincents</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the Key.</p>
            <p>Thereupon by intervention of Cardinal <hi>Filomarino,</hi> who was Archbishop of <hi>Naples,</hi> and accounted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of the City, an interview or parley was appointed t'wixt the Viceroy and <hi>Massaniello,</hi> who with much ado was perswaded to shake off his Mariners slop, and put on a rich Sute of Cloth of Silver, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note by that white Colour the innocence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Being attended to the royal Castle by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the people, and he himself mounted upon a choice Courser with naked sword in hand; the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy treated him with terms of extraordinary respect, being both for the satisfaction of the people, in an open Balcone. At that time there were many obstreperous noises among the people below, and a great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but <hi>Massaniello</hi> lifting up onely his hand, all was hush'd.</p>
            <p>The Capitulations for peace t'wixt the Viceroy and <hi>Massaniello</hi> being read aloud, and confirm'd by the Viceroy, and the <hi>Collateral Councel, Massaniello</hi> said, That by the wise deportment of his Excellency his Catholick Majesty had gain'd the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> more firmly then ever; for that mass of people he saw, with millions more were bound to thank his Majesty, and his Excellency, who will be ready to expose their lives to defend his Government here against the <hi>French</hi> or any other Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oulio Genovino</hi> was the chiefest Counsellour of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saniello,</hi> who in the Duke of <hi>Ossi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Massaniello</hi> sent a <hi>Regalo</hi> of sweet meats to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, and to his Lady; who return'd a Present of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to <hi>Massaniello's</hi> Wife, who afterwards did visit her attir'd in Cloth of Gold. <hi>Massaniello</hi> commanded the Kings-Arms to be set up over all the Gates of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Cities Arms underneath, with <hi>P.</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; and understanding there were many Bandito's lay sculking in the Town, and fled to Sanctuaries, the fury of the people was such that they pull'd them all out and kill'd them.</p>

            <p>There was order given to erect to Erect a fair Palace in the great Market place for <hi>Massaniello,</hi> and much of the Materials had been brought thither to that purpose; there was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> imprisoned by the people, but <hi>Massaniello</hi> commanded him out, and sent him to the Viceroy, who remanded him to <hi>Massaniello,</hi> who pardoned him.</p>
            <p>All the Tribunals of Justice were shut up at this time, nor was any person obeyed but <hi>Massaniello,</hi> who commanded Gibbets to be set up in divers places of

the City, which struck a great terrour into the hearts of all people.</p>
            <p>The next day the Viceroy with the Royal Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel came in great pomp to the great Church, where Cardinal <hi>Filomarino</hi> was in his <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> at the high Altar, and <hi>Massaniello</hi> standing with a naked Sword upon one of the steps, and his Brother behind him in Cloth of Silver also, the Viceroy tooke there a solemn Oath to perform the Capitulations in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majesties name, viz. <hi>That all kind of</hi> Gabel <hi>that were imposed upon the City of</hi> Naples <hi>since the Reign of the glorious Emperour</hi> Charls <hi>the Fifth should be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abolished, and never to he levied again: That his Excellency should do his endeavour to procure a full ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof from the Court of</hi> Spain, <hi>within the compass of two moneths, and that in the interim the most faithful People of</hi> Naples <hi>should stand upon their Guard, and in Arms.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Massaniello</hi> gave out, That he would provide five Millions very speedily to send his Catholick Majesty for this singular grace towards the support of his Wars: He commanded all the houshold-stuff of the Duke of <hi>Mataluni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Massaniello</hi> gave out, That what Courtesan soever desired to marry, she should have fifty Duckets given

her. He went then among the Gallies, and made a poor Mechanick a Captain of one of them. He was feasted in the Castle by the Viceroy, together with his Brother and his Wife; but the next day he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some ridiculous Extravagancies, as leaping into the water to refresh himself in his Clothes, so that some thought he had a fig given him in the Castle to intoxicate his brains; Others did impute it to want of repose and sleep, for he was wonderfully watchful, intentive, and restless in his business. But he began now to lose the wonted respect among the Souldiery and Citizens: Insomuch that <hi>Marco Vitale</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary giving a Captain a cuff before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, the Captain and others fell upon him and slew him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrea Roma</hi> and <hi>Ardizzone,</hi> with others, all ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Blades, went the next day to the Church of <hi>Carmine,</hi> where they found <hi>Massaniello</hi> airing himself, they surpriz'd and dispatch'd him, and cut off his head; 'Twas thought the people would have resented it, but it proved clean contrary, for they followed the Coach wherein the head was carried to the Viceroy, with a great deal of applause and triumph: His body was drag'd up and down by the Boyes of the City. So fell the bold Fisherman of <hi>Naples,</hi> who had reign'd as absolutely as any Sovereign, the space of eight days and eight hours; And one may say more absolutely then any Kings use to do; for they are restrained by Laws; but <hi>Massaniello</hi> was beyond the bounds of any; For during this short time, he caused to be killed by his own order two hundred and fifty persons, and that suddenly, giving them onely time to confess, and to some he would give none. In fine, He was thought
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32004:13"/>
to be more then a man, and that what he ordered was ordained by God himself.</p>
            <p>After this Tragical Act, the Lord <hi>Regent</hi> of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria,</hi> with his wonted Guards, went with Trumpets before him about the Streets, and proclaimed, <hi>That none under pain of Rebellion should stirre:</hi> He declared further, <hi>That all Gabels were taken off:</hi> to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he carried the Instrument in his hand; therefore he commanded, <hi>That none should adhere to the complices of that late Rascal, that Retailer of Fish, who disturbed the tranquillity hoth of People and City;</hi> So there was a great cry, <hi>Viva il Ré di Spagna,</hi> Let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> live. A little after, the Viceroy passed up and down the City in stately Equipage, which increased the cry, So that the noise then was, <hi>Viva il Ré di Spagna, è Duca d' Arcos,</hi> Let the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> live: And as the Viceroy went along, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the people every where of the Abolition of the <hi>Gabels,</hi> and further Concession of Graces.</p>
            <p>The next night after, there entred into the City at the Royal Port six hundred Horse, with admirable se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, who went all to the Palace to serve the Viceroy upon occasion, and the next Morning they betook themselves to divers Ports.</p>
            <p>That day the bread fell to be eleven Ounces lighter; whereupon the people mutined again, and fell a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Furnaees and goods of the Bakers. Then they went in multitudes of armed men to find out the body of <hi>Massaniello,</hi> which it seems was cast into a Ditch; they took it out, washed it, and persumed it, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it upon a Bier out of the gate of the <hi>Holy spirit;</hi> where they took down his Head, and sewed it to the rest of the Carkass, and so brought it in a very solemn
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32004:13"/>
order to the great Church of <hi>Carmine:</hi> The people went along, both men and women, crying out, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Sisters say a <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and an <hi>Ave Mary</hi> for this our Countryman and fellow-Citizen; his body being hoised up a great height, to be made more visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So he who was cursed and dragged up and down the streets the day before, is the next day after bewailed, missed, prayed for, and buried in marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pomp: the white Boyes of <hi>Loreto</hi> went before him with above a thousand Priests with burning Torches in their hands, the Trumpets and Drums sounded the doleful march; and as he lay in his Funeral bed, they put a Crown upon his Head, and a Scepter in his hand; so he had at his death those Ensigns, the jurisdiction whereof he usurped in his life. Many thousands of armed men accompanied his Herse, and women with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, raising up their beads and voices in high and dolorous accents, with <hi>requiems</hi> and <hi>refrigeriums</hi> to his soul. This Funeral pomp came out again from the great Church of the <hi>Carmine,</hi> and fetching a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass about all the five Precincts of <hi>Naples,</hi> they carried the body under the very Balcone of the Viceroy, where it stayed a while till they had fix'd a Standard, and hung Colours thereabouts. After all this the Bier was brought about two hours at night to the great Church again, where he was interr'd with much pity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; the common people crying him up for a Saint already.</p>
            <q>—Quantum est in rebus inane!</q>
            <p>Thus <hi>Massaniello</hi> being raised up by popular Air, slain and scorn'd by the same people, honour'd and idc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latriz'd after his death by the same persons, may be compared to a Ball tossed up and down by Fortune.

The voice went then, that a Chappel should be built for him, and these ensuing Epitaphs were compos'd by the prime wits of <hi>Naples.</hi>

THese Commotions in <hi>Naples,</hi> being the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan great Town, did cause that almost the whole Kingdom did rise. In <hi>Bitonto</hi> many houses were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise burnt; as also in divers others places, as shall be related hereafter. In the ancient City of <hi>Nocera</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Duke himself did not scape the fury of the flames, but was made even to the ground, with all the costly movables, as also the dwellings of all such that adhered unto him; and if the Duke himself had not taken a fair pair of heels and fled to <hi>Messina,</hi> he might have expired his last in the Tumult.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Naples</hi> the Count <hi>Cosino</hi> laboured to have a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Inscription set up in the Market-place, which should mention the abolition of all Taxes that were granted by the Viceroy, and the people were mighty eager to have it erected.</p>
            <p>The Counsellour <hi>Moschetola</hi> persisting by his Agents to exact the Gabel in <hi>Meleto Casale</hi> of <hi>Aversa,</hi> upon Corn which he had rented, the people of that Town being transported with fury, came to <hi>Naples,</hi> and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagueing with that people, they ran about dinner time to the Market-place, where the said <hi>Moschetola</hi> had a house, and gave him such a hot Alarm, that like a Cat he was forced to flee over the tops of the houses to save himself. The women were permitted to go out of the said house, and afterwards they took out all the houshold-stuff, and carrying it to the open street in a kind of solemnity, all was burnt to ashes, besides rich Tapistry, and exquisite Pictures, there were two cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards of silver Vessels, and a great Library of Books
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32004:16"/>
exposed to the fury of the fire; all which was compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the value of thirty thousand Crowns, all which was reduced to Cinders. They directed their course after to <hi>Alonso d' Angelis</hi> house, a great Officer of the Kings <hi>Dogana</hi> or Custom-house, and would have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with the same sauce; but the Viceroy interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his authority, or <hi>request</hi> rather, so earnestly that he prevailed.</p>
            <p>In the Market-place the day following there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a huge tumult concerning the publick Inscription to be set up concerning those Capitulations which the Viceroy had signed and sealed in behalf of the most faithful people, which being delayed, the rabble flew to <hi>Cavallero Cosino</hi>'s Palace, a most famous Limner, who had the charge of doing the thing; but he finding himself in imminent danger of his life, fled away, and his House with many rare Pieces had felt <hi>Vulcans</hi> fury, had not the Viceroy caused the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Picture to be hung up before the Gate in a high Balcone, which preserved the House.</p>
            <p>They of the Market-place ran and burnt all the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses up and down the City, as also that which was near the Castle ditch, and they chop'd off the head of a lame <hi>Sicilian</hi> who kept it. But the Viceroy having commanded two of the said Incendiaries to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, they were by his order both strangled that night, and the next morning their Bodies were hanged up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Castle, which put a period to all burnings for the time. A Jesuite was also beheaded, but he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacred and degraded first of his function in the Church of <hi>Sancta Barbara;</hi> he was suspected to have come from <hi>Sicily</hi> to trace some machinations against the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> his name was <hi>Regnicolo,</hi> and he hath a

            </p>
            <p>There was a notable thing discovered about this time in the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> which was this; One <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Severino</hi> a publick Notary, had a Sister who had been a Widow seventeen years before; he was to pay her six hundred Duckets towards her Dowry; but he had immured her and a little daughter of hers betwixt four walls in a dark cave, where he fed them with Bread and Water, with some few Fruits and Roots, as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishes, Cucumbers, and other such stuff: This Widow had a Son in the custody of an Uncle all the while, who being grown up to mans estate came to the said Notary, and loudly demanded his Mothers goods, thinking she had been dead: The rumour of this business flew up and down among the people, who therefore rushing into the Notaries house, and searching up and down, the woman began to shriek out in the cave with her Daughter; so they broke down the wall, and entring into the cave they found there two Women like sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or furies, with long dishevel'd hair, in a strange po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; hereupon the Notary was clap'd up in Prison, and the Women carried to the Monastery of St. <hi>Onuphrio,</hi> where a great concourse of people came to see them; so the Notary had exemplary punishment.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Naples</hi> went on to inroll more men for the Militia, which came to above the number of eighty thousand Foot, besides Horse; they changed the Guard every night, nor did they esteem any commands that came from the Castle; the Tribunals of Justice did cease sitting, and the commotion was held up as high as it was in <hi>Massanicllo</hi>'s time, only there were not so many heads chop'd off, and houses burnt, yet there was no sace of any government but only among the Souldiery.

One day which was a Festival, a great number of boys, half naked and painted with red, some on horseback and others afoot, with Turbands on their heads, and habited like Turks, went up and down; in the midst of them there was a triumphant Chariot, where there sate one apparelled like a King, and sitting in a Throne, with a half Moon upon his head; others were masked; others went with strange Spectacles on their noses, in such a hideous manner, as if they had been so many Devils broke loose out of Hell; before the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot there went a Troop of Horse, whereof the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most carried a Scepter in his hand, habited like a Turk; and in this garb they passed before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and under the windows and mustachos of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy.</p>
            <p>In these commotions the Franciscan Friers of St. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> thought to make their advantage in a long suit they had with the Capuchins of St. <hi>Antonio de Padoua;</hi> The Capuchins pretended that it belonged to them to carry the silver statue that was in the Treasury upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn days; but the Franciscans alledged twas their right, in regard their Order was more ancient, and theirs but a branch of it, and that in the time of St: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> there was no such thing as a Capuchin: besides, he is buried in <hi>Padoua,</hi> and painted to the life in a Chappel that belongs to the conventual Franciscans, who are of the same Order as they of St. <hi>Lorenzoin Naples:</hi> Upon a sudden they went in Procession, and carried the said silver Statue of St. <hi>Antonio</hi> up and down the Streets of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the great Street of <hi>Toledo,</hi> accompanied by a mass of people, with divers bands of Souldiers, and Drums beating before, as if some assault were to be given: The common people were for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32004:18"/>
Franciscans, but the Noble-men and Gentry were for the Capuchins; but the Franciscans got the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more ancient: This Contracto had been brought formerly before the Viceroy, but he reserred it to <hi>Rome</hi> where it depended. The said Statue being replaced that night in the Treasury, the next morning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple entred and took away the keys by force, and put out the Chaplains who were appointed there by the Nobility, and appointed others of their election.</p>
            <p>The next day the Viceroy sent a Galley to <hi>Calabria,</hi> which carried <hi>John Baptista Montforte</hi> Duke of <hi>Laureto,</hi> who was expresly employed by the said Viceroy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the tumults in <hi>Cosenza,</hi> which were little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to those of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Lord <hi>Don Carlo di Capon</hi> was clapped up in Prison by the Souldiers of <hi>Pusilipo,</hi> together with his servants, &amp; many hainous things were to be laid to his charge. A Brigade of the people pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing along the Castle ditch, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers put themselves upon their Guaed, one of them discharging his Musket, hit Doctor <hi>Benedetto Guadagno</hi> that stood in a window, who fell down dead in an instant; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Viceroy caused the said Souldier to be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hanged after confession, under the same Window, although he alledged that he knew not the Musket had been charged with a bullet.</p>
            <p>The Students of <hi>Naples</hi> would have a share also in these Revolutions, therefore they went all in a body and presented a Petition to the Viceroy, the effect whereof was, That they should pay no more Fees for their Degrees then was used to be paid in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour: The Viceroy gave them no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive answer for the time, which they imputed to some i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

they attempted at their return to burn his house, but it was prevented by some means the Viceroy wrought; and the next day he caused divers of the Students to be imprisoned, who were the chief ring-leaders.</p>
            <p>The City still resolved to stand upon her Guard till the confirmation of the Articles concerning their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges came from the Catholick Court, and they arm'd day and night accordingly; one of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles was, <hi>That such arming should not be tearmed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the interim.</hi> The Viceroy was not idle, but he caused Bulle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>A Compendium of the Sublevations and Turmoils which happen'd in the City, and among the People of</hi> Cosenza.</head>
                        <p>UPon Sunday-morning about the break of day, a Dispatch was expresly sent to the President of this Province from the Viceroy, wherein he ordered that a <hi>Pragmatica</hi> should be publish'd and proclaim'd through all the Territories and places thereof; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof was, <hi>That his Excellency was ready to grant and pass unto that people all those Graces which they expected, as was done to the City and People of</hi> Naples, <hi>for prevention of that horrid effusion of blood, firings, and other confusions which might ensue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet for all this a multitude of common People ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together in Bands that very Sunday-morning, all armed with a full and furious purpose to repose the Insolence and Pride of the Nobility, who had reduced the common people to such a pass that they could hardly live by them. The Cape or chief Leader of which Popular Brigades was Captain <hi>Joseph Gervatio,</hi> who with his Ginet in hand caused himself to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Captain-General, and was so accepted: it was concluded amongst them, That they should procure to live separately from the Nobles, and to be subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to no other but to the King himself, to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32004:19"/>
or some principal Officers of Justice; This Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the common people was so numerous and active all that Sunday that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> dared scarce stir out of his house, or hardly peep out at the Windows: The Bells rung out to give general Alarms; at last they formed a Petition to the Lord President for a present Concession of those Indulgences and Graces which were granted the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> and with much ado for that night the President did appease them. But upon Munday-morning the Nobles rouz'd up their spirits, desiring to know the cause of this hurly-burly, and what the people did desire, and there should be a course taken to satisfie them. Hereupon a choice num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the said people being met at the Monastery of Saint <hi>Francisco di Paola,</hi> the Lord President, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the foresaid <hi>Antonio Gervasio</hi> the Cape of the people told them, That their pretention and intention was to live separate from their Nobles, as also from the Sindiques and Regiments, as likewise from the payment of certain <hi>Gabels;</hi> And that every one of them should pay for his own particular fire, it being not consentaneous to reason, that the people who were alwais disposed to make ready paiment, not only to the royal Court, but of all other inferior <hi>Gabels,</hi> and that the Nobles by their authority should be exempt, in such sort that the burden fell still upon the people which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd more weight daily; at least they payed doubly as much as the Nobles, as the <hi>Jurat</hi> can testifie, who was one year for the Nobles, &amp; another year for the people.</p>
                        <p>To these Pretentions and Demands Doctor <hi>Baracca</hi> offer'd to give a satisfaction to the Nobles, and to make it appear that they were very just: So it was agreed on both sides, that he should have time to do it; In
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32004:20"/>
the interim it was order'd, that all should lay down their arms, which was done as it were in an instant, by the command of Captain <hi>Antonio Gervatio,</hi> untill a minute or scedule should be made, declaring the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they desired to live among the Nobles; so every one return'd to his own fire. While this was a doing, and all this was hush'd for the preseut, certain <hi>Albaneses</hi> being arm'd passed through the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Cosenza,</hi> who were clad like Country-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: Hereupon Captain <hi>Gervatio</hi> with a huge Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of people ran to the Lord Presidents Palace, complaining and crying out, That it was no reason that the Nobles during the time of treaty, which tended to an amiable accord, should make provision of Arms, calling in those <hi>Albaneses,</hi> specially since the people had laid down their Arms in that interim, therefore they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected some false-play under-hand, whereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd that the Lord President would do them the favor as go to <hi>Pompeo Sambiate</hi> who maintain'd those <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> and inorder him to dismiss them; that all sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Clouds of Diffidence might vanish: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lord President went accordingly; and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the said <hi>Pompeo</hi> to discharge his Souldiers, He answered, That he could not do it by any means, nor ought he to do it, in regard that that armed Band was for his own Defence, and not to offend any other: The Lord President replied, and rejoined, but he could not prevail.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon Captain <hi>Gervatio</hi> having notice what had passd 'twixt the President &amp; <hi>Seignior Pompeo,</hi> he with a huge rabble of people well arm'd, having made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of barrels of Pitch, Oil, Matches and Wood, went in a kind of fury to the Lord President; telling
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32004:20"/>
him, That since his Lordship could not thrust out those <hi>Albaneses,</hi> they would do it themselves; So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting thence like so many enraged Lions they went up and down with Drums, and Trumpets, discharging divers shots at <hi>Sembiate's</hi> windowes and applying Pitch, Oil, Match and Wood to his Gate, where the fire began to crackle: Another Brigade of people set fire in another part of the Town to the houses of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> and <hi>Bartolo Sembiate;</hi> Others to the house of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo Matera;</hi> Others to the house of <hi>Ignatio Sembiate,</hi> with other of the chiefest houses; Insomuch, that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Town of <hi>Cosenza</hi> seem'd to be a <hi>Mongibelo,</hi> or Mountain of fire at that time, the like whereof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen before: All Obedience to Authority, all Pity and Piety was lost: While they put fire to <hi>Scipio Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biate's</hi> house, the poor Genrleman half naked stood upon the top of his house, and bullets flew about his Ears; at last he was reduced to that extremity, that he said aloud, <hi>I yield, kill me not in this manner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Confession.</hi> The people answered, If he yielded, they desired not his life; so he came down from the Tiles of the House, and put himself in a Chamber; in the interim some or other of his servants had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a Pistol, at the report whereof the people fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously rushed into the Chamber where he was upon a Couch, and one of them, and he of the meanest sort of Mechanicks, fell upon the person of the said Lord <hi>Scipio Sembiate,</hi> and chopt off his head, and threw his body out at the window; so his head was fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a Lance, and carried up and down with this cry, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Honour or Life, the Boyes ran up and down tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the flames, that the face of things look'd as if the day of Judgment had been come. Others surrounding the head of <hi>Scipio Sembiate,</hi> they plac'd it at last upon the Bridge of the <hi>Revocati,</hi> so the people multiplied in numbers, and encreass'd in fury more and more, till they came to the number of Ten thousand armed persons. The Nobles, some of them, hid themselves in Grotzes and Caves; others, in Churches, others in Monasteries and Hospitals; others, would not forsake their Wives and Children, but would stand to the brunt of what should happen: And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now neer noon, Captain <hi>Gervatio</hi> came to the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal with a great number of his men, whence he sent a kind of command to the Lord President, that he should send a Trumpet for the <hi>Fiscal Proctor,</hi> and send him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him upon business that much concern'd the service of his Majesty. The world stood astonish'd at this peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Order, but it was presently obey'd: so the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, together with the <hi>Fiscal Proctor</hi> was sent, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Town-house, Captain <hi>Gervatio</hi> order'd that the Trumpet should go back; which being done, the Captain propos'd to the Fiscal, <hi>That for the special service of his Catholick Majesty, it was needful that a Tax should be impos'd upon all the Nobles, and sent to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy for the necessities of war:</hi> This took effect presently, and a Tribunal was appointed to tax every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: They began with <hi>An. Cavalcante,</hi> who was assess'd 500. Crowns, which was proclaim'd by sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the party sent for, who with fear and reverence appear'd and obey'd presently, assigning but so much time to provide then mony: so all the Nobles were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd in like manner by sound of trumpet, and assess'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32004:21"/>
accordingly, and in case any refus'd, his house should pass the fire, which was done to some: So there was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sudden a kinde of Exchequer or bank of money rais'd up in the City of <hi>Cosenza:</hi> some Gentlewomen came with their children to move compassion, &amp; to have some abatement made in behalf of their Husbands; but neither the tears of the Mothers, nor the cries of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, could prevail or soften the stony hearts of the people.</p>
                        <p>A little after <hi>Bartolo Sembiate</hi> was imprison'd, who being penn'd up in a dark Grotza, with a son of the late murther'd <hi>Scipio Sembiate</hi> his brother, who being ready to starve got out to get some bread, but he was repriz'd, and they were both thrown into the prison of the <hi>Audientia,</hi> but in the way thither he swooned thrice for weakness, and former want of nourishment: A little after he was sent for by a Trumpet before Captain <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasio,</hi> where he was inorder'd to pay <hi>15m</hi> Crowns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 24. hours, otherwise, he must be contented to have his head taken off by his Souldiers. Any one may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture what a pitiful plight this Gentleman was reduc'd to; the throbs, tears and sighs that came from his wife and children would have mollified an Adamant; but rather then to exchange life for death; he made a shift to take this money up by Exchange. Many dayes after the said Captain <hi>Antonio Gervatio</hi> sitting in the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, sent out his Summons by sound of Trumpet, and laid what Assessments he pleas'd upon all the Nobles and Gentry that dwelt in <hi>Cosenza,</hi> and all the places adjacent: and now we will proceed to the Territories of <hi>Otranto.</hi>

                        <p>THe rumours of what passed in <hi>Naples, Cosenza,</hi> with other places, together with the flames of those fires flew as far as the Countrey of <hi>Otranto;</hi> and though the people be thin in those parts, yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions were very high and hot in the Town of <hi>Leve,</hi> and the circumjacent places, as also thorow all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Viceroy had writ to the Lord President and Councel of <hi>Leve,</hi> to take off all kind of <hi>Gabels:</hi> The President then was <hi>Giacomo Arnolfini</hi> who was absent at that time, and the <hi>Audienza</hi> was very weak. <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni Angelo</hi> the Elect of the people, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, went to the Camp-Master <hi>Boccapianolo</hi> to consult with him: Who advised, that it were expedient to send back to his Excellency to know what kind of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> he understood should be abolished, which was done accordingly: But the President being return'd in the interim, together with the Tribunal, without conference with the Camp-master they sent out order
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32004:22"/>
to take off all kind of <hi>Gahels;</hi> but this was done with such a little Decorum, that it caused rather a kind of alteration then quietness in the baser sort of people; and gave occasion to ill meaning men to put their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in execution, which was done in an instant; for a crue of the common sort went to three or four houses of particular men, and did them much dammage; they sack'd and burnt the house of the Duke of <hi>Santo Donato</hi> which stood in the said Town of <hi>Leve;</hi> but matters were handled so, that they proceeded no further, only the houses of two Doctours suffered, who they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did some ill Office towards an immunity from <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Camp-master was inform'd, that there were some people coming from abroad to assist the Citizens of <hi>Leve,</hi> with intent to burn three houses more; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for prevention hereof, he arm'd some Troops of horse: The houses they aimed at were known after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be the house of <hi>Tauritano,</hi> of <hi>Francisco Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> the Fiscal, and of Auditor <hi>Stephano Pagliva;</hi> By the operations of the said Camp-master these houses were saved, yet some entered into the <hi>Dogana,</hi> and burnt whatsoever they found therein; They also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a <hi>Capo popalo,</hi> who might govern all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monality.</p>
                        <p>The City of <hi>Nardo,</hi> with the Inhabitants, did rise up, and bandy against their Patron, raising up For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses within the Wals, and renouncing all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him: He having timely notice hereof, came flying with a great number of Horse and Foot, with all his kindred and allies, who were numerous in those parts; and having begirt the City round, she
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32004:23"/>
did most stoutly maintain her self with Cannon and Musket; whereupon some were killed on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and divers wounded, the number where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could not be known; But at the same time Duke <hi>Francifco Burtato</hi> was wounded, with one of the Family of <hi>Sersale</hi> whose name could not be known.</p>
                        <p>But the Lord <hi>Titta Cicinello,</hi> more fearless then the rest, went on to batter the said City in the best manner he could: The Siege lasted three dayes; at last arrived the Bishop of <hi>Leve,</hi> with him of <hi>Gallipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li;</hi> and the Camp-master, who interposed so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that they commanded and reconciled all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt the City of <hi>Narda</hi> and her Lord, in so much that they returned all to their former Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                        <p>The first who entered the City was the Lord <hi>Titta:</hi> But if I should recount what succeeded in other places, I should never end; as those mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and firings which happened in <hi>Misagine,</hi> in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuni,</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Tolva</hi> and in <hi>Taranto,</hi> more then any where else; In <hi>Guttagia</hi> they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered twelve persons in one morning.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Otranto</hi> there happened new garboils, no lesse New then Lamentable: For the Tumults of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> being quieted, the Count parted thence with his train every one to his own home. You must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that those poor people are in a worse Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then others; for their syndique, and the chiefest of the Common people were beheaded, which struck such an astonishment into most of them that they all fled, and those few who stayed behinde made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32004:23"/>
they remained but as silly sheep for the slaughter, but the Duke returning had more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion then was expected.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Leve</hi> Councellour <hi>Urracea</hi> was arrived there from <hi>Naples;</hi> the people had shrew'd Umbrages of fear that he came to no good purpose, but to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement with them, and impose some new Gabel: therefore he understanding that they had a Design upon him, he absconded himself in the Camp-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters House: But they laid violent hands upon <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca-pianolla,</hi> and cut off his Head, Hurling his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse out of the Windows, and carried it about the Town in piece-meales.</p>
                        <p>They went about to seize upon <hi>Cinino</hi> the <hi>Fiscal</hi> Advocate, who cunningly escaped into the Castle; but he could not preserve his House which was burnt to the Ground, with whatsoever was in it, and no House could be better furnished; Nor did the Lord President himself escape some affronts from the Common people, but they beleaguered him in the Castle of <hi>Leve,</hi> which was succoured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Valour of the Camp-master <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capianola.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the City of <hi>Ostuni</hi> also there were perpetrated horrid murders, yea within Sanctuaries where <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymo de Fina</hi> Serjeant Major was knocked down, in the Land of <hi>Grottaglia:</hi> they slew the Baron <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta;</hi> and in the Countrey of <hi>Martina</hi> there were many firings and slaughters committed, with other horrid things, that unless there were fresh ocular Witnesses thereof, the Recital of them would sound as Fables; I must adde hereunto that the people
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32004:24"/>
of <hi>Leve</hi> did put into the Hands of <hi>Boccapianela,</hi> all the Powder and Ammunition of the City; which person was much esteemed, and held to be so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to the People as no man more; But yesterday they write that he was so hacked, and ill handled, that all wounded they brought him to the place where the said Gunpowder was with the rest of the Ammunition, and took all things from him but his Life, clapping him in close Prison, meerly upon surmises and fears.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the worst things that humane imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can conceive were acted in those parts. And now 'tis high time for us to return to <hi>Naples,</hi> the source whence all these mischiefs did flow.</p>

began to be sensible of the wrong and prejudice that might redound unto them thereby, and of the consequences that might grow further from hence: Therefore upon a sudden they took up Arms again; and the rather because in that <hi>affidavit</hi> they told a lye, because when the people burnt any House, they did it with that punctuality that none might embeazle the value of a pepper Corn, but that all should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the fire, as proceeding from the blood and radical moisture of the poor; but most of <hi>Cenano's</hi> goods were preserved. Hereupon there was twenty thousand Foot presently in Arms, before whom the Captains cried out, <hi>Tradimento al popolo, un pater, un ave Maria, pregate dio ne doni victoria, Andiamo à mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire per voj altri, ó vivere ó morire:</hi> which was as much to say, <hi>The people is betrayed, one Pater, and one Ave Maria, pray to God that he would be pleased to give us the Victory; let us go to die for you, to live or to die.</hi> And 'twas wonderful to see how many young men went on so resolutely, who making a halt upon <hi>Sancta Lucia à Monte,</hi> made themselves Masters of that Post, as an eminent place whence they might shoot at the Castle with advantage, and at the Viceroys Palace: Having planted their Standards there, and placed a Court of Guard for the defence thereof, they dismiss'd some Companies. Then they directed their course towards <hi>Pirrifailione</hi> for the Guard of the New-bridge: This place was guarded by six hundred Foot of a new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, who were weli Intrenched; and not being able to repell the violence of these men, who advanced with such a resolution and fury, the Souldiers that were formerly, were forc'd to abandon the place and leave their Arms behind, which the people seiz'd on: As
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32004:25"/>
also upon the house of the Prinee of <hi>Ascoli,</hi> and the Camp-master General was ingaged therein: a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant with thirty <hi>Spaniards</hi> were there for the guard of it, whereof about ten were killed, and the rest saved themselves into a grott. The people being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred therein did not touch any thing but the Arms that were hid there, without doing any detriment at all.</p>
                        <p>Afterward they went on to the Palace of the Princess of <hi>Bucera;</hi> and seiz'd upon all the Arms she had, whereof they gave a receit: Then they marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Palace of the Viceroy; but not being able to do any good there, in regard of the preparations he had made for defence, they directed their course to <hi>Sancta Lucia</hi> again, and thence to the <hi>Dogana,</hi> and took out the Arms they found there, which were a thousand five hundred Archibuzes, and Pistols, but touch'd not any thing else.</p>
                        <p>With three hundred foot they made themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Convent of Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> and entered on the grove's side; nor could any resistance prevail, where afterwards they began to stir and interpose again; and all the street Captains being assembled at Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> they desired that the Viceroy would deliver them <hi>Massaniello</hi>'s brother, who was prisoner in <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> as also <hi>Julio Genovino,</hi> whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple demanded to keep in their custody, together with all those Captains who had subscribed in favour of President <hi>Cenano:</hi> The Archbishop by his singular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, prudence and gravity, did labour so far that an accord was determined, whereupon the Bels rung out for joy, and a white Flag was hung up in <hi>Castelnovo</hi> by the Viceroy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:32004:26"/>
But when the Souldiers who were in Garrison in <hi>Castelnovo</hi> faw a crue of people drawing towards the Palace, they gave a volly of shot to the people without bullet; but the people thinking that their Muskets were charg'd, they fell all with their Face on the ground; nor did the people go then on any hostile intent, but to congratulate. Yet as the Devil would have it, the report went that five hundred of the people were kill'd by them of the Palace: so the Accord was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, and the War grew hot again. From <hi>Sancta Lucia</hi> they began to batter the Castle where the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy kept his Court, discharging all their great Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which did some hurt to the adjacent places; the Castle answered, and also the Castle of Saint <hi>Elmo;</hi> but the people being nothing at all dastardiz'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but incited still by the Women; the whole day was spent in shooting off the great Cannons on both sides: The House of <hi>Don Diego Manciohe</hi> was saluted by divers shots, but did not much hurt: <hi>Porto</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by some of the Canons; whereupon they set up the Kings Picture in a high Balcone, but a Cannon bullet shot it through and through.</p>
                        <p>In the Evening they chose for the Elect of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Lord <hi>Don Francisco Turaldo</hi> Prince of <hi>Massa,</hi> who mounting on horseback, undertook the business, and dispens'd his orders accordingly. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Castle of Saint <hi>Elmo,</hi> as also <hi>Castelnovo</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged four Cannon bullets apiece, then a suspension of Arms was agreed upon, and a Treaty was resum'd for an accord, but in vain: For there were ten Heads of slain <hi>Spaniards</hi> six'd upon poles, and carried in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph up and down the City.</p>
                        <p>The next day, the great Artillery that was planted
<pb facs="tcp:32004:26"/>
upon <hi>Sancta Lucia,</hi> did some hurt to <hi>Castelnovo;</hi> the same day they of <hi>Porto</hi> secur'd themselves with good Trenches rear'd up in the uight time: but there was a strict watch laid, that nothing either for belly or back, any other thing, should be carried to the Castle where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iceroy was.</p>
                        <p>The Camp-master General sent forth an Order that all the street-Captains, and other Captains of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, should meet at Saint <hi>Augnstin,</hi> to treat and determine some capitulations for peace, which was done accordingly: And when they were agreed upon, they sent them to his Excellency by six Captains of Foot, accompanied by the Lord Bishop of <hi>Salut,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Filomarini's</hi> brother: But that morning there were discovered some Trenches cast up in the night at the <hi>Hospitaletto:</hi> there were others cast up in <hi>Toledo</hi> street; for both parties digg'd night and day notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Treaty; besides that which remain'd of the Duke of <hi>Ostuni's</hi> moveables were committed to the mercy of the Fire, and his House was turn'd to a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; above his Palace they planted great Muskets, with other kind of Artilleries to batter the <hi>Castelnovo;</hi> the Son of the said Duke was kill'd at <hi>Pizzifalione;</hi> besides, they planted two great Cannons upon the Trenches of <hi>Porto</hi> to annoy <hi>Castelnovo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When this rumor began, there were in the Castle the L. Prior of <hi>Rocella,</hi> the L. Prior of <hi>Caraceioli, Don J. Baptista,</hi> and the Duke of Saint <hi>Petro,</hi> whither they retir'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves during the broyl, with divers other personages of high rank, for their safety: some of them went forth one day, and the Camp-master-general clapp'd them up in prison, because they conceiv'd some jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies of them, nor could they pump any thing out
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32004:27"/>
of them in point of information; they surpriz'd also <hi>Don John Lorio Sanfelice,</hi> but they chop'd off his Head as a President to the most faithful people.</p>
                        <p>The President <hi>Cenano</hi> was shut up in prison by the people of <hi>Santa Lucia,</hi> and they put him with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor in a great chair, and carried them about the great streets, and in the <hi>Sellaria</hi> they took off his Head, burning his clothes afterwards; They chop'd off the Head also of a Corporal of Sergeants called <hi>Marchetol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo:</hi> The next day there was a Truce accorded; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding both parties went on in entrenching and fortifying night and day. The Camp-Master-General being well informed of the innocency of some Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists which were in prison, joyned with some street-Captains he freed them, which business was delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who upon their enlargement took Oath to be faithful unto the City.</p>
                        <p>They took off the head also of the Corporal of the Sergeants of <hi>Porto,</hi> who said that in those places where they made their fortifications there should be so many Gallowses and Gibbets set up to hang those who wrought in the said fortifications; all which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by pregnant proof, and authentick witnesses, and in three hours he was dispatched. The scale of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Justice was found, but he did it upon a stone by reason of the fury of the people: There was order given that the Holy Sacrament should be exposed and set open in divers Churches, that it would please God to enlighten the hearts of the people to see the right; Besides the Nuns with poor maidens amongst them made solemn processions, repeating the most holy <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</hi> There was scarce a post or place without and within the City butw as intrench'd which made the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32004:27"/>
world wonder where they could get so much Cannon.</p>
                        <p>A company of Priests appeared who went with their Sotunes raised up; at the head of them there marched a very Reverend Church-man upon a Ginet, with a gold Cross in his hand; but this gave rather an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of scandal and murmuring, nor was it well taken by the people.</p>
                        <p>They pillag'd all <hi>Genovino</hi>'s goods, who for many days before had withdrawn himself to the Castle; and if they could have laid hold on him they would have sent him after President <hi>Cenano</hi> to the other world.</p>
                        <p>The next day a Peace was publish'd, which made every one to dance for joy; yet the Viceroy thought it not safe to come out of <hi>Castelnovo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After dinner the Lord Cardinal <hi>Filomarino</hi> went on horse-back with the Prince of <hi>Massa,</hi> and Camp-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-General, and rid up and down the streets, all cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Peace, Peace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Towards the evening there came out an Edict in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Precincts of the City, wherein the Viceroy did thank the most faithful people of <hi>Naples</hi> for their good wills and inclination to peace. He ordered likewise, That none should speak of the Castle of S. <hi>Elino,</hi> which was fortified and furnished with all things necessary: Now, amongst other places, he understood that the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make a new motion that that Fortress should be in their hands.</p>
                        <p>The next day they took the Goods of President <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi> which they had conserv'd in a Convent of <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Nuns, and brought them to the <hi>Sellaria;</hi> they brought thither also the Goods of <hi>Giovamis S. Felice,</hi> which all passed the flames. They gave out an Order also to take the Son of <hi>Sanfelice, Don Lucio;</hi> because
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32004:28"/>
he had given out in a menacing manner, That he would make the people of <hi>Naples</hi> eat the very earth in lieu of bread. Now the said <hi>Don Lucio</hi> was a great Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master in <hi>Aversa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They of the people went to the Convent of the <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuni</hi> on Mount <hi>Olivct,</hi> where there was Abbot the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Tonno de Angelis,</hi> together with the Visitor-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they were both put in a Coach, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart from <hi>Naples.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One among the people cried up and down the street' <hi>Guerra, Guerra,</hi> War, War; but he was put to prison by Order of the Prince of <hi>Massa,</hi> then he was shot to death, and his head carried up and down the City for a disturber of the peace of the most faithful people of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Monks of the Trinity made themselves prisoners to the Popes Nuntio; and upon that Church door they fastned an Edict that had passed, wherein she was stil'd, <hi>La Santissima Trinita de Spagnuoli, The most Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spaniards;</hi> they caused that Edict to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd and torn in pieces: They a little after made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner <hi>Caesar Sanfelice,</hi> for some words which drop'd from him which gave scandal.</p>
                        <p>The next day those Capitulations of peace which were accorded 'twixt the Viceroy and the most faithful people came out, and were published in divers precincts of the City, whereupon they raz'd some of their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. His Excellency form'd a new Company of three hundred Officers, all Italians, making a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over them, Captain <hi>Biasi di Fosco,</hi> a person of high resolution and merit.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy sent prisoner to <hi>Spain Julio Genovino</hi> upon a Galley, who was accused to be the first inciter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32004:28"/>
of <hi>Massaniello,</hi> and the chiefest fomenter of all the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults; Doctor <hi>Luis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>i Capaccio</hi> at the instance of the most faithful people was appointed to be the Minister for confirming and swearing the foresaid Articles of peace 'twixt his Excellency and the most faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but the Viceroy was advised by the Collateral Councel, not to go forth in person out of the Castle to swear unto those Articles, but that the Oath should be administred to both parties within the Walls of <hi>Castelnovo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day being Sunday, the City sent to, the Viceroy in behalf of the most faithful people, that the Articles should be effectually ratified within the Arch-Bishops House; His Excellency returned an exeuse, that he was not well disposed in his health, and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed examples, besides that in such cases all treaties were used to be confirmed within the Castle: Thereupon the Camp-Master General <hi>Don Francisco Turaldo</hi> went thither, being accompanied with all the Officers of War, beginning with the <hi>Alferez</hi> of Lieutenants, to higher Degrees, together with the General of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance <hi>Ottavio Marchise,</hi> all on horseback, and it was a very goodly sight; the horses were extraordinary, but the horsemen were not so good, being oppidane: and <hi>Turaldo</hi> himself being sick of the Gout went in a Sedan. They all entred into the Castle in a solemn manner, where the Articles were all sworn unto; and so they return'd into the City very well satisfied, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in outward appearance.</p>
                        <p>The next day they entred the House of <hi>Francisco de Lieto,</hi> a principal Merchant, and of very high credit, an honest man and much honoured, where there was a pillar which the people took exceptions at, and would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32004:29"/>
carry it away; He said that he had lost upon the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> fifty thousand Crowns, and he would spend fifty thousand more, provided that the <hi>Gabels</hi> were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and setled; But they went to call in more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to plunder him, which he perceiving he stole away surreptitiously; Thereupon they imprisoned his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and took away a great quantity of Cloth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merchandizes of value; Thus when some thought the insurrection had been ended, it began afresh: they began to double their Guard again; but they freed the rich Merchant <hi>di Lieto</hi> for a ransom.</p>
                        <p>In regard of the absence of the Nobility who were retired to their Countrey-Houses, and abandoned the City, trade began to decay extreamly, and the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans went up and down the streets like vagabonds ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to do. Thete came news from <hi>Sicily,</hi> that his Catholick Majesty had confirm'd the capitulations of peace with the <hi>Palermitans,</hi> which caused much joy in the City, in regard they hoped that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty would ratifie their Articies also in as ample manner.</p>
                        <p>There came fresh information, that <hi>Don John of Austria, Generalissimo</hi> of the Seas, and natural Son to his Catholick Majesty, was with a royal Fleet at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> he sent to the Viceroy to provide some provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Gallies; but he returned answer, That there was little convenience to accommodate them there, but the Island which his Royal Highness was at, was more proper for to furnish Bisket, and other necessaries: It was wonderful to see how dexterous the Citizens of <hi>Naples,</hi> were in handling their Arms, in their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of war, in their marches and watches, as if they had been bred souldiers all their lives.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:32004:29"/>
There were solemn processions made by all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houses within and without the City, for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction to come from Heaven upon the last agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that God almighty would please to inspire the heart of the Catholick King, to confirm the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations for avoyding of more blocdshed, but it seems their solemnities took little effect, as shall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The great statue of silver was carried up and down with that of Saint <hi>Germano</hi> Protector of <hi>Naples;</hi> but aster the end of the processions the said silver statue of Saint <hi>James</hi> was replac'd in the Arch-bishops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace: There happened some stir the next day after, touching <hi>Joseph Palumbo</hi> Lieutenant of the people, who had the chief charge of the Magazines of Gun-powder; Notice was taken, and complaints made, that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered too great a proportion to go for the Castles, but that it should be reserved for the service of the most faithful people; therefore the said <hi>Palumbo</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to Saint <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> but being a popular man, and one known to be a good Patriot, and of a publick soul, and a prrson of integrity; there were four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the best armed men joyn'd together, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and free the said <hi>Falumbo,</hi> and there was like to be a hot fray, and bloody business, had not the Prince of <hi>Massa,</hi> General to the City, with much ado and no less discretion appeased the tumult.</p>

                        <p>THe first day of <hi>October,</hi> 1647. The Castle of Saint <hi>Elmo</hi> hung up the great Standard upon sight of his Catholick Majesties Royal Army, there entred afterward into the Port, five and fourty great Vessels and as it was thought the Galleys of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>Don John of Austria:</hi> A Rumour ran that they carried six thousand fresh Foot, others said they came but to three thousand. All the Royal Castles saluted them, the Quay was throng'd with many thousands of people to fee the Fleet; It was then certainly known, that his Royal Highness was aboard the Galeones, thereupon it was ordered that Prince <hi>Thraldo</hi> with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qata</hi> the Elect of the people, should go to tender a Tribute of due Obsequies and Reverence to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and he with many evidences of affection receiv'd them, and gave audience, saying, that he was ready to do whatsoever they desired or could imagine to have, having authority from his Majesty to grant a Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32004:30"/>
of all things, provided that the Arms should be consign'd to his Excellency, and put in the Castles. They carried him a plentiful present, two hundred Turky-Cocks, two hundred Capons, two hundred pair of pigeons, twelve Calves of <hi>Surrento,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of choice Fruit upon twelve Felucas: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all very joyfully, causing some pieces of Gold to be hurl'd into the Felucas among those who carried the presents. The same Evening the Viceroy sent him a hundred Weathers, a hundred gammons of Bacon, with other commodities.</p>
                        <p>The next day his Highness signified his pleasure, That he was desirous to disimbarque and put foot on shore, but he desir'd that first the City should disarm: Hereupon all the Captains of War, and all the Street-Captains assembled at S. <hi>Augustin</hi> to conclude upon that which his Highness demanded; but the common people of the Market and of <hi>Lavinaro</hi> forc'd into the said Church, threatning death to all the Captains who were there met, who dismiss'd the Parliament for the time, and referr'd all to his Highness. The next day <hi>Arpaia</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> of the people was inorder'd to go to his Highness, and desire him that he would come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore but with a limited number, whereunto <hi>Don John</hi> gave no pleasing ear: The next day a choice number of Captains went to attend his Highness, and to advertise him, that the people were willing to lay down their Arms, and put them up in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, not otherwise; this likewise gave little content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentto his Highness.</p>
                        <p>The next day certain Spanish Souldiers came down from <hi>Castlenovo</hi> with a company of Reformadoes, and made themselves masters of <hi>Caesar Lubrano</hi>'s house in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32004:31"/>
the <hi>Hospitaletto,</hi> where they disarm'd all those that stood for the people, who were but few, because they depended upon the contract of Peace, all the Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es being destroy'd to that purpose round about the City: The Captain of that Post was a Glover, the Spanish Souldiers burnt the door of his house by an artificial fire, plunder'd him, as they did many other houses: All the three Castles began to play and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their great Guns, which struck a terrible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment into the women, but they did but little execution in regard of their distance, unless it was at <hi>Porto,</hi> which suffer'd much. The Captains of the people who were assembled in Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> and in <hi>Toledo-</hi>street went all into the Castles, as also some of the great Market, another Captain of <hi>Porto,</hi> of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> with divers other: Then the gross squadron of Spaniards came down, and with much cautiousness got possession of many of the importunest Ports in and about the City, without the loss of one soul.</p>
                        <p>The people of <hi>Toledo-</hi>quarter remain'd much asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd being without Captain, <hi>Alfarez,</hi> or any other Officer, as much as a Serjeant or Corporal: The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards seiz'd also upon <hi>Porto,</hi> but the people recover'd that again; for the people of the great Market came in great numbers, and revil'd them, calling them <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,</hi> with other opprobrious language, which inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to take Arms again.</p>
                        <p>The people thought they had all the justice of the world on their side, in regard, that according to the Capitulations with the Viceroy, they were to continue in Arms till the confirmation had come from <hi>Spain,</hi> which time was limited to three moneths; therefore the Prince <hi>Turaldo</hi> going to the great Market, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32004:31"/>
cryed out, <hi>We are betrayed, we are all betrayed:</hi> The Prince answer'd them with gentle language, and in substance; <hi>Son con voy, per morir con voy, sio hó fatto Errore la testa lo paghi, má io Son stato Gabbato con voy:</hi> I am with you, to dye with you, if I have offended let my head pay for it, but I have been cheated as well as you. From that time forward the people would not permit <hi>Turaldo</hi> to go out of their arms, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Castle, or aboard the Galeons. The Spaniards in the mean time stirr'd themselves notably, and took into their possession the Post of <hi>Porta Reale,</hi> with that of <hi>Porta Medina;</hi> the three Castles still played upon <hi>Santa Lucia</hi> and <hi>Chaia,</hi> whereupon they gave up their Arms into the hands of the Spaniards, and scarce any of the people peep'd out thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>That Night not only the three Castles, but the great Galeons which were in Port played upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and one would think by the horrid noise they made, that a house could not stand, yet the damage was not very great; thereupon his Highness published a strict and high Order, <hi>That every one should lay down his Arms upon pain of death;</hi> which many did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; considering with themselves how they had three Castles, a Fleet of Galeons, and another of Gallies against them; the Spaniards also having rendred themselves masters of so many Posts, and going on still in their Fortifications, but specially there being in the Port another <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet they did not lay down their Arms or Spirits, but with a flying squadron of two thousand foot they recover'd the Port of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the White port; they attempted to regain <hi>Reale</hi> and <hi>Porta Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina;</hi> but they fail'd in that enterprize, as God would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32004:32"/>
have it: Therefore Prince <hi>Turaldo</hi> was of opinion, it was better to fall to entrenching again, for fear the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> might gain more places and posts. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel was embrac'd; yet while they were busie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench, the flying squadron of two thousand foot did recover <hi>le fosse del Grano,</hi> and divers <hi>Spaniards</hi> fell there, for a great number of them coming to Saint <hi>Sebastian,</hi> upon the upper ground, they let fly upon them shot as thick as hail, as also at Saint <hi>Andrea,</hi> insomuch that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew not which way to turn themselves to avoid those fiery Tempests. A Lieutenant General of his Majesties was on horse-back, with about fourty horse, and stood before the house of <hi>Bernardo Turboli</hi> upon a special piece of service; but he was so wounded that his bowels gushed out, and so was carried to <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito Santo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Spaniards afterwards hurl'd themselves in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talana</hi> street, but the women out of the Balcones and Windows pelted them with stones, whereupon the Spaniards put fire to three Shops, and sack'd divers Houses besides, the Women flying away at the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. The Brigade of Reformado's advanc'd afterwards with many <hi>Napolitan</hi> Cavaliers in the Vanguard, and in the Rear a Company of Spaniards, with six Officers of War, <hi>Don Gaspar de Salta, Hieronymo Arnadeo,</hi> with others, united themselves in the street of <hi>Porta,</hi> as far as Saint <hi>Stephano,</hi> and the Spaniards as far as <hi>Jesu Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> but they were repell'd by the people by a flying squadron remaining Masters of <hi>Porta Medina</hi> and <hi>Porta Reale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Day following the people rush'd into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Vicaria,</hi> and burnt all the criminal Writings, setting at liberty fifteen hundred Felons, whom they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32004:32"/>
enroll'd for Souldiers, and fetch'd as many Arms as would serve their turn: Among those prisoners there was one <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who had been in the <hi>Candian</hi> wars for the service of the Signory of <hi>Venice:</hi> This <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had been a Commander a long time, being a man of knowledge and courage, therefore they put him in the head of a Troop; So there was hot skirmishing both night and day in the City on both sides, and the great Cannons played without intermission, wherein there was much slaughter. Most of the Officers did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and took the Communion, carrying the Badge of the <hi>Carmine,</hi> hoping thereby the holy Virgi n would protect them in the publick Service of their Countrey, and for disburdening themselves from the insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight of Gabels. The Artillery which stood upon the Tower of <hi>Carmine</hi> did notable service, and one Bullet was shot thence into the Royal Galeon, where <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> himself was: He therefore land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and got into the Palace of the Viceroy in safety, he is a comely youth, about twenty years of age, and full of Vigor and Resolution. His Sea-Commanders inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him most of all to begin the War, telling him, that half a dozen shots from the Galleons would so terrifie the people, that they would lay down their Arms, then the Sword-justice should restrain them afterwards. Both parties had now as it were beleaguer'd one another; all <hi>Toledo-</hi>street as far as the Palace, the <hi>Hospitaletto, Chaia,</hi> together with <hi>Santa Lueia,</hi> were full of armed men, insomuch that none could pass to and fro, nor did any bread appear in the Shops, or flesh in the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or fruit in the Market: There went such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from the City to <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> that they have half famished that place; thereupon the Viceroy propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32004:33"/>
a Truce, but the people refused.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> the next day rais'd up a great Trench about <hi>Porta Reale,</hi> together with a little Bulwark, which was done with that suddenness in the night time, that it could not be prevented; Coaches as well as Carts were employed to carry Materials up and down to fortifie: The <hi>Walloons</hi> who guarded <hi>Porta M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>dina</hi> rais'd also in an instant, as it were, a marvellous strong Trench, which the people offering to resist, they could not do it.</p>
                        <p>The people then occupied <hi>San Sebastian,</hi> they rush'd the <hi>Zezza</hi> or Exchequer, and seis'd upon all the silver violently into that was therein, with other treasure; as also all the banks of Moneys for the service of the Publick.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy publish'd a Declaration, <hi>That whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would bring Corn or Meal into the Castle he should be allow'd to sell it at such a rate for ready money.</hi> At that time there came a Galley laden with Corn from <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa;</hi> but the Galley-slaves killing the Captain made her run upon the sands, and so the people took her with five Cannons. There began to be a mighty scarcity in the City, yet the fury of the war grew hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Viceroy put forth a Proclamation, <hi>That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would come into any of the three Castles to serve their</hi>

                           <hi>King, his Catholick Majesty, should have an advance of pay, and be presently entertain'd:</hi> And that day 3 Brothers were detected to have a Design that way, but they were all put to death by the people who were heated more and more. There were divers Carts laden with dead bodies pass'd up and down the streets, to the number of fourty, this Morning; In the midst of the City the Picture of Death was set up near a red Flag; yet there went great numbers, that had neither houses nor shops to be plunder'd, to the Castles. There was a Design to make a Mine under Saint <hi>Ursola,</hi> and to blow it up with Gunpowder; but Prince <hi>Turaldo,</hi> in regard it was a Religious house, would not permit it, which made him to be somewhat suspected by the people; There were some houses near the Fathers of <hi>Santa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> which were burnt to the ground, and all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-houses which belong'd to the said Fathers, were us'd in the like manner; besides divers other fair hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses near <hi>San Suriano,</hi> that it was a most pitiful specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to behold it.</p>
                        <p>There was a Design discover'd, that a Priest had on foot against the most faithful people who was of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Giordani,</hi> they presently chopp'd off his head, and cut others to pieces in great numbers who were of the Conjuration: The Nuns of the <hi>Divine Love</hi> were remov'd for fear of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monastery, call'd the Sacrament near <hi>Francisco nuovo.</hi> There came from <hi>Nocera</hi> to serve the most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people four hundred fresh men very well arm'd, which did much encournge the City, and the next day after they came, they perform'd a notable piece of service against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were thought to begin to want powder; for there was a calculation
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32004:34"/>
made that they had discharg' d from the three Castles, Galleons and Gallies, above thirty three thousand Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets already.</p>
                        <p>There was a Captain made shorter by the head, in regard the people had some jealousies that he held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the Viceroy, having divers barrels of powder in his lodging which he had not discover'd.</p>
                        <p>The next morning betimes the Spaniards played from Land and Sea with their great Cannons, so that it made the very earth to tremble; they threw balls of wild-fire also into the City, which did notable hurt, and made both women and children to cry out, and howl miserably up and down the streets: The great Bell of <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> rung out again; but that night the Capuchin Fryer who was brother to the Archbishop, and was accounted a very holy man, was permitted to go to the Castle to his Highness <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> to whom he propos'd some terms of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation; <hi>Don John</hi> directed him to the Viceroy, but nothing could be obtain'd.</p>
                        <p>The Captain General of the people, the Prince of <hi>Massa,</hi> was suspected to have intelligence with the Enemy, in regard of a Lukewarmness they found in him in the execution of his Office, therefore he was committed prisoner to the <hi>Zapateria,</hi> in a certain dark Cave, and <hi>Chanchiero,</hi> who had chopp'd off the head of <hi>Don Peppo Caratta,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mataluni's</hi> brother, who was but a Shop-keeper, was appointed to exercise the Office of Captain General; for it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The people having made a Mine under <hi>Porta Reale</hi> it was discovered by the Spaniards, who seiz'd upon all the powder, and took some of the Miners, which they carried to the Castle. There was a very bloudy fight 'twixt the Citizens and the Spaniards, about the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gana</hi> or Custom-house, whence the people had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd above a Million of goods into the House of the Duke of <hi>Adri.</hi> There came four hundred fresh men from <hi>Sanseverino</hi> to serve the people, about which time a great many houses were burnt about <hi>Porta Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale.</hi> There came also six thousand Combatants for Recruites from other places, as <hi>Lauro, Nola,</hi> and other Towns, insomuch that the City had not wherewith to sustain them, they were in such numbers.</p>
                        <p>About the <hi>Dogana</hi> there was the most furious fight of all, which lasted six hours, wherein many hundred, were wounded and slain, but more on the peoples sides and all the while the great bell of St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> rang out, while they were shedding one anothers blood.</p>
                        <p>Thete were about a hundred boys called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zari,</hi> which had certain darts, who went up and down
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32004:35"/>
and put fire to the Convent of <hi>Jesu,</hi> where they rush'd in and did much hurt; but they were all beaten out by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day there was a tough and bloody skirmish at <hi>Porta Medina,</hi> and the great bell of St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> rung out three times; the Fight was pursued to <hi>Sancta Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> where the people broke open a gate, but they were forced to turn back by the exemplary valour of <hi>Don Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omede Caraffa,</hi> who had a very choice Brigade, though few in number; the next morning there was nothing but flames and smoak through the West side of the City, there were so many Houses, and some of them very fair ones, which were set on fire the night before, which had not yet done burning.</p>
                        <p>There came the next day three hundred men from <hi>Salerno</hi> for the assistance of the people, who were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd towards the Sea-side; that evening, and all night following the great Bell of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> sounded again, and the Fight continued all night most furiously, wherein many of the new <hi>Salerno-</hi>men breath'd their last.</p>
                        <p>The next day there was truce propos'd, but to little purpose; so they fell to it all night again, and many hundreds were slain: Among the people some of the Family of <hi>Parigi</hi> were shot to death, upon suspition to hold correspondence with the Castle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don John of Austria</hi> sent some Gallies with a design to secure <hi>Posilipo,</hi> but they fail'd in the effect; for the <hi>Spaniords</hi> were beaten back, being ore-powr'd by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. The people finding that they were weak in Horse, they made a new Cavalry, and they admitted some of the <hi>Banditi</hi> to their Troops, who had come to fish in these troubled waters, to command them. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32004:35"/>
Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi> had sent some choice Troops of Horse to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> which did extraordinary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He sent a Cavalier of Quality to the Captain-General of the People, to know the merit of their Cause, and why they were so active in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and the ruine of so many innocent souls, and such a glorious City: But the people sent back but an uncivil Answer, <hi>viz. That when the Confirmation was come from the Court of</hi> Spain <hi>they would send his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness another kind of Message; till then 'twas but just they should continue to stand upon their Guard, and repel any force, by that power which God and Nature had given them for the defence of themselves and their Franchises, together with their Wives and Children; yet persisting with firm resolution to continue in an exact obedience to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majesty, and not to listen to the Enchantments of any other Prince, which began to tamper with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for a Revolt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That night being a clear moon-shine, the people cull'd out three hundred Horse, and four thousand Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers and Pikemen, to keep in one body upon some design, and it was to meet with the Auxiliaries that the Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi> had sent; but they did not bring their intent home to their aim that night. The next morning a Ban was published, <hi>That none in any part of City or Suburb should plunder, under pain of death;</hi> which was obeyed accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 19. of <hi>September</hi> the great Bell rung out for every one to be in a posture ready to fight: There was fire put to the house of the Prince of <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarchio,</hi> hard by the <hi>Dogana</hi> of Corn, and a general skirmishing continued all night long till the <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, at which time there came out a Procession of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32004:36"/>
Friers in a doleful grave posture, with their faces bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the earth, which struck such a sense of mortality among them, that there was a White Flag raised up for a Truce, which the Castle condescended unto; but notable execution had been done on both sides the night before, so that the greatest business of the next Sabbath was to bury their dead.</p>
                        <p>The night following there poured down such fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cataracts of rain that hindered all kind of action on both sides; but upon <hi>Munday</hi> there was a tough Fight happened betwixt the Brigade of the Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi> and the people at <hi>Marano,</hi> three of his Commanders had their Heads chop'd off in the great Market-place, besides there was one hanged who had been surprized and searched, and a Letter found about him from the Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi> to the Viceroy.</p>
                        <p>The next day the voice went up and down, That if there were not terms propounded for a sudden Peace they intended to introduce Forreign force, and fix up a Protest against his Excellency: The sound of this voice went up to the Castle. There was brought that day the Head of Captain <hi>John Rosso di Nola</hi> into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, who was one of the chief Commanders in the Brigade of the Duke of <hi>Mataluni.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A publick Ban was fixed upon the Church-doors, and in the publick Market place, as also upon the gates of the City, that all Cavaliers who had withdrawn themselves from the City might return with safety, which was done at the importunity of the Artisans, who cried out that all Trade was failed, which they imputed principally to their absence. The 20. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> there was a general assault made, and the most pertinacious was at <hi>Santa Lucia</hi> upon the hill, and at
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32004:36"/>
S. <hi>Martins;</hi> They of the people would have forced their passage that way, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intrenched, they could do no good, notwithstanding that the Dispnte was extreme eager and hot; eleven <hi>Spaniards</hi> were taken prisoners, besides those that were hurt and killed. The next day there was a furious Dispute at <hi>Porta Medina,</hi> where the people had made a Mine, which wrought a contrary effect, and flew in their own faces, insomuch that divers were blown into the air, some killed on the ground, and divers pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disfigured.</p>
                        <p>The next day the people caus'd their own Head to be beheaded, which was the Prince of <hi>Massa, Tural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> their General, because he had caus'd sand to be put into some Barrels in lieu of Gun-powder, specially in those which were to do execution near <hi>Jesus</hi> Church: His Body and his Head were brought to the open Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, to be a spectacle to all people: And about that time the Spaniards sallied in divers places out of their Trenches, and did notable execution upon the Citizens, while they were gazing on the Head of their General.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 22 of <hi>September,</hi> having been engag'd in fight all night long, the people put forth a publick <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesto</hi> in print, with their reasons why they had taken Arms, therefore they desired his Holiness, together with the Emperour, and all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so all other Christian Princes, to be sensible of their sad condition, and assist them, not onely with their prayers, but with their Arms, in so just a quarrel; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that besides the recompence which they might expect from the goodness of God in an act of so much lawfulness and piety, that most faithful people would

                        <p>The Prince of <hi>Turaldo</hi> who had a good while serv'd the people in quality of a General, having receiv'd the Pass-port to go to the other World without his Head, <hi>Gennaro Arnese</hi> succeeded him in that publick charge: The first piece of Justice he did was to condemn a Captain to have his Head struck off, for violating a Woman in the Doury of Virgins where he had his Command.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Turaldo</hi> being gone, 'twas imagin'd by some that it would facilitate the way to peace; and that which rais'd the hopes of some the more, was, because his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness's <hi>Nuntio</hi> had gone to the Castle, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that solemn audience; but nothing came of it, so that all the next day there was nothing but skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in every corner.</p>
                        <p>The 23. of <hi>September,</hi> six hundred of the people 'twixt Horse and Foot, went to <hi>Marano</hi> in succour of that important Post, where they found three thousand Horse of the <hi>Barons;</hi> in particular, the Marquess of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cagnano,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mataluni,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Monte Sarchio,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Caivano,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Marianella,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Siana,</hi> and a number of other Cavaliers, all which were repelled by them of the place, and the succour which came from the City; among other, their Captain General was killed, and thirteen more, whose Heads were brought to the great Market-place in triumph, with divers prisoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                        <p>The next day the great Cannons from the three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles plaid more furiously than ever, and made both Towers and Steeples, Houses, Monasteries, and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32004:37"/>
to tremble every where. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to open a passage at <hi>Vemero,</hi> which was a Post of mighty consequence; the Dispute was very stubborn, and wonderful hot, lasting above three hours; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were made to retire at last, being surprized by night. That day the people did strictly command, that under great penalties the Cavaliers should keep within their houses, nor were they suffered to go hear Mass inany Church for fear of Conventicles: They sent their Orders abroad likewise in the Countrey cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent, that they should bring provision to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and other Assistances, under pain of Rebellion. The day following it was pitiful how the Women went howling up and down with their Children at their breasts, crying out for Bread, which was come down to 11. Ounces. There came into the post eleven Gallies from <hi>Genoa</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Tursi,</hi> who all saluted the Castles, and the Castles them; besides, the <hi>Torrion</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> gave them also divers Salutes in behalf of the people; but the said Duke coming ashore was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards clap'd up in prison.</p>
                        <p>There came six hundred fresh Souldiers from <hi>Sanse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verino</hi> and the precincts thereabouts for succour of the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> who upon their Ensigns brought the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Death; They were quartered about the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of S. <hi>Andrea,</hi> the Nuns being removed thence to another place.</p>
                        <p>Certain Letters which were sent from the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the most Christian King to the most faithful people of <hi>Naples</hi> were publickly read, being consign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Don Luigi Ferro,</hi> who had been Ambassador for the people in dispersing the foresaid <hi>Manifesto</hi> up &amp; down: The proffers which the Christian King made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32004:38"/>
to the Republick of <hi>Naples</hi> were accepted, which was two Millions of Gold, twenty Galeons, eighteen Gallies, and fourty Tartanas: Thereupon a Feluca was dispatched with an Express from the people to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the said propositions, and whatsoever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them. This Express was to go to <hi>Don Luigi Ferro,</hi> who was then in <hi>Rome,</hi> negotiating with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26. of <hi>September,</hi> the people sent out a <hi>Ban</hi> to call in all the Barons up and down all the Countrey for their assistance, under pain of burning their Houses, and other penalties.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy understanding what had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Franee</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and that <hi>Johu Baptista Ferro</hi> was sent expresly to <hi>Rome</hi> about it, he sent present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof to his Catholick Majesties Ambassadour there resident at that time, to do what diligences he thought fitting in so pressing occasions. In the mean time all that day there was fighting in divers posts about the City, and much bloud spilt. The Viceroy caused the great Cistern of Oyl, which was near <hi>Porta Reale,</hi> to be emptied, and to be sold for the use of the Souldiery, wherein there was computed to be above one hundred thousand Sesters or Quarts. The Viceroy, Cardinal <hi>Filomarino,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Tursis,</hi> they say, had a private Conference over the Walls therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts that afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The next day the voice in many places of the City, <hi>Viva Francia,</hi> Let <hi>France</hi> live, in other places, <hi>Viva il Parlamento d'Inghilterra,</hi> Let the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> live, which caused <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> and the Viceroy to have Fleas in their Ears. The rumour went that <hi>Monsieur de Fountain,</hi> Ambassadour at <hi>Rome</hi> for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32004:38"/>
his most Christian Majesty had sent four Veteran Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for the service of the City, who had order to let them know that he had a Million every year to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for the preservation of their liberties, terming them a most noble, and a most generous people. They of the long Robe went melancholy up and down the <hi>Streets,</hi> complaining that they were undone for want of practice, w ich was no wonder, for <hi>Inter armasilent leges;</hi> there was news brought, that the Duke of <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luni</hi> was towards <hi>Aversa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There came another express from <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Baptista Ferro</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> was resolv'd, and would make good his purpose, and promise, to preserve <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> in quality of a Common-wealth; thereupon the cry up and down went <hi>Viva Francia,</hi> Let <hi>France</hi> live; which they strain'd their throats to cry so loud, that the sound thereof might reach to <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> which was but a harsh note in the ears of the Viceroy and his Highness. That day there was fire put to the house of <hi>Nicolo Tinano</hi> in the <hi>Piazza</hi> ofS. <hi>Elmo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The General <hi>Gennaro Arnese</hi> put out'a Declaration, that none under pain of death should say, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the King of <hi>France</hi> was false; wherefore another Express was sent to the French Army to sollicit their haste. The 30. of <hi>September</hi> the fight was somewhat cold, as if the spirits on both sides had languish'd.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy caus'd a Letter to be Printed in form of a <hi>Manifesto</hi> to be sent to all the Barons throughout the Kingdoms, wherein he required them in his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majesties Name, to contribute and send speedily what Auxiliaries and assistants they could to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the tumultuous humours of these Mechanicks.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, they caus'd the Capitulations
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32004:39"/>
which were made with the Crown of <hi>France</hi> to be stampt and fairly printed. They also put out a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against the Barons, If they contributed any aid or advantage whatsoever to the Viceroy against them.</p>
                        <p>'Twixt the <hi>Conciaria</hi> and <hi>Lavinaro</hi> there was a great contest whether they should receive the King of <hi>France,</hi> or continue still under the Catholick King; but at last it was concluded that they would have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they would reduce themselves to the form of a Republick, according to the example of old <hi>Rome,</hi> their next neighbour, who never flourish'd more then under the form of a Republick. Another answered, that to establish any thing, it must have first a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we must not be transported with <hi>Chimeras,</hi> and build Castles in the Air.</p>
                        <p>The report ran that divers of the Nobles had taken Port at <hi>Capo di Chino,</hi> which fill'd the City full of odd thoughts; because it was a post of infinite advantage: Therefore all that night there was nothing but shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of small and great Guns, ringing of bells to fight, and much hurt was done on both sides, both to men and houses, which ceased about the morning.</p>
                        <p>Newes came to the City, that yesterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was a great contention betwixt the Brigades that the Nobles had levied, whereof some would cry <hi>Viva Francia,</hi> others <hi>Viva Spagna,</hi> and the Dispute went so high, that from words they fell to Arms, and 200. were slain upon the place of those that cried for <hi>France.</hi> The Army of the Barons were advanced as far as <hi>Aversa,</hi> where they made a hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:32004:39"/>
The next day the Bell of <hi>Santa Barbara</hi> within <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelnovo</hi> rung out as a Signal to battel, which was not done before; Thereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came down with a great deal of violence; and the people endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get <hi>Porta Medina</hi> and <hi>Porto Reale,</hi> specially <hi>Vomero,</hi> which was next under the Castle, the dispute was very eager and bloody; but those places by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the great Cannon were notably defended, and a great slaughter made of the Citizens which made the women go up and down the streets like frantick folks; one crying out for her husband, another for her brothers, another for her Children; so that it would have softned a heart of stone, and they began then to revile not only the Viceroy, and <hi>Don John of Austria,</hi> calling him unlucky Bastard; but they fell with foul terms upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himself, crying out, <hi>Viva Francia, Viva il Parlamento d' Inghilterra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Barons bestir'd themselves notably in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and made themselves Masters of <hi>Scafati,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Tower</hi> where the people were strongly entrench'd, but forc'd to yield and run away: And the same hour that I was writing this, there was a bloody combat at <hi>Porta Reale</hi> and <hi>Porta Medina,</hi> and <hi>New Jesu,</hi> which was so batter'd, that it can never be repair'd again: The slaughter was such, that dead bodies were carried away by Cart-loads, and great pits made to hurl in the carkases; so that one Priest serv'd for many to sing their requiems; Then they discharg'd some Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in the Castle with powder onely for joy and triumph.</p>
                        <p>I will now relate here what persons they were that were the first raisers of these horrid tumults. It must be presupposed that about the lower places of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32004:40"/>
great Market-place, as also in <hi>Lovinaro, Conciaria, Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria,</hi> at Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Santa Maria Loreto,</hi> and the <hi>hourg</hi> of the Virgins, there were about thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men that used to goe barefoot, with Canvass slops, and onely their shirts upward; these men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving most of them upon the Retailing of Fish, Hearbs, Sallets, Flowers, and such petty Commodities; and some of them carrying Cruses of Oyl, Fruits, Bread, Honey, with other things of the like Nature about the <hi>Streets;</hi> Most of them have their Wives, who attend their Labours at home, as beating of Flax, spinning and washing; These people are very prolifical and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they have abundance of Children; they fare hard and lie upon Mattresses; for few of them have any sheets, yet they earn about twelve pence a Day; They have no stable possessions at all, but what they have is from hand to mouth: They are called in <hi>Naples Scalzi,</hi> that is, unshod people; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they go most an end bare-footed; Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Food, besides Roots and Fruit, is a little Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con put betwixt two pieces of Bread, having boiled or rosted it before to make it melt upon the Bread to make it savory; They have nothing but Water to drink after it, and this is commonly their Dinner; for Supper they have commonly but Hearbs and Grass, whereof they will eat as much as a Horse, a little Oyl and Vinegar; and divers of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bread.</p>
                        <p>They live best in Fruit time, whereof there is greater store about the City of <hi>Naples</hi> then any where else; and Fruit time doth last there near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on six Moneths: They feed much upon Figs, which are there very great, and most delicate; yet these
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32004:40"/>
people are plump and well to pass, vigorous and hearty, notwithstanding that their greatest sustenance is fruit.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> had imposed a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ornese which is less then a farthing upon every two pounds of Fruit by way of <hi>Gabel,</hi> and this year afforded more quantity of Fruit then ordinary: These poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grew half mad thereupon, considering what Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were imposed upon all other Commodities as far as bread, which is the staff of Life: <hi>Massaniello,</hi> as was related before, assisted by a number of these poor people, burnt the Gabell-House in the Market place, and committed other high Acts of Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy commanded the House to be set up again, and continued still to exact the said Gabell upon Fruit: Thereupon they grew more incensed and resolute then they were before; and the Artisans with other of the best sort of Citizens joyning with them for the Common interest and Freedome, the Tumult by Degrees ascended to this monstruous height, that whereas before they spoke Reverently of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they now villifie him together with <hi>Don John</hi> his Bastard, and crye up the King of <hi>France,</hi> knowing him to be a mortall Enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to be now in Actuall Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; besides by the information of some Merchants here, they had notice how matters pass'd in <hi>England;</hi> Therefore oftentimes they cry out, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va el Parlamento d' Inghilterra;</hi> and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ended the Moneth of <hi>October</hi> within the City of <hi>Naples.</hi>

We are now on the first day of <hi>November,</hi> the Feast of <hi>All Saints;</hi> and to begin the Moneth, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> shot very furiously from the Castle of Saint <hi>Elmo,</hi> and gave them hot Alarums; but this was onely in the Morning; they were quiet all the Day after.</p>

WHile these prodigious tumults succeded in the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> I must not omit to declare that in <hi>Calabria</hi> at most Towns by a kind of strange influence, the same spirit of insurrection did possess the people. They of <hi>Monteleone</hi> did tumultuously rise up, and burnt 3 houses, which made <hi>Don Fabricio Pigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello,</hi> Duke of the said City, to hasten thither for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the broyls in his own person, and for that time his presence did so prevail, being attended by the Nobility, and others of best rank, that he quench'd those popular flames, and brought divers of the chief Mutineers to punishment, whereby he setled a perfect quietness, not only in the City of <hi>Monteleone,</hi> but in all the places adjacent.</p>
            <p>But when the said people had understood how stoutly the people of <hi>Naples</hi> held out still, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arrival of Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> whom they called the <hi>By-blow</hi> of his Majesty: The said Duke of <hi>Monteleone</hi> finding the inclinations of the people general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an insurrection, and their spirits elevated to a high pitch, by the example and constancy of <hi>Naples,</hi> he wisely gathered what choice men he could to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number, and having got a good Vessel, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Brigantine, he arrived safely to the Port of <hi>Naples</hi> the first of <hi>November,</hi> whence he went presently to <hi>Castlenovo</hi> to do his Observance to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> who with extraordinary demonstrations of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and affection received him. Whereupon the said
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32004:42"/>
Duke offer'd with many hot Protestations to make litter of his life for the service of his Catholick Majesty the King his Master, upon all occasions, though never so full of imminent and unavoidable danger; which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations he made good afterwards by his Actions; so he dis-imbarqued the fifteen hundred men he brought, with a good quantity of Arms, Corn, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions which he brought along with him from <hi>Calabria.</hi> That night the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being much animated by these new Auxiliaries, and the person of so gallant a man, made sallies out of the Castles down towards the City, where they sought in three several posts all night long, and the people of <hi>Naples</hi> were ready to receive them; so that they got little at that time. The next day the Viceroy had a design upon <hi>Pusilipo,</hi> and to that purpose sent thither a considerable force; but the passages being narrow, and the people resolute to live and dye with the <hi>Napolitans,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were repelled with some considerable loss, so that they re-imbarked themselves, and so retir'd.</p>
            <p>The next Morning three hundred <hi>Calabreses</hi> more were sent from the Prince of <hi>Satriano</hi> as a new supply for the Viceroy, in behalf of the Catholick King his Master. There were tidings also brought from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Barons, That Don <hi>Vicenzo de Tuttavilla</hi> had parted from <hi>Aversa</hi> towards the <hi>Greek</hi> Tower, and <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fati,</hi> where runs the source of the waters that drive all the Mills thereabouts; it was beleagured by three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the people; <hi>Tuttavillia</hi> had with him six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse, the Duke of <hi>Andria,</hi> with others, six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more, the Duke <hi>Martina</hi> sixty, the Marquess of <hi>Turiviso</hi> two hundred Horse, and fifteen hundred Foot, the Prince of <hi>Yorella</hi> three hundred Foot, and three
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32004:42"/>
hundred Horse, the Prince of <hi>Supino</hi> fifty Horse, the Count of <hi>Santa Maria</hi> in <hi>Grisone</hi> thirty Horse, the Duke of <hi>Cassa Massima</hi> fifty Horse, and <hi>Tonno Gentili</hi> having left <hi>Aversa</hi> to the Government of the Duke of <hi>Matalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> who had two hundred <hi>Banditi,</hi> together with the Duke of <hi>Sora</hi> fifteen hundred Horse, the Prince of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> fifty Horse, and the Camp-Master <hi>Marco Laudulpho</hi> of the said City was inordered to keep his Station at some distance from the City.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy having seasonable notice of the motion of the Army under the Barons, gave Order to batter the Trenches about <hi>Porto;</hi> but they were so well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and barricadoed that the Artillery could do no good.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Massaniello</hi>'s Command was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd in the City, <hi>That none must go abroad in a Cloak or upper Garments, but all en cuerpo.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luni</hi> maintaining his Brigade upon his own expence, without one Carlin charge to His Majesty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding some Quarter to guard, he was assigned that of <hi>Santa Lucia</hi> on the Hill, a place of the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, because the Enemy had means thence to batter <hi>Castelnovo.</hi> About midnight an Alarm was given by the Enemy, and the said Duke would have exposed his own person in the Van, which he did, and did nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble execution upon the Citizens. The next day being returned to the castle his Highness <hi>Don John</hi> fell embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of him, expressing much Thankfulness and Joy.</p>
            <p>The people the day following took eight of <hi>Puzzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olo</hi> men Prisoners, with a Corporal of the Duke of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tàluni</hi>'s, who had been freed formerly by the said peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when the <hi>Vicaria</hi> was taken; he was hanged in the Market-plaee. The City made great provisions for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32004:43"/>
the Frenchmen, whom they expected to come for Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries; whereupon the Viceroy sent some choice Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys to <hi>Pusilipo,</hi> and other places, with two hundred men upon a design. The same morning the General of the Barons Army march'd to <hi>Cerra,</hi> where he found the Prince of <hi>Montesarchio,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Fraia</hi> (who was Governour of that place) with three hundred Horse and two hundred Foot; with these three was Don <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Caracciola,</hi> the Son of the Duke of <hi>Cosenza,</hi> Don <hi>Fabricio Spinello,</hi> Don <hi>Jusepe Mastrillo,</hi> and <hi>Carlo Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano</hi> a Captain of a Troop of Horse, together with Don <hi>Antonio Tuttavilla,</hi> Don <hi>Francisco de Vargas,</hi> 'twixt <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon <hi>Munday</hi> the fourth of <hi>November</hi> the Citizens of <hi>Naples</hi> sent in the Name of the most faithful People two thousand Foot well armed towards the <hi>Greek-</hi>Tower: The Duke of <hi>Tursis</hi> with much difficulty did land his Goods, with some of His Highnesses Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi> The rumour ran, That his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majesty sent a peremptory Command, that an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation should be made with the people by all means possible, and that the War should cease. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Highhess sent a person of quality to tell the people how he received a great deal of consolation that he had found so much experience of the most faithful people in the Alleglance to his Catholick Majesty, in that they had caused some of theirs to be taken off, whose tongues had cried out, <hi>Viva Francia,</hi> therefore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32004:43"/>
there should be reasonable Justice done to all their just demands. Thereupon they proposed, That the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> should be removed: Secondly, That His Highness might govern them; Thirdly, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in <hi>Vallom</hi> should retire to <hi>Castlenovo;</hi> Fourthly, that the chief Incendiaries should depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Fifthly, that the Castle of S. <hi>Elmo</hi> should be in the hands of the people, with the posts about it, as it was in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour; Sixthly, and lastly, they desired a performance of the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations agreed upon at first.</p>
            <p>The next day the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Montelione</hi> imbarqued themselves, who came to preserve that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in her obedience and security. The people thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on removed, and planted some of their Artillery in the Palace of Cardinal <hi>Filomarino</hi> and S. <hi>George</hi> the Great, that they might the more conveniently shoot at the Castles; which many wondred at, considering there was an Overture of Treaty made; the Barons Army met all in one gross Body, the General being the Prior <hi>Caraeciola</hi> before-mentioned, and <hi>Don John Sames</hi> with two hundred Horse went towards <hi>Scafati,</hi> where he arrived about fix a clock, and found the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer'd by two thousand of the peoples Forces; There were within fifty <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had but an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferez</hi> for their chief Commander, they were in want of Match and Bullet, having been besieged four days, and they were forced to make use of their Shirts for Match, and melt Copper-money for Bullet; The <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Tercia</hi> under the command of <hi>Prospero Tuttavilla</hi> came very luckily at that time, together with Captain <hi>Siglia</hi> and <hi>Osman,</hi> two Companies of Musketiers, one of <hi>Don Diego de Cordova,</hi> the other were <hi>Burgundians;</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:32004:44"/>

The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had eight Troops of Horse, who were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Poleto Pastina</hi> of <hi>Salerno.</hi> The people lost 1500 persons, and 25 were taken prisoners, the rest were pursued as far as <hi>Stradono novo,</hi> near the Territories of <hi>Aversa;</hi> On the Barons side onely one <hi>Burgundian</hi> was slain, and 2 more wounded; they made a Halt there, and the Barons Army sack'd and burnt many houses, among the rest the house of <hi>Pietro Cassale.</hi> There was also much pillage and treasure seiz'd upon, most part whereof was distributed among the fifty <hi>Spaniards</hi> who kept <hi>Scafati</hi> so gallantly.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they march'd to the Tower of <hi>Aversa,</hi> where they hung out white Flags in sign of obedience; and the General being entred he gave them an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal pardon, and while he march'd towards the <hi>Greek</hi> Tower of <hi>Castelmare,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Montelione</hi> appear'd to receive further Orders, together with the Duke of <hi>Girifallo,</hi> the Marquess of S. <hi>George</hi> with 400 Foot, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Prince <hi>diValle,</hi> came also unto them; the whole Army being come to the said Tower, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they of <hi>Scafati</hi> had fled, before they gave any Assault, the Enemy did abandon the Post.</p>
            <p>While thus in the Countrey there was a course ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to straiten the people to the obedience of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,

there was no time lost in <hi>Naples;</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Montelione</hi> did bestir himself notably, who advanc'd boldly towards the <hi>Dogana;</hi> he attempted also to force the passage to <hi>Sancta Lucia</hi> to confront the Enemy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done so oftentimes before: At last having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that in <hi>Calabria</hi> there were new Tumults, he made it appear to his Highness how necessary it was for him to return thither; hereupon parting from <hi>Don John,</hi> with many expressions of endearments, he had the Title conferr'd upon him of Vicar-General, with a very ample Commission to that effect, yet with this restrictive clause, That the Kingdom being quieted he would be willing to resign the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>In the morning betimes they of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tower came to tender their obedience the sixth of <hi>November;</hi> So for the guarding of that place the Camp-master-General quarter'd there 150 <hi>Calabreses,</hi> and 200 <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi> to be commanded by the Duke of <hi>Nartina</hi> and <hi>Luigi Minutulo</hi> with their Troops of Horse, and <hi>Seignior Caesare Caraffa:</hi> But being setled there, there came the day following 1200 of the peoples Army under the command and conduct of <hi>Capitan Rosso,</hi> who suriously assaulted them, and having gain'd the first Trenches with the death of 15 <hi>Calabreses</hi> whom the Duke <hi>Monteleone</hi> had brought, and 4 <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they burnt the Monastery of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> together with the Hospital of the <hi>Incurables,</hi> cutting off the heads of 15 sick men; but they within making a virtue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, sallied out with that magnanimous resolution, that they put them to flight, and took about 300 of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32004:45"/>
them prisoners, and did execution upon above 100 in the pursuit; <hi>Cavallero Medici</hi> got the Colours of the Horse, the Count of <hi>Santa Maria, Don Michael Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Castillaneta,</hi> with the Marquess of <hi>Trevico</hi> did signal service that day.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Naples,</hi> in the <hi>interim,</hi> Judge <hi>Palma,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himself into the Castle, did frame a Writing, exhorting the people to conform themselves, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the mercy of his Highness, who did offr to stay there for Hostage, until the Capitulations came from his Majesty: In that Writing of the Judge there were many Proposals worthy of the consideration, with Cautions how the <hi>French</hi> in former Ages did carry and miscarry themselves in that Kingdom: How that in the compass of less than 4 moneths they were forced to send them away packing, and desire the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to enter: now it is not observed, that the <hi>French</hi> are any thing alter'd in their Natures to this day, but are still the same, insolent and unstable men, as they were from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Yet for all these Overtures of Reconcilement, the great Cannons played still, and all sorts of small shot, and acts of hostility committed night and day 'twixt both parties; and this day the Musketiers came as far as the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s house, which was much wondered at. It was expected about this time, that a general Indulgence or <hi>Amnestia</hi> should be publish'd through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that for 10 years there should be a Freedom given of all the Lands; moreover that the power of the Barons o're their Tenants should be restrain'd.</p>
            <p>There came news to <hi>Naples,</hi> that the Marquess of <hi>Velez</hi> was dead in his Viceroyship of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that Cardinal <hi>Trivultio</hi> was appointed to succeed him in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32004:45"/>
Government of that Kingdom. Tidings were brought also, that 4. Feluca's were come from <hi>Rome,</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commanders of War, for the service of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; there came news afterwards, that 7. more were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, and thought to be <hi>French;</hi> and that a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage was aboard of them, which was thought to be the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> therefore the Town made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to receive and entertain him according to his quality in point of diet and housing. There sallied out of the Town that day 5000. souldiers upon some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign on the <hi>Greek</hi> Tower, but they came back <hi>Re infectà.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 8. of <hi>November,</hi> all night long, the great Bell of <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> rung out, and the great Cannons played more furiously then ever; Drums and Trumpets soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded every where, the Castles did a great deal of hurt to the City: At <hi>Donna Alluina</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made two Mines to force their passage that way further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of the City; but the Mines played not, which made them return to their own Posts with some Mortality: Yet two of the fairest Houses in <hi>Naples</hi> were blown up that night: And about the <hi>Dogana</hi> there was skirmishing for six hours together, 'twixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the people, which caus'd such mortality on both sides.</p>
            <p>The next day the people understanding that the Prince of <hi>Montesarchio</hi> was coming with 3000. fresh Combatants for the Royalists, the great Bell gave an Alarm, so there sallied out of the City 500. men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him which took effect; for they made the Prince to sind his way back again: Now, because the business of the people might go on more regularly, they might go on more regularly, they elected 4. Doctors of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32004:46"/>
Law, and 4. Swordmen as a Committee to consult what was to be done: Some houses were burnt without the Gate of the holy Spirit; and upon the Palace of <hi>Tonno d' Angelis,</hi> there was a black Flag set up, so that the Cannons played most part of the day.</p>
            <p>Yesternight there was a great Brigade of Cavalry and Infantry discover'd in form of a Squadron beyond the Bridge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Santa Madalena;</hi> there came also two Gallies which were laden with dead bodies from divers places of the Country, to receive honourable burial in the City, whereof there were divers Commanders. St. <hi>Elmo</hi> had got a supply of Gunpowder from <hi>Sicily</hi> by a Gally of purpose; so the next day the Castle thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for 7. hours together.</p>
            <p>This incens'd the City so much, that the next day there was a Bando publish'd that none should speak of peace; but that every soul should prepare to defend himself by Arms, and annoy the Enemy as much as he could. The Cavaliers, and General of the Barons, who kept up and down the Country, made a halt at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigliano,</hi> and Sequestred the goods of <hi>Ciccio Ferlingero,</hi> General of the Calvary to the people, where they found 500. Butts of <hi>Lacrime Christi,</hi> a choice sort of Wine; the Prior <hi>Caracciola</hi> was left Governour of the said place with 200. Souldiers, and <hi>Ottaiana</hi> the Prince himself guarded the place.</p>
            <p>Wednesday following, they march'd towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa;</hi> in the way they made a halt at <hi>Marigliano,</hi> and Sergeant Major <hi>Nega</hi> was left Governour of the place, with 4. Troops of Horse. In many places of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey circumjacent to <hi>Naples;</hi> the tenants rose up in great numbers, hoping that the City would be able to free them from the yoke of slavery they groan'd under, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32004:46"/>
the excessive Rents they paid to their Landlords. They of <hi>Naples</hi> had so fortified the <hi>Dogana,</hi> that it look'd like an impregnable Bulwark; it commanded one side of the Sea; so that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not pass to the little Mole to and fro, which was a great incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity unto them; for divers were, killed as they went along from time to time, and it hindred the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of necessaries to the Castle.</p>
            <p>For two days together there was nothing but shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great and small Guns, and the Bullets flew up and down every where, which made no distinction of persons, whereby you may conjecture what a mortality there was. The civiller sort of people, as Lawyers, Clerks, Notaries, and other of the long Robe, were commanded to put themselves in Arms for the common defence, and were assigned several Posts for them to Guatd.</p>
            <p>There came gladsome news to the City that the Prince of <hi>Montesarchio</hi> was routed, who came to stop the watets of <hi>Poggio Reale,</hi> insomuch that he himself was put to fly, nor was the service without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loss to the people also: There was one of the house of <hi>Capello,</hi> that was surprized and taken for a spie to the Duke of <hi>Mataluni,</hi> with divers other prisoners of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity brought to the Market-place: Thereupon there were bonfires of joy made in divers places of the City, and the Bells rung out, and the Cannons played to congratulate their good successes. The <hi>Cavalry</hi> of the people thought to assault some posts about <hi>Vomero;</hi> but by the valour of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who served the Viceroy, they were repuls'd with no little loss: They took an eminent man called <hi>Andrea Carola,</hi> who belong'd to the Prince of <hi>Massa,</hi> prisoner,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32004:47"/>
and a Councel of War went upon him, so he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to have his head cut off.</p>
            <p>The Camp-master General, <hi>Scipione Latro,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Viceroy to have the chief charge in guarding <hi>Puzzuolo.</hi> The people that night march'd with 500. resolute men, and advanc'd just under the Castle of S. <hi>Elmo;</hi> they entred into an outward House that belong'd to the Governour of the Castle, where they found some provision, and great store of Wine, which they let out upon the ground, and burnt the House: The chief Leader of this venturous Brigade did play his game so well, that he came off with the loss of ten men only.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> did publish a Bando, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could bring him the Head of <hi>Gennaro Arnese,</hi> who was Elect of the people, should have 10000. Crowns: Thereupon the people caused another Bando to be publish'd, that whosoever could bring into the Market-place the Head of the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> who was Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, should have 12000. Crowns; or whosoever did kill him any way, should have 6000. upon certainty of the act: Insomuch that the eagerness and enmity on both sides grew hottet and hotter. They of the long Robes and divers Priests went up and down the streets <hi>en cuerpo</hi> all in black, with Muskets on their shoulders, and Pistols on both sides hanging at their Girdles.</p>
            <p>There came unwelcome news to the City the day following, That the Count of <hi>Conversano</hi> was come to <hi>Puzzuolo</hi> with four thousand fresh Combatants, to joyn with the Cavaliers by the way of <hi>Ansignano;</hi> there was brought in the afternoon a Cart-load of Heads into the Market-place, which had been cut off in the Countrey. The fight grew very furious towards the people, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32004:47"/>
at <hi>Porta Reale,</hi> where a Spanish Camp-master Don <hi>Jeronymo Guzman,</hi> kinsman to the Viceroy, fell gloriously; yet his body was rescued, and received ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable burial in the Church of <hi>Spirito Santo:</hi> Eleven <hi>Spaniards</hi> more perished in that place; but of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people 'twas thought there were about a hundred slain.</p>
            <p>The next day the Castles saluted the City betimes with their Cannon from St. <hi>Elmo;</hi> an unhappy bullet came and killed one of the principal of the Black-coats that was in Arms. There came news from the Country, That <hi>Don Julio Aquaviva</hi> was slain about <hi>Marigliono,</hi> with others who had sold their lives very dear, with slaughter of divers of the people.</p>
            <p>The Popes Nuntio, there having come unto him a Courtier expresly from <hi>Rome</hi> to that purpose, desir'd to have Audience of the people in the Name of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, to whom he had some things to communicate that tended to the publick Incolumity and Welfare of the City: Thereupon there was a Consultation had in <hi>Gennaro Arnese's</hi> House, the General of the people, where it was deliberated that he should be heard; but that he should pass through some private Houses, not through the open streets, to the place of Audience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he might not discover their works: Thereupon the General of the <hi>Napolitan</hi> Republick put himself in State all in Cloth of Silver, to attend the Nuntio; who came at last with an Auditor, whom the Pope had sent purposely with a Brief, exhorting the City to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves to a serious treaty of Peace, otherwise the holy Church must do her duty, and exercise her Spiritual Arms for the preserving of Christian blood, and preventing the effusion of it. 'Twas said he stil'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32004:48"/>
               <hi>Gennmaro</hi> by the Name of Excellency; who answered the Nuntio, <hi>That he could not expect a sudden Answer to so grave an Embassie; Therefore the most faithful People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired some time to consult and consider of it:</hi> So the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio parted, and some did laugh in their sleeves at him when he was gone, so little they feared the Arms of the Church.</p>
            <p>But this message from the Pope did so little prevail, that the next day the people buckled themselves for fight more earnestly then ever, being now so long flesh'd in blood that it made them little sensible of danger; therefore all that day there was Skirmishing in all places.</p>
            <p>Towards the evening there was a Feluca discovered, which had been chased by two Gallies, but narrowly scaped them; this Feluca came safely to Port, and she brought in her the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who had lived a good while retir'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> having left <hi>France</hi> upon some disgust: Hereupon there went off from the Torrion of <hi>Carmine</hi> twenty six shot of Ordnance, and then the Bells did ring out <hi>à Gloria:</hi> The Duke had with him but four Servants: <hi>Gennaro Arnese</hi> went to meet him in splendid Equipage, and he was received by the people with extremity of gladness; the Cannons upon the Bastion of the great Church went off again, and he was conducted to the <hi>Carmine,</hi> where there were Church-Offices performed to God and the most blessed Virgin for his safe arrivall to <hi>Naples.</hi> His Quarter was provided for him behind the Bastion of <hi>Carmine.</hi> The next morning he appeared in the Windows of His Lodging, and hurl'd money among the people, telling them that they should be of good cheer, for the <hi>French</hi> Army was near: That evening he did the like; but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32004:48"/>
as they were discoursing of this business news came that the said Army was sailed towards <hi>Toscany.</hi> About night there were brought eight Heads into the Market-place; and it was reported that one of the Sons of Count <hi>Conversano</hi> was dead. The next day there were sixteen Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ucas that brought French Officers and others from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who threw monies again among the people up and down the streets. That evening there was skirmishing at every Post about the City.</p>
            <p>But there came cold news from the Countrey, That there about three hundred of the people kill'd by the Barons Army, who was recruited much by the Cavaliers of <hi>Castlemare.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> went to view all the Trenches that were rais'd up and down for the defence of the City, as also at <hi>Vomero,</hi> and <hi>Puslipo,</hi> at which time a fire happened in the <hi>Vicaria,</hi> which was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd before it had done much hurt.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Polito Pastina</hi> the Cape of the <hi>Bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> for to be revenged of some enemies of his in <hi>Salerno,</hi> made himself Master of the place by force, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he had received some refreshments there a little before: He secur'd the Town for the people; but the Camp-master <hi>Boccapianola</hi> of <hi>Leve</hi> came with three thousand well appointed men presently after, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Pastina</hi> in the Town of <hi>Salerno,</hi> where he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended so much fear, that he proposed suddenly some Articles, That if the Viceroy would pardon him he would for the future constantly serve his Majesty with all his Brigade; which was accordingly accepted.</p>
            <p>These are the successes out of <hi>Naples;</hi> but within her Walls there were hot disputes all this day without any intermission, which lasted till night and darkness parted them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:32004:49"/>
The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> the next dav went to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops Palace, to take on Oath of Fidelity to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hear Mass, and so he took the Communion by the hands of Cardinal <hi>Filomarino.</hi> News came that the City of <hi>Nocera</hi> was in great commotion, and that much slaughter was done there, some adhering to the people, but the greatest number to the King, who hated the very name of the French. That evening there was a hot encounter at <hi>San Carlo alle Mortelle,</hi> where a Knight of St. <hi>Jago</hi> was slain, with divers others; but the people lost more; for they were in a better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to spare them, having ten times more store of men then the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> got a choice Brigade, to give a general assault to <hi>Donna Alluina,</hi> whereupon the Bells rung out to Arm; in this Service very many fell; but <hi>re infectà</hi> thence they went to <hi>Santa Maria la Nova;</hi> but the success was not great. The Viceroy caused nine to be executed that he had taken prisoners into the Castle, and published a Ban, <hi>That whosoever took up Arms against His Majesty should suffer death without mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day there were very hot encounters in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, and many were slain, hurt, or taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners; the great rain caused them to be quiet in the afternoon, which foul weather came accompanied with a tempest that endangcred some of <hi>Don J. of Austria</hi>'s Fleet, which was in the Port, expecting what would be the issue of these broyls.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> desir'd to have 6000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, and he would go to finde out the Barons Army, which did so much spoil in the Countrey: he had his desire, and so march'd to <hi>Auversa.</hi> The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons having timely intelligence hereof, joyn'd all in a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32004:49"/>
Battaglion, and came with a great deal of resolution towards the Duke; and understanding there were many <hi>French</hi> in the Army, it heightned their spirits the more: The people hearing the noise of so many Trumpets, and sound of Drums, were seared, and so astonished that they thought of flying away; but the Duke with other Commanders did encourage them, so that a furious Fight lasted for 2 hours; but at last the Dukes people gave ground, and so ran away with the the loss of 300 upon the place, and about half so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounded, and 40 prisoners. The Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the people was slain, who was a <hi>French-man,</hi> with a Camarade of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whose body he bought for burial: On the Barons side there fell the Marquess of <hi>San Juliano, Don Emmanuel Vaaz,</hi> with 30 more; the victorious Barons retired (the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come) to <hi>Aversa,</hi> and the people for another place that stood for <hi>Naples.</hi>

            <p>They had been somewhat quiet in <hi>Naples</hi> all this while, attending the success of the Countrey Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, which when they heard, it somewhat dejected them. The Duke being returned to <hi>Naples,</hi> went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit all the posts up and down; the next morning the City had a hot Good-morrow given her by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that put her in a palsie for a great while; There came more <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to finde out the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> but they were very few. Some of the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the words of the Duke, that the <hi>French</hi> Army was near, made a motion, that if the said Army came not by such a day the Dukes head should pay for it; Many thought this <hi>French</hi> Army was a meer <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> and a pure Cheat; nor did there want some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments os the Viceroy to infuse this into the peoples heads.</p>

About the <hi>Dogana</hi> the next day, there was a tough Dispute, where 20 were killed, and 30 of the people wounded, many fell likewise on the other side. The Admiral of <hi>Don John</hi>'s Galeous died about this time, having been sick divers days of a continual Feaver. There was a new Patent to be given to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> wherein he should be stiled the <hi>Doge</hi> of the <hi>Royal Republick</hi> of <hi>Naples;</hi> but some under hand gave advice, it was not fitting to be done until there were some certitude of the <hi>French</hi> Army he spoke of. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some reports were flown from the Castle, that the confirmation of the Articles was come from the Catholick Court, and was a printing with addition of further Graces for the City of <hi>Naples.</hi> In the <hi>interim</hi> there came reports daily how divers places in <hi>Calabria,</hi> as <hi>Pizzo</hi> and others, were mightily troubled with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which were grown so high that much bloud was spilt, many houses burnt, and other mischiefs done.</p>
            <p>In some places the Kings party prevail'd, in others the people; Yet the Marquess of <hi>Santa Catherina</hi> did a great deal of good, who went up and down with 2000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, and did quiet sundry places that were in uproars with such moderation and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it is admirable; He suppress'd besides some Rogues, that taking the advantage of the times robb'd up and down the Countrey, hanging them up on the High-ways on Boughs of Trees, that they might be a terror to the passengers. And in one little Grove which lay upon the common passage, they say, he did such an execution of those <hi>Free-booters,</hi> who were worse than <hi>Banditi</hi> or common Robbers, that every Tree was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with their dead bodies, some having 4, some 5,

            <p>Upon the third of <hi>December</hi> there was quietness on both sides, as if there were no war at all, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there began a fiery Encounter about the <hi>Dogana,</hi> being the nearest post to <hi>Castelnovo;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> ordered <hi>that some place should be filled with earth and fagots, that the Cannons towards the Castle might be mounted higher;</hi> whereupon many hundred people were set on work for that purpose accordingly; There was order also, <hi>That all the Wines near</hi> Naples <hi>should be brought into the City, because the Enemy should not make use thereof:</hi> There were likewise divers private Magazines of Corn found in the City, which being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered they were made use of for the publick good.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was resolved to raise a Regiment of men upon his own charge, that they might be more faithful unto him, and as it were his own creatures; he offered 20 Carlins by way of advance to every one, and a greater pay than ordinary; thereupon divers came to enroll themselvs, and he promised to pay 3000 men upon his own score; to which purpose he had Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Exchange for considerable summes: One of the greatest things that pinch'd the City, was the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32004:51"/>
and Gallies which were in Port, in regard they were a great hindrance for Commodities to come to the City, which was reduced now to a great necessity of victuals. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made a secret Mine in the Prince of <hi>Rocca</hi>'s house; but the people having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of it, spoil'd it, though it cost the lives of many.</p>
            <p>The fourth of <hi>December</hi> there were very hot Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the <hi>Dogana,</hi> where many fell of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> sent 300 men to <hi>Castelamare,</hi> to hinder the refreshments that used to come that way for the Castles.</p>
            <p>The sixth of the same Moneth, there was a Truce for 3 hours; in the mean time his Highness <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> gave notice to the City of a Letter sent from his Catholick Majesty, wherein he ratisied all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations of Peace agreed on by the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> and this was thought to be procured principally by the the intervention of his Highness <hi>Don John.</hi> The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being sent to the Captain General of the people, and communicated to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the said Duke exhorted the people to accept of it, in regard their King had therein made Concession unto them of so many signal Graces, and indeed of whatsoever they desired; Thereupon the people boiling with heat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered twice, that they would be cut to pieces rather than to be subject to that Nation any longer; The Duke finding the people so stiff in that resolution, he took a Meduill from his breast, saying, <hi>that his most Christian Majesty had given him that Meduill for a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that whensoever he sent it to his Majesty, there should come an Army forthwith:</hi> so at the very instant there were 7 Feluca's dispatch'd towards the said Army, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

sollicit it should come away for the succour of the City, and most faithful Napolitan people.</p>
            <p>Upon the 7. of the same Moneth, the Bread was commanded to be made at twenty four Ounces, by reason of scarcity of Corn; but the poorer sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple extreamly murmuring hereat, it was forced to be made at five tonesses the loaf, for fear of some Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
            <p>Advice was brought that from <hi>Calabria</hi> there came four thousand souldiers under the conduct of <hi>Polito Pastana</hi> of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who had executed an hundred persons in that City for their insurrections, reducing also <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Nooera</hi> to a firm obedience. The people imprisoned three <hi>Walloons</hi> upon some jealousies of Treason.</p>
            <p>The eighth of the same, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> review'd all the posts with much vigilancy, accompanied with his most understanding Officers, giving strict Orders every where to look to their Charge; The people were constrain'd to send forth some Brigades out of the City to preserve the Market folks and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from plundring.</p>
            <p>The Duke caused three Bans to be published; one concerning the Gunpowder, the other to regulate the Markets: and the third, that whosoever did not come to keep his watch, he should forfeit so much.</p>
            <p>The City began to be fcant of Corn, so that much bread was made of Indian Wheat: Upon the 12. of <hi>December</hi> the Castles began to give hot salutes to the Cisitens, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> sallied towards the <hi>Dogana,</hi> where the Son of Regent <hi>Casanate</hi> was slain, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other persons of quality, and a Cavalier of <hi>Sant</hi>

               <hi>Jago</hi> was one of them; there were fifty wounded men carried to the Castle: <hi>Don Joseppe de Sangro</hi> also fell within the ditches of the entrenchments, so that his body could not be rescued: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made this fight as it was said, of purpose to divert the Duke of <hi>Gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> went on in his Design, and with 15. Troops of Horse, 14. pieces of Cannon, and 4000. Foot, he march'd towards <hi>Juliano,</hi> and so to <hi>Aversa;</hi> he had 20. Carts, besides his train of Artillery: The people renew'd the Order, <hi>That none should wear Cloaks that very day.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> being come to <hi>Juliano</hi> with such a force, the Guardian <hi>Giacomo Rosso</hi> presented him the Keys of that place kept former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Duke of <hi>Mataluni;</hi> so that he recruited his Army there to 15000. Combatants making <hi>Juliano</hi> his randevouz: When he was departed, the Castles did so let fly their Ordnance, as if the day of Judgement were come. In <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> the <hi>Carmine,</hi> and <hi>San Carbona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> the Bells rung out to give Alarms, and those shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings began an hour before day, and continued all the morning; they sallied out of the Castles with much Resolution, and passed through some of the Trenches, advancing as far as S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Martyr, where the gross of the peoples Army falling upon them, they made a very handsome retreat, and got back to their posts; notwithstanding, there was an ambush made for them in the way, which they avoyded, but with the loss of the third part of their number; that Evening there came tidings that Count <hi>Conversano</hi> had burnt <hi>Fratta Picciola</hi> with great slaughter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:32004:52"/>
Afterwards it was inordered; that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> should be treated his Highness; He was now at <hi>Juliano,</hi> where among other things he found 4000. sacks of Grain: He put sorth an Order, <hi>That none should part from the present Army which he had then, under pain of death.</hi> In <hi>Naples</hi> there were hot doings the 14. of <hi>December,</hi> both in Castles and City, and one unlucky Bullet did good execution against <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novo,</hi> for it battered down a little Turret, and made a breach in the Wall.</p>
            <p>The cry was still <hi>The French Army will come;</hi> but some said, 'twas but a Fancie: News came that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> not being able to lodge all his men in <hi>Juliano,</hi> he was forced to find them Quarter in the places circumjacent. The business was still hot in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and many skirmishes on both parties. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Lazzari</hi> were assaulted by some of the Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi>'s men, whereof the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> having notice, he got presently a Horse-back, and with a choice number went to their succour, so there was a tough Dispute wherein many of the people perish'd, and twenty of the <hi>Lazzari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Naples</hi> there were some suspected of foul play, and to have intelligence with the Castle, among whom, the Captain of the Post hard by Saint <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo Suriano,</hi> and others of the House of <hi>Colentano,</hi> who were all imprisoned by the people; some of them freed themselves, but others were condemn'd to die, and executed.</p>
            <p>A Mariner come from <hi>Genoa</hi> reported that he had seen at <hi>Piombino</hi> thirty four French Vessels under sail design'd for these Seas, and that others who were their consorts were scatter'd by a violent tempest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:32004:53"/>
It was given out, that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had sent a Herald to assign a day of battel to <hi>Tuttavilla,</hi> who was in <hi>Aversa,</hi> and that he answered, <hi>That he much wondred that the most Christian King, and he himself being a Prince of the House of Lorrain, who had so many Obligations to his Catholick Majesty, should offer to assist the vilest people of</hi> Naples. The Duke replied, That the King of <hi>France</hi> being the Protector of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, as it appear'd to him the <hi>Napolitans</hi> now were, had commanded him to defend them in their just priviledges; therefore he sent him notice that he should make himself ready for combat, for he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to have a battel.</p>
            <p>There were the day following a Fleet discovered at Sea, and some thought it was the French <hi>Armada,</hi> and so rejoyced exceedingly; But they of <hi>Castel Ovo,</hi> thought it to be a Fleet of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> consisting of twenty three Vessels; thereupon up went the Flags within the Castles, crying out, <hi>Armada de Cielo, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada Catholica,</hi> the Armada of Heaven, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Army: Others said, it was the <hi>Indian Plate-Fleet</hi> which was come to succour them here: This bruit ran through all <hi>Toledo</hi> street; afterwards from the Castle they spied six more; they were all about two miles distant from the shore; so night came on, that they could see no more for that time.</p>
            <p>The next morning that Fleet proved to be <hi>French</hi> indeed, which came to assist the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> as they made their approach towards the shore, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced themselves to the form of a half Moon, as if they came to besiege the <hi>Spanish Fleet,</hi> which was in post. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral seeing that <hi>French Fleet</hi> sailing towards the shore, he wondred at the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32004:53"/>
rashness of those who had the guidance of it, that they would offer to enter into that Gulf, having no post of security: therefore he gave out a <hi>Rodomontado</hi> that he would not leave a Vessel unsunk of them. 'Twas thought that Fleet would sail towards <hi>Posilipo</hi> to disimbark some men and ammunition, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Napolitan</hi> people finding it was a <hi>French Fleet,</hi> displayed their Colours up and down the City, and rais'd up the great Standard with the Image of the Lady of <hi>Carmine,</hi> of <hi>San Gennaro,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of <hi>Naples,</hi> with the Arms of the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; and those of <hi>France,</hi> and all being brought to the Church of <hi>Carmine,</hi> solemn Mass was sung in presence of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> (who was now returned to <hi>Naples</hi> for the timee) and <hi>Gennaro Arnese</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General, with an incredible multitude of people about them; and after Mass the Standard was set up in the bastion of <hi>Carmine,</hi> by divers of the principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the great Guns went off every where in token of joy.</p>
            <p>The next day there came on shore many Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and others from the said <hi>French Fleet:</hi> they land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also six hundred Cows and Buffalo's; which the people took for provision for City and Souldiery: The <hi>French Fleet</hi> kept still in form of a half Moon; and it was a goodly sight to behold it; it consisted, as formerly was said, of twenty eight great Vessels, and one small one; they kept their distance so far, that they were out of the reach of the <hi>Spanish Fleet,</hi> or Castles.</p>
            <p>There came about this time a Declaration set forth by the <hi>Napolitans,</hi> that they never had done, nor
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32004:54"/>
intended to do any thing against the Nobility and Gentry, whereat divers did very much wonder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the state of things then.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Ginnaro Arnese</hi> resign'd his General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with great applause of the people; who cried out aloud, <hi>Let the Duke of Guise, let the Duke of Guise live:</hi> There was a purpose thereupon to make him <hi>Doge</hi> of the Royal Republick of <hi>Naples</hi> six years, and the said <hi>Arnese</hi> Governour of the <hi>Bastion</hi> of the <hi>Carmine,</hi> till some of the Castles should be taken, allowing him twelve thousand Duckets provision <hi>per annum.</hi> The Duke also assured him of the greatest Offices of trust that could be in the said Republick.</p>
            <p>That Evening the six thousand Sacks of Corn which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had found in <hi>Juliano</hi> was brought to <hi>Naples</hi> for supply of the City; and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> parted again for <hi>Juliano.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was great expectation what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the two great Fleets at Sea; but in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim by distresse of Weather two Vessels were sunk; one on this side <hi>Posilipo:</hi> the second t'other side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chaia:</hi> The sirst saved her men, but they were all cast away in the other; and it was a ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sight to behold Men swimming, being closed arm in arm.</p>
            <p>They say, that there was another sunk, and two more were boarded; so that with those of <hi>Castleamane,</hi> they accountd fourteen Vessels in all, and one more lost in full Sea five Tartana's: The Spanish Fleet had the Winde on their side at first, but then it turned contrary; in so much That the French Fleet followed the Spanish al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most under Castle <hi>Ovo,</hi> and the Tower of Saint
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32004:54"/>
               <hi>Vincent,</hi> by perpetual shooting; so that this night there were great expressions of joy in <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Bells rung <hi>à Gloria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Tursis</hi> had Order from the Castle to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Truce for three hours, which lasted above six between the Castle and the Town: The rumour ran, that the French Fleet was gone very ill handled, and also disgufted by the people, who would not consigne the Bastion of <hi>Carmine</hi> into the French hands; and there wanted not those who painted out the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the life, and exaggerated his ill qualities. It was given out, that the French Fleet had disimbarked both men and victuals at <hi>Bagnoli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Christmas-day; and in honour of that holy Tide there was a cessation of Arms on both sides, and no hurt done: On the peoples side there was a Letter intercepted from <hi>Tuttavilla</hi> to the Viceroy, wherein he complained that he could not furnish him with either men or money, therefore he advis'd him to manage the business as well as he could; he express'd likewise, that they had scarce a shirt left amongst them; for all went to make clouts for the wounded men.</p>
            <p>The Galley <hi>Santa Agata</hi> went voluntarily to find the French Fleet, which came on almost under the command of <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> putting it self in the posture of an half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon: there were among them three vessels so huge that they seemed as so many Mountains in the Sea: They came upon the point of <hi>Pusilipo,</hi> and got 'off again clear by the favour of the wind: The dearth of bread increased in the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> which made their spirits to faint somewhat; yet the next day they advanced towards the Castle of Saint <hi>Elmo,</hi> and the Spaniards sallying out towards them, they lost five and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32004:55"/>
twenty of their men. There was a plot discovered for the murthering of the Duke of <hi>Tursis,</hi> who had been lately taken prisoner, and the Complices received their condigu punishment. <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi>'s Steward came in a Feluca of purpose, with white silk Flags, to treat with the people for the freedom of the Duke of <hi>Tursis,</hi> and a Ransome was put upon him of fourty thousand Duckets.</p>
            <p>There came a recruit of three thousand men from <hi>Farino</hi> for the service of the people; their Leader was <hi>Antonio Donato,</hi> who had the title of Camp-Master from the Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi> The Spaniards took a Feluca that was coming from <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> full of people of good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but it cost them dear; for among others a Knight of S. <hi>Jago</hi> was slain in the action, three hurt, whereof one was a Captain of note; the weight and price of bread was regulated.</p>
            <p>There came tidings, that the City of <hi>Aversa</hi> was yielded up, which had been so well fortified: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple took likewise <hi>Caviano,</hi> where there were divers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers mingled with Spaniards, so that the Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master <hi>Tuttavilla</hi> fled into <hi>Capoa</hi> with hundreds more: <hi>Cerra</hi> also made a rendition of it self; The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> appointed Governours in those places according; and there were fourty thousand measures of Corn brought to <hi>Naples</hi> from those places, for the common sustenance of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> sent to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of three thousand Duckets for the Duke of <hi>Tursis</hi> by a Spanish Camp-Master: The Duke answered, <hi>That the City of</hi> Naples <hi>wanted no money; and when he would yield the Castles, and the Fleet of Gallies, the Duke of</hi> Tursis <hi>should be given up.</hi> The Tower of <hi>Anuntiata,</hi> a Post of

great consequence was taken by the people, and likewise all the Advenues about <hi>Castelamana;</hi> the Post of <hi>San Leonardo</hi> was also reduced to the peoples obedience. There was a hot dispute between the Spaniards and the people at <hi>Chaia,</hi> where the peoples Souldiers advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as far as <hi>Pedro de Toledo</hi>'s house: A Letter of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi>'s intercepted going to <hi>Sicily,</hi> wherein he inordered Cardinal <hi>Trivultio</hi> to send the <hi>Sicilian Armada</hi> hither, for preserving of <hi>Naples,</hi> which with the whole Kingdom was in danger to be lost.</p>
            <p>The first day of the year 1648. there came letters from divers places in <hi>Apulia,</hi> from the <hi>Capipopolo</hi> there, That they had twenty thousand good Combatants ready to assist the Royal Republick of <hi>Naples,</hi> if need were: An Alfarez going that day to the Elect of the people for Corn to make bread for his Souldiers, and the Elect refusing, the Alfarez took out his Poniard, and would have stab'd the Elect; whereupon the Alfarez was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and hanged that very day in the Market-place. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> removed his dwelling to the Palace of the Prince of <hi>Santo Buono,</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Carbonaro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Collateral Council gave the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> to understand, that he should sit no more among them in quality of Viceroy, but that his Highness should Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; but this was done, as 'twas thought, in policy, to induce the people to a conformity; but 'tis certain that <hi>Don John,</hi> speaking of him, said, <hi>Vayase en hora mala che ha hecho perder este Reyno a mi Padre: Let him go, in an ill hour; for he hath lost my Father this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> There were two attempts made upon <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> by the people; but they were repulsed both times.

               <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> sent an Express to the Barons, that they should make themselves ready, and appear in the Field in a Body. The Judge <hi>Onufrio</hi> was sent to <hi>Santa Clara,</hi> to perswade them to render themselves to his Catholick Majesty, alledging how that that great King had long Arms; but the people fell a laughing at the Judge.</p>
            <p>There was News brought that the passage of <hi>Scafati</hi> was re-gain'd, whereupon there was great rejoycing in the City; a special Guard of Halberdiers was appointed to attend the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> the Governour of <hi>Salerno</hi> came to do him reverence, bringing him a present of four choice Ginets with rich Saddles, and the Arms of the Duke upon them. There came also 2 <hi>Capopoli</hi> from the Territories of <hi>Otranto</hi> to do reverence to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> with Presents and assurances that they were at the disposing of the Royal Republick. Most of the Judges were removed through all the Tribunals of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and well-affected men put in.</p>
            <p>On the other side <hi>Don John</hi> inordered some part of his Fleet to go to <hi>Sardinia</hi> to fetch men and munition. There came news also from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Conde d' Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> (who had been Embassadour in <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1635.) had a Commission to be the Viceroy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> There came also a Courier from <hi>Milan,</hi> that there were three Regiments appointed. and ready to serve His Catholick Majesty for the quieting of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon the next day there was a most terrible fight made betwixt the Castle and the City for 4 hours together, wherein some hundreds perished on both sides; the morning after, the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> with his Family departed, and the Castles gave him a Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;

            <p>A general Pardon was publish'd that day by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria;</hi> whereupon the grave Judge <hi>Onufrio di Palma</hi> made a moving eloquent Speech to the people, that since the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> with the chiefest Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries were gone, and that they now had a Kings Son, so gallant a young Prince, to govern them, it was high time for them to return to their former obedience to their Monarch and lawful King, who had maintain'd them in peace and plenty so many years, and now did make a gracious offer to take off all kinde of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and grant a general <hi>Indulto</hi> or Pardon. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple answered, <hi>That if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>would go home to their own Countrey, the Peace was made.</hi> So this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Governour wrought little effect for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but both parties jear'd one another; so that the Phlegm and longanimity of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully appear in these Traverses of affairs.</p>
            <p>The Report was very rife that the <hi>Condc d'Ognate</hi> was preparing to come from <hi>Rome</hi> with a Recruit of 1500 choice men for the service of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and to be Viceroy of <hi>Naples.</hi> In the mean time the War did not languish a whit; for the people were now beleaguering <hi>Surrento</hi> and <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> with much resolution; so that the noise of the Cannons was heard from <hi>Naples.</hi> News was brought that in <hi>Santa Maria de Capra</hi> many of the people were slain, which did much exasperate matters as they then stood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:32004:57"/>
There was a new Election of Deputies made; Prior <hi>Caracciola, Don Diomede Caraffa,</hi> and <hi>Marco Antonió Gennaro</hi> were appointed for the Nobles and City, who expos'd to his Highness the grievous calamities and confusion that so flourishing a Kingdom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd unto by reason of the present Tumults; that the people took up Arms for no other end but to recover their Liberty and Livelihood; that they might be the better able to serve his Catholick Majesty, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their fidelity to their natural King; and for the future they offer'd to keep Arms no more in their houses, but live quietly, and in brotherly concord one with another.</p>
            <p>The next morning there came thirty thousand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates from <hi>Spain</hi> for the support of the War: that Afternoon the Duke of <hi>Mataluni</hi> came to <hi>Naples,</hi> to do reverence to his Highness; and a Rumour ran that two Cardinals were to come from <hi>Rome</hi> with the <hi>Conde d'Ognate</hi> to accommodate matters: The people receiv'd a foul Repulse before <hi>Surrevto;</hi> insomuch that they were forc'd to raise the Siege with much loss. The like ill success they had before <hi>Puzzuolo;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> did a notable piece of Justice upon a <hi>French</hi> Baron, who had held intelligence with the <hi>Puzzolani,</hi> and under-hand had been a means to convey them corn and other provisions. The people put to death a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Frier, a man of an ill life, and a dishonour to his Frock.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the fair hopes of Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet for two days and nights there was nothing but fighting and skirmishing at every Post; insomuch that there was a computation made of near upon five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred slain on both sides in the space of fourty hours
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32004:57"/>
There was order given out that the <hi>Lazzari</hi> which are the scum of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> people, being most of them Porterst, Scavengers and Tankerd-bearers, having now grown very innsolent, should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd.</p>
            <p>There was new Money stamp'd with the Arms of the Royal Republick. The same night <hi>Antonio Manel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> Elect of the people was slain by <hi>Jacomo Rosso</hi> Camp-master of the people, by order of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> chopping off his head afterwards, and carrying it up and down the City upon a Halberd, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was dragg'd to the Market-place, and so hang'd by the one foot, because he had secretly conveyed Corn to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day divers kinsmen and acquaintance os the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> came to the City. <hi>Gennaro Arnese</hi> Governour of the <hi>Bastion</hi> of <hi>Carmine</hi> having had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intelligence that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had a Design to introduce the <hi>French,</hi> and make himself King; the said <hi>Gennaro,</hi> together with <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> and a great multitude of Citizens, most whereof were on hors-back, rid up and down the City, and cried, <hi>Viva la Republica, Viva il Popolo;</hi> At which Rumour every one did shut up his Shop and his Doors, and the City was generally in Arms; which being understood by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> he commanded his Regiment of Horse to be presently put in equipage, calling together all his Confidents, making all of them a good Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron before his Palace; and <hi>Arnese</hi> passing by at that time with his Brigade, he was so saluted with some Muskets that six of his men drop'd down dead, which made the rest betake themselves to flight: the Duke afterwards rid up and down the Streets, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32004:58"/>
cried out, <hi>Viva la Republica, Viva il Duca di Guisa, Vivasualtezza;</hi> And so going to the <hi>Carmine</hi> he had some conference with <hi>Gennaro Arnese,</hi> whereupon all was quieted in a marvellous suddenness, considering the quality of the Commotion.</p>
            <p>The first of <hi>February</hi> 1648. The Castle of S. <hi>Elmo</hi> put up the royal Standard, upon discovering three Gallies, one whereof was the <hi>Capitana</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> wherein was imbarqu'd the <hi>Conde d'Ognate;</hi> upon his arrival to the Post he was saluted by all the Castles, first by <hi>Castelovo,</hi> then by <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> and lastly by the Castle St. <hi>Elmo.</hi> The <hi>Bastion</hi> of <hi>Carmine</hi> did also sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him, but it was with Bullets, as he passed by, whereby three of the Gally-slaves and two more were slain, which caus'd him to remove into a Feluca, and so went first to salute his royal Highness, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Palace, where he was attended by the C <hi>llate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council</hi> and all the Nobility, with all the <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of Ceremony.</p>
            <p>There happen'd a great Commotion at this time among the people and Citizens of <hi>Naples;</hi> some cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>Spain,</hi> others <hi>France,</hi> some <hi>The Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and others the <hi>Republick:</hi> so that every one began to arm, and it was like to produce very ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, unless the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> by a <hi>French</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and resolution had appeas'd the uproar.</p>
            <p>The D. of <hi>Guise</hi> reform'd the Officers of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which tended afterwards to the advantage of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majesties service.

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:32004:60"/>
were absent, which was a mighty advantage to the business; and after some musket-shot the Palace yielded; nor would the great Cannon which was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there go off, though fire was put to it; so that all things seemed to conspire to make this Enterprize happy.</p>
            <p>He marched thence to the great Market-place; and approaching the great Bastion of <hi>Carmine,</hi> where <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro Arnese</hi> was, with three hundred select Souldiers of the people; he sent him word that it was expedient that the said Torrion or Bastion should be put into his hands for his Majesties Service; and if he would not conform to so just a demand, he left him to consider what an act of disloyalty it would be: <hi>Arnese</hi> calling his best thoughts to consultation, held it a desperate teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to refuse, considering that at the end he might be constrained to do it; so he came forth, and presented the Keys to his Highness, prostrating his person before him: Thereupon <hi>Don John</hi> imployed <hi>Fru Paolo Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> a Commander of renowned va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and of high esteem among the people, to let them know, That it was his pleasure to grant them an <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> or general Pardon, with an aboli ion of the Gabels, and of all faults, provided they did presently range themselves to their wonted allegiance. Hereupon the people remained satisfied; but they desired to have that grace declared unto them by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, being so great a Prince of the Imperial House of <hi>Austria;</hi> So when he came out of the Church the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple desired His Highness that he would be pleased to pronounce with his own mouth what he promised by the Cavalier of <hi>Malta;</hi> whereupon he uttered aloud what the said Cavalier had said before, assuring them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32004:61"/>
besides of further demonstrations of Grace srom his Father: So that huge croud of people gave such an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause that might have rent the Air as far as the middle Region.</p>
            <p>This heroick Enterprise took effect almost without any effusion of blood at all; only two Spanish Captains perished, and one of the peoples, with some few wounded; all which may be imputed to a special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in the first place, and then to the prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess of a young General, and prudence of a grave Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy; And lastly, to the absence of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was much taxed of inadvisedness to leave the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as matters then stood.</p>
            <p>The next morning betimes the Duke of <hi>Tursis</hi> was seen walking among the people in the Market-place, with his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Avella,</hi> with their naked swords in hand, among a great confluence of people, who cried out, <hi>Viva Spagna, viva ill Duca de Tursis;</hi> So all the Bells rang out <hi>à Gloria,</hi> and every one was as it were wild with gladness.</p>
            <p>That afternoon there were four hundred Spaniards put into the Torrion of <hi>Carmine</hi> for a Garrison, where there were eighteen pieces of great Ordnance; among them there were fourty Italians: So all the rest of the posts of the City were secured, together with <hi>Chaia.</hi> All other places in the Country rendred themselves upon discretion, when they understood this not able news, and particularly <hi>Aversa,</hi> notwithstanding that <hi>Palumbo,</hi> a great stickler for the people, and in singular esteem, was there with considerable Forces.</p>

               </gap>nt from the City of <hi>Capua,</hi> he met him; and although the Duke made notable resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet at last he was forced to yield himself, and so he was clap'd up in the Castle of <hi>Capua,</hi> and removed thence to <hi>Garta.</hi> The Collateral Council sate upon him, and condemn'd him to dy; but <hi>Don John</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that, saying, <hi>It was more fitting to send him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to</hi> Spain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pastina</hi> who would not conform nor accept those gracious conditions from <hi>Don John,</hi> got two Feluca's, and with all his own and the plundred Goods he had from divers, sail'd for <hi>Ligorno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All those monstrous tumults of <hi>Naples</hi> being now quash'd, the <hi>Conde d'Ognate</hi> sent for the Camp-master <hi>Scipio Latro,</hi> Brother to the Lord Regent <hi>Latro,</hi> who by the Marchioness of <hi>Vasto</hi> was appointed Governour of the Isle of <hi>Istria,</hi> the Viceroy gave him a Patent to that purpose, &amp; besides made him Camp-master Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the said Isle; he told him besides that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd advice how a great <hi>French Armada</hi> made her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; therefore it was fitting he should prepare strength accordingly to resist; The Camp-master an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd him, that at that very instant he would go, and finde out the said <hi>French;</hi> so the Viceroy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his promptitude presented him with a Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Pistols. He had no sooner set foot upon the Isle of <hi>Istria</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> Fleet appear'd; which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the City of <hi>Naples</hi> did stay a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the House of the said Camp-master General at <hi>Ciattamone,</hi> in form of a Half-Moon: The Castle <hi>Dellovo</hi> discharg'd some Pieces at them, but the Bullets
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32004:62"/>
could not reach. Towards night the <hi>French</hi> went to <hi>Pusilipo,</hi> the next day they attempted to dis-imbarque at <hi>Istria,</hi> but they were hindred; so understanding how matters had pass'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> when they had rov'd up and down those Seas some days, and taken some few Tartana's, they set sail for <hi>Porto Longone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little after this when things were pretty well et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Viceroy commanded <hi>Gennaro Arnesel</hi> to be shut up in prison, who had been Captain General of the people a long time, during the greatest brunt of the Commotion; The pretence was that he was thought to have intelligence with that <hi>French</hi> Fleet, notwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that his Highness had comprehended him before in the general pardon, and conferr'd an Office upon him of five thousand Ducates <hi>per annum,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him besides the Cross of <hi>Santiago:</hi> the proofs were such against him that he was condemn'd to die; so there was a Scaffold erected before the Castle, where he receiv'd an honourable Death by having his Head severed from his body.</p>
            <p>There were also three Mariners, who had brought the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> executed that day; There were divers other condemn'd to suffer death; but his Highness, <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> going one day to the great Market-place where there were Gibbets set up to execute a great many more, the women did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune him with their Petitions; whereupon he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to the Castle, the Gibbets were all taken down, and the condemned persons sent to serve in the Gallies.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> imbarquing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a huge Fleet of Galleons and Gallies, hois'd sail for <hi>Sicily,</hi> having been so fortunate as to repress those
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32004:62"/>
prodigious uproars, and leave <hi>Naples</hi> setled in a perfect peace.</p>
            <q>Sic furor evanuit tenues popularis in auras.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Flema Spagnuola,</hi> the staidness, longanimity, and constancy of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (for which he is so much cried up) was not discerned more in any of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings elsewhere, then by their carriage in suffering a good while, and afterwards by suppressing these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Conde d'Ognate,</hi> the new Viceroy, like a new Broom, swept all clean, and carried himself with that dexterity and diligence, that by degrees he found out the chiefest Fomentors, whereof he hath dispatch'd away divers to the other world; and the Inquisition is not yet ended, but some suffer daily, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or collaterally; And touching the Taxes or Gabels, he hath found out other ways to raise Summs equivalent unto them for the service of the King his Master.</p>
