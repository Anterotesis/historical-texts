         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the wronges, but lawyars do not
their duties. Iustice is good, but
the Iustyces care not for poore

but these officers vnderstand not
their office and duty or yf they do
vnderstand it, they will not do it,
&amp; which is the worste of all, when
thei do it not, thei may not be told

be more notable or more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred
then that thys vertue thys
temperaunce and moderation of

since y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this stage wherevpon

al Asia, &amp; in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>titie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest
in iudgement, the best learned, &amp;
by nature so far sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dyng that the
voices &amp; signes ar broght to rome
I besech thee labour &amp; do thy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> may not only seme to
haue ben worthy those things but
also to haue ouercom al things by
thy cunning. And because that I
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g other kinde of officers haue
obteyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> administration of the
common wealth in the citie, and
thou the gouernaunce in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
although my parte do geue

that we do not striue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that remaineth &amp; is loked for,
but for that that is gotten alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which was not so necessary to
haue bene desyred as it is mete it
<pb facs="tcp:8418:23"/>
should nowe of vs be mainteined.
And if so be that I might be sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> thee in any thing I wol
desire no more then this state whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch
I haue already obteyned. But
nowe the matter goeth so that vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse
all thy wordes and dedes doe
agre with the thynges which we
do. Here I shall thynke my selfe
to haue gotten nothyng by my so
great labours and so greate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of all the which thou haste
bene partaker. But seyng thou
aboue all others hast helped vs to
get great renowne: surelye thou
ought to labor aboue all others to
preserue the same. For thou must
not only haue the estimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s and
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts of those men which ar
now liuing, but also of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> which

it is fre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> slaunder &amp; il wil. Fina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ought to thinke thus y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou
doest seke glorye not only for thy
selfe: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which thyng though thou
diddest yet thou wouldest not con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temne
it, especiallye seyng that
<pb facs="tcp:8418:23"/>
thou hast consecrated the memory
of thy name amongest wonderful
great monuments. But this thy
glorye must be communicat with
me, yea and deliuered to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Wherin thou must beware
lest if thou be negligent thou doe
not only seme to haue cared lytle
for thy self, but also to haue enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds &amp; kinsfolk. Nether do
I say this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my words shuld seme
to awake thee which afore diddest
slepe but rather to haue pricked
thee forward which afore didst run
for y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilte always do that which
thou haste done, that al men may
prayse thy iustice, temperancie,
seueritie and integritie.</p>
            <p>But an infinite desire of glory do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
wholly possesse me for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
loue which I beare to thee.
Howbeit I thinke thus y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Asia is
now as wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to thee as eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry

to praise which thou dost not wel
