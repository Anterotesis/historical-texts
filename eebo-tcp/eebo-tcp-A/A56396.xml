            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY FROM THE Primitive Church.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe whole Christian World being both Alarm'd and Amazed at the late Barbarous Conspiracy against the Sacred Lives of Your Majesty, and Your Royal Brother: And Your Majesty having upon that Occasion been over-whelm'd with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless Addresses and Protestations of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty from Your dutiful Subjects of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I thought it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper or unseasonable to consult the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the best and purest times of our Religion for Precedents of this Loyal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and after an Accurate, Diligent and Impartial Enquiry, I dare in their Names
<pb facs="tcp:42190:3"/>
declare to Your Majesty and all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, their infinite abhorrence of all Treasonable and Rebellious Attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Sovereign Powers whatsoever, as the rankest contradiction to their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, and the boldest Blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own Sovereign Lord. So that though Your Majesty were as much an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as You are a Patron and Protector of the Church, whoever shall at any time, or upon any pretence, offer any Resistance to any of Your Royal Commands, must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever renounce his Saviour, the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and the Twelve Apostles, to join with <hi>Mahomet, Hildebrand</hi> and the Kirk, set up the Pigeon against the Dove, the Scimeter against the Cross, and turn a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to his Saviour, as well as a <hi>Cromwel</hi> to his Prince.</p>
            <p>And this, Sir, in those days was thought so far from flattering Divinity, that if they had not own'd and asserted it with their last drop of Blood under the worst of Tyrants, they had judged themselves Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors both to their Prince and to their Lord. And this Doctrine of entire and unreser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Submission was then so Catholique, so Universally Taught and Practiced, that Christian Rebellion was a Sin altogether unknown in those days. It was the only Sin, for which the Laws of the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:42190:3"/>
appointed any Punishment, because it was the only Sin that was then never actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally committed. And though they had too frequent and sad Occasions to enter their Protestations against it, that was never done to correct any miscarriages among themselves, but to rectifie the misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours: Who being possest with too just a Jealousie, that all Alterations in Religion tended to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Government, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged in Duty, and for the honour of their Lord to represent to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, That the erecting of his Kingdom in the Empire, was so far from shaking their Thrones, that it was and ever would be their strongest Security: And when they had done this, they had nothing more to do then to submit themselves to their Royal Pleasure, and lay their Lives at their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feet.</p>
            <p>And this, Sir, they did with that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, Frankness, and Ingenuity, so without all reserves and limitations, that the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that some Men have dasht upon their Memories is as false as foul, that all their Pretended Loyalty was nothing but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, for want of strength to raise, and pretence of Law to Warrant Rebellion. But some Men are so ignorant, that they cannot understand the Doctrine of the Cross,
<pb facs="tcp:42190:4"/>
because its Superscription was written in <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and were they not as great Strangers to the Primitive Records, as to the Primitive Religion, they could never have had the confidence to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten a surmise so false upon so clear an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; when beside giving us their own Opinions, they have left behind them the Eternal and unalterable Reasons, upon which they were grounded, and these are of equal force in all Ages, and under all Governments. And this unkind Calumny is so very unjust, that their spightful and most implacable Enemies, who spared not to asperse them with all the vile things that could be believed, durst never charge them either with any Overt-acts, or secret designs of Disloyalty.</p>
            <p>And as for the Laws, though no Subject were ever more thankful for good Laws, or more tender of their preservation then themselves, yet when they had them, they were neither so ungrateful nor so uncivil, as to turn them upon the Government, and make them so many Bulwarks and Sconces for Rebellion. They thought it a very scurvey complement to invite Princes to protect their Religion, by telling them, That whilst they were pleased to Persecute it, Christians were under an entire Submission to their Will and Pleasure, but when they
<pb facs="tcp:42190:4"/>
had once own'd and protected it by Law, that then their Christian Subjects were warranted to Rebel against their Sovereign Authority, by a Commission from their own Imperial Rescripts. As soft and simple Lachrimists as they were, they were wiser then to give <hi>Julian</hi> so much advantage to justifie his Apostacy, when by it he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Imperial Crown to himself and his Successors, that <hi>Constantine</hi> had paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Christian Subjects, by taking up the Christian Faith. And whenever there was any misunderstanding between the Emperour and his Laws, they thought it their duty, that were subject to both, to leave the Contest to be adjusted between themselves. And if the Prince were at any time undutiful to his own Laws, and so unhappy as to incur their displeasure, whatever Power the Laws had to Execute themselves upon him, they were satisfied that the Subjects had none.</p>
            <p>And as they embraced this Principle of unlimited Submission as one of the greatest duties of their Religion, so they have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared in all their Writings, that setting aside all tyes of Duty and Conscience, they would have done the same upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Interest and Prudence: And tho they had lived under the worst of Princes, and themselves had been the worst of Men,
<pb facs="tcp:42190:5"/>
they would have paid the same submission for the purchase of their own ease and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they thought themselves to owe out of duty to God and his Laws. These, Sir, were the Doctrines that they taught both as Divines and Philosophers, as Men that understood this World, as well as Christians that believed the World to come. And though to avoid being too bold and tedious, I have here only presented Your Majesty with the Subscriptions of all the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers of the Church for the first Three hundred and sixty three Years; yet if Your Majesty think it worth Your Royal Acceptance, I am ready to produce not only the hasty Votes, but the Hands of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Bishops and Doctors for above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years, with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beside the demonstration of the Primitive Loyalty, I have here humbly presented Your Majesty with the true State of the Primitive Church, as it was left by our Lord and his Apostles, and taken into Protection by the first Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, knowing how much it will endear the Church of <hi>England</hi> to Your Majesties Royal Care and Kindness, when you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern its exact conformity to the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, in all things but its Suffering. And now I cannot pray for more happiness to Your Sacred Majesty, then they compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:42190:5"/>
in a Collect for their Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours under all the Storms and Outrages of Persecution: That Almighty God would grant You a Long Life, a Quiet Reign, an Undisturbed Family, Valiant Armies, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Councellors, and Loyal Subjects: That all things may fall out as successfully as Your Royal Heart can desire: That Your Empire may ever increase and flourish: And that the Lineal and Legal Succession of Your Royal Family, may inherit Your Imperial Throne through all Succeeding Ages.

Others are as fierce to have all Ecclesiastical Officers (though immediately Commission'd by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for the Government of his Kingdom through all Ages) stript of all manner of Authority in the Christian Church, and all Government of Religion vested only in the Civil Magistrate. Others again

were neither for its utter Extirpation, nor confining the whole exercise of its Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Secular Powers, but for dividing it into its several Provinces, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing some part of it to the Clergy, and some to the Civil State. Because Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being Instituted chiefly for these two great ends, <hi>viz.</hi> The advancement of the present Peace and Welfare of Mankind in this World, and their safe Conduct and Passage to the State of Bliss and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the World to come: so far as it relates to the present quiet of humane Society, it is but fit and necessary it should be subject to the Authority of the Supreme Powers over them, whose proper Duty, Trust, and Office it is to provide for the settlement and preservation of the Publick Peace. And therefore seeing that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has a prime and over-ruling influence upon that, so as either to establish or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb it by its good or bad management, it concerns them in the first place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage such Doctrines and Principles, as in their own nature tend to the Peace and Quiet of Government, and to root out such false Notions, as incline or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to any Turbulent and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices under any pretences or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of Religion. And if any such there be, or if any such there have been; nay,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42190:10"/>
if any such there can be, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by the boldest Libertines, but that in such cases the Supreme Magistrate must be allowed power to defend him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lf and his Government against their Errors or Follies, by the force and execution of present Laws and Penalties. But then as the Christian Religion aims at the future happiness of the Souls of men, its Conduct and Government is left to a peculiar Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men, to whom its Founder has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted the care of Souls, and for which they are accountable to him alone. For seeing the Kingdom that he establisht was altogether different in its Constitution from worldly Empire: Seeing he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Officers void of all Secular Power to preside over it by virtue of his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Authority: And seeing he has engaged a peculiar Providence to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant to them in the Government of his Church through all Ages, the case is plain to all Men that believe his Institution, that all Ecclesiastical Power, whatever it is, that concerns the welfare of Mens Souls in the World to come, is entirely vested in the spiritual Guides and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church.</p>
               <p>It being therefore so manifest, past all contradiction, that in all Christian States, there are and must be from the Nature
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42190:11"/>
both of Government and Christianity, two distinct Powers, the only difficulty will be so to determine the Bounds of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ch, that they neither interfere in the exercise of their Jurisdiction, nor any way incroach upon each others Authority. An undertaking that has been often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by learned Men, but generally with that vehement biass and partiality either way, that has made it a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie not for truth but interest. For it being chiefly managed by Divines and Canonists in behalf of the Church, and by Statesmen and Lawyers in behalf of the Common-wealth, each Party have not so much endeavour'd to assign the real Bounds of Truth, as to propagate their own Empire and Dominion. And for this reason is it that the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so eagerly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally advance the Ecclesiastical Power, (the omnipotent Soveraignty of which they settle in the Pope alone) as to raise it above the Power of all Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all the Powers of the Earth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they content to make it Superior to all their Authority, but swell it to that exorbitant Greatness, till they swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all Empire into its Jurisdiction. And for this very reason the learned that have generally opposed themselves to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42190:11"/>
these high and wild pretences, have as generally run into the other Extreme, so as to take all Ecclesiastical Authority not only from his Holiness and his Court, but from all Ecclesiastical Officers, to whom it was consign'd by our Blessed Saviour, to the utter destruction of any such thing as a Christian Church. So that in this Partial and in reality Prophane way of managing this great Controversie, they contend not about the true and just grounds of each Province, but both fight for the possession of the whole. In which way of waging War, no other event of it can be expected, then of that irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable fewd between <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the great <hi>Scipio,</hi> that either <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> must be destroyed, and the Empire of one intirely subdued to the Dominion of the other. And though some very few have treated of these things with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more temper and moderation, so as to acknowledge some kind of Bounds to their respective Jurisdictions, yet they scarce ever set and determine them with that Justice and Equality, that the securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of Government and Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; but apparently warp to their own side, as they incline to, or depend upon the interest of the Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical State. And therefore that is the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42190:12"/>
great and only advantage that I can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to my self above those many so very much more learned Men, that have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd in this weighty Argument, that I know my self to undertake it without being engaged by any prejudice, or bias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any Interest, or hired by any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then purely the discharge of a good Conscience (without which the highest pleasure and satisfaction that humane life can afford, were not a tolerable thing; but with it an ordinary State of life with health, is a present Paradice, and state of Happiness.) So that how much soever I come behind others (and I am sensible of a very great distance) in the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Wit and Learning, yet I shall give place to no Man in freedom and integrity of Judgment. And that alone I am sure is enough to make me Master of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; for if Men would only consider the Nature of the thing it self, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract it from interest and prejudice, that alone would bring them into a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of it. But when instead of looking directly upon their Object as they ought, they labour to squint and pervert their own Eye-sight, it is their own sault that they lose its natural repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation. And this is the very thing that fills the World with so many disputes to

so little purpose, because Men in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries will not follow the guidance of things themselves; whereas if they would but be pleased to do so, the truth of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is as clear and visible to a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquirer as Light it self. There is not any one Argument that is thought more intricate, obscure, and difficult then this that I am now undertaking, and therefore it is for the most part baulkt by the Wise Men of the World, as a point too touchy to be handled, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such great and powerful interests are engaged in the Contest, and they are sure to be jealous (as they ought to be) of their own Prerogatives, and will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much as endure to have them tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, much less fetter'd and confin'd. So that this dispute is not only supposed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult but dangerous, in that it is thought so hard a matter for the Undertaker not to incur some way or other the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Superiours, by his best and most honest performance. And yet after all this wariness and wisdom, if Men would but state the thing only as that states it self, there is scarce any one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie that can be more safe or more easie then its determination. For things are so wonderfully order'd by the wise Providence of God in settling Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42190:13"/>
in the World, that by determining the power of the Church and State, as they are determin'd by his own original Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Parties may have their own utmost demands, and particularly the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power more then otherwise it could have. demanded. And I doubt not but before I have done to give satisfaction to the highest Pretenders either way, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the side of the State without any invasion of the Churches Power. To assign an inherent and independent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Church, distinct from that of the State, and immediately derived, not from the Prince, but our Saviour, and that I am sure is as much as the highest claims to Ecclesiastical Power can, with any modesty, or without rank dishonesty challenge. But then this being granted, I shall demonstrate, That there is as full and unabated Supremacy in Sovereign Powers over all manner of Ecclesiastical Authority, as if it had been entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from their own special Grant and Commission: And that certainly is as high a Prerogative as any Prince can care to demand, to have a Sovereign Power over all the Powers within his own Dominions: So that whether they are derived from his Authority or not, they shall be as entirely Subject to it, as if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42190:13"/>
they had subsisted by no other Charter. And that is as high a Supremacy as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself has been pleased to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for Sovereign Princes, when he took away all Power from the Church to vest it in them; for though it is a very gross prophaneness in him to allow no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for Religion it self, then as it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd and made Law by them; yet that Authority that is in the Church by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, is as absolutely Subject to their Dominion, as it could have been, had it been establisht as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, only by their own Authority. And this State of the Controversie, if it can be made good, I am certain will satisfie all Parties that can claim any share or degree of Government in Church or State, but most of all the Supreme Powers, to whose Soveraignty all Power, whatsoever it is, or whencesoever derived, is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly Subjected. As for the Jurisdiction of the Church as settled by Divine Right, and nothing else; I have discoursed of that in former Treatises, and proved that it is immediately derived from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himself, and settled unalienably by him upon the Apostles, and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors the Bishops forever; so that here I must suppose the Constitution of the Christian Church within it self, and all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42190:14"/>
that I am bound to do at present, is, That supposing its distinct and independent Authority for granted, to explain how it accommodates and submits it self to the Civil State, and comes under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obligation of all good Subjects to true Allegiance and Loyalty to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince.</p>

               <p>And here the first and chiefest thing to be consider'd is, That Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty supposes the Power of Princes, Civil Government being settled in the World from its beginning by the general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and antecedently to our Saviour's particular Institution. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the first thing that our Saviour openly declared, when he enter'd upon his Office, was the erection of his own new Kingdom; so the next thing that he took care to instruct his Subjects in, was, that this his Kingdom was no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World. So that from thence it is evident, that he left the Government of the Kingdoms of this World in the same posture in which they had ever stood, be ore he came into it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there could be no alteration, much less abatement of the Civil Government any where upon the score of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, otherwise the Institution of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42190:14"/>
had been a breach upon the Ancient Rights of those Sovereign Powers, in whose Dominions it was erected, which was the first thing that our Saviour whilst himself conversed upon Earth, was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid. This therefore is to be set down in the first place, as the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of his Religion, that neither himself, nor any of those that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for the Government of it, challenge any Temporal Power to themselves, or any exemption from the Authority of those that have it. Neither is this to be lookt upon only as a positive duty, but it is necessary in it self from the nature and the design of Christianity, which was to settle a pure Religion in the World by the strength of its own truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without any help of worldly power, or mixture of worldly interest, as I have elsewhere shewn at large from the whole story of its first settlement. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreeable to this great Observation it is very remarkable, That our Saviour himself whilst he convers'd upon Earth, did not only never challenge any kind of Civil Authority to himself, but seiz'd all occasions to defie and disclaim it, as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconsistent with his Commission. Thus <hi>John</hi> 6. 15. When the People, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him to be that Temporal Messias
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42190:15"/>
that they expected, would have forced him to take the Kingdom upon himself, he immediately withdrew into a Solitude to shift their importunity. And <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14. When one solicited him only to take upon him the Authority of an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator, he perfectly disavows it, as if he were solicitous not to give them the least pretence of Objection against him for his intermedling with the Civil Government. And yet he might lawfully have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, according to the received custom of the Jews at that time; for in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, to avoid the scandal of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before Heathens, they referred all their Controversies to the Rabbies and Doctors of the Law (and such an one this Jew supposed our Saviour to have been, as appears by his giving him their proper Title of <hi>Master)</hi> and whoever refused to stand to their award, he was Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated their Society, as a scandal to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation. And this priviledge of being their own Judges among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was granted to them by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and for a long time continued by the Christian Emperors themselves. And therefore though our Saviour might have undertaken this Office by the allowance and permission of the Civil Government; yet to avoid all suspicions of any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42190:15"/>
he protests against it as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his own Office and Person: And the case is the very same as to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in Adultery, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 3. of whom he declares that he had no such Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they imagin'd, to pass any Sentence upon her, according to their Law; so that if she were not legally condemn'd before they brought her before him, she was at liberty for any such Power that he had to pass Sentence upon her. But the most remarkable passage for his disclaiming all Earthly Power, is in his Examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pontius Pilate, Joh.</hi> 18. 36. to whom he freely confesses, that he is a King, but to prevent his jealousie or mistake, he both immediately declares that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World, * and clearly explains what <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Audite Judaei &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, audi circumcisio, audi praeputium, audite omnia regna terrena.

So that for any of his Officers or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to make any resistance to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power by the Sword, in defence of his Kingdom,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42190:16"/>
is to destroy the very nature of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Constitution, that consists in this, that it is to be govern'd by the power of Truth, and is distinguisht from the Kingdoms of this World, in that it is a Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of the Sword. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for any Officers in it to pretend to any such Power by virtue of any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Commission from him, is at onc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> both to dethrone and renounce his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power, because it is a contradiction to his whole design in the World, to have either such a Kingdom or such Subjects. And that he further declares to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else then the Institution of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Truth in it, by virtue of its own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the World, that I should bear Witness unto the Truth; every one that is of the Truth heareth my Voice.</hi> That is, all Men that are lovers of true Goodness will voluntarily come into my Kingdom, and submit themselves to my Doctrine and Discipline: for that is the evident meaning of that phrase, <hi>They that are of the Truth,</hi> they that are ingenuous and sincere lovers of it, as in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans, c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>They that are of the Contention, i. e.</hi> Persons that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to Contention. So that there is the true State of Christ's Kingdom, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42190:16"/>
it is a Kingdom without force within it self, and has no true Subjects but such as freely and of their own accord submit themselves to it out of love to the Goodness of its Government. So that whereas all other Kingdoms subsist by the power of the Sword, his, taken by it self, and as not complicated with the Civil Government, cannot subsist with it. And therefore when St. <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Master, he commands him to sheath it, because it was a Method in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with his Design, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 53. <hi>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more then Twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> If that had been the proper method to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass his design, and to settle his Kingdom, he could easily have done it by an Army of Angels, but that would have spoil'd the whole work, had he betook himself to any forcible defence, who was to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish an Institution in the World by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means then its own Truth and Goodness. Many reasons are given of our Saviour's reproof to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men of all Factions, to enhance, or abate its obligation; but the only true reason is, that which himself has here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it was utterly inconsistent with the nature of his Institution. This was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42190:17"/>
the sense of the Doctors of the Church, through all Ages down to the very time of <hi>Gratian</hi> himself in the year 1150, an hundred years and more, after the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh; so that though he had declared and practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, it seems his Doctrine could not speedily obtain any great footing in the Christian Church: who treating of the power of the Sword to whom it belongs, determines from this very passage, that of all Men the Officers of the Church have nothing to do with it. <hi>De Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi>

                  <q>As for Bishops and all Orders of the Clergy, it is evident that they ought not to take up Arms either by their own, or the Pope's Authority. For when <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles brandish't the material Sword, to defend his Master from the violence of the Jews, he heard a Voice, Put up thy Sword into its Scabbard, for all that take the Sword shall perish by the Sword. As if he had expresly said, hitherto it has been allowed thee and thy Predecessors <hi>(i. e.</hi> I suppose the High Priests under the Old Testament) to punish the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God with the Corporal Sword, but from this time forward I command thee to sheath it for an example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and use the Spiritual Sword, which is the Word of God, to Sacrifice the lusts of the old life. For all beside him, or the Authority of him, who is endued with legal Power, and who, as the Apostle says, bears not the Sword in vain, and to whom every Soul ought to be Subject, every Man, I say, that draws the Sword without his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, shall perish by it.</q> And this state of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42190:18"/>
the question he proves from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of divers ancient Councils and Popes, which I here forbear to recite, because I intend (if God permit) to consider them in their proper Times and Places, for that is my design as I proceed to reap the whole field of Church Records, and not Glean, as the common Custom is, its scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd fragments. Only this passage of the Father of the Canonists I have here dropt in, to let his modern Followers, that are one and all base flatterers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court against all Sovereign Powers, see how enormously they wander from the Text of their own Law, as well as the Holy Bible. But to return, our Saviour having declared to the President what his Kingdom was not, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of Force and the Power of the Sword; he proceeds to declare what it was, <hi>viz.</hi> a Kingdom of Truth. Which <hi>Pilate</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be some kind of Stoical Kingdom, for such a thing the Stoicks pretended to at an high rate by virtue of their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, he asks him what is the Truth that he professes. But reflecting, it seems, with himself, that it was not pertinent for a Judge upon the Bench to enter into a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick dispute with a Prisoner at the Bar, he lets fall the Question by not stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an Answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42190:18"/>
But beside these evident passages in our Saviour's conversation for disclaiming all Civil Soveraignty, there is one Text, that is usually by mistake applyed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, though it relate to a very different matter, <note n="*" place="margin">Barclay <hi>contra Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchom. l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 157. Salmas. <hi>defens. Reg. cap.</hi> 3.</note> and that is <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. where our Saviour is supposed to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>Roman</hi> Collectors, and that is owning his subjection to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Didrachma, the Money there demanded of him, was not Tribute money paid to the <hi>Roman</hi> Publicans, for we never read of any such Tax, but Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-money paid to the Jewish Priests and their Collectors, for the Use and Service of the Temple, and this continued till the time of <hi>Vespatian,</hi> who, as <hi>Josephus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, imposed upon the Jews this Tax of two Drachms, that they had hitherto paid towards the repairs and annual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for the use of the Capitol at <hi>Rome.</hi> And this explains the true meaning and reason of our Saviour's demur to its payment, when he asks <hi>Peter,</hi> Whether Princes are wont to take Tribute of their own Children; because this Tax for the Temple Service was gather'd in God's Name, and was called <hi>God's Tax;</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> more then once expresses it, and therefore it was as improper for our Saviour, who was the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42190:19"/>
Son of God, and as it were Prince of the Temple, to pay this kind of Tribute, as it is for an Heir of the Crown to be Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King his Father, after the same rate with his other Subjects. But though these Gentlemen have grosly mistaken the Text, their Antimonarchical Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries prophanely abuse it when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as they unanimously do, <hi>That our Saviour paid this Tax for himself and</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as they conceit, to <hi>Herod,</hi> who had converted the Revenue of the Temple to his own use) <hi>purely to avoid offence, yet they were not bound to do it, and if</hi> Peter, <hi>because a Disciple of Christ was here made free from paying burthensom Taxes, so are all Christians as free as he, and may legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuse to submit to such Tyrannous Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</hi> As if our Saviour were such a Prophet as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who headed the Rebellion of the Soldiers against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Heraclius;</hi> or rather such another Messias as <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be sent of God to instruct his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they ought not to pay Tribute to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and as Rabbi <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 37. drew away much People after him, whose blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their Sacrifices to stop the Contagion of their seditious Doctrines, and declared it High Treason for any

                  </gap>, that it is not lawful to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar.</hi> And that very probably was the true ground why the Jews made it the chief Article of our Saviour's Accusation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pilate,</hi> That <hi>he perverted the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, forbidding them to pay Tribute to</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar. And it is evident, that it was the craft of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Herodians,</hi> when they went about to entangle him with this Question, <hi>Whether it was Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give Tribute unto</hi> Caesar <hi>or not,</hi> that they might expose him to the <hi>Roman</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, expecting that he would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself an Assertor of the Jewish Liberty, agreeable to the present Doctrine of the Zealots and the <hi>Gaulonites,</hi> that it was not lawful to be Subject to any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but God alone. But he very wisely avoids their snare by answering, That they might serve God, and pay Tribute to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> too; and therefore seeing it appeared by the Inscription upon the Coin, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was their Sovereign Prince, it was not only lawful, but their bounden Duty to pay him Tribute, because it was only to render him what was his Due. And in reality, this whole Transaction between our Saviour and these Trapanning Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, is the clearest state of his Doctrine against resistance to the worst of Princes,

And yet when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is askt his Opinion concerning sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to so brutal a Prince, he has no regard to his Personal Qualifications, but to the Rights of Soveraignty: Whatever the Man is, it is enough that he is your Prince, and after that there is no room left to resist his Impositions. And here it is farther to be observed, that the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Answer is general, not Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawful to pay Tribute to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> only, but to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; to which the Answer is round and peremptory, Whoever is your Sovereign you are bound to submit to his Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore seeing you own the Emperor for your Sovereign by using the Coin stampt with his Image (which is the very badge of Soveraignty in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) you are as well bound in Duty to submit to his Commands, as you are to obey God's; and as it is your Duty to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42190:20"/>
Worship God, so is it to pay Tribute to the Emperor. But according to our new Hildebrandine and Antichristian Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our Saviour ought to have answered with more caution, and distinguisht con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Legality of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and demurr'd upon the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Person: If he be a good Man, and govern according to Law, I would advise you to pay him Tribute: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if he be an Oppressor, and his Tax immoderate, resist and take up Arms against the Tyrant; and as you will be faithful to your Country, your Religion, and your Liberties, deliver them from the burden of his Tyrannical Government. This one Principle is the result of all the Antimonarchical Pleas and Apologies to warrant Resistance; and no doubt it would make wise work in the World, if every Subject might lawfully take up Arms against his Prince, as oft as he is pleased in his own wisdom to find fault with his Government. And yet that, I say, is the bottom of all Antimonarchical Pretences, that they may, and ought to defend their Liberties by force of Arms against the Sovereign Prince, if he do not Govern according to Law: And so this very Text is glossed by one of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Patrons of the Cause, <hi>Cum Dei simus,

A very gentle Gloss this, upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Text, to make it so far from any suspition of sin to Rebel against unjust, or wicked Princes, that not to destroy them and their Tyranny were Villainy, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Treason against God himself. And thus, if this Gloss be once admitted, is our Saviour made an open <hi>Gaulonite,</hi> declaring himself and all his followers free from the unjust exactions of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Powers: which is only to charge him with that very Crime that his most implacable Enemies would have fastened upon him. So prophane are these Men forced to be in their wickedness, as to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie Treason by Blasphemy, and no Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy can be ranker then to make our Saviour a Patron of Rebellion. But because this Gloss looks too bold, they have an evasion to shift the Text, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42190:21"/>
That our Saviour did not Answer, but only baulk and involve the Question, in that there is no consequence that the Money was <hi>Caesar</hi>'s because stampt with his Impression, for then all that we have would for the same reason be <hi>Caesar</hi>'s too. But as the Gloss accuses our Saviour of breach of honesty, by making him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Power of the Sword when he had disclaim'd it; so this evasion charges him with defect of understanding, as if our Saviour had been so weak as to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Title of Propriety from his Inscription. Whereas any Man of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, if he will not industriously pervert it, cannot but understand that our Saviour argues from the known Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of all Nations in the World, to stamp their Coin with their King's Image, so that the piece of Money that they shewed him bearing <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Picture, that was an Evidence that he was their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord, and therefore were they bound to submit to him in all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that were not inconsistent with the Law of God; and paying of Tribute not being so, it was not only no sin, but a necessary Duty, or, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it, in pursuance of his Masters Precept, <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This Sense is so very plain and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, that nothing but malitious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity could pervert it; and the truth of it is, this sort of men seem to take a kind of Pride and Delight in insulting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Holy Scriptures, and make them ridiculous by their own imperious glosses to avoid their force, as we shall see as we proceed. But at present to give one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for all, there are among them that blush not to prove our Saviour's Civil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Kings of the Earth from the blessed Virgins Song. <hi>He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Proud in the imagination of their hearts, he hath put down the Mighty from their Seat, and hath exalted the humble and meek.</hi> In which words she glorifies the Goodness and Wisdom of God, that he was pleased that his Son should be born of a poor despised Maid, and not as the great Men of the World expected, of them that sate upon the Thrones of the Earth; from which hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and grateful piece of Devotion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that she rejoyced and triumphed in the Prospect of that Confusion that her Son should bring upon the World, by subverting and pulling down all the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht Governments in it, and erecting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42190:22"/>
every where new Kingdoms and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities by his own Prerogative; 'tis so rude an imposing, not only on this particular passage, but upon the whole Tenor of the Gospel it self, and the nature of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Office, as argues a strange height ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pride or Prophaneness. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evident from all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding passages, and the whole Scope of the Gospel, then our Saviour's disclaimour of any pretence to any Temporal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And the truth of it is, if he had laid claim to any such Power, his Religion had stood upon no better Foundation than that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that was at first planted and propagated, and has hitherto been maintain'd by nothing but the power of the Sword. Whereas the Design of our Saviour's Institution was pure and unmixt Religion, and therefore abetted it self and its Laws by no other Sanctions, then only the rewards and punishments of the life to come. And the same Power that he claim'd and exercis'd himself, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he devolved upon his Apostles, from them to descend to their Successors to the end of the World; so that all their power, whatever it is, being derived from him, is of the same nature with that, which himself whilst on Earth challenged as Head of his Church. And yet it is plain that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42190:23"/>
as Head of his Church he was so far from challenging any superiority over the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the World, that he profest nothing more frankly than an entire subjection to them. And therefore Sovereign Princes cannot be properly said to be vested with any power under our Saviour as such, for as it is evident that they are vested with a Supremacy of Power antecedent to his Institution, so is it as evident that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave them any Commission for the Government of his Kingdom. That power was given to his Apostles, that were as much subject to the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as himself had ever been; so that as he could give them no Temporal Power because he had, or rather would have none, it is plain that neither they nor their Successors could pretend to any by vertue of his Commission. What he enjoys in Heaven as the Son of God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, is peculiar to himself upon the account of his Divinity, but he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated no other to his Church on Earth, then what himself claim'd whil'st he remain'd in it, which was purely spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in order to a Future State, but void of all Temporal Power and Coercion. So that it is but a crude expression (not to call it prophane, because it is so common by customary mistake) to affirm that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42190:23"/>
Kings are <hi>Supream Governors under Christ.</hi> They are and ever were so under God, but so as to be <hi>superiour</hi> to Christ, as Christ is Head of his Church within their Dominions. For as Head of his Church he ever own'd himself subject to the Temporal Powers. And therefore what absoluteness of power soever he enjoys by vertue of his Divine Nature, yet as the <hi>Messias</hi> or the Mediator of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (for as such he was man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.) or as the Head and Founder of the Christian Society, he strips both himself and his Officers of all pretences to, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Temporal Power. The reason of it we must carry with us all along, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the Essential thing peculiar to his Institution, that it might be able to subsist purely upon its own strength, and maintain it self purely by vertue of its own Goodness, and that not only without the Assistance, but against the utmost Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of all Worldly Power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wise Providence of God so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd things, that it was sent into the World under all disadvantages, but only of its own Truth and Goodness. And by that alone it prevailed over all the World, before it had the least countenance from the Civil Powers, nay whilst it was with all their strength, zeal, and malice opprest
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42190:24"/>
by them. And this is the only thing that made it pure Religion, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht it from all other Religions in the World; whereas had it any certain Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral advantage annext to it as such, men had been invited to embrace it as matter of Interest, and not of Conscience, and then it had become Worldly Policy, and ceased to have been Religion. That then is the first Principle upon which our whole Christianity lies, that all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, Priviledges, and Preheminences, that the Church can pretend to derive from our Saviour are purely Spiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating only to the State of Souls in the World to come. And if the Church any where enjoy any other Dignities or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, it derives them wholly from the Grants and Charters of Soveraign Princes, who may endow them with what Priviledges themselves think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, as they may any other Order of their Subjects. And what Powers or Priviledges all States that profess Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are bound by that profession to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon the Church, I shall shew in its proper place, but whatever they are, the Church cannot challenge them by it's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Charter. So that if any Church shall be so presumptuous as to pretend to any such Power, which way soever it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42190:24"/>
comes in, whether directly or indirectly, by vertue of our Saviour's Commission, that is not only a Contradiction to the Nature of Christianity, but an Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Abuse put upon the whole Design of the Institution. But as to pretend to any such Power from our Saviour only over Subjects, is no less then Blasphemy against him; so to pretend to it over Soveraigns, doubles the Blasphemy by adding the Sin of Rebellion to that of Impiety, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroys not only the Being and Constitution of a Christian Church, but of all humane Societies. So that how many Marks soever there may be of a true Church, this alone is an infallible Note of a false one. And therefore every Church that refuses to disclaim any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power over Princes, renounces the Christian Faith, and forfeits all the Rights and Priviledges of a Christian Church; but if it should be so vain as openly to claim any such power, it bids open defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our Saviour, and quits him and his Religion to follow <hi>Mahomet.</hi> So that there is no one thing in the World can so effectually unchurch a Church, as its claiming any Temporal Authority to it self, especially over Soveraign Powers. And this I doubt will light very severely upon the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> ever since the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42190:25"/>
                  <hi>Hildebrandine Apostacy,</hi> viz. That the Pope as Vicar of Christ, has a power of deposing Soveraign Princes, and absolving Subjects from their Allegiance; this they have own'd whenever they durst, and put in practice whenever they could, and would never be brought upon any Terms to condemn it, which Doctrine certainly is the greatest unkindness that they can do themselves, and the worst thing that their greatest Enemies could desire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject against them; and if any thing can prove <hi>his Holiness</hi> to be Antichrist, this is the thing, because it is an utter Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the whole State of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and makes our Saviour a false Christ by making him a Temporal Messias, and placing him in the head of an Army to subdue the Princes and Nations of the World into subjection to himself. I am sure for this very reason does the Learned Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> make <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Type of Antichrist, because he promoted his Religion over several parts of the World by force of Arms, <hi>Quod armorum</hi>

and outrages, that they acted against Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes, and yet no man has done it with more diligence then himself, as I shall prove when I come to consider his Performance. Neither will this Charge of Apostacy light only upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but upon every Church that maintains a right of resistance to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Powers upon a pretence of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion whatsoever, for that is still to take to themselves such a power against their Prince by our Saviours Authority, which is the same direct contradiction to the Nature of the Christian Faith, and the same sort of Apostacy from Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Mahumetism, putting a Scymeter into our Saviours hand, and under his pretended conduct waging War against their lawful Soveraign, and that is the greatest dishonour that they can bring to their Master or themselves, And yet we shall find some other Churches aś much guilty of this Apostacy both in Doctrine and Practice as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and though <hi>Rome</hi> and they stand at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est distance of Enmity, out of Jealousie of one another who should carry the prize, yet they both fully agree in this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Antichristian Principle. But this Charge will come home in its proper place, at present we must take this Article
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42190:26"/>
of faith all along with us. No Temporal Authority in the Church unless from the grant of the State.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>§. III.</head>
               <p>But then secondly it must be granted too, that the Power of Princes, how great soever in Church matters, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the Spiritual Authority of the Church, that was as much settled by our Saviour, without any dependency on the Authority of the State, as the Authority of the State was settled by the Providence of God, before there was any such thing as a Christian Church in the World. So that it is undeniably evident from its original Constitution, that the Church subsists no more upon the State as to its proper Power, then the State upon the Church. For as the Christian Church came into the World, after the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of States was entirely settled in it, so did the World come into the Church after its Government was as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely fixed within it self. And therefore as Christianity by its coming into the World ought no manner of way to abate the Civil Power of the State, so neither when the Powers of the World come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, ought they to diminish any thing of that Authority, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by Divine Commission before they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42190:26"/>
came into it. For they are received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it upon the same terms with all other Proselytes of the Christian Faith, that they submit themselves to it as our Soviour's own Institution. So that as our first point is, That all Sovereign Princes have, or ought to have, an Imperial Supremacy over all Ecclesiastical Persons, and in all Ecclesiastical Causes; Our second is, That this Supremacy, which is the highest Power that can be on Earth, is no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, but a Civil Supremacy. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that, it would be a dishonour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade a Sovereign Prince to the Priestly Office: The Ecclesiastical Power is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual, and that is a Power that was never challenged by any Prince, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly given by any Man (though it is so by plain and undeniable consequence by all that disown an Inherent Authority in the Church, from our Saviour's own Commission) but only Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who as he made the Prince his own Priest, made him his own God too. Now these two Principles laid together, clear up the Nature and Title of the Supremacy of Sovereign Princes, That it is none of that Spiritual Power that is lodged in the Church, but a Temporal Supremacy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Spiritual Power of it, within his own Dominions. And now if these
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42190:27"/>
two Principles, that are as certain as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity it self, were but calmly attended to, they would perfectly silence all the clamours of both the extreme Parties in this Controversie. Those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must cease their noise, that we make the King a Bishop, by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Supremacy in all Ecclesiastical Causes, and over all Ecclesiastical Persons, when upon this State of the Question such a Supremacy over all things and persons within their Dominions, is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from all Sovereign Power, and Christianity, and all the Power that it brings along with it, comes into the World upon its supposition: So that by it we are so far from making the King a Priest, that without it, we cannot own him to be our King. And on the other side, when we assert a Spiritual Power to the Church, distinct from, though sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King's Supremacy, others cry out Popery, <hi>Praemunires,</hi> and I know not what hard names, they would soon let fall their out-cry, if they would consider that it is such a Power as never any Prince exercised, or wittingly challenged (though it is possible that some may have run upon it by mistake) and is neither Temporal nor Foreign Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in those two points lies the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42190:27"/>
of the pretended Supremacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> for as it is Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it plainly subjects the Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to its Empire; and as it is Foreign, it makes the whole Kingdom Feudatory, and brings us into the form of a Province under an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince; both which are such abuses of Government, as evidently subvert it. Nay farther, as a Foreign Temporal Jurisdiction is inconsistent with the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy; so is all kind of Foreign Jurisdiction, though meerly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, irreconcileable with the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royal. The reason and the account whereof, I shall give in its proper place, when I come to state that easie, but yet undiscover'd Point of the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of National Churches. All that I am obliged to at present is to shew the difference between that Authority that we assign to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> would Usurp; against which though there were nothing else to be objected but its being Foreign, for that reason alone it ought to be banisht the Nation as an Enemy to the Civil Government. Whereas the Authority of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is seated in the King's own Subjects, who can call them to an account for it, if they use it to his own or his Subjects preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42190:28"/>
and can as well punish them for any disorders in the abusive Exercise of it, as he can any of his own Officers for their misdemeanors in their trust in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. So that so far is the King's Supremacy, as it is stated in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from entrenching upon the proper Power of the Church, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> cavil, that it only protects it in the due exercise of its Jurisdiction: And so far is the proper power of the Church from disclaiming or abating any thing of the King's Supremacy, as the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions clamour, that it first Establishes that upon the most lasting Foundations of Divine Institution, before it makes any claim to its own Power, and when it does, it does it upon no other Terms then of entire submission to its Supreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And now that Man must wilfully dream, that can imagine such a power as this in the Church, can be any way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to, or detractive from the Civil Government; and yet that such a Power there is, is an assertion worth no less then our Christianity it self, that stands or falls with it. For if our Saviour have not entrusted his Church with a Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self, sufficient to maintain it self by vertue of his own Authority, then it stands upon no stronger Foundation then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42190:28"/>
the Will of the Sovereign Power. And then as that can Establish, so it can Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate its whole Obligation; which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say, that it is no True Religion, for it is certainly none if it relye only upon humane Authority. So that all that can be concluded in this case is, that upon supposition that our Christian Faith is an Imposture, there can be no Power in the Christian Church, and that for a very good reason, because then the Church can be no Church. But upon suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that our Saviour founded it by Divine Authority, the peculiar Power of the Church derived meerly and immediately from himself, without any interposition of humane Authority, is the first thing to be believed as absolutely necessary to its Being and Subsistence.</p>
               <p>But this will appear with a brighter evidence, if we consider the several bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Jurisdiction, that as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with the supposition of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, so are they such acts of Power as no Sovereign Power ever challenged, or can with any decency exercise. As the Power of Preaching the Gospel through all Nations of the World, in the Name, and by the Authority of God: The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of granting, or with-holding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Grace, the Sacraments of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42190:29"/>
Baptism and the Eucharist: The Power of the Keys, or judging who are fit to be admitted into the Society of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, and who ought to be cast out of it for non-performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions undertaken at their Admittance: The Power of instructing the People in the Duties of Religion, or guiding and directing them in the safest way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: The Power of Ordaining, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating, and Constituting Ecclesiastical Officers, to succeed in the Government of the Church through all Ages. These are the several points of their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and are granted to be so by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself, and that at the very time <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leviath. part.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 42.</note> when he undertakes to demonstrate, that all these acts of Power are no acts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And that is one of his choisest methods of Demonstration in all things, to bear down the undenyable Truth of all things by meer force of Assertion; thus here he reckons up the chief Acts of Authority in the Apostle's Commission, and then will bear us down that they are no Acts of Authority, only by saying so, and that against the Common Sense of Mankind. For if they had a Commission from our Saviour to do these things, then were they Empowred and Authorised by their Commission to do them. So ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42190:29"/>
a thing is it to talk of acting by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission without acting by Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every Commission as such, is granting so much Power. And therefore if the Apostles and their Successors were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned by our Saviour to these several Acts of their Office (as he grants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be denyed) every Act is an effect of that Power that is settled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by virtue of their Commission. And is it not strange, that this witty Gentleman should begin all this Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant discourse against all Power Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical as such, with this very Assertion, <hi>That the Power Ecclesiastical was at first in the Apostles, and after them in such as received it from the Apostles by successive laying on of hands.</hi> What thickness of Contradiction is this, <hi>A Power Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,</hi> and yet no Power at all? Why then if it be no Power, it is no Power Ecclesiastical, and if it be a Power Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, then it is some Power. And then again a Power by virtue of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Commission, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Power war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Divine Authority; and to say that this is no Power, is plainly to aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, That there is no such thing as Divine Authority. And upon this supposition that lies at the bottom of all this witty Authors folly and Philosophy, it must be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42190:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confessed, that there can be no Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Power over the Christian Church, either in the Clergy or any Man else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon it there is neither Christian Church nor Christian Religion, and then it is certain, that there can be no Power over nothing. So vain are all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts against that Authority that our Blessed Saviour has granted to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Succession, that it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by any other Principles, then what directly overthrow Christianity it self, upon those Terms it must be parted with, but upon no other. And though Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> speaks out more boldly then his Neighbours, yet all the followers of <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> and all that will own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> certain Form of Government establisht in the Church by Divine Right, cannot avoid the Church of <hi>Leviathan.</hi> And therefore to proceed with him as Fore-man to speak for all the rest, it is evident that beside the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by which the Apostles and their Successors act, every act that they are enabled to by their Commission, is in its own Nature, and as such an Authoritative Act.</p>
               <p>First, such is the power of Preaching, and Teaching, <hi>i. e.</hi> the power of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of the Gospel to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and requiring all Mens Obedience
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42190:30"/>
to them under the sanction of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Rewards and Penalties. And if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> can affirm that exacting Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon such terms be no piece of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it is in vain either to reason with himself, or any other Man of his Kidney or Understanding. But he proves it to be so, because <hi>The Apostles were Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Preachers are Cryers, and Cryers have no right to Command.</hi> Among the many bad qualities in this Author's way of writing, his contempt of other Mens understandings is none of the least, for if he had not a very low Opinion of their intellectual Abilities, he could never have presumed to impose upon them by such childish pretences. And the truth of it is, he talks, not as if he discoursed to Men, but to Magpies, Parots, and Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws, that are to learn to chatter his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates by Rote. For is it not a strange grossness of Confidence, that when our Blessed Saviour came from God to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish a new Law to the World, and enforce it with the severest Penalties, and when he gave the same Commission to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles that himself had received from his Father, to publish this Law to the World, though they do it with all this Authority to infer, that they do it with none at all, because when they declare their Message,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42190:31"/>
they open their mouths as Cryers do when they make Proclamations, and so the original Word signifies any kind of publick Declaration. And what if it were the proper term for the Cryers Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it may for all that, in common Speech be applyed to any other way of Publication; it will be hard to find out any one word in the World so severely stinted to its original Import. However every School-boy could have inform'd the old Philosopher that this word is not so confin'd, and that it is not, is evident from the very passage it self, because the Apostles that are said to Proclaim or Cry the Gospel to all Nations, do not make a simple Proclamation, but require Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what they publish under the most forcible obligation of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. And such Proclamation as that, whatever the term Proclaiming may signifie in its naked sense, brings with it as much Authority as it is possible for Government to put in practice. But he farther affirms, in proof of no Authority in the Church, <hi>That the Apostles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers of the Gospel are our School-Masters, and not our Commanders.</hi> But beside that this is an Arbitrary Assertion of his own devising to assign them the Office of School-Masters, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42190:31"/>
no where does so: The Authority of a School-Master is some Authority, for though he have not the Power of the Sword, he has that of the Rod, and that is as effectual for his purpose among Boys, as the other among Men. So that there is no Logique in the Argument, neither can I believe so witty a Man to have been so weak as to have brought it for that purpose, but rather because he thought the comparison was a witty slur upon Christianity, as if it were as childish and contemptible an Office to instruct men in it, as it is to teach Boys and Children their Elements of Speech. That is a shrewd hint, though the next compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is much more poinant, <hi>That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour compares Preaching to Fishing,</hi> i. e. <hi>to winning Men to Obedience, not by coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and punishing, but by perswasion, and therefore our Saviour calls not Apostles hunters of Men, but fishers of Men.</hi> Now though his endeavour to prove that there is no Authority in the Officers of the Church, because they have no Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is altogether vain and trifling, because he only presumes what no Man will grant him, that there is no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the World; yet here his way of demonstration is somewhat more then usually pleasant, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42190:32"/>
endued with no power of Coertion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Saviour has constituted them, not his Huntsmen, but his Fishermen: Where I think it would require the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s wit to make it out, why there is less Coertion in Fishing, then in Hunting, especially in Net-fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was their former Trade, to which he knows our Saviour there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes; when this mighty difficulty is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, I may come to understand the force of the Argument, but till then, I must confess it is above my reach. But hitherto it is evident that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this Gentleman's Grammatical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations from Cryers, School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Fishers, that the Commission granted to the Apostles and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to preach the Gospel, did not only carry proper Authority in it, but the highest sort of Authority, because enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the greatest Rewards and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and that every man knows is the very Life and Soul of all Power.</p>
               <p>The next branch of their Commission is to Baptize in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and though the Philosopher would here make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self merry, not only with the Sacrament, but with the Holy Trinity, in whose Name it is Administred, yet after all his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42190:32"/>
pains to prove it no Authority, he fairly confesses, <hi>That it is an Authority either to Baptize, or refuse to Baptize, because Baptism is the Sacrament of Allegiance, of them that are to be received into the Kingdom of God.</hi> But certainly if they have Power to grant or deny them this Sacrament, <hi>i. e.</hi> to receive them into the Kingdom of God, or shut them out of it, if there be any such thing as Power in the World, there cannot be a greater then this. And consequent to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he says, is the Remission and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Sins, or the Power of Loosing and Binding, and for this, I must confess he gives a pertinent reason (for so he is forced to do sometimes, meerly by the truth of things against his own petulant design) <hi>For seeing to Baptize is to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the reception of Men into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to refuse to Baptize is to declare their Exclusion; it followeth, that the Power to declare them cast out, or retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, was given to the Apostles, and their Substitutes and Successors.</hi> And so it does unavoidably, for they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon certain conditions, those that received them upon promise of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Conditions, must have a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perpetual Power to judge of their performance, and accordingly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42190:33"/>
to continue them in the Church or Kingdom of God, or cast them out. But would not one take the Man to be bereft of his Wits, that should rave and talk of nothing but the Authority and Power of these Acts, whilst he is eagerly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against their being Acts of Power and Authority. Such is the inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s rovings, and how can he help it, whilst he would make the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Gospel to destroy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it self, for that is the folly of his undertaking in the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that he would make the Christian Faith appear a forgery, and prove it so by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. A contradiction so round, as could never have met in any Mans head that had not squar'd the Circle and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively proved from one and the same Topick, there must, and that there must not be a God. Both which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently undertaken, and in his opinion perform'd, and I believe may sooner do it, then prove the greatest Acts of Power in the World to be no Acts of Power at all.</p>
               <p>But after Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has, in spight of himself, granted all that Authority to the Church that he would deny, and that the Church can demand, his next work is to render it useless and ridiculous. For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42190:33"/>
first he would place it in the People, but that I shall not at present dispute with him or any other, that deny the distinct Power of the Church, for whether it be in the People or not is all one to their Assertion that it is no where, and the Seat of it is another question that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses its being somewhere. Only by the way it is observable, how Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> through his whole Book shelters his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness under the then Reigning Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Independency; and the truth is, that wild Confusion of things is a fit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for all sorts of folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For when the Rabble are made Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judges in any Cause, as they are by the Independent Principles of all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses both in Church and State, that is breach wide enough for the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse to enter, and leaves the Government of both at the mercy of all manner of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Sedition. For the whole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the project concludes in this, to leave every Man at liberty to do what he pleases, without being accountable for his actions to any Superiours; and that is in express terms to abolish all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and even break up Families them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But though it be advantage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to subvert the Government, it is much more to invert it: For all Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42190:34"/>
of Government into the People sets the Feet upon the Head, and the part go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd above the part governing: And the result of it, when reduced to practice, is to set up one Great and Royal Slave as a mark for the Insolence of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And whenever they are put upon it by Ambitious Men to challenge their original Soveraignty; if the Prince have the ill luck to fall into their hands, they will be sure to treat him with a more haughty barbarity then they would any other ordinary Person, thereby to shew the greatness of their native Power. And the wretch that durst be so impudent as to spit in his Sovereign's face, perhaps would have scorn'd to have offer'd the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to a fellow-subject; that had been but a common act of Power, and only an affront to an equal; but to offer so great an indignity to a Sovereign Prince, was truly becoming one that understood the native greatness of his own Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, being by the original right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a more absolute Prince then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Monarch in the World of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Creating. So that upon these terms of putting the Supreme Power into the Hands or the Heads of the People, 'tis to tell the Subjects, that no Man has any Right or Power to Govern them, but as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42190:34"/>
themselves think good to be Govern'd; that is, in a word, that they are under no Government at all.</p>
               <p>But secondly, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is not content with setling this Sacred Power in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Rabble, unless he make it more idle and ridiculous, as a Power of no use and effect in it self; because, says he, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which is the only Penalty by which it abets it self, is of no effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Apostate, having nothing of Damage or Terrour in it; not of Terrour, because of his unbelief; nor of Damage, because in times of Persecution he is return'd thereby into favour with the World: And in the World to come is in no worse Estate, then they which never believed.</hi> It is an hard task to struggle against common Sense, it forces a Man in every breath to choak himself with swallowing his own words. Thus here by Excommunication, he tells us, <hi>That a Man is put into an Estate, wherein his sins are not forgiven, and so excluded the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> As great a punishment as can be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane nature, if there be any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in Hell; and yet according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> it is none at all, if Men will not be afraid of it. But whether they will or will not if Christianity be not a Lye (which though he believed not, he could
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42190:35"/>
not suppose, for the Discourse, if it be any thing, proceeds all along upon that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) the punishment is the same in it self, and has naturally the same effect. And if some Men at present are so hardy as to despise it, as some are to out-brave all the punishments of this World, till they over-reach them, yet when it comes to be actually inflicted, they feel its smart as severely as the more timerous and cowardly Offenders. But when he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, that it can be of no effect in the World to come, because it puts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no worse Estate, then they had been in, if they had never believed. Is not that a Condition bad enough? When by his belief he obtain'd Remission of his Sins, and a Right to the Kingdom of Heaven, and when by his Apostacy he is returned back into a State of Condemnation. And is the difference of these two States so small, that the loss of one should be no Damage, and the suffering of the other no Punishment? But beside this, the State of Apostacy is much worse then that of Infidelity, because Apostates sin more or less against the Convictions of their own Conscience, and that is the highest Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of all sins, whereas Men may remain in Infidelity, through negligence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r want of enquiry, which though a fault,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42190:35"/>
is by no means so disingenuous as acting against knowledge. But as for this Case of Apostates in time of Persecution, upon whom, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> says, Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could have no effect of Terrour. If indeed the Providence of God had not given them sufficient evidence of their Faith, I will grant it to be true, not only of that, but of all the other Threatnings of the Gospel. But if God have given sufficient motives of belief, (as if the Gospel be not a cheat, he has, if it be, all Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s dispute is without bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) a Man's Apostacy is no Fence against the Reflections of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. For though it is in his Power to deny his Faith for fear of Persecution, yet it is not in his Power to disbelieve it. So that upon such a Man the Sentence of Excommunication, by which he is cast out of the Kingdom of Heaven, lights with as much Terrour as upon any other Believer. And there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the History of the Primitive Church, then the Efficacy of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon such Offenders. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of those that fell in time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, were by this means alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to the Church, brought to sue for pardon, and undergo very severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as a satisfaction for the Scandal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42190:36"/>
But to what purpose do I put my self to the trouble to prove these things, when all Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s discourse upon this Argument, runs upon this supposition, as if Christianity were but a trivial and indifferent thing, that might, or might not be believed as Men variously fancied, or were casually inclined: And upon that supposition I will freely grant it to be of as little effect as he would have it. But if the Providence of God hath given us such a Demonstrative Evidence of the Divine Authority of this Religion, that no Man, who inquires into it, can wink against its Light, without doing violence to his own Convictions, then whether Men will or no, it will be a perpetual Terrour to their Consciences. And that this slight Opinion of the Evidence of Christianity (though upon what slight, and indeed ignorant pretences I have elsewhere shewn) is the bottom of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s meaning, is too manifest from his next branch of the Supremacy of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Powers, which indeed is neither better nor worse then bare-faced Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And that is the Power of making Scripture Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> Obligatory: But if that be the state of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is not at all material, whether a Man regard it or not, for any Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42190:36"/>
or Authority in it self, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is not to be blamed, unless in point of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for all those irreverend abuses, that he has been pleased to put upon it. But if it be made Law by the Command of God, as it is, if it be not all imposture in pretending falsly to his Authority, then whatever the Sovereign is pleased to make of it, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, that will allow it no obligation but from Man, stand Convicted of the most manifest Treason and Blasphemy against the Sovereign Lord of all, and this part of Ecclesiastical Supremacy of making Scripture Law, that they give to Kings, they take away from God himself. After all this rank prophaneness, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most needless to consider his last branch of Ecclesiastical Power, <hi>viz.</hi> the Right of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, and Constituting Ecclesiastical Officers, not only because it is of the same Nature and derived from the same Divine Authority, with all the other particulars of the Apostolical Commission, but because himself grants it in general by placing it in the People. For if it be any where, that is enough against himself, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies all manner of Power in the Church, but most of all because he has confessed (and no Man can deny it) the whole truth of the matter both against the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42190:37"/>
                  <hi>Hobbist</hi> and the Independant too; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles conveighed their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to their Successors, whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Deputed and Ordained by Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, and if so, this Power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting Successors resided in them alone, because no Man could be constituted an Officer in the Church, but by their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, or those to whom by it they Transmitted their Power. So that whatever interest they might permit the People in their Choice or Nomination of their Officers, the whole power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting them in their Office and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity lay in themselves alone.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>§. IV.</head>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> having hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to treated of the Power Ecclesiastical, as it stood before the Conversion of Kings, and Men endued with Sovereign Civil Power; and after his rate of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved it to be no Power at all whilst vested in the Pastors of the Church; he comes now to prove, that it is lodged in Civil Sovereigns, upon their Conversion to the Christian Faith, and that when it comes to them, it becomes true and proper Power. But before I consider his small Arguments, I cannot understand why that which was no Power before, becomes Power now: There can be but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42190:37"/>
one reason for it, and that is too obvious in all Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Writings, <hi>viz.</hi> Because it is now abetted with the Penalties of this life, whereas before it was only abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Penalties of the life to come; so that the plain <hi>English</hi> of the Assertion, if spoken out, is this, that there are no penalties at all but in this life, and then I must confess, that the power of the Church can be no Power till complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Civil Power. But the man that discourses upon such Principles as these, has nothing to do with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, or any thing relating to it. But secondly, Which way came this Power into Civil Sovereigns? Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour left it to his Apostles, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it down by Imposition of Hands to others, who were to conveigh it in the same manner of Succession through all Ages, how then came Civil Sovereigns by it? If any were Ordain'd to it, they had it by virtue of their Ordination, not their Right of Sovereignty; if they were not, which way could they become pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of a Power, that was never deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them in the way of Ordination, which is the only way in which it can be conveighed, and therefore if they have it not that way, they can never have it any other. As for the Principle upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42190:38"/>
which he founds this Power of the Civil Sovereign, though it be true in it self, yet it is no proper reason for what he would infer from it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Right of judging what Doctrines are fit for Peace, and to be taught the Subjects is in all Common-wealths inseparably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Sovereign Power Civil. This is undoubtedly true, that they are the proper Judges of what conduces to the peace and quiet of Government; but then this Power is common to Heathen as well as Christian Soveraigns, they are all equally concern'd, and obliged to take care of the Publick Peace; so that this Power does not accrue to the Civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign by his becoming Christian, but was antecedently and inseparably annex'd to the Sovereign Power. And therefore 'tis but a vain distinction that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes of the Ecclesiastical Power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before and after the Conversion of Civil Sovereigns. When before it, they have all a right of judging what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are fit for Peace, that being inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably annex't to all Sovereign Power; and after it, they have no more as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes. And then if the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Power rested in the Apostles and their Successors before the Conversion of Civil Sovereigns, it must do so ever after,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42190:38"/>
for they could not lose that Power that was left them by our Saviour, any other way, but by his own actual transferring it to another; which he having not done, it continues, as and where it was first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So that Sovereigns as Christian, as they lose no Power they gain none, their Power is in both Cases Supreme from the nature of Sovereignty. But beside all this, because they have a right to judge of all things, as far as they concern the Civil Peace, it is an inference that only becomes Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Principles, to conclude that this gives them a power of judging what is fittest to promote the Salvation of their Subjects Souls in the World to come. And yet that is the true and proper Province of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power, so to guide and govern the Church in this World, as to bring the Members of it to Heaven hereafter. And that is somewhat more then meerly to provide for the Civil Peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a right to that, cannot give any right to this, especially when it is by express Commission settled in another order of Men. All True Religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very serviceable to the Interests of Peace and Government, and so far it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Civil Power, as such, to abett its force with Civil Laws. But then it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42190:39"/>
has a much farther prospect into the World to come, and the care of that is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour to a particular Order of Men Consecrated to that Office. How this Power comes not to interfere with the Civil, but is subject to it, will be shewn in the next place, but our present business is only to assert its Right. And that is so apparent from the whole design and nature of Christianity, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without it. For if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our enacted the Christian Law and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Christian Church, not by Civil but Divine Authority; if he Instituted the Apostles and their Successors to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, then their Right of Government stands upon the same bottom with the truth of Christianity. And if it be true that the Christian Church was planted in the World by Divine Authority, it is as true, that they have a right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it by the same Authority. This is so undeniable to common Sense, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has no way to avoid it, but by denying our Saviour's own Supremacy at present, in that his Kingdom is not to begin till after the Resurrection. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the falshood and the wickedness of the Assertion, whereby Christianity is made of no force or use in this World, in that no Man can be obliged to obey its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42190:39"/>
because our Saviour has not power to make it Law, till he enters upon his Kingdom, and that is not till after the end of the World. Beside this, I say, who could think that any Man that reads the Gospel, could be so extravagantly foolish as to dream, that it was not intended for present Obligation, and that no Man is bound to obey any part of it before the day of Judgment, when that day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed on purpose for the distribution of Rewards and Punishments, according to Mens discharge of their Duty towards it? Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would, in my Opinion, have asserted with much more modesty, that God Almighty had sent his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World upon a sleeveless Errand, though that is as rank Blasphemy as can be vented; then with so much formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty go about to prove out of the Holy Scriptures themselves, that his coming into it is to no purpose, because it takes no effect whilst the World lasts. This is to fasten upon the Almighty such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piece of folly, as his Politiques have run himself into in another Case, when he tells the World, that the serious belief of Religion is necessary to Government, and yet that all Religion is nothing but an Artifice of State; and then it is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Religion, nor can be seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42190:40"/>
and so can do no service to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. So here he makes God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to send his Son into the World to publish a Law, by Obedience to which, Men may purchase to themselves a State of Salvation in the World to come; and yet at the same time makes the same God to declare that this Law, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication whereof he sent his Son into the World, is of no force in this World to which it was publisht, and that no Man whilst he lives is under any obligation of Obedience to it. Upon this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition would not any Man conclude, that our Saviour might very well have spared all his pains, and not have been in so much hast, and put himself to so much trouble for Enacting a Law to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but rather to have deferr'd its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication to the next World, in which it was to Commence its Use and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But the true Consequence of this Evasion is a clear Demonstration of the distinct power of the Christian Church, when there is no way to take this away but by abrogating our Saviour's own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. For if all Ecclesiastical Power be in the Civil Sovereign, then he has none, and so Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> to be consistent with his Principle, says he has not, while there are Civil Sovereigns in the World.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42190:40"/>
But if he have any, he has power to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute what Officers he pleases, and by virtue of their Deputation they have a Power as independent upon the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, as that Authority from which their Power is derived. So that to take away the distinct Power of the Church, as it was settled by our Saviour upon the Apostles and their Successors, is in plain terms to deny his Power as well as theirs. For if they had a right to it at first by his Grant, and if his grant be of any Validity, they have the same for ever. So dangerous a thing is it if Men would seriously consider, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the Authority of the Church, it is no less then renouncing our Saviour's own Authority. And I am confident no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prince would ever accept of any Supremacy of Power upon such terms, and yet if he challenge to himself, though but a share of that Power, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has left to the Apostolical Succession, he must plainly invade that original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in our Saviour himself from whom they hold it.

                  </gap>hough we could suppose any Prince so prophane, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would make all Princes, yet we cannot imagine any Man so impudent as to take up his Supremacy upon no better terms then of Renouncing his Saviour,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42190:41"/>
for so does every one that denies his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Authority, and takes it to himself. So inseparably is the right of Governing the Christian Church annexed to the Apostolical Office by virtue of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Divine Authority, that to take it from them and place it any where else, is open Rebellion against the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God himself.</p>
               <p>Thus far have I consider'd the wild Consequence of that Opinion, that gives all Power in the Christian Church to the Civil Magistrate, and shewn, not only that it gives them what no Prince was ever so Extravagant as to challenge, a Power to Administer the Sacraments, a Power to Ordain Ecclesiastical Officers, a Power to do all those Offices that are known all the World over to be proper only to the Ecclesiastical Function, but withal, that it apparently takes away all Authority from our Saviour himself. And this in the Conclusion of all I must say for Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that though he sticks not to own all these bad Consequences, he affirms no more then what he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to by his first Assertion, and whoever gives the proper Ecclesiastical Power to the Civil Sovereign, if he will not own Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Consequences, must quit his own Assertion. And this I shall prove
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42190:41"/>
in its proper place, upon all the followers of <hi>Erastus,</hi> that will not acknowledge any form of Ecclesiastical Government settled by Divine Right, they must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Christianity, and be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the Church of <hi>Leviathan.</hi>

               <p>And now having avoided these two dangerous extremes, one whereof destroys our Government, and the other our Religion, upon the supposition of the Truth of the Premisses, there are, and ever must be in all Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, where Christianity is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd and Protected, two distinct Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions, so as that if we confound them both together, or that either invade or intrench upon the other, it is as much as our Christianity is worth, and the wrong either way will light at last upon our Saviour's own Authority. For if the Priest challenge any Temporal Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as derived from our Saviour; beside the violation of the Rights of Sovereign Powers, he directly affronts his Masters own Government, and in effect disclaims it. For his Kingdom is purely Spiritual, and he becomes our Lord and Saviour by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Supremacy over it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pretend to any Power of another Nature from him as head of his Church,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42190:42"/>
is the thing that I charge with turning Christ into <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and forces upon him in spight of his own Protestation against it, a Temporal Dominion. Which is such an abuse of his Institution, and such a contradiction to his whole Design, that to call him Impostor would not be a greater Blasphemy. For this implies no less then that under pretence of such a Religious and Innocent design of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Kingdom but not of this World, he really intended no other Design then to advance an Universal Empire over all the World, and all the Sovereign Powers of it. And on the other side, if a Sovereign Prince shall assume to himself the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of that Power, that is peculiarly vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Governors and Officers of the Church, and so take upon him the sole Government of it as such, instead of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Church he destroys it, when every Church as a Church is capable of no other Government, then what was delegated to the Apostolical Office by our Saviour's own special Commission, after the full settlement of the Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes. So that after this, for them to take it to themselves, is to act not only without, but against our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's own express Commission, when he has so particularly appropriated that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42190:42"/>
to another Order of Men. Neither is it only an encroachment upon our Saviour's own Authority, but an assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to himself. In that the Prince thereby Challenges the Supreme Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Saviour's Kingdom, without any Commission from him, and then has it by virtue of his own Title, and not of our Saviour's Grant, and then is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour plainly turn'd out of his Kingdom, and another seated in his Throne.</p>
               <p>Now this being the true State of the Christian Church, the grand difficulty that follows upon it, and that has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so much puzled most Men in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is the danger of Competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Supreme Powers. For if they happen to contradict each other, as of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time they have too often done, who shall over-rule? If a man obey his Prince contrary to the Prescription of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guide, he may endanger his Soul; if he obey the Bishop, he disobeys his Prince, and thereby forfeits his Neck to Justice. This Knot is thought so difficult, that instead of untying it, it is generally cut asunder, and the competition avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by denying the distinction. Thus the <hi>Romanists</hi> that are the high flying Assertors of Ecclesiastical Power, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously confine all the Power of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42190:43"/>
Princes to things Secular, and take away all Authority from them in matters Ecclesiastical. And on the other side, the greatest part of those that Assert the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Supremacy, deny any Jurisdiction at all in Ecclesiastical Officers, making their whole Function meerly Ministerial, or nothing but a right to perform and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Offices of the Church, but as for any Power or Jurisdiction in it, they have none but what is granted by the Civil Magistrate. But both these run into all the fore-mention'd ill Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the first by denying the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy over all things within his own Dominions: The second by denying our Saviour's Supremacy over his Catholick Church in all places, by which he has every where settled a Power in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, distinct from the Power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so that either of these Extremes, howsoever minc'd and stated, still carry us upon the same Precipice. Though this difficulty becomes so much the more nice, because of the more Ancient Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sovereign Powers: in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Institution of the Christian Church they govern'd their Kingdoms without Competitors; and therefore have reason to be jealous of this new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as an encroachment upon their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42190:43"/>
old Soveraignty. For whereas before the setting up of this, the whole and sole Power within their Dominions was in themselves, now they seem to enjoy but a kind of divided Empire, and see another erected in it, backt by no less Authority then the immediate and miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God himself, and that is greater then the greatest Power upon Earth; so that by it they seem not only to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall'd but over-topt in their Authority. That is that Providence that had hitherto made them Supreme under it self within their own Dominions, seems hereby to introduce a Superiour Power over their Heads, by his own more immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. All which seems to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable contradiction to the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that I have laid of a Christian Church, that it makes no alteration or abatement of the Rights of Sovereign Princes. But all these difficulties as big and as dreadful as they may appear at first view, are clearly scatter'd by one very easie and obvious consideration.</p>
               <p>And that is, that the Christian Church, as it is endued with no Temporal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or Power of the Sword, so all the Authority that it has is founded upon the Cross of Christ, and that obliges all that own it to a more entire and resign'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42190:44"/>
submission to Civil Government, then Men could have been brought under by any other way without its Institution. So that the Erection of our Saviour's new Kingdom within the Kingdoms of the Earth upon the Doctrine of the Cross, is so far from defrauding Sovereign Princes of their Ancient Authority, that it is its greatest improvement and inforcement; but especially it makes the Power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sovereign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more absolute then all other Powers that are not Christian, and even to these it raises their Soveraignty higher then it was before, over all their Christian Subjects, by binding them to a stricter Allegiance then their own Laws; and of all other Christians, those that have the highest Authority in the Church are obliged by their very Office to the most humble, peaceable, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute submission to the worst of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All which considerations render Christianity the most easie of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World for compliance with the peace and quiet of Government.</p>
               <p>And first, as for the Notion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross, it is singular to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. For all other Religions both of Jews and Gentiles had some Worldly interest twisted with them; but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to avoid all mixtures of Hypocrisie,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42190:44"/>
abstracts his Institution from all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, unless of the World to come. And therefore first Erects his Kingdom, not only without any Promise of any advantages of this life, but to let his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers know what they were to trust to by the Principles of his Religion, with a certain assurance of the loss of all the comforts of life, and at last life it self. So evident is it from the original Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Christian Church, that it is so far from giving Men any claims of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interest, that meerly as they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, they are obliged, whenever they are called to it, to renounce them all. And this Doctrine lying at the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christianity, our Saviour was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to settle it in the first place. When he gives his Disciples their first Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to preach the Gospel to all Nations, that is the first Condition that he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches them to require of all Proselytes, <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>that taketh not up his Cross and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. i. e.</hi> He that takes not up his Religion upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of taking up the Cross too, is no true Christian. By which expression of taking up the Cross, is signified the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-going of all kind of Calamities, of which the Cross was the greatest, being the most shameful and most painful pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42190:45"/>
that was used at that time: And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> in his Description of a perfect good-Man, that nothing shall fright out of his Duty and Conscience, says of him, that when he has suffered all miseries, he will endure to be Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied too. So that the meaning of our Saviour's words is plainly this, Let no Man expect any Worldly profit by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing me, and therefore not pretend that I gave him any ground for it; but on the contrary, such is the nature of my Institution, that whoever will undertake it, it must be upon no less condition then this, that he be willing and ready to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all manner of Persecutions for it, even the scandalous death of the Cross it self. So plain is it, that Christianity when it meets with any Opposition, is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it self by nothing but suffering to use no weapon but the Cross, and Men that are indispensably obliged to such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute submission, are sufficiently tyed up, if any such thing be possible, from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any disturbance to the Civil State; for what greater security can be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against that, then that Men should be bound by the first Principle of their Religion, with meekness and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to resign up their Lives to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Government. So it is in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42190:45"/>
case of Christianity, they have nothing to plead but their own innocence, and if that will not satisfie, they have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from our Saviour to upbraid the Power that condemns them, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to the Justice of the Court, but instead of that are obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go its Sentence as he did with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of meekness and silence. Here is no disputing the Commands of Princes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right or wrong, nothing but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute submission to their most unjust and illegal Proceedings, much less any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to their most unwarrantable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, nor any weapon of defence but laying down their Lives after their great Masters Example in submission to the Government. This is the true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest state of the Christian Church, that every Man be faithful to the Laws of his Religion, and if he suffer for it, he shall be compensated with those Rewards that his Religion Promises, and that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation enough for all that he can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in this World; and if he take it not up with this condition, it is not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion that he takes up, for it is no Christian Religion without the Cross. And so our Saviour has all along stated the matter upon all occasions. And it being so stated, it is easie to understand,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42190:46"/>
how in cases of the greatest competition, both Powers so prevail at the same time, as to attain both their respective Ends. For by it the Civil Power must over-rule as to all effects of this life, and when it is to be thus gently submitted to in its most unjust Decrees, that is a full secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Peace and Quiet of this World, and that is the proper end for which it was instituted. And the Spiritual Power attains its effect, as to the World to come, <hi>i. e.</hi> the salvation of the Souls of Men by their Conscientious Loyalty to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Laws; and that is all that it aims at, and that every Professor of it ought to pretend to. This is so plain and evident in the whole practice of the Primitive Church, that one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that any Man should ever dream that true Christianity could any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with Civil Government. For when the Powers of the World at that time, particularly the Governors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, being under a mistaken apprehension that the new Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion aim'd at Innovation in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, endeavour'd by all the methods of Cruelty to stop its progress, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians who were all bound openly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their Faith, and some of them to propagate it in publick, notwithstanding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42190:46"/>
all that bloody opposition that was made against it, went on in their work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out creating any the least disturbance to their Governors, unless what they gave themselves by their own needless out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage against them. For all that they did in their own defence was only to declare, that how much soever they were displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Christian Religion, they could have no ground or provocation to persecute it, because it was not only by its Laws, but by its very Constitution, in the first place tender of all the Rights of Civil Government; but if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that they were resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against them, they had nothing more to say or do for themselves, then to lay down their Lives with all possible meekness, in submission to their Royal Will and Pleasure, and hoped they would not take it for any piece of stubbornness or affected disobedience, that they would not Renounce their Faith, nor quit their hopes in the Kingdom of Heaven, out of compliance with their Commands, when they saw them so much in good earnest as to be ready to lay down their Lives out of pure submission to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Such a competition as this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided upon the supposition of the real Truth of Christianity, but then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42190:47"/>
upon supposition of its Nature, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that it can be any way prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Civil Government, to which by its obligation to peaceable suffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, it cannot avoid to discharge its whole duty of subjection to it. If it be said, that though this is the real state of Christianity in it self, it cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that its Professors should be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and so free from passion, but that they may be provoked to resistance by Oppression. To this it is easily answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that how much soever the Christian Religion allows for other infirmities of Flesh and Blood, this is open defiance and contradiction to it; so that the Man that pretends to Christianity, and yet can be prevail'd upon by any Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to entertain one thought of it, is a Villain, a Cut-throat, a Traytor, and a Rebel, not only against his King, but his Saviour. And therefore whenever Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are encountred with any pretences whatsoever of disturbance upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion, for that very reason alone they ought to cut them off as the most incorrigible and most unpardonable sort of Traytors. And if they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians themselves, and have any kindness for the honour of their Religion, to make such shameless pretenders to it, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42190:47"/>
of their utmost severity, it is the very top of all Blasphemy, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. In short, there can be nothing more evident then this, that Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it self, as it is founded upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross, can never do any harm to Civil Government, so if it be ever abused and prophaned to such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, they that do it are the worst of Villains, that deserve the utmost punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be inflicted upon them in this life, and will be sure to meet with it in the life to come. And that I think is all that it is possible for any Law to do, to deterr those that it would oblige from offending against it, by all the Penalties that God or Man can inflict.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>§. VI.</head>
               <p>But secondly, beside this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrine of the Cross, that cuts up the very Roots of all resistance to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Powers, there are great numbers of particular Laws, peculiar to this Religion, that lop off all its Branches and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by advancing the Reverence that is due to Authority; and requiring from all that profess any Obedience to that, a more accurate Obedience and Subjection to their Governors, then their Governors could have obliged them to by their own Authority. So that of all Men the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42190:48"/>
must be the best Subject by his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profession; so far is he from being brought under any probable Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of disrespect to his Superiours by his Christianity, that by that, be his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours what they will, <hi>Caligula's, Nero's</hi> or <hi>Domitian's,</hi> he is bound by a new obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, under no less penalty than the Divine displeasure, to give them the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est honour and the lowest subjection. It were an endless work to enumerate all passages in the Holy Scripture to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it being more frequently and more earnestly urged then any other duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very well observes in his Book of the Lawfulness of Rebellion) <hi>Every Man is naturally selfish and proud,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> Thes. 377.</note> 
                  <hi>and apt to break the bounds that God hath set us, and to be Kings and Laws to our selves. This Rebelling disobedient dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition therefore should be first resisted and subdued, as a greater Enemy to the Peace of Nations, then the faults of Princes are.</hi> And therefore I shall alledge one or two of the most pregnant Texts against it, to shew both the Impudence and Impiety of those Men, and himself in particular, who dare Reconcile any Pretence to Christianity with the least disrespect to Sovereign Powers. And whilst they lay claims to greater Holiness and Purity
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42190:48"/>
then their Neighbours, are putting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual slights and affronts upon their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and whenever they can gain an opportunity by the assistance of the Rabble, blush not with all their demure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to wrastle with them for their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. Which is such a rank piece of Blasphemy, such a bare-faced appearance of <hi>Antichrist, Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> as no good Christian can sufficiently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, nor any wise Magistrate sufficiently punish. Though the greatest affront of all, is to the Holy Scriptures themselves; for when they have so clearly and severely forbidden all Resistance to Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; when the Rules that they have given in this case are so absolute and universal to prevent all Evasion; when beside the great Authority of the Command it self, they enforce it by its own wisdom and reasonableness; in a word, when it is tyed upon us by all the strongest Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations both of Power, Interest, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, after all this to escape the force of a Law so carefully Enacted, is to pass an open slight upon the Wisdom of the Legislator himself. But to make these very Precepts that were given on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to cut off all pretences of Resistance, so many Warrants and Commissions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Subjects for raising Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42190:49"/>
their Sovereigns, as has been done in our Age, exceeds all the Impiety of Men, nay of Devils too, in all former Ages.</p>
               <p>For what can be more clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly express'd then St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse to the <hi>Romans,</hi> chap. 13, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God. The Powers that now are, are ordain'd of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation,</hi> &amp;c. Here is no Restriction, no Reservation, 'tis the Catholique Duty of all Mankind, and stands upon such reasons as equally effect all. And first from the Original of all Authority, <hi>It is from God.</hi> It is not said, because those in Power were either the best or the wisest Men; but be the Men what they will, they have their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from God himself, and for that reason he requires subjection to them as to himself, and therefore looks upon all resistance to these his Vicegerents, as an affront to the Authority of his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: <hi>Whosoever resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> And then no wonder if the Judgment of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it: <hi>And they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation.</hi> But
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42190:49"/>
though this Argument from the Divine Original of Government be so strong an enforcement of this Duty, yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle goes on to tye it harder, and that is from its End, the Good of the Subject: <hi>For he is the Minister of God to thee for good.</hi> And common Sense will tell us, that submission to the worst Princes, is much more the Interest of the Subject then Rebellion against them. So that how much harm soever a Tyrannical Prince may bring upon a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> he does it more good, though it were only by being a Bar against the Miseries of War and Confusion. And common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will confirm the Wisdom of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument, that be the Governors the worst that can be, and so they were at that time; yet their Government in spite of their own folly and wickedness is highly beneficial to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and in that every private mans Interest and Property is comprehended. Now from both these Premises the conclusion is unavoidable: <hi>Wherefore ye must needs be Subject not only for Wrath, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake.</hi> That is, not only for fear of the King and his Laws, but out of sense of duty to that God by whose Authority Kings Reign, and who has bound upon our Consciences the duty of Subjection
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42190:50"/>
to them. Now one would think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for Men to escape from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of so clear a Law; and so it is, till they lay aside the natural Sense and Ingenuity of Mankind; and then indeed Mens Consciences are arm'd against all Conviction, and so it happens among us, that as once much learning made this great Apostle mad, so now much Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion makes him a Fool. For so we are told that we must not think that he would be so silly as to abett the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Tyrants, <hi>Non ut Neronem aut Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannum quemvis alium supra omnem legem &amp; paenam constituendo, crudelissimum uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Imperium in omnes mortales constabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liret;</hi> that he would not set up <hi>Nero</hi> or any other Tyrant above all Law and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and establish the cruel Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one above all. And therefore we must distinguish between the King's Person, as a Man <hi>in Concreto</hi> (to express it in Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s words, though it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lex Rex Q.</hi> 29.</note> is the Sence of all the Monarchomachists) and as a King and his Office <hi>in abstracto,</hi> the Person may be resisted, though not the Office, because if the Person govern not by Law and Justice, he ceases to be a Lawful Power. But to what purpose is it for God to make Laws, if Men may evacuate their force by such Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42190:50"/>
Nothings? For how can we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Office of a King, but by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the King himself? If the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it self could Govern without him, then it might be the safest way to stick to the <hi>Abstract,</hi> but seeing it cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without the <hi>Concrete,</hi> he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to submit to the Office, commands us to submit to the Man in whom it is, or he commands us nothing. So that this is really no better then prophane trifling with the Word of God, when we are in plain and express terms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make no Resistance to our Governors, to get loose from so useful a Law, by such childish and senseless Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles as plainly contradict the Law it self. For whereas the only design of such Laws is to preserve the Peace of humane Societies, by such evasions as these, all Men are left at liberty to disturb it as they please, notwithstanding all the Laws in the World that ever were, or ever can be made against it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would advise these Men that can cheat and lullaby their own Consciences with such Rattles as these, either to lay aside their Metaphysicks or their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because such niceness and subtilty makes it a thing of no Use in the practice of the World. For if there were no such
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42190:51"/>
Laws at all, Men would be under no greater restraint from the Sin, then they are now by the most effectual Laws, that it is possible for God himself to lay upon them. Men that can use such abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and preva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icating shifts to escape their plain Duty, are arrived either to too great Prophaneness, or too high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm to be admitted to the Rights of common Christianity. They serve their Saviour just as they do their Prince, they obey him <hi>in abstracto,</hi> and Rebell against him <hi>in concreto;</hi> they submit to his Laws when themselves think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, but when they do not, they then cease to be his Laws. This is the unavoidable result of these thin and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious distinctions, that Religion, if Men will, shall be of no use or force in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the World.</p>
               <p>But secondly, this is down-right Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens play, and make all Laws whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ridiculous, when it leaves it to those who are commanded absolute submission, to judge when submission is sit, and when not. Do but once allow that Liberty, and after that all the Laws injoyning this Duty can never command any thing. For after they have commanded all that can be commanded, every Man will be as much at liberty to do what he pleases,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42190:51"/>
as he was be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore, being sole Judge of the fitness of his Subjection. But if he be Judge of that, he is not bound, and if he be bound, he is not Judge, but is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely bound. In our present case, what can the Apostles Command signifie, when he peremptorily and indefinitly requires subjection to the Higher Powers? <hi>i. e.</hi> say these Statesmen to all Powers that govern by Law, and none else. This makes the Subjects the Supreme Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Government, not the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors themselves; for by it, whatever these do or Command, it is of no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then as the Subjects judge it Legal, and if they do not, they are at liberty to Resist and Rebel. And if this be so, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would deserve to be laughed at, for being so serious in enforcing a Law that can never bind, whilst he commands Subjection or Non-resistance to higher Powers, when the Subjects after that, have full Power in themselves to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to what higher Powers they will or will not resist. Such Non-sence lyes at the bottom of all Rebellion; for if Men are at all bound to submit to their Governours, they are bound to submit to all; if not to all, then not to any, because the Power of Resistance is, by this poor Republican Principle, at last wholly left
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42190:52"/>
to their own Judgment, and then they are subject to no Authority but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their own Wills.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, if a King ceases to be the higher Power, or to be a Lawful King, whenever he does not act according to Law, or whenever his Subjects shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend so, how is it possible there should be any settled Government or Society among Mankind; when it is so plainly impossible, but that there must be miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages as long as Kings are Men; and much more misapprehensions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as long as the People are the People? So that the design of these Men that advance such Niceties as these, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently nothing else, then to render all Government an impracticable thing. For what security or settlement can it ever have in the World, when by such lavish Principles as these, Subjects are impowred, nay always Authorised to subvert the present Government? For whatever the present Government is, it will have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects enough; and that which is worse, the fewer it has, the more it will be complained of. For there is never so much noise of Grievances and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as under the kindest and the justest Princes; in such happy times, I know not by what unhappy fate Men run Mad
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42190:52"/>
with Insolence, out of meer Vanity and Wantonness. And it is observable in all Histories, that good Kings have suffered more from the fury of the People then Tyrants and Oppressors. So unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and unruly a Beast is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mankind, that nothing can make them happy; and when they enjoy so great a Blessing as a kind Government, they will destroy both that and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too, only to trample upon its kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But however upon this Principle that Kings may be resisted, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king'd when they are supposed not to govern according to Law, both good and bad must make a daily forfeiture of their Crowns; and there never can be any such thing as Government in the World, unless God himself would be pleased to forsake Heaven, and settle a Visible Throne among us here on Earth. And yet if he should, though he would fall into no miscarriages, he could never escape from the complaints and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings of such Men as these. Their only delight and happiness is to be find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault, and were they in Heaven it self, they would be peevish and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. Good God purge thy Church from such sower Leven as this! that has for so many years fermented all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42190:53"/>
into restless Tumults and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and has at length by its violent and eager rage, work't out the very Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life of Christianity.</p>
               <p>But lastly, this Principle does not only lead to confusion, but is confusion it self, because it takes away the very Being both of Government and Subjection. For if the Subject may resist when the Prince does not govern according to Law, Who is to be Judge of that; if the Prince, he will be sure to judge for himself, and that destroys the Principle that these Men proceed upon: If the People are the Supreme Judges, then they cease to be Subjects, and are made the Sovereign, for wherever the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Judgment resides, there is the Sovereign Power. So that by this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, there is no avoiding the absurdity of setting at the same time the Prince above the People, and the People above the Prince; and so I remember <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> has done in the very Title Page of his Book: <hi>De Principis in Populum, Populi<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> in Principem legitimâ Potestate.</hi> Of the Lawful Power of the Prince over the People, and the People over the Prince. But sure if one be above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the other can have no power over that which is above it, or if they are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42190:53"/>
both endued with the Supremacy of Power, then they are Equals, and Equals have no Power over Equals, for if they have, they are not Equals. There is no way of Reconciling this Reciprocal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Inferiours above Superiours, and Superiours above Inferiours; but his Poets way, who recommending this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy work to his dear Countrey of <hi>France,</hi> he advises her for the Cure of all her present Breaches and Distempers, to keep the Power both of the King and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within due bounds, and then all will be well again.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42190:54"/>
confess I know not how to Answer it, and I doubt no Man will ever attempt its solution. And that is this, if this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be Universal, that it is unlawful to resist Kings in any Case, <hi>Then when King</hi> David <hi>deflowred</hi> Barthsheba, <hi>she might not lawfully have resisted him with Bodily Resistance and Violence, and if she had,</hi> David <hi>might have said to</hi> Barthshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, <hi>because I am the Lords Anointed, it is Rebellion in thee a Subject, to oppose any bodily violence to my act of forcing thee; it is unlawful for thee to cry for help, for if any shall offer violently to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue thee from me, he resisteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God.</hi> One would think that these Men design'd nothing else, then to prophane and ridicule the Scriptures; for how else could it ever have come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Man's head to parallel Rebellious Resistance to the Commands of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, with not yielding to a Rape? If the Man had intended mirth and entertainment by the conceit, it might have pass't for a prophane Jest; but to be grave and serious, nay fierce and eager in such smutty impertinencies, turns the whole matter into down-right folly and dulness. And yet our great <hi>English</hi> Divine <hi>R. B.</hi> has very much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> Thes. 349.</note> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Divine in the Emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42190:54"/>
of the Notion, inferring from hence (as he says) a <hi>fortiori,</hi> that we are much more bound, when unjust and unchast Kings would commit Rapes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Parliaments, to rescue them by force and violence from their Lascivious Attempts. And so it is evident that in the long-Parliament-Rebellion against his late Majesty, they were so far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or intending any harm to the King himself, that they only kept him off from doing violence to the Chastity of the Houses. So easie is it for these sort of Men to find pretences or excuses for Treason, that no similitude can be so light or trivial, but that it shall have weight and sense enough to bear them out in all their enormities. Though I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that of all Men that ever I met with, this holy, this mortified, this daily dying Saint, has exceeded them all in the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of his Principles, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness of his Talk upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for my own part, I cannot think what to make of some Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; for I cannot imagine that Men who pretend to great zeal for Religion, and take mighty pains (as they think) to promote it, who say that they live in a daily expectation of speedy death, and a future Judgment, should be stubborn
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42190:55"/>
and resolute Atheists. And yet I can as little conceive that Men, who are seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the belief of these things, should through the habitual course of their Lives, do such things for the disturbance both of Church and State, as are plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with any sense or design of integrity. I know pride and passion may Transport Men into strange actions, but then those are as great Crimes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as any that they can hurry them into. But that they should carry Men, that mean honestly, into such a constant course of life, as no Charity can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile with any Principles of Integrity, is the thing that I say lies beyond my comprehension.</p>
               <p>Thus in our particular Case of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistance (which is one of the greatest Cases of Conscience in the World) thô there is not, nor cannot be a clearer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in all the Bible, then this of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, against all manner of Resistance to Sovereign Princes; yet has this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Man so stated the bounds of due Obedience, and lawful Resistance from its Authority, as in the result of all, not only to evacuate all its Obligation, but to make it the very Warranty from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of all Popular Rebellions. Thus he tells us plainly, that all resistance is not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42190:55"/>
here forbidden (though the Apostle says in express terms, that whoever resists shall be damn'd, and that I think is all Resistance) <hi>For there is a Resistance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Subjection, and that is forbidden: And there is a Resistance not contrary to Subjection, and that is not forbidden.</hi> Now he that can Reconcile Resistance and Subjection together, may at the same time be a Rebel and a good Subject, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has stated it. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving distinguisht between Resistance lawful and unlawful, he makes it lawful in so many Cases, and unlawful in so few, as makes it so in all. Thus <hi>Thes.</hi> 340, he says, <hi>That if a Prince Command his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects beyond his Limits, resistance in such a case is not to resist the Power, but the Will of a private Man.</hi> The very same Assertion with <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s, that if he govern according to Law, we are bound to submit, but if he exceed those bounds, that the Law has left him, then Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Rebellion are no sins. Such a wilful blindness is it in these Men, that, that they cannot see the middle way of subjection that lies between Obedience and Resistance; for when I cannot Obey, I can and ought to Submit, but Resist I cannot without Rebellion. And that is the Subjects Duty in all unlawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42190:56"/>
though he cannot obey, he can be quiet and peaceable, nay he can do any thing to remove or redress the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but resist the Government. When a Kingdom is blest with good Laws, it concerns Subjects to be tender of their Preservation by all fair and regular means; but if they once Rebel against their Prince in defence of their Laws, they lose both, by the Dissolution of the Government; for when that is gone, and it is certain that all Rebellion aims at its destruction, the Laws lye dead, and can do them no Service. And therefore there is no one Law so beneficial to the Subject, as the Fundamental Law of Sovereignty, that it is irresistible; the security of the publick Government is the last security of every Man's Liberty and Property. But if it be once invaded, we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in a state of War, and then no Man can have any thing that he can call his own. But of that when I come to discourse of the Reason, and the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Non-resistance; here it is enough to observe that these Men are so perverse as to acknowledge no middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween actual Obedience and actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; whereas the peculiar design of these Precepts is to fix our duty, when we cannot obey, in Submission or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restance.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42190:56"/>
But here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has a subtle Notion that will baer out his Innocence, though he wade up to the Knees in Blood, and to the Elbows in Rebellion; and that is, <hi>That not obeying is the first and chiefest resisting,</hi> and therefore if one be Lawful, so is the other, and then when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we cannot Lawfully Obey, we may Lawfully Resist. An admirable Notion this! to set all the World on fire, to make no difference between meer Non-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and cutting of Throats, for that I take it is making some kind of Resistance, yet by Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Principle, bare not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more so, being <hi>The first and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est act of Resistance.</hi> What cannot these Men break their Consciences to, that can out of the duty of Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence infer the Obligation, or at least the Lawfulness of actual Resistance, because forsooth Passive Obedience is the first and chiefest act of actual Resistance. I pray God deliver his Church from such Apostate Divines, and his Anointed from such Rebel Subjects. But now are we come to the very Fort-Royal of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Rebellion, <hi>Thesis</hi> 352. If a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that is, as he all along explains himself, its representative Body) wrong their King, it is not Lawful for him to right himself by War, because it is against
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42190:57"/>
the Common Good, of which the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives are the only Judges, by <hi>Thesis</hi> 356, 357, 358, 367. That is to say, that supposing the Parliament of Forty One had offer'd the King all those Injuries and Indignities, that he so justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of; yet when he went about to recover and assert his Soveraignty by force of Arms, it was fighting against the Common Good, and Representative Body of a Nation, in which all Men are bound to Resist him, because they are all bound by nature to defend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good. How helpless and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the condition of poor Princes, when they are wrong'd they may not defend themselves, whilst their Subjects may not only take away their Swords, but tye their Hands, and if they please to disable them forever, cut them off too for the Common Good. This is Fourty One true blew, and I think a cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. But what has a King no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? No, none at all against the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative Body of a Nation. Methinks he might Dissolve them.

Let them take it for a warning, if he should serve them such a slippery trick, the hurt will be all their own, but not an Atom of injury to himself.

                     </gap> which he made, and I will offer my head to Justice as a Rebel.</hi> But this is to piece out one wickedness with another, not only to rebel against the King, but to Depose him. Had he fought for the King against the Parliament, he had deserved to be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42190:59"/>
hang'd for a Rebel, and had violated that Command of God, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the danger of that Condemnation that is there threatned to Resisters: Had been guilty of Treason and Disloyalty against the Sovereign Power of the Land, and had been a Traytor, and guilty of resisting the higher Powers. From all which it is undeniably plain, that not the King, but the Parliament are the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and Supreme Power. Which is such a contradiction to the fundamental Constitution of the <hi>English</hi> Government, to all the known Laws of the Kingdom, to so many reiterated Acts and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Parliaments from time to time, that as bold an affront as it is to the Law of God, it is a more impudent out-sacing the Law of the Land; so that it seems there is no other way of justifying that Rebellion, then by perverting and bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both. And if Men can allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves such Liberties as these, I know nothing that can keep them in any due subjection to the higher Powers, that can dispose of the Supremacy by their own Arbitrary Will and Pleasure: For where the Sovereignty of this Kingdom resides, is a thing so easily and vulgarly known, that to search it out requires no deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42190:59"/>
either into the Laws of the Land, or the Nature of Government. The Oath of Supremacy is so full a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it, that no Man, whoever took it, can after that, deny the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power to reside in the King alone without Perjury <hi>[That the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the only Supreme Governour of this Realm.]</hi> For if he be the only Supreme, there is no other Supreme, much less Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. I do not argue from the bare Title of Supreme Governor, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 363.</note> because that, say the Presbyterians, may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary, though others may share in the Power; but from its being appropriated to the King alone. For we do not only swear that he is the Supreme Governor, but that he is the only Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and then we swear that neither the Parliament nor any other State of Men, whatever share they have in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the Supreme Governors.</p>
               <p>I shall not dispute with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any Man of the Principles of Fourty One, of the Power of Parliaments, for be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great, yet unless the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy be meer Perjury, I am sure it is not Superiour nor Equal to the King's, when by it he alone has the Supremacy, and then to resist him by their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is Rebellion by the Law of the Land,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42190:60"/>
and Damnation by the Law of God. So impossible is it to tye Men to any Sense of Duty, that can allow themselves such an unconscionable liberty of perverting and falsifying Laws; and if this be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with any tenderness of Conscience, or any Pretences to Integrity, there can never be any such thing as Truth or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty in the World. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> declares that he is very desirous to Repent, if he have sinned, that he daily prays to God that he would not suffer him to dye impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently in his Sin, and promises that if he could but be convinced of it, he would make publick Recantation. I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is serious in his Protestation, and hope to live to see it perform'd, and that is my only design here to convince him (if that be possible) before it is too late. I intend not to upbraid him, or others with old Miscarriages, or to revive old Stories long since buried in Oblivion. For when his Majesty has been pleased in his great goodness to pardon them as to all the Punishments of this life, God forbid but that they should enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Mercy and Clemency. But I call upon them to think of Repentance out of pure tenderness and compassion to their Souls. For God never pardons Absolutely, but always upon Conditions,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42190:60"/>
and with him, nothing less will expiate a publick Crime then a publick Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And therefore I hope to see Mr. <hi>B.</hi> before he go hence, to make good his promise of making his publick Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and remove that scandal that he has given to the Church of God by so foul a <hi>Mistake</hi> (as he calls it) and I hope it was no worse. Though I fear when this is done, he may find new matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for slandering, and traducing the whole Church of God, and for that end perverting, and false representing all its Records, as he has done in some late Books, especially his Treatise of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and his History of the Councils, that are so full not only of falsification, but rank malice against all the Ancient Governours of the Christian Church (against whom he could have no other ground of quarrel then only this, that they were Bishops) that it is such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest disclaiming of all Truth and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as no pride or passion can excuse; and those two great faults are the only Pleas that can be made to extenuate the rankness of his malice. But here are such numberless heaps of meer falshoods and spiteful insinuations, as could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from nothing better then wilful dishonesty, unless this may be pleaded
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42190:61"/>
in his behalf, <hi>viz.</hi> his gross ignorance of the things that he writes of, and that in good earnest is the best and truest Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for him, for it is evident from his crude way of writing, that none but a very Novice in Antiquity, and an utter stranger to the true Records of the Church, could ever have betrayed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to so unlearned a Performance. There is not any one Story in which he has not committed gross mistakes, and such as discover themselves to proceed from nothing but his unacquaintedness with the Primitive Records. And any one that can but Translate any of the Modern Collections of the Ancient Councils with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking into the Original Acts and Histories, (without which no Man can arrive to any competent knowledge in this learning) may make just such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church-Historian as <hi>R. B.</hi> And therefore I would advise him, instead of boasting himself Father of Fourscore Books and upwards, to have some pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and take some pains, to write one well-weighed, well-digested, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reviewed, before he publish it. And if his heat could but be prevail'd with to submit to so much tameness, one such discourse would outweigh, not only Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score, but four hundred Books of Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42190:61"/>
I have insisted thus long upon this Apostolical Precept, because it is the most effectual Bulwark against Rebellion, and therefore most abused by the <hi>Hildebran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinists,</hi> who would elude its Obligation by the several fore-mentioned shifts to evacuate the Sense of the Law it self. But now to proceed, with the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> agreeable is that of the other great Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist. Chap. 2. from vers. 13th to 25th. Where the same duty is laid down fully in the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and comprehensive Terms, and with the same regard of duty to God, it must be done <hi>For the Lord's sake,</hi> and that is the biggest thing that can be said in this or any other Case, that Almighty God requires it forever, and as Men will own his own Authority as an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Duty, and this for all the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons alledged by the other Apostle, and some more. Not only because their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is from God, and because the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution it self is for the general Good of Mankind; and because the great Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World commands Subjection to them as his Vice-Roys, under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest Penalties both here and hereafter, but beside all this it is made necessary, because it is for the honour of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that by a meek and peaceable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42190:62"/>
to the most unjust sufferings, after their great Master's Example, they should prevent, and silence those Calumnies of his and their Enemies, as if they were distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Government; so that if they did not submit with all meekness and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Superiors of what rank so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, down from Kings to Masters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, whether good or bad, it would have been a just scandal to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But to this Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and seriously replies, <hi>That patient suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Q. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>and violent resisting, are not incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.</hi> That is to say, that a Man may Resist in his own defence, but if he have the ill-fortune to be overcome, he must then suffer patiently. This Patience <hi>per force</hi> I see is the right Presbyterian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; when their Superiours are too strong for them, they will crouch only because they must. But as long as they are able, Princes must pardon them if they defend themselves by force of Arms, though if they cannot, they will be so civil as to lay them down. And of the same kind is the Submission of Servants to harsh and cruel Masters, when they are beaten, to defend themselves with the next Cudgel that they can seize on, but if the Master prove the more able Fencer,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42190:62"/>
then the Servant when he has lost his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive Weapon, has no remedy left but to lye down and suffer himself to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten patiently, and this Patience of a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Slave is their only true Christian Subjection; though as the Proverb goes, It is a Vertue more suited to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of an Horse, then the Religion of a Man. And if this be all that is injoin'd by the Apostle, it is nothing at all, for when we are commanded to suffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, or not to resist, only when we cannot help our selves; it is a very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less command, because so we must do, whether we will or no, and Patience <hi>per force</hi> is no Patience at all.</p>
               <p>But beside this dull shift, we have a more acute Evasion to elude the Text, That these words were not address'd to Subjects that had the rights of their own Country, but to Strangers residing and inhabiting in such places, where they could challenge no greater rights then meerly of Courtesie and Civility. But though this is not so dull as the <hi>Scotch</hi> resistance, to yield when we can fight no longer, it is but another way of fooling against the express Sense of the Words themselves. For to say nothing of the distinction between Native Subjects and Strangers, between whom there can be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42190:63"/>
no difference as to this Duty, then that it is stricter upon the natural Subject then the Foreigner. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s reason, as it makes no difference in the Point, so it admits none, because it is universal and unlimited, <hi>viz.</hi> from the peremptory Command of God, that requires submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Kings and all their Subordinate Officers, and upon this reason it concerns all alike. And after that to let Subjects loose from the duty of Non-resistance to their Prince, because the Law was here particularly directed to such as were Aliens, though built upon, and enforced by a reason common to all Men, shews, if not the prophaneness of the Men, the badness of their Cause. Though after all, the Observation is as false, as 'tis tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, when it is so vulgarly known, that the dispersed Jews were for the most part made Denisons of those Cities where they inhabited; and there were very few that were not, as well as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> free of some City or other. And then these Jews or most of them, to whom this Epistle was written, were as proper Subjects to the Government, under which they lived, as if they had been Natives of the Province. Certainly Men must be arrived to a very slight regard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own Consciences, that dare
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42190:63"/>
shuffle away the Obligation of such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and Sacred Laws of God himself, with so much violence to their own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings. For it was impossible that Men of Common Sense, much less of Learning and Acuteness, could satisfie themselves with such trifling pretences. But so it ever was, and so it ever will be, that as certain as Religion is at the top of all Rebellion, Atheism and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is at the Bottom.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
               <head>§. VII.</head>
               <p>But to what purpose do I take all this pains to prove the Duty of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistance from the Laws of God, the Obligations of Conscience, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christianity, when that only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the <hi>Hildebrandists</hi> of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Apostacy from the Christian Faith? For what care they for that? Religion is the least of their thought or concernment; and though they make it the flourish to all their pretences, it is not for any kindness to that, but only to amuse the Common People, and dazle them (as Men catch Larks with Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glasses) into their Party, both against themselves and their Governours. And it is evident that the Patriots and Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of Faction have no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Conscience in the Case, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42190:64"/>
interest, reason of State, and the good of the Common-wealth. And here they applaud and admire themselves with one busie and plausible pretence, that this Doctrine of absolute Submission pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a natural dulness, and want of that Sense, that all Men of wit and courage ought to have of their Native Liberty, and serves no End but only the encouragement of Tyranny, inviting Princes that are of themselves ill-inclin'd, to insult over our Tameness, and how much soever they trample upon us, and our Liberties, they know we must not only endure all, but like Spaniels resent it well. Now though a wise Man would not refuse Subjection to a good natur'd or a generous Prince, yet what Man of any Spirit, can with any patience see a whole Kingdom enslaved to the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or the folly, or the luxury of one Man? That (say they) is not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Government, for that always takes care of the Publick Good, but instead of that, it betrays the Common-wealth to Tyranny and Arbitrary Oppression.</p>
               <p>Now to give the utmost that these Pretenders to Politicks and Innovation can alledge, not only to justifie, but to admire themselves, and the wisdom of their Proceedings, I will freely grant that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42190:64"/>
it may, and often does fall out, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be weak or wicked, or negligent, unskilful and unfaithful in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they may injure Multitudes of Private Persons, and neglect the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; that their Follies and Vices may endanger a whole Nation; and that the case is somewhat hard, that all the good People in it must be bound in Duty and Conscience, to assist and uphold that Power with Lives and Fortunes, that is nothing but Load and Oppression. This indeed is an hard case, and an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that must sometimes (though but rarely) be felt by being under, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But alas! there are many more hard cases in the World, and much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier inconveniences if we cast it off. So that setting aside all regard to Duty, and consulting only Interest, and though we care not to be honest, yet if we will be but a little wise, and take a true account of our own quiet and security, let these shrewd Men of Politicks, only consider, whether it will not be more easie to bear this heavy Burthen, then to cast it off with Violence to the Government; and whether by removing one present incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, we do not run our selves into more, greater and more lasting. That is the only point of Wisdom and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42190:65"/>
in this case, whether submission to the worst Government be not more easie to the Subject, then War and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. And this I think will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any Man of Common Sence if we only consider what we lose, and what we gain by it. First we lose our own safety, and all that we gain, is that loss<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For all Government is the first security of every Man's private Interest against the Injuries and Violences of all other Men, and that will make it highly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beneficial at all times, though never so ill administred. For were it not for fear of Authority, every Man would be exposed a Prey to all Men, and all Mankind would unavoidably fall into a State of War, then which State, nothing can be more defenceless and deplorable, and yet nothing but Government pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves us from it. So that when we shake off our Duty and Submission to that, we put our selves and our Families, out of all security against the Violence of all the World beside. And therefore it was both a wise and a witty custom that <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Empiricus</hi> reports to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adv. Math. l.</hi> 2.</note> the old <hi>Persians,</hi> that the People upon the death of any of their Kings were allowed five days Anarchy, that by the Mischiefs, Slaughters, Rapines, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42190:65"/>
committed in that short Interval, they might be convinced of the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Necessity of Government, and set the greater esteem upon the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince. And if Men would but consider the great Usefulness of the worst Government, that it is a defence and protection of their own private Interests against the Invasions of wicked Men; that would soon prevail with them to bear all the inconveniencies of a bad Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, rather then blow up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and Fortunes together with it. For whosoever resists the Government, does what in him lies to destroy it, and when that is done, he has not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd, but certainly lost his own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. So great a gainer is every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that will take upon him to reform the Government by force, that he pulls up the very Fence, by which his own Inclosure and Propriety is secured. Nay though himself may be so wise as to sit down patiently under an oppressive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet if he do but encourage this Doctrine of the Lawfulness of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to Princes, he exposes himself, as well as the Government to all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualts of Usurpers. For if it be Lawful for other Subjects, though they think it not wise for themselves, to take up Arms
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42190:66"/>
against the Prince, his Authority is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made too weak and ineffectual to be their Protection; they are exposed to the dangers of War, and lye wholly at last at the mercy of a Conquering Army, and that is the Result of all the Pleas for Resistance upon any pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that they all conclude in Anarchy and Confusion. And if we will but take the Experience of our own, or other Ages, the case will be plain from that too, as well as common Sence, That Resistance to Authority, if it were never so Lawful, is such a Remedy as never bears its own Charges; and that no Nation ever made use of it, that did not rue its own folly. The Vices of a single Person are finite, and reach but to particular cases, the most bloody Tyrant that ever was, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cut off any great Numbers; and it is truly observed by <hi>Cardan</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> that as wanton as he was with the Lives of Men, in a very few Months after his death, there was abundantly more blood spilt, then in all his fourteen years Reign. The miseries of War are endless and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and whatever the event is, or whoever wins, the Common-wealth is sure to be a loser, and to pay a severe reckoning on all sides. Some few of the scum of the People, may by the strength
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42190:66"/>
of their brawny Arms signalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Clowns of Eminance, whilst the Ancient Gentry and Nobility endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all their Fortunes, and great numbers even of the first beginners of disturbance lose their Lives, and in short the whole Kingdom must be undone for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a <hi>Cromwel,</hi> a <hi>Pride,</hi> an <hi>Hewson,</hi> or a <hi>Desborough,</hi> and it rarely happens (and it is pity but it should be so) but that the first Contrivers are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached in their own Designs, and baulkt by other Men, and other Councils, and live to lament their own folly in much more good earnest, then they did the grievances or miscarriages of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But when the dispute is once raised, it is not to be determin'd but by the Sword, and wherever success attends, that Nation is in a sweet condition, when a Conquering Army comes with Swords drawn to rate the Merits of their past Services, and challenge rewards equal to their present Insolence, and that is to take whatever they are pleased to demand; and it is a kindness in them not easily to be expected if they will stop at any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. At least it is certain, That which side soever is Victor, the generality of a Nation never reap any thing by a War, then Repentance, and a little Wisdom
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42190:67"/>
got by dear bought Experience. But not to mention a thousand other great, publick and lasting Calamities, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follow Resistance and Rebellion, the certain miseries of Civil War it self, infinitely outweigh all the Burthens that the greatest Tyranny can lay upon the Subject. What a long Succession of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled Tyrants must have Reign'd in <hi>England,</hi> before they could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so many inhumanities, as a few years Civil War for the Liberty of the Subject brought upon it? What one mortal Man's Salvageness could ever have spilt half so much Blood, as was shed in any one eminent Battel? Let therefore the Patriots of Sedition cease to upbraid Loyalty with weakness of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, when all Men of common Sense, or any Experience in the Affairs of the World, cannot but see through the delusion of fighting for their Liberties against their Prince, by which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and for the most part lose both, and at least certainly bring themselves into greater Slavery, then they could have suffered, had they been patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the worst of Governments. And this brings to my mind another instance of the wisdom of Submission, and that is this, that as no wise Man that takes a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42190:67"/>
thorough account of his own interest, would care to draw himself into a War against his Prince, so it is generally Men of the meanest understandings that are seduced by them. And they are drawn in by such poor slights and delusions, that plainly shew the contempt that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots have of their shallow reach, and the bottom of all their Politiques is, to inveagle the common People into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that in all contests with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it is only their interest that is concerned, and as for themselves, were it not to assert their Liberties, they would never undergo the frowns of the Court, never expose themselves to the hazards of War, nor venture their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for any thing less then the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Country. And all this while the poor People must be supposed so dull (and so they are) as not to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that there is any such thing as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Ambition and Discontent in the World, and yet it is these that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the great Patrons of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. And though their Seditious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices are known, and thread-bare, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten discovered as used, and a thousand times over and over exposed, yet because the common People have not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to know, or make use of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42190:68"/>
of former Ages, they are in every Age as ready a Prey for the Snare, as if it had never been set before. So that omitting divers other good reasons that might be urged against all kind of Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and particularly that one, That if it be once allowed the common People in any case, there is no stop of pretences, or end of confusions. And if Princes may, and do abuse their Power, it is much more certain that the Rabble cannot use theirs aright: And therefore to prevent the vast inconvenience of their ever abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it, it must be stopt at first, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserve, else the mischiefs that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if it be admitted at all, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>I know indeed, that learned Men sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some Extravagant cases in which they will allow Resistance to be Lawful, <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Winzet</hi> suppose two, <hi>viz.</hi>

Perhaps the thing may be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in Nature, but it is so infinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that it ought not to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the practice of the World: Least by supposing such an unexampled mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we let Men loose from their Duty in all other Cases; for that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice of all Incendiaries, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the People that their present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors take the course to destroy the Common-wealth. So that by this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these two Extravagancies, these Learned Men utterly defeat their own Design, because these are the very Cases that are pretended in all Rebellions, and may be applyed to all Cases, as Men please to make use of their assistance. Thus when <hi>Barclay</hi> argues, <q>That if the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note> Power of calling Sovereign Princes to account for their Government, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the People or their Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, it would be as destructive of good as of bad Princes, as we may see by the insolent deportment of the <hi>Ephori</hi> against their Kings, whom they chastised not only for their greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, but for their mistakes or fancies; thus as <hi>Plutarch</hi> Records in the Life of <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> they punisht King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamus</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:42190:69"/>
for chusing a little Woman to Wife. If therefore this were the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kings to be liable to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People, they would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exposed to numberless Affronts, Reproaches, and Calumnies. And that would be ever enough for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, only that they did not please the People, though they fell into their displeasure not by any fault of their own, but by the procurement of some ambitious Incendiary. And this would be so much the more dangerous to good, then to bad Princes, because ill Men, are more apt to assault good Men, then they them. And nothing is more difficult, then for a Prince to manage things with that wisdom and happy success, as not to incur the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of some Parties, of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. If he defend and relieve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty from the Oppressions of the great ones, he makes the Nobility his Enemies, as <hi>James</hi> the Fifth of <hi>Scotland</hi> did, whom they therefore Nick-named <hi>The Carlis King,</hi> i. e. <hi>The King of the Clowns.</hi> If he favour and advance the Nobility, and they any way oppress or disgust the Commons, it will drive them into Tumults, and though at first they may be despised as a cowardly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42190:69"/>
and silly Rout, whilst they want a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; yet when they are headed by any bold Captain, there is nothing more daring or more dangerous, for casting off all fears and restraints, they will mount out of the lowest Servitude to the top of Pride and Insolence, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if any of the Nobility join with them, and it rarely happens in such cafes, but that the People draw in the Nobles, or the Nobles the People. And yet there is but one pretence for all Rebellions, the fault of the Governor; and but one design, and that is to save the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth from destruction. And this will put it into the Power of all Rebels, who pretend that they are forced to take up Arms against their Prince for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety (for all Rebels hide their wickedness under that Veil) and if need be for the same reason Depose him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which discourse, as effectual as it is, is clearly defeated, and a Gap opened to all the liberty that Rebels challenge by his allowing the Lawfulness of resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>When the Prince goes about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Common-wealth,</hi> when by his own observation it is the standing Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and only Pretence of all Rebellions. And the truth of it is, if it be once gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42190:70"/>
in any one case, it may be made as wide as Mens conveniences require.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> has extended it to Seven or Eight Cases more, <hi>i. e.</hi> As many as <note place="margin">

And so has Mr. <hi>B.</hi> from this very concession of <hi>Barclay,</hi> justified <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth p.</hi> 466.</note> the Rebellion against his late Majesty, by recapitulating the many misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and illegal Acts of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or rather Transcribing the long Parliaments Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdom; in which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the People the great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest danger of the utter Subversion of our Religion, our Laws, our Liberties, and the Common-wealth it self, under the King's Government: And thus we see that by allowing resistance to the worst of Kings in any one case, it will serve for a plausible and effectual pretence for Rebellion against the best of Kings in all Cases. And therefore it is more for the benefit of Manking to have this liberty denyed even in those rare and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Cases, then by granting it in any to make a pretence for all Rebellions: And if ever there should be a Prince so strangely beside himself, as to set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to destroy his own Kingdom, there
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42190:70"/>
would be no danger of him, and he would be so unlikely to effect it, that he would first need to be chain'd up for other acts of madness, before he could entertain such raving thoughts: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it would be much less mischievous to the World, that such a Bedlam Prince should rather be suffer'd to destroy the Common-wealth without resistance from his Subjects, because it is so rarely done, then that his Subjects should be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to rebel against him under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, because it is so frequently done; a thousand times for once: And for this reason is it, that God Almighty has made universal Subjection such an indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duty, because however the World goes, peace is at all times most beneficial for the good of Mankind, and that is the end of all his Laws. And its universal obligation is so evident, upon supposition that Government is of Divine Institution, that <hi>Grotius</hi> has no other way to escape from the Argument, but by making it a meer humane Invention. Which is to suppose that all Men in the World were once out of Government, and that is to suppose them both uncreated and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, as I shall prove when I come to discourse of the Original of Government. But at present, granting all Government
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42190:71"/>
to be an Artificial invention of Men, yet it was first contrived for the common se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and therefore it is always as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to keep it up, as it was at first to set it up; for if it be at any time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, we are in the same state of War and Confusion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we agreed to submit our selves to it; and therefore for the same reason that we first entred into it, are we obliged to preserve its Rights inviolable, lest by breaking the present settlement, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selves to all those inconveniences of life, that we design'd to avoid by its first Institution. So that in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all, whether Government were first instituted by God or Man, it is agreed on all sides, that it is necessary to Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Society to the comfort of every Man's life; so that to baulk or oppose the Government, is to destroy the Society, and to destroy that, is to destroy every Man's own Propriety; and after that, all other pretences, how big soever, are too light to be put into the Balance against so weighty a Consideration. This that I have here in brief represented, is enough to convince any Man, that Submission to a lawful Government, how ill soever managed, cannot be more our Duty, then it is our Wisdom and Interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42190:71"/>
And therefore that it is not want of a good understanding or a manly sense of things to bear Oppression, but the Effect of true Prudence, and a thorough insight into the consequences of things. And I have here dropt in this brief account of the folly of all resistance against a legal and setled Government, only as a present check to the petulancy of Sedition. For be the pretences in any case never so strong and plausible, they can never stand before the force and the light of this one Consideration, That how great, and how many mischiefs soever Resistance may think to remove; it certainly creates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, and those much heavier, and rarely ends in any thing than universal destruction. But this Argument I shall (by Gods assistance) prosecute more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when I come to shew the Grounds and Reasons upon which this Duty of Universal Subjection is founded, and these I shall demonstrate from the Use, the Nature, and the Original of Government, that cannot subsist but upon its supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And then I shall take an account of all the republican and antimonarchical Principles, and shew that all their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses concerning Government first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the Common-wealths-men of <hi>Greece,</hi> stand upon no firmer bottom
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42190:72"/>
than meer fable and poetry, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that their fundamental Principle, of deriving all Government from the People, is built upon no wiser supposition then this, That the World was once peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with Men and Women, that sprung out of the Earth, both without a Creatour and without Parents. And then in the last place shew, that the <hi>Hildebrandinists</hi> of all Sects; <hi>Bellarmine, Suarez, Mariana, Lessius, Becanus, Boucherius</hi> and others on the Papal side: <hi>Buchanan, Junius Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Rutherford,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and other of the Presbyterian side, all agree in this one Principle of deriving the Government from the People, and make it the last pretence of all their pleas for resistance upon what account soever. In the mean time I proceed upon the Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">

               <p>That is the second advantage, that the Christian Religion brings along with it for the security of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> the many Laws that it has injoyn'd to bind Subjects to an entire and absolute subjection. The third is this, That those that are entrusted with highest Authority in the Church, are most severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden to challenge to themselves any temporal power or dominion, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42190:72"/>
strictly commanded to exercise their own jurisdiction with all manner of meekness and humility, towards their Inferiours, and an exemplary submission to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours. And this is a new Tye upon them beside all the former obligations from the nature of Christianity, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross, the Precepts of our Saviour and his Apostles in common to them, with all other Christians, to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and unreserved subjection. Thus when our Saviour had constituted the Apostles supreme Governours in his Church, he beats them all off from all Thoughts of worldly pride and ambition; and instructs them to exercise their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though it were so very great, with that complyance and condescention, as if they had in reality none at all. For all our Saviour's Precepts to his Apostles to avoid domination, relate wholly to the manner of exercising their Authority; and not to the Authority it self, as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Christian Church would force them to imply. For that the Apostles were vested with true and proper Power, is evident both from their Office (all the Acts whereof we have shewn to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative) and from our Saviour's own immediate Grant, in which he expressly declares, That he leaves to them and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42190:73"/>
their Successours the same Power, that himself had received from his Father. So that if he had any real Authority at all, so had they too; and if they had none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he. And therefore those several Texts, that are usually alledged to take away the Power of the Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of any thing but the manner of its exercise, without any pride or haughtiness, and with all manner of gentleness and condescention to those that were under their Authority. And if we take an Account of the particular passages themselves, they will force us to take them in this sense and no other. Thus when they were contending among themselves, our Saviour calls them to him, and tells them, <hi>The Princes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise Authority upon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>them, but it shall not be so among you: But whosoever will be great among you, let him be your Minister; and whosoever will be chief [or Ruler] among you, let him be your Servant, even as the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister.</hi> Which words though they are alledged by <hi>Grotius</hi> in the Book of his Youth, <hi>de Imperio,</hi> against all manner of Authority in the Church beside that of perswasion, which is none at all: Yet in his Notes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42190:73"/>
upon the Gospels, he clearly shews the Vanity and the Falsehood of that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. And no wonder, when it is done so expressly by the Words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in which our Saviour shews his Apostles, how they may observe this Rule by following his Example, Now it is plain (says he) that it cannot be said of him that he had no Authority, when he says of himself that he had all Power in Heaven and Earth, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refer to the Being of Authority it self, but to its kind and the manner of using it. That as he notwithstanding the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Dignity, behaved himself rather like a Servant than a Lord, and instead of imperious commanding his Subjects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to the lowest Offices towards them, thereby to endear them to himself and the gentleness of his Government, so should all Pastours and Governours in the Christian Church, not insult and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over their Flocks, not govern them with an arbitrary Power, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Benefactours:</hi> But to treat them with all gentleness, and to be so far from using them like Slaves, that they should rather behave themselves to them like Servants, <hi>i. e.</hi> in short, to mix nothing of Arrogance with their Authority. And that truly becomes the Person and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Christian Prelate (as St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> paraphrases upon it) to be affable and courteous, to be kind and gentle, to be familiar and condescending to the meanest Persons; this gains him respect with all Men, and makes his Authority much greater then it would be without it, Men will much more readily obey a Superiour, that obliges more then he commands. Whereas on the contrary (says he) if a Bishop be proud and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or if rough and peevish, or if when he ought to reprove he scold and braul, or if when he should command, he huffs or domineers; or if he affect to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to his Inferiours, and shew the greatness of his Power, by nothing else then being pert and vexatious, he justly exposes himself to the contempt of all Men, loses the respect due to his Person, and the Reverence due to his Place. Nothing so odious or despicable as a Clown in any Authority, but in Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it is so offensive, that the indignity
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42190:75"/>
of it is not to be express't, it is so wide a contradiction to the Place and Office. Now the sense of this Text being thus stated, as it is by this Eloquent Father, it fixes the meaning of all the rest; thus when St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Pastors not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. c. 5. v. 3.</note> to Lord it over God's heritage (where it is all one whether it relate to the whole Flock, or only the subordinate Clergy) it is the very same word which is used by our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to correct and moderate the general Law when it is applyed to particular Cases. And all good Government is ever more merciful then the Law ought to be, for that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too severe to deter Men from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, so that there are not many cases in which it is broken, wherein the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not require some mercy and compassion. But as this Vertue is so highly commendable in all Government, so is it much more in that of the Church, in which Almighty God shews more of it in himself towards Mankind, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel being nothing but a dispensation of his Mercy and Gentleness to Offenders. And as this is a necessary Qualification in the Governors of the Church for gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and rectifying their publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so is it most becoming their private Conversation, and by gaining Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to their Persons, doubles that of their Office. So that when our Saviour instructs his Apostles in this new way to Greatness, his instructions are wise in a literal Sense, for nothing is really so great and commanding in the World as true Humility. <hi>Whoever will be great among you, let him be your Minister, and whoever will be first among you, let him be your
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42190:77"/>
Servant,</hi> Matth. 21. 26. <hi>If any one desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and Servant of all,</hi> Mark 9. 35. <hi>He that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himself, shall be abased; and he that will abase himself, shall be exalted,</hi> Math. 23. 12. The common experience of the World sufficiently attests the Truth and the Wisdom of these Propositions, so Powerful is the obligation of Courtesie, Condescention, and Humility. But if the Governors of the Church are so strictly injoin'd this Vertue, where they have Authority, how much more are they, where they have none? If they may not contend with one another for Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though they have equal Power, how much less with Sovereign Princes, of whose Power they have no share, and to whom they are bound to a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and exemplary Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission then other Subjects, by their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Power. So that our Saviour has taken all possible care, as far as Law can do it, to reduce the Constitution of his Church to an entire compliance with the Civil Government. And though he has instituted a distinct Government in it, suited to the design of his Religion, he has so many ways brought it into Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Sovereign Powers, that they are much more disabled by their very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42190:77"/>
to give them any disturbance, then they could have been without it; the very Authority it self being a new and distinct Obligation to a stricter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. But because notwithstanding all this Evidence some Men are jealous of granting any Authority to the Church peculiar to it self, especially when all Power is so apt to degenerate into abuse; and therefore though they cannot deny the truth of it in general, are very shy of admitting it at all, lest they give it too much advantage sometime or other to fix and strengthen an interest within it self, against the State (And I must confess the prophane boldness of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever since the <hi>Hildebran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> Apostacy, in justling and contesting with Princes, as the Vicars of Christ, has given too much ground for this Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) I shall from this general state of the Christian Law, as fixt by our Saviour and his Apostles, proceed to its particular Precedents, when it came to be reduced to practice in the Primitive Church. Whereby I shall make it to appear, after and beside all these foregoing considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to forestal all pretences whatsoever, of resistance to the Civil State, that thô this, because all Power is so, may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to abuse, yet that there is not any

               <p>And on the other side, the advantages that accrue to the State by receiving the Church into its protection, are so great, so certain, and so universal, that there cannot be a grosser faileur in Policy, then to refuse or deny it. And here I say for our better direction, as every where else, we must advise with the practice of the Primitive Church, where we shall find the whole matter so fairly and so easily accorded, that it is next to a miracle how it should ever be made so great a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in these later times. But it hapned in this, as it did in most other things at the time of the Reformation, that men saw themselves wrapt up, they knew not how, in woful Errours and Corruptions, but did not, and indeed as the World
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42190:78"/>
then stood, could not immediately disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the true original state of the Church, as it was at first setled by our Saviour and his Apostles, and received into protection by <hi>Constantine</hi> and the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. So that though they had Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight enough (and God knows very little would serve their turn) to discern the follies and abuses of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were at a loss how to fix the right Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for want of the ancient Records of the Church, that lay buried in dust and rubbish at that time, could make but slow improvements in it. So that before the true state of the Church could be clearly and fully discover'd, most of them were setled in some way or other, and after any new settlement, it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to make any Alteration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they continue in their first posture to this day. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the very first Attempt, resolving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it self by the Example of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and having the good fortune to retain the Apostolical form of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government in subordination to the Royal Power, set it self in a right way to Reformation. And so as the state of things came to light by degrees, brought its work to some competent Perfection. For the Reformation of the Church after
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42190:79"/>
such an inveterate degeneracy, must needs be a work of so great bulk and difficulty, that it is an unreasonable thing to expect that it should be finisht at the first stroke. So great a design as that must be a work of time and consideration, to be reviewed and amended as the Master-Workmen shall find most convenient. So as that they, who had a Power first to begin it, have an inherent right, when ever they think fit to take an account of their own Work, and if they find any flaws, mistakes, or defects in it, to make them up by an after-care. So that there must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Power residing in the Church to enact or abolish Laws, as it judges most serviceable to the present state of things. And that is truly and properly the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Governours of it acting under the Allowance of the Sovereign Power by its establisht Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, with a constant power residing in themselves, and their Successours, to enact new Laws as they shall judge most beneficial to the Edification of the Church. And it is a very crude notion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as common as it is) that it is to be found in its Canons, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Constitutions, for that is only the Law and dead rule of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the Church properly so
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42190:79"/>
call'd consists in its living Authority, as setled by our Saviour, by which these Laws were at first enacted, and are or ought to be still executed, and may in some cases be alter'd. And that is the great difference between the Law and the Authority of the Church, that one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, and the other is not. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church may make new Laws and cancel old ones, but that lasts the same for ever. So that for men to talk of this or that Church, without a particular form of Government setled in it by our Saviour's own Commission, is to turn the Christian Church into a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera and imaginary state of Fairies. But as for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the design of its Reformation, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of a National Synod of Bishops, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a select Convocation of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters representing the whole Body of the Clergy in subjection to the Sovereign Power, and in communion with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church all the World over, as far as it can be attain'd. And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived so agreeably to the Primitive Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the Interest of Government, the Nature of Christianity, that there is little else defective in it, then the honesty and the confidence to own it self, and put its own Constitution into effectual practice.

               <p>At present for the practice of the Primitive Churches Government within it self, and as it related to the Civil State, it must be consider'd in the two Periods; before and after the Conversion of the Empire; and by comparing the true face and posture of things in these two so different states, we shall have an exact description of the Rights of the Church in all estates and conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: But most of all of its easy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Rights of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Christian States; and of the safest way for Christian Sovereigns to govern and protect the Church within their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, without invading its inherent and unalienable Authority. And then last of all, I shall compare that Royal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, that is acknowledged and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in the Church and Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in Causes Ecclesiastical with the sense of the Ancient Church, concerning the Authority of Emperours, and with the Practice of Christian Princes, in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this Authority. And by shewing their compleat Agreement, shall from that Topick distinctly prove that we have in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42190:80"/>
this, as well as in other matters, attain'd a good degree of Reformation.</p>
               <p>First, as for the Period of time, before the Conversion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there are two things to be consider'd; first their behaviour towards the Civil Government, whilst it supprest and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the Christian Faith: Secondly, the exercise of their own Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves. From both which it will appear that the Church, as a Society founded by Christ, challenged a Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on distinct from and Independant upon the Civil State; and that this Jurisdiction was so far from interfering with or aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sovereignty of Princes, that it bound them to the strictest Allegiance and Subjection, to the most inhumane Persecutors. And the Story of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, whilst the powers of the Church and the World were separate, and indeed (as much as it was possible) opposite, will set before us a much clearer State of the Nature and Extent of the two Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then we can have from the Practice of Christian States, in which the two Powers concurring in the same Acts of Government, it is not altogether so easie to discern their distinct influences: but will withal give us the fullest Character of true Christian Loyalty from their practice
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42190:81"/>
under the hardest usage and severest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions. But most of all from their Principles upon which they founded their Obligation to their Practice; and when it appears upon what grounds and reasons they submitted to the utmost cruelty of the Civil Government, that will prevent the common shift made by all Factious Parties against the Authority of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: <hi>viz.</hi> that they submitted for want of strength to make resistance, because it will shew that they thought themselves obliged to suffer any thing from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment rather then resist, by the most Sacred and indispensable Laws of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>And first, as for their Patience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission under all kinds of Cruelties and Oppressions, it is so remarkable, so entire, so without reserve or exception, that, if it were possible, the height and glory of their practice exceeded the Gallantry of their Masters Precepts. And though they were eminent for all other Vertues, yet in this of patience, cheerfulness, and magnanimity under sufferings they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did themselves. It was the hight and perfection of all their goodness; it was the wonder and astonishment of their Enemies; and the glory, and if any thing could be so, the very boast of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42190:81"/>
Numberless are both the Instances of this Practice in the Records of the Church, and the Assertions in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ancient Doctors of it, to own and justifie their Obligation to it. But to transcribe them would be an endless work, and would take up the greatest part of the Records of the first three hundred years; that are for the most part employed about these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Praefat. ad lib.</hi> 5.</note> stiles them) these peaceable Wars of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confessors. It is enough that in all that time, there is not one instance of any Christians making any forcible defence, or joyning in any Sedition against their Governors. Though if there had been any miscarriages in that kind, that could have been no objection against the truth of the Doctrine it self, which is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the general Practice and Sense of the Church, not from the irregularities of a few private persons. And yet so far was it from that, that to me it looks like Wonder and Miracle that among all the Primitive Christians, who lived under Pagan and persecuting Emperors till the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, which takes in the Interval of three hundred and forty years, there should not be one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of any one Christian, that either taught or practised the Doctrine of resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42190:82"/>
in any case whatsoever; but that on the contrary they unanimously both taught and practised the Duty of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience, as one of the greatest and most indispensable Laws of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>And first as for the publick Records, the Canons and Laws of the Church, the case is the same here, as that of Parricide in old <hi>Rome;</hi> the Crime was so unknown and so unsuspected that no Provision was made against it. For among all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Decrees and Censures of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, which were all enacted to restrain some present miscarriages, there is not one to be found that forbids or punishes the Sin of Resistance to Lawful Superiors. The Christians of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church were so firmly fix't in their Duty here by our Saviour's and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Precepts, and by the constant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and Unanimous Sense of their Pastours and Teachers, that they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that they could not make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the most unjust violence of their Persecutors, without renouncing Christianity it self. And that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why this Crime was then never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by Ecclesiastical Censures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was then never committed. And though there are scarce any other Sins
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42190:82"/>
for which the Church has not appointed proper Penances, because they were some time or other put in practice, yet the sin of Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llion was the only Crime for which it had no Penance, because there never was any one instance of it, to give any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccasion for a Law against it. Nay, so far was the Church from doing any thing prejudicial to the Rights of Sovereign Powers, that it was careful and tender of the Interests of Families, in pursuance of its Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Christianity was to make no alteration in any Civil Rights whatsoever. And therefore in the 82 Apostolical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non it is provided. That no Servant be admitted into Holy Orders without his Master's consent, because (as they give the reason of the Law) that would be a subversion of Families. And for that reason it was made one of the Articles framed against St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries in the <hi>Synod under the Oak,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>an them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, this was one, that they taught Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to run away from their Masters, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, upon the pretext of Godliness, which as well as all their other absurd Principles is here justly, and as <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naras</hi> observes, in pursuance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Doctrine, Anathematifed. These are all the Canons that I know of in the Ancient Church, that concern Mens Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rights, so rarely were they invaded or violated among the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; but the first Canons that I meet with against Rebellion, were the three Anathema's of the Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the year 633: When the <hi>Romans</hi> being driven out of <hi>Spain</hi> by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and they being settled in the peaceful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Country, after the death of <hi>Cinthilas,</hi> who first obtain'd the Crown, and the Peoples consent to it; <hi>Sisinandus</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42190:83"/>
his Son summon'd this Council in the first year of his Reign, to Anathematise all Persons, that should any way attempt any thing against his Crown, Life, or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But this was meerly contrived for the security of his Government against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to preserve his new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from Revolting to their old Masters, and was not made to condemn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Resistance, as if it had been taught at that time, but to abet their Oath of Allegiance, and for that reason the Anathema upon the Offender is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the sin of Perjury. The next passage that I remember, to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Rebellion, is the fragment of a <note place="margin">

In which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from, or insurrections against the Emperour are Anathematised; and so is the Priest that gives absolution to any Rebels, before they return to their Duty and Allegiance. The occasion of this Law I know not, but whatever it was, I know no other of the same nature till the <hi>Hildebrandine</hi> Apostacy, whose bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous proceedings against the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, were immediately censured and condemned by a Council
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42190:84"/>
of Thirty Bishops assembled at <hi>Brixia</hi> in the year 1080, and himself is Deposed and Anathematised, as one that destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Order of the Church, and disturb'd the Peace of Christian Empire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass't the Death of a Catholique Prince, and abetted a perjured Usurper, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Peace of the World. And the same Sentence was ratified five years after in a Council at <hi>Mentz,</hi> though all in vain, for they got nothing by it, but the Name and the Brand of Schismatiques. But what bloody work has been made in Christendom by the Principles of this Termagant Pope from that time to this, will make up a Volume of it self, when we come to those times.</p>
               <p>But to return to the state of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, though there are no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of any affront or violence offer'd to the Civil Magistrate in it, yet there are numberless Instances of their quiet and peaceable Submission, and that too upon Principles of Duty and Obligations of Conscience.

her Kindred, her habitation, her hope, her favour, and her honour all dwell in the World to come. She has but one thing to request or indeed to challenge, that she may not be condemn'd unheard.</q> Here is no pleading any exemption from the Imperial Judicatures upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christian Priviledges; but he offers himself and his cause to a fair and impartial Tryal, and he is so confident of its innocence, as to desire no other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour but only the Justice of being heard. Neither does he any where complain of their punishing such Actions as belonged not to their cognizance, but only of the Illegality of their Officers Proceedings, in that they were condemned unheard and unexamined. And though they were so, yet he no where appeals from their Courts, but only presses them to examine and search into their cause, and so stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the name of the Christian Church, to stand or fall by their Judgment. And as for their strict Loyalty to their Prince he farther pleads, <q>that they pray for the Emperors that God would grant them long Life, a quiet Reign, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed Family, Valiant Armies, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counsellors, Obedient Subjects, and whatever else they can desire either as Men or Emperors; and then bids them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42190:88"/>
proceed to murther them, and tear their Souls from their Bodies, whilst they are praying for their Emperors Happiness. And therefore you that think that we have no concern for the Safety of <hi>Caesar,</hi> look into our Books and learn from them with what Redundancy of Kindness we are commanded to pray for our Enemies and Persecutors, and who are more so than those by whose Authority we are condemned as Criminals. But beside that we are expresly injoyn'd to pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority. We revere the Wisdom of God in the Emperors, that sets them over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we acknowledge that Character in them, that God has imprest upon them, and therefore we will wish them safe, whom he would have so. But what do I say any more of the Christians duty and even Religion towards the Emperor, whom they are particularly bound to honour as one chosen by their God? so that I may well say, that <hi>Caesar</hi> is most of all ours, as being set over us by our God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42190:89"/>
Combat, Courage, and Submission. And therefore it is very well observed by the learned Lawyer <hi>Baldwin,</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena</hi> to this acute Author, that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citius</hi> the Heathen, though he were in all other things a very bold Calumniator, and insisted fiercely upon all the vulgar slanders against the Christians, yet he never durst charge them with the least suspition of Disloyalty or Rebellion. To which they might have added, That though they were usually indicted of Treason by their Enemies, yet the only proof of it, was their resusing to Sacrifice by the Emperour's Genius: And setting that one act of Idolatry aside, there is not any one charge upon Record of any one act of Disloyalty, and that (as says the learned Lawyer) was the glory of our Ancestors, that they would be provoked by no injuries to any thought of Hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against Lawful Sovereigns, howsoever barbarously they were treated by them; or enter into any Conspiracies against them, though at that time they were frequent and plausible, as being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mindful what became their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Meekness, Modesty, and Sobriety; so far were they from being Turbulent and Seditious, and running mad with a thirst of Revenge.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42190:90"/>
any way, was judged no less a Crime then renouncing the Christian Faith. It were easie to have collected a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of passages out of the Writings of the Ancients to the same purpose, and divers such Collections have been made by Learned Men, but I have selected these peculiar passages out of my own little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, because they do not only give us their Opinion, but the ground upon which they build it, from the reason and the nature of their Religion, and that gives it a perpetual and unalterable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in all times and cases; and how various soever the Affairs of the World may be, yet this duty can never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by any change of circumstances; because it is as unchangeable as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Religion; so that as long as Christianity lasts, it must for ever equally oblige all Christians under all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and in all conditions.</p>
               <p>Neither do they teach the Doctrine of Non-resistance meerly as Doctors of the Christian Church, &amp; as it is a Law of their Religion, but as Philosophers, or men that understood the Interest of Mankind, and the Original of Government. For the reason which they unanimously alledge for it, is this, that all Governments in the World are every where fix't by the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42190:91"/>
Providence of the Supreme Governor of it, and for that reason they take it to be their Wisdom, as well as their Duty, peaceably to acquiesce in the settled and establish't Government, how ill soever administred, and leave the punishment of its ill-administration by particular persons, to him from whom they received their Authority. Now this Doctrine of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistance or Submission being so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally taught, and that upon such unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able principles and reasons, one would think it enough to set it above all manner of exception or evasion; And yet such is the perverseness of the several Anti-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Factions of Christendom, that they break through all these Restraints into all the licentiousness of Rebellion. But this they do with that impudence against the common sense of Mankind, and that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their own Consciences, that they would have done much more prudently to have wholly slighted and rejected the Authority of the ancient <hi>Lacrymists,</hi> then admitting it, to make so poor and dull a mistake from its obligation. For they all agree in this one slender and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent Plea, that this Doctrine was only suited to their present necessity, because they then wanted power to make resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. That is to say in one soft and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42190:91"/>
friendly word, that they were a Race of the rankest Knaves and Fools that ever appeared among Mankind. That when our Saviour had strictly forbid it as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the nature of his Religion, and the Fundamental Doctrine of the Cross. That when the Apostles reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the same precept with all the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and all the motives in the World, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly out of duty to God and their Religion. And that when the whole succession of Christians from their time to After-ages profess'd and practiced the same duty upon the same Principles. To tell us after all this, that 'tis all Hypocrisie and Dissimulation, nothing but a Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Jesuitical Trick to blind their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors with fine Stories of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of taking up Arms in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when the only reason of it was, that they had no Arms to take up, and that it was nothing but sufficient strength and ability to resist, that kept them off from actual Rebellion, This is such a contradiction to all their avowed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, to the Notoriety of the matter of Fact itself, to all their Apologies, and to their own defiance of so durty a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize, as amounts to no better account then giving them all the open Lye, and for that reason I think it would have been
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42190:92"/>
much better to have at first once for all trampled upon the Authority of such tame Creatures, then to shift it off with such a senseless and shameless Evasion. And upon that account I suppose it was, that it was at last forsaken in our late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and new pretences devised in its stead; but of such a daring boldness and blasphemy against Heaven itself, that they would sooner affright a wise man to hear them, then puzzle a Fool to answer them, and those are the prophane Pleas of the Independants to justifie his Majesties Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> New Discoveries and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Heaven it self. It seems the Villany was so horrid in itself, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less could bear out their confidence in committing it, then the immediate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God himself. And thus they are not ashamed to tell us, <q>That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Non-resistance was not a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable priviledge for that age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not discover'd, because it would have hindred the birth of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> whose coming into the World, God had preordained, and for the more easie let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him in, and the appointed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of him in his Throne, there was a special necessity that no such Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as this of the lawfulness of resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whether true or untrue, should be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42190:92"/>
taught and believed. Whereas now on the contrary that the time of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and purpose for the downfal of <hi>Antichrist</hi> drawing near, there is a kind of necessity that those truths, which have hitherto slept, should now be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, as the necessary means to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine <hi>Antichrist,</hi> particularly that God should reveal to his faithful Ministers and Servants the just bounds and limits of Authority and Power, and the just and full extent of the lawful Liberties of those that live in subjection.</q> This is the sum of the new discoveries of <hi>John Goodwin</hi> in his Book Entituled the <hi>Anti-Cavalier.</hi> And there are divers passages to the same purpose in the Writings of <hi>John Owen</hi> about the same time, who has warranted all the Villanies of <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Independants, even the King's Murther itself, by pretending to new Lights and Revelations from Heaven. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>That when God is doing great things,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eben Ezra,</hi> p. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>he gives glorious manifestations of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies to his secret ones. So that he that is call'd to serve Providence in high things without some especial discovery of God, works in the dark, and knows not whither he goes, and what he does, such an one tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in the Wilderness without a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Cloud. Clear shining from God must
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42190:93"/>
be at the bottom of deep labouring with God. What is the Reason that so many in our days set their hands to the Plough, and look back again? Begin to serve Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in great things but cannot finish? Give over in the heat of the day! They never had such Revelation of the mind of God upon their Spirits, such a discovery of his Excellencies, as might serve for a bottom of such undertakings. Men must know that if God hath not appear'd to them in brightness, and shewn them the horns in his hand, hid from others, though they think highly of themselves, they'l deny God twice and thrice before the close of the work of this Age. Hence is the suiting of great Light and great work in our days. Let new Light be derided whilst men please, he will never serve the Will of God in this Generation, who sees not beyond the line of foregoing Ages.</hi> But what is this new Light, that was never seen in the World before? to this it is fairly answered, <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the peculiar Light of this Generation, is</hi>

that had caused terrour in the Land of the Living, and laid his Sword under his head, was brought to punishment for Blood,</hi> as he expresses it in his Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for his present Majesties overthrow at <hi>Worcester,</hi> p. 15, where he very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly bestows upon him the honourable Titles of a <hi>Tyrant full of Revenge, a man of Blood, a Son of</hi> Belial, Absalom, <hi>and</hi> Sheba <hi>the Son of</hi> Bichri. And lastly, he encourages the Rebels and Traytors the day immediately after his late Majesties Murther, with a <hi>jacta est Alea,</hi> i. e. the cast of a Dye thrown by the hand of God himself, <hi>whose Providence</hi> (he says) <hi>must be served in it, according to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very made of his own unchangeable Will.</hi> But such pretences as these are such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate pieces of Villany in themselves, so framed to serve any wickedness in the World, such rank Blasphemy and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, so destructive of all Government and Society, that for any man to make use of them is the very height of Prophaneness, and when men are come so far, it is in vain to confute them, because 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to object worse things against them then they are ready to own. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they unawares make a fair confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that their own Doctrine and Practice is contrary to the Doctrine of the Gospel
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42190:94"/>
and the Practice of its Primitive Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and then we care not whence they receive it; for whencesoever it comes, it makes them Apostates from the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, that did not only suppress it, but expresly condemn it, so that if their new discovery be true, there is an end of the Gospel. To that height of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were these men blown up by their success in Villany, that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renounce their Saviour openly before God and the World, then quit their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Though the highest aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is, that after so daring a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Christian Religion, they dare pretend to the highest claims of Gospel Purity.

               <p>In the first place it is already made evident that our Saviour by his own appointment, setled Governours over his Church, and that these were the Apostles and their Successors the Bishops through all Ages. Now the proper office of all Government, is to see to the execution of all Laws already in force; and to enact new ones upon particular occasions and emergencies, as they shall judge most advantageous to the present state of the Society. And this was the work of the Apostles and Primitive Bishops, always to promote the Practice of their Masters own Laws among his Subjects, and as oft as it was needful, to make occasional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for the peace and order of the Church. Of the former I need say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because it is granted and supposed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42190:95"/>
on all hands, but of the latter, it will be requisite to give a full account, because though it is the only means that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has provided for the Unity of his Church, and though by the use of it the Church was preserved in Peace and unity in its best and purest times, and lastly, though without it there can be no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church, nor any bar to endless confusions, yet I know not by what blind and unhappy fate it is become a popular and a reigning principle among us. All Innovators lay it at the bottom of their new Projects of Reformation, it is the fundamental Principle of <hi>Grotius</hi> as well as all other Erastians, Legislativam Potestatem jure divino non competere ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae, <hi>that the Church has no Legislative</hi>

But he was then a young man, and the Book is written with great rawness, and betrays la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable want of consideration. It is the very Foundation of all Independency, that nothing ought to be imposed by the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42190:95"/>
Governours of the Church upon the Members of it, but what is clearly revealed in the word of God. And that there is no other Rule of Unity then that rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by our Lord himself, which is so far from truth, so inconsistent with the Being of a Church, that it is a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Nature and the use of Government, whose proper Office it is to make Provisions for the Peace and good Order of the Society, upon all occasions, by the common rules of Prudence and Discretion, and such things it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to leave to the judgment and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Men, because their convenience and usefulness is alterable with change of times and circumstances, and therefore must be left to the liberty of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church to impose or remove them as they shall judge most suitable to the present State of things. This was the standing rule in the Primitive Church, that points of Faith were unalterable, and when they were once determin'd by the Judgment of the Catholick Church, they were never after that to be debated, but as for all Laws of Discipline they were alterable with change of times and circumstances. And to name one for all, Regula quidem fidei <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Virgin. Vel. c.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>(says Tertullian)</hi> una omnino est, sola immobilis &amp; irreformabilis. Hac lege fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei

manente, caetera jam disciplinae &amp; conversationis admittunt novitatem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionis. <hi>The Rule of Faith is always the same, this alone is unchangeable and unreformable. But as this remains for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, so matters of Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment admit the Novelty of change and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</hi> So that next to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Charter of being a Church, this is the grand Principle of its Government, that its Governours be endued with an Authority of imposing some things that are not required in the Word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church must be govern'd as all humane Societies are, <hi>i. e.</hi> by men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, that have Wit enough to judge what is fit to be done upon any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent cases, and whose Authority is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to oblige the Members of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Decrees, and without it there could neither be Church nor Government. So that this principle is so little suited to the state of Church-Purity, (as the Schismatiques pretend) that it is only set up as an impregnable pretence for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Schisms and Divisions. For it was never started or so much as thought of till t'other day, when the Puritan Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for want of something more material to object against the Constitutions of the Church, were forced at last to make this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42190:96"/>
their main quarrel, that they were not pré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd in the Word of God. And as long as they were resolved to stand to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, they were secure in their Schism; for it is an Objection not against the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Constitutions of this Church, but the practice of the Universal Church, and the exercise of any power in all Churches of the World, and therefore it being so good a Fund for Confusion, it is for that reason so carefully nursed by the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Faction at this day; it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of all <hi>J. O</hi>'s Books about Schism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes all peace and settlement an impossible thing, when there is no such rule of worship or discipline as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by attending to which the Unity of the Church is to be preserved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to refer us to a means of Peace that is not in being, is to leave us remediless. And if the Church may not make occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Provisions to restrain some mens extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, and to settle good order, all men are let loose to all the follies in the World, and it will look more like a <hi>Bedlam</hi> than a Christian Church. In short, it serves to no other purpose then to be an everlasting pretence of Sedition, when it takes away not only from the Church, but from theCivil Government too all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of making any Laws for the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42190:97"/>
of Religion. And yet this very Principle of Confusion, this Darling of Independency, this bulwark of all Schism is crept into the Church of <hi>England</hi> it self, or some pretenders to it, and is laid down by our Reconcilers and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers as the first Rule of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation between the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the present Dissenters. Though if it were admitted, the different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would be so far from being taken into the Bosom or the Peace of the Church, that it would only widen the differences, and harden them in their Schisms. For first the contest is not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily about unscriptural Impositions, but about divine Commands; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that their Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of God's Institution, and that the form now establish't in <hi>England</hi> is an humane Government set up against it, and destructive of it; this is the whole design of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Treatise of Episcopacy, and this has ever been the main contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie from the beginning of the Schism, whether the Episcopal or the Classical Government were set up by our Saviour in the Christian Church (for Men were not so unthinking in those days as to imagine he should set up the Society of his Church without setling any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42190:97"/>
in it) and therefore it is but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, a partial, and a treacherous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Separation, to state the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie only in Ceremonies, when the main controversie has been from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this very day about a matter of Divine Right, and therefore to take no notice of that in the History of the Schism, is to intimate, that as to that part of the controversie, neither had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the other, but they both equally contended about what never was, and that all the blame of the Separatists is their refusing to submit to some lawful Impositions: But that reaches not their cause, the ground of their Separation is pretended Divine Law, they must be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of that, or they must be let alone. But secondly, this Principle of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation by rejecting unscriptural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Communion, would be so far from reconciling the Dissenters to the Church, that it would only give up the Churches Cause to their demands, and justifie them in their Schism, because they dissent not from her in any matters clearly reveal'd, which alone the Church has Power to impose; and to charge the Church of Tyranny, for daring to impose any other conditions of Communion, then what are imposed by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42190:98"/>
An excellent way of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this in behalf of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to condemn her whole practice of illegal and unwarrantable Usurpation, and allow the Pleas of the Dissenters just and reasonable: And, what is worst of all, to take away all Government in the Church for ever, and the Church it self too, when it is evident from common sense, that it can never subsist without a Legislative Authority within it self, but that I shall have occasion to discourse of more copiously hereafter, when I come to shew what injury is done to the Church of <hi>England</hi> by these false Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of accommodation. I shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent content my self with proving it by experience, and representing the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws made by the Ancient Governors of the Church from time to time, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and provide for its own Peace and Tranquility. And by it I shall make good these three considerable Points. First, the great Authority inherent in them, and independent on any Civil Power. Secondly, their great wisdom in the use and exercise of it, for by the particulars it will appear, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acted upon wise and prudent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And thirdly, the absolute necessity of it, when we shall see by the Example
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42190:98"/>
of every age, that there is no way of preserving any manner of Peace in the Church without it.</p>
               <p>And to begin with the first Decree made by the Apostles themselves, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the contrary prejudices of Jews and Gentiles: If they had obliged the Gentiles to comply with the whole Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that would have look't like an attempt to bring them under the old intolerable Bondage, and tempt them rather to renounce Christianity then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to such a grievous Yoke: And if they had wholly exempted them from the Mosaick Law, that would have as much endangered the Apostacy of the Jews; thinking that they should thereby have renounced the God of the Law; for it was not easie to every capacity to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between rejecting the Law and the Lawgiver. And therefore to satisfie and avoid the prejudices of both Parties, they agreed <hi>To lay no greater burthens then these necessary things, that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>from Meats offer'd to Idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</hi> Where by things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, it is plain that they mean things necessary at that time and place; for that they were not so in all times and places is evident, not only from the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42190:99"/>
direction of their Synodical Epistle to the particular Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> but from their not imposing the same Decree upon other Churches, that were not in the same Circumstances. In the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined upon <hi>Judaea,</hi> the Jews were very numerous, and therefore to avoid offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>i. e.</hi> tempting them to renounce the Christian Faith, it was requisite to make it a standing rule to them at that time, that all Christians abstain from the Oblations to Idols, and that would whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent their great fear of Idolatry. But on the contrary, because the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> consisted chiefly of Gentiles, the same rule was not made peremptory and universal to them, but they were left to their own liberty to eat Meats of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Idols, as they judged most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Christian prudence and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as they are directed by their Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father St. <hi>Paul.</hi> This is all that I can make of that great Council; and though they were endued with the Holy Ghost, yet they proceeded by no other Rule then common prudence and discretion. And if they had taken the same method that our Schismatiques and Pacificators would oblige the present Church to, to search for a determination of this casual
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42190:99"/>
dispute in their Masters own Laws, I doubt they would have been very much at a loss to have found any thing like such a decree amongst all his Precepts. And yet there was as much reason that they should refer all Acts of Government to be determin'd by his own express De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as that their Successors should refer them to theirs.</p>
               <p>But next to this Apostolical Synod, the Apostolical Canons are the greatest and earliest Demonstration of the Legislative Authority of the Christian Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compiled by their next Successors in the second and third Centuries, by which we understand the true settlement of the Church as the Apostles left it, for all the Canons relating to Government are no new Laws, but only declarations of old Customs; so that though they were not Apostolical Laws, they were true and early Records of Apostolical Customs, and by them the practice of Church-Government was so entirely set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that they were ever after the Rule and Pattern to the determinations of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Councils. And most of the chief Canons, both General and Provincial, were only Ratifications of these old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, to recover their just Authority, when any of them had been neglected
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42190:100"/>
or violated, or additional provisions in pursuance of their general design in new particular Cases. For which it seems every Age found matter enough to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press some Mens extravagant and wanton fancies; and it was the new rising of Schisms and Heresies that gave occasion to enacting all the Laws of the Church. But these Apostolical Canons being as it were the <hi>Institutes</hi> or <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of the Ecclesiastical Laws, and being withal enacted in this Period of time, that we are now in, by pure Ecclesiastical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I shall give a brief view of them, to let the Reader see the exact Model of the Primitive Church, as reduced to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and brought to perfection by the Apostles and their immediate Successors. In the first place therefore, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has so great an influence upon the welfare of the Church, as the setting up good and wise Governors over it, great care is taken against rash Ordination of Bishops; so that though every Bishop has an inherent Right in himself to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh his own Authority to another, yet is it here fixt, and has remain'd so through all Ages, as a standing Law to the Church, that every Bishop be Consecrated by three Bishops at least, or two in cases of necessity. Now though this Rule has
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42190:100"/>
been observed and practiced in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches over all the World, and is so highly useful to the good Government of the Church, by not entrusting a matter of such weight to the discretion of a single Person, yet I believe it will be a very hard task to find any thing like a clear Precept requiring it in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. So apparently repugnant is the principle of the Projectors of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation against unscriptural impositions to the very first Law that was made in the Christian Church after the Apostles, and if they pleased it might as well be used to take away this prudent Practice as any other Ceremony whatsoever. Now the Bishop being with this great care and caution admitted to his Trust, he was consider'd in a treble capacity; first in relation to his own Diocess; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to the Bishops of the Province; thirdly to the Catholick Church. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own Diocess he had the Supreme Government; for every Diocess, though it be but a Member of the Catholick Church, is yet a distinct Society of it self, and ordinarily Govern'd by a Jurisdiction within it self, and that was by the Bishop and his Colledge of Presbyters; in which he enjoyed such a Supremacy, that no act of the Presbyters could be valid without
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42190:101"/>
his Consent and Authority; and yet his Supremacy was so confin'd, that he could as little act without the concurrence of his Presbyters as they without his. Now this Episcopal Superiority acting only in conjunction with the Presbyters, was the most proper method that could have been contrived to prevent confusion on one hand, and Tyranny on the other. For where a Body of Men act in an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Power without some real Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity above them, nothing can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but perpetual Factions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities. And on the other side a Power purely Monarchical, without any Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in the Government, may easily, if it please, degenerate into Tyranny, and when it does so, has nothing to restrain it; and though Tyranny be an ugly thing in Civil Government, yet in the Ecclesiastical it is far more indecent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Church Power is founded upon the profession of Meekness and Humility. But though the Bishops ever associated the Presbyters in Authority with them from the time of the Apostles, yet I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there are no Footsteps of any Divine Command requiring it, though its early practice may prove it an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Custom and Tradition, but if it was, it was (for any thing we know)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42190:101"/>
their own voluntary act, as becoming the modesty of Christian Governors.</p>
               <p>But the Jurisdiction of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus seated in the Bishop and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Presbyters, matters were so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ordered, that their Acts were not only valid within their own Precincts, but in the Catholick Church all the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 12.</note> World over. Thus it is Enacted that if any Clergy-man or Lay-man excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate or any way unfit to be received, shall be received in another City <hi>(i. e.</hi> according to the Language of those times, in another Diocess) without commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letters, both he that receives him <note place="margin">

anothers Diocess upon pain of Deposition. There is no Flight or Appeal from one single Bishop to another, but if any man thought himself aggrieved by his own Bishop, he had power of Appeal to the Bishops of the Province, who were to assemble twice a year in Council to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Matters of great weight in the Church, especially to review the Acts of Government in every particular Diocess of the Province, that if they found any wrong Judgment, they might reverse it, or if any harsh or too severe, they might mitigate it. Here is all the care in the World taken to preserve the Efficacy of the Discipline in every Church, and it was so religiously observed in the Primitive times, that I do not remember one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of its being violated till the time of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Usurpation. And it is reckoned among the many other strange Enormities of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> by the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> in their Epistle to the Emperours <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42190:102"/>
Communion by another. And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the foremention'd Apostolical Canons, to preserve the Authority of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop within his own Jurisdiction, it was afterward decreed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 5.</note> Council, that there shall be no redress, no nor complaint against the Sentence of the Diocesan Bishop; unless it be at the meeting of the Provincial Synod. And it is said that at the motion of <hi>Atticus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for prevention of Frauds and Cheats in Canonical Epistles, such an artificial form was contrived by the Council, as was impossible to be counterfeited. The form is extant in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Distinct.</hi> 73. it is somewhat remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and very well worth the perusal. But it is plain that they confined every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops power within his own Circuit, and every Clergy-man to his own Bishops Jurisdiction. And all the following Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils stick close to the same principles of Discipline, though the <hi>African</hi> Bishops were more strict then other Churches in this as well as all other points of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no Travelling among them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dimissory Letters. And if any Bishop <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 26.</note> carried a complaint to any Forraign <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 31.</note> Church, he stood <hi>ipso facto excommunicate</hi> to all the <hi>African</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42190:103"/>
But lastly, beside this form of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Government, in which all matters of common concernment were determined by the major Vote of the Episcopal Synod, and by which all the Diocesses within the Province were united and cemented into one Communion, there was a common tye of Government between the Bishops of several Provinces, in whose Concord consisted the Unity of the Catholick Church so much talked of by the Ancients. And this was chiefly kept up by Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Synodical Letters, which was not an Arbitrary correspondence, but an indispensable duty of every Church to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church, so that whatever Bishop neglected it, he was for that reason cast by all others out of the Communion of the Catholick Church, and by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice every Act of Discipline in every Church was of force in all Churches all the World over, and whoever was taken in a Member of one Church, had a right from it to communicate in all Churches, and whoever was cast out of the same, stood excommunicate to the whole Christian World. And this was done with all security and expedition by setling the power of correspondence in every Province upon the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and by the mutual intercourse of <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42190:103"/>
all the general Affairs of the Church were transacted. And therefore upon the choice of a new <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> it was the custom to signifie his Election to all the rest, that they might know to whom to direct their corresponding and communicatory Letters. Thus the Synod of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that deposed <hi>Paulus Samosutenus</hi> in the year 270, write to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all other Churches through the whole World, that they had deposed <hi>Paulus,</hi> and placed <hi>Domnus</hi> in his stead, <hi>and this,</hi> say they, <hi>We therefore signifie to you, that you might write to him, and receive communicatory</hi>

                  </gap>he power of summoning Provincial Councils was the only thing that he was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42190:104"/>
empowr'd to do by his own single Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For the practice of it being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasional and uncertain, and yet very frequent, it was necessary to entrust it with some single person; and for that, none fitter then the chief Bishop that resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the chief City. And for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his trust he gave an account of this as well as all other parts of his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in the Provincial Synod, that was assembled twice a year, to take a review of all things that concern'd the state of the whole Province in reference to all Churches without it, as well as of the Government of every particular Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess within it. And thus by this subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Diocesan Bishops to Provincial Synods, and correspondence of Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Synods with each other, was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Discipline of every Church effectual in all Churches, because no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one Church could be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Communion with another without his Letters-Testimonial. Whereby it was so order'd that whoever was admitted into one Church, was admitted into all; and whoever was excommunicated out of one, was shut out of all. And no wonder then that the Canons of the Church are so careful in this part of Discipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Church and Church, when the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42190:105"/>
Efficacy of all other Acts of Discipline depend wholly upon it. For if a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence given in one Church, were not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in every Church, it was in any mans power to elude it, only by slipping into the next Jurisdiction. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing could be more pernicious to the whole Discipline of the Catholick Church, then for the Bishop of one Church to receive and protect the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of another against the Sentence or without the consent of his own Bishop, for that reason it is, that the Primitive Church was more watchful in that part of Discipline then any other, and for the same reason 'tis, that I have here traced its practice, thereby to direct us to the true way of restoring the effectual Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Ancient Church in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which has for many ages been with scandal and dishonesty enough utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by one single Judicatures making it self a common Sanctuary against the Jurisdiction of all other Churches. And till this intolerable abuse and corruption be removed, it is in vain to hope for any amendment of the poor distressed and despised Estate of the Christian Church, and some men have been pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, whether out of scorn or pity I know not, but if the Church will crouch
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42190:105"/>
under such a pettifogging abuse, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves both.</p>
               <p>But by the Premisses we see that whilst the Church preserved its Original liberty, it was able to preserve its Peace and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too by observing the Canonical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to mutual Concord among all Christian Bishops, and that was so far from being arbitrary, that whoever broke the Rule, was by it immediately depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all Trust and Authority in it. And the practice of this Discipline was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served entire and effectual in the Church, till the settlement of <hi>Patriarchates,</hi> who swallowed up this Authority, as they did all the other Metropolitical Rights, into themselves, till at last the Pope swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up theirs. And then the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of granting commendatory or dimisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letters, was in all Provinces entirely appropriated to their Legates, This is a short account of the Polity of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and in it I think all things are so neatly composed for an easie, a civil, and an effectual Government, that I may safely challenge all the great pretenders to Politiques and Framers of Common-wealths, to find out a more useful or more artificial Scheme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:42190:106"/>
But beside these great and more lasting Rules of prudence and good order, they were forced to make many occasional Laws to restrain some Mens particular follies, and superstitions. I will for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity sake instance only in two Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons. In the fifth Canon, the Clergy of all degrees are forbid to put away their Wives upon pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, under pain first of suspension, and if they persist deprivation. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of which Canon was the Opinion of several Hereticks, especially the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> of whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> reports, <hi>Nubere &amp; generare à Satanâ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt esse:</hi> that they affirm'd, That Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Propagation was the Devil's invention; and this Opinion grew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in the second Century; so that <hi>Tertullian</hi> among many others was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with it: But more especially, That the Clergy were bound to leave their Wives, that they might devote themselves the more entirely to Prayers, Fastings, and Religious Exercises, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of married Persons being less pure, and less acceptable to God. Now to stop this Superstition, as if Marriage were any way inconsistent with the Service of God, this Canon was at first Enacted, and is afterward Ratified by divers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42190:106"/>
Councils. And the truth of it is, this Opinion of the great merit of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy was one of the first Superstitions that invaded the Christian Church, and was in every Age more busie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than any other, though I do not find that it could ever obtain the force of Law in the Eastern Church, till the Council in <hi>Trullo</hi> in the year 691, by whom Bishops, and no other, are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to cohabit with their Wives after Consecration; and as that is the first Canon of this kind, so is it a flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Apostolical Canon. And though the Council endeavour to excuse it, yet they do but the more grosly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themselves by their own Apology, and instead of defending their fault, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it. For when they have made the Canon, they tell us, that they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereby to contradict the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canon, when the very making of it is an express contradiction to it. And in the very next Canon they condemn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for prohibiting mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Priests and Deacons, and make good their Decree from this very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that equally allows it to all Orders. But above all commend me to <hi>Gratian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Distinct.</hi> 30, 31.</note> upon this Argument, who when he has in two whole Chapters recited several
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42190:107"/>
Ancient Canons of the Church against this Superstition, especially those severe ones of the Council of <hi>Gangra,</hi> and last of all this last mention'd Canon in <hi>Trul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> in which the marriage of Presbyters and Deacons is expresly warranted, he begins his next Chapter with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assertion, <hi>Servanda est ergò continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ab omnibus in sacris ordinibus consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis.</hi> And then proves it by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of later Popes, injoining Caelibacy as a Duty of Piety to all Orders of the Clergy. But if they can thus confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly justifie their Innovations out of the Ancients, by concluding contrary to their own avowed and express Sense; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess they may make good any Cause, though I should think it would be much more adviseable to let fall such a Cause, as can be no better way defended. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarkable Law that was Enacted during this Interval by meer Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, was the exclusion of all voluntary Eunuchs from Holy Orders. And that was made upon occasion of the Heresie of the <hi>Valesians,</hi> who thought themselves bound to this severity against themselves, by too rigid an Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some passages of our Saviour, especially that of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel, 19. 12. And the same Canon was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42190:107"/>
renewed in a Synod at <hi>Alexandria</hi> against <hi>Origen</hi> upon the same account, and after that by the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> upon occasion of the fact of <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who being a Presbyter, and very much delighting in the conversation of a young Virgin, by name <hi>Eustolia,</hi> and being upbraided with the scandal of using so much freedom with her, to prevent that, without losing her Society, he made the same attempt upon himself that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> had done, for which he was deposed by the Council, though afterwards he was, contrary to the Canon, or rather in defiance to the Council, promoted by the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Faction, with whom he sided, to the great See of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But hereby we may see the necessity of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power in the Church, without which there would be no means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain all the wild Conceits and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies that Superstition can blow into Mens fancies. So exorbitant a Principle is it, so inconsistent with the Peace and preservation of the Church, so absurd, so foolish, and contrary to the Common Sense of Mankind, that nothing ought to be imposed by the Governors of the Church, but what is expresly imposed by the Word of God. There are many more Examples in this Interval, both of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42190:108"/>
the settlement of that Polity in the Church that I have above described, and of divers wise and prudent Laws made upon particular Occasions; but to avoid being too tedious, and yet to do the work effectually, I shall confine my self to the Writings of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in whose time the State of the Church was brought to perfection, and who, I may be bold to say, understood it as well as any Writer of the Christian Church, either before or after his own time, and who has stated the whole matter with the greatest clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and strength of Reason, and reduced it to practice with the most unblameable prudence and wisdom, and therefore I shall give a more particular and exact account of his Sense of the Government and Unity of the Catholick Church, both for the enlightening of some Mens minds, who pretend to be so dull, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand how it should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd in way of external Polity, and for a proof of the exact agreement of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its design'd Model of Reformation, with this Ancient State of the Christian Church. This is made much more easie at this time by the late labour of a very learned Prelate of our own in digesting his Writings, that had hitherto lay not a little confused, into
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42190:108"/>
their due and exact order of time. For when we certainly know at what time, and upon what occasion every discourse was written, it must needs make it much more easie, and much more useful then otherwise the discourse could have made it self. For that Unity is a very desirable thing is agreed on all hands, the only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is, wherein it consists: Some will have it to be only an Union of Faith and Charity; others of External Polity, so as that all Christians are some way or other United under one Government. And these we may subdivide into two Parties: Either those that place the Unity of the Catholick Church in a Subjection to one single Monarch: Or those that set up an Obligation to a Political Unity among all Churches under several Governments. So that though every particular Church or Diocess have Supreme Government within it self, as to all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern its own State, yet it is accountable to the Catholick Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> to all other Churches for the Peace of the whole. For though a Church may be at Unity within it self, yet if it do any thing inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the peace of Government in any other Church, it becomes Schismatical to the whole Body of the Catholick Church; presuming, as much as in it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42190:109"/>
lies, to overthrow the Discipline of all other Churches. This as I take to be the true State of the Controversie, so to be St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s sense of it.</p>

               <p>And the first Principle that runs through all his Writings, and lies at the bottom of all his Notions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Church Unity, is, that there is but one <hi>Episcopacy</hi> setled in the Church by Divine Appointment, distributed among the several Bishops of the Catholique Church, every one retaining the whole Power within his own Bishoprick, as he expresses it like a Lawyer, <hi>Episcopatus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Eccles.</note> 
                  <hi>unus est, cujus à singulis in solidum pars tenetur. There is but one Episcopacy, of which every one holds his own share with full Title and Possession.</hi> For the word <hi>in solidum</hi> is a Law-term denoting a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of Title; so that though an Estate be divided into two parts, yet both inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit their own share <hi>in solidum;</hi> and so if two Men be bound for the same Debt; if they are bound each Man <hi>in partem,</hi> they are obliged to pay but half share, but if they are obliged <hi>in solidum,</hi> either of them is bound to pay all. And this is St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s State of Episcopacy, that though many share the Authority, yet every Bishop has as full possession of his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42190:109"/>
own share within it self, as if there were no other. <hi>Seeing</hi> (as he elsewhere <note place="margin">Cùm singulis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storibus portio Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis sit adscripta, quam regat unus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisque ac guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, rationem sui actûs Domino red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diturus.</note> expresses it) <hi>a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the Flock is allotted to the care of its particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, which every one is bound to guide and govern, and to account to God for the discharge of his Episcopal Office.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this his singular Notion, but the unanimous and settled Sense of the Ancients: Thus the Author of <hi>Clement</hi>'s Institutions brings in the Apostles Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after this manner to all Christian Bishops: We being all gathered together have written to you this form of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Doctrine, <hi>For the Confirmation of</hi>

                  <hi>Churches.</hi> So all the Ancient Canons inhibit every single Bishop, even the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan to intermeddle in anothers Diocess, upon pain of Deposition. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this Supremacy of Power in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop any abatement of the just Rights of Metropolitans; For in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church (as I have shewn in a former Treatise) Metropolitans had no Power over inferiour Bishops, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Synod of the Province. So that it was the Synod, not the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, that had the Superiour Power over every single Bishop. And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he was as liable to the Sentence of the Synod, as the meanest Bishop of the Province, as appears from the case of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus;</hi> and Metropolitans, considering their number, were as often censured and Deposed as other Bishops. And this is the reason of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s so
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42190:110"/>
earnestly disclaiming the Title of <hi>Episcopus Episcoporum,</hi> because though his own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical Jurisdiction were of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet as a single Bishop he had no Superiority over any other Bishop; no Authority to punish his Misdemeanors; to receive Appeals from his Sentence; or to order and rectifie any thing within his Diocess. All such Power was to be exerted only in Synodical Conventions, in which he had the Honour and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Presidency, but the Jurisdiction was seated in the Body of the Council, without whose concurrence had he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to do any thing more then any other Bishop, his least punishment had been certain Deposition. This was the real State of things in the Ancient Church, and Metropolitans never took upon them any Power over their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues or Brother-Bishops by their own single Authority till after the Papal Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, neither then did they challenge it as Metropolitans, but as Legates to the Pope, and that was one of the highest branches of the Usurpation. But before that time the Governours of the Church were not more watchful against any one thing then that one Bishop should not claim any power over another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:42190:111"/>
Now this Principle being first laid, That the whole Episcopal Authority is vested in every Bishop, the next that is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it, is, That whoever sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from the Communion of his Bishop, or sets up another against him is a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick: and this was the Subject of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all his Epistles concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> or such as fell in time of Persecution. For they according to the Ancient Discipline of the Church, were not to be received into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion but by these degrees. First they were to Petition to be admitted to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that upon confession of their fault was granted, and then having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergon the Penance imposed, they made a publick Confession of their Crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Congregation; and upon that they received Absolution by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the hands of the Bishop and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ergy, and after that they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Holy Eucharist or Full-Communion. But instead of this solemn severity of Discipline, some of his own Presbyters had been so rash as without the consent of their Bishop to give them entire Absolution, and admit them to entire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. This was the opening of that unhappy Schism that afterward created

To divide from their Bishop, as <hi>Faeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissimus</hi> had done, was a breach of the Unity of the Priesthood, and that was a breach of the Unity of the Church, which is here expressed by the word Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, as it is frequently in the Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, but especially those that writ against the <hi>Novatians</hi> and the <hi>Donatists.</hi> All the Christians under one Bishop were said to appertain to the same Altar, because they belong'd to the same Communion; and therefore when any separated from him, they were said to erect a new Altar, because they set up a new Communion. And this Rebellion against the Bishop he farther aggravates as an utter Subversion of the Christian Church; <hi>It is adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And then passionately exhorting the People to avoid them, he thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses himself: <hi>Let no Man draw you Ghri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nemo vos Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos ab Evangelio Christi rapiat, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo filios Ecclesiae de Ecclesiâ tollat.

               </p>
               <p>Thus we see how it is all along with him, one and the same thing to be out of the Communion with the Bishop and with the Christian Church, whilst the Bishop was in Communion with that. But matters being thus prepared, and the storm of Persecution laid, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in a little time returns home, and Summons a Provincial Council, in which the Cause of <hi>Faelicissimus</hi> (whose zeal had now made him proud of being head of the Party) and his Factious Associates, was Examin'd, and after a full and fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the former Sentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by their own Bishop was Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ratified.

But the Opinion of <hi>Novatian</hi> being the most plausible (for that of <hi>Novatus</hi> was a meer inlet to all Debauchery) it soon swallowed up the <hi>African</hi> Schismatiques into it; for <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> having by his Schism escaped with all his Crimes the Discipline of the Church, he cared not what became of his Opinion, Schism was his only business, and therefore he would quit his Opinion or any thing else, to strengthen himself by a stronger Faction.

who allowed full Restitution to all other Offenders, but in this case he does it with an <hi>If.</hi> And in plain truth the Nature of the Crime deserved it, for it is an Eternal Subversion of the Peace of the whole Church, if the Pride or the Peevishness of one single Man may be suffer'd to censure and condemn the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole Catholique Church. For though this pique of <hi>Pupianus</hi> lay only against St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> yet he being (as he tells him) in Communion with all the Bishops and Churches through the whole World, though the blow were aim'd at him singly, it lighted upon all, and the whole Church was equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the Censure. Which was then thought such a piece of <hi>Luciferian</hi> pride, that it was by him placed next to the unpardonable Sin. The passages in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to this purpose are innumerable, and there is scarce an Epistle, in which he does not expresly declare the Unity of the Catholique Church to lye in the Concord and Agreement of the Episcopal Colledge; that was a Succession to the Apostolical, between whom the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church was equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet so as to agree all together in one Catholique Communion. This is a thing so easily to be understood that I

cannot but stand amazed to find Men of Sense, Learning, and Ingenuity pretend to be so dull as not to be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how the Unity of the Church should be reduced to practice by way of external Policy, when all the Lines of it are so plainly traced out in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal practice of the Primitive Church, and particularly in the Writings of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> It were easie to give a much larger account of it by transcribing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Records of the Christian Church, the chief Affairs whereof were all along transacted by this way of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolary Correspondence: And therefore the best way of attaining knowledge in Ecclesiastical matters is not by following set and form'd Histories, so much as by consulting particular Epistles, in which we have a distinct account from time to time, of the true Springs and Motions of all the publique Transactions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</p>

               <p>But because this Argument of Unity and Communion, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Polity in the Church is become a Controversie among some learned Men of our own Church, though what I have already discoursed in general be more then enough, or at least as much as is in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42190:128"/>
it self needful to state the Case, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I assoil some particular Arguments that are at this time on foot, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that I have said, I shall leave some Readers under the power of great prejudices, and those prejudices being maintain'd by the deserved Reputation of some good and learned Men, they are not to be easily removed, not otherwise then by particular Confutations. The two great Men at first engaged in this Controversie are Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> Men of equal value both for Modesty, Learning, and Piety. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> is peremptory for the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one United Government in the Catholique Church. The Dr. granting it to be a thing very desirable, and in some rare cases practicable, as when all Christendom was almost confin'd within the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, cannot conceive any Necessity of it, or Obligation to it. But with all due Reverence to the memory of so great, and so good a Man, I must make bold to say, That, however it comes to pass, he answers neither his usual Acuteness or Ingenuity in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Probably it might have been an imperfect work, and an Essay upon the Argument by way of exercise to himself; or if he were serious, and the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42190:129"/>
discourse were the result of his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will appear when I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his way of discoursing it, that he had by no means weighed the matter as he ought, that he did not comprehend the Arguments that he undertook to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he was not consistent with himself, but expresly asserts the Opinion that he endeavours to oppose. Of all which unusual inconsistency in so Acute a Man I can give no other Reason, then that his great Zeal against the Unity of the Catholique Church by way of Papal Monarchy Transported him so far as to make him forget that obligation to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Communion that lyes upon all Churches under their several distinct Governments. But whatever was the ground of his mistake, his reasons only concern us, and here to proceed Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, I shall in the first place set down his Adversaries Arguments, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies upon them; and then his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, with my Answers to them. And first he begins the dispute with an intimation of the want of perspicuity in his Adversaries Writings, and this I know is a popular Objection, and very much in the mouths of some Men, who will by no means allow him to be an intelligible Writer, though for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42190:129"/>
I cannot imagine, unless that it is convenient for themselves that he should not be understood; for if once Men were convinced of the true Constitution of any one Church by Divine Authority, that would forever destroy all indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or pretended moderation, between the several different Parties among us. And if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Divine Right, then all that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from it are both Heretiques and Schismatiques; and all that join with it as the right Church, and not meerly as the Church in possession, are obliged to declare them so, and endeavour to have them cast out of all Ecclesiastical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. If indeed the difference were only about Rites and Ceremonies, there might be some room for good nature; but when the contest is about the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Constitution of a Christian Church, as it was Established by our Saviour and his Apostles, those that separate from it, nay that endeavour with all their might to destroy it, (as our present Schismatiques do) cannot but incur the utmost displeasure and severity of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Men that sincerely love it: In such cases as these, it is a contradiction to talk of terms of Accommodation: And that is the reason why some Men that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42190:130"/>
would keep fair with all Parties, are so afraid of the Plea of Divine Right for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for if that be setled, they are thereby obliged and determin'd positively to declare against the Schi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of all other different Parties. And not to do it is to partake of their Sin, and in effect to join with them in it, for not to be for the true Church is to be against it, our Saviour will accept of no such lukewarm and perfidious moderation. In short, Men that Communicate with the Church of <hi>England</hi> not as founded upon Divine Right, proceed upon no other ground then that it is the Church at present in Possession, so that whatever Party has the luck to get uppermost, that is the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and then be it Popery, Presbytery, or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendendy we are Schismatiques if we sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from it: For if there be no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical form of Government settled by Divine Law, then none of these can be in themselves unlawful, because nothing can be so but as it is against the Law of God, for where there is no Law there is no Sin, and therefore it is but a very mean piece of Service to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to assert the Lawfulness of her Constitution; for if that be all, and if it be not necessary too as establisht by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42190:130"/>
Divine Right, so are all other forms, then all the difference is, that the State has thought good to annex the Ecclesiastical preferments to this way; but setting them aside, the Separatists are as much the Church of <hi>England</hi> as our selves, and if the State should be pleased to settle all the Emoluments of the Church upon Presbytery or Independency, yes or Popery it self, then all that is pleaded for the Lawfulness of the present Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will be as pleadable against it for the Church Triumphant. So fatal and pernicious to the Being of a Christian Church is this Principle that takes away all Divine Right, it blows up the very Foundations of the Church, that can stand upon no other bottom then the Authority of God, and lets Men loose from all other Obligations to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with any Church, then meerly those of courtesie and civility; for the only reason it can lay upon them, is to Communicate with the Church they live in, is to do it for convenience and peace sake, rather then to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, otherwise they are lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the Law of God to be of what Church they please, or if they please of none at all; for if there be none by Divine Law, they cannot be obliged to Communicate with any. But of the ill Consequences of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42190:131"/>
this fatal Principle, I shall give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account in the Conclusion of this Design; when after I have made good the true State of the Church, I shall be able to convince all the different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Deviations from it, and amongst the rest I doubt this Sect of Men will be found the most guilty of any, of perfidiousness against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, for they disown any such thing in all times and places; and that is an offence of a more heinous Nature, as well as larger Extent, then when committed only against the particular Church of <hi>England.</hi> Though the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test aggravation of it is, That it is taken up precariously without ground or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Reason, in defiance to all the Records of the Christian Church, and that all its Pleas pervert them with more folly and grossness, then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> pretences for Papal Supremacy, as will be shewn in due place. In the mean time to return to our Learned Author, and his complaint of Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>'s obscurity, that was taken up by him from a vulgar Opinion, and that was first started by others, chiefly to prevent the force of his Arguments for the Divine Right of Ecclesiastical Power. It must be granted, that there are some things in his Epilogue to the Church of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42190:131"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> that cannot but create some difficulty to the less skilful Reader: As first, the very careless and uncorrected Impression of it, whereby such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of faults have escaped, or rather pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the Press, as cannot but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much disturb and perplex the Sense, especially when the mistake is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as it very frequently is) in the Particles of Argumentation, whereby the plain coherence of the discourse is often lost and inverted; both which being added to the obscurity of the stile it self, which though it is intelligible enough to an attending Reader, yet must be acknowledged somewhat dark and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, as usually happens to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtful Men, and that seems to have been the case of this Learned Man, his former Writings upon the very same Subject being much more plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous. But the thing that most of all puts the ordinary Reader to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oss, is his frequent and large digressions, for being a compleat Master of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Learning, he could not confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his proper Argument, but upon every turn runs out into other Subjects. And the method of the connexion not appearing, the common Reader loses the design of the whole. To give an instance or two, his chief Arguments for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42190:132"/>
of the Catholick Church being taken from the Unity of Baptism, and the Lord's Supper; beside making out his Conclusion, he enters into large Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses concerning the Use and Necessity of Baptism against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the presence of Christ's Body in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,</hi> and the Sence of the Church about it in all Ages against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by that time the less diligent Reader has travell'd through these long Digressive Controversies, he forgets the first Conclusion, of the Unity of the Church from the Unity of right to these two Sacraments in it.</p>
               <p>But if the Reader would distinguish between the direct Course and Tenor of the Discourse it self, and these occasional Salleys, the whole Method of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would appear plain and perspicuous enough to an ordinary understanding. And for the proof of this I shall only refer him to his first Book upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the substance and groundwork of his other larger Treatises. And that is his discourse of the Right of the Churches in a Christian state. In which keeping close to his Argument, he has stated this and all other matters that he t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eats of with that clearness and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Reason, that whoever will be at the pains to run through that little Book
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42190:132"/>
can never complain of any Obscurity in his following Writings. Thus in his first Chapter, he lays the Foundations of the one Catholick Church upon the right of holding publick Assemblies for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God by Divine Authority, upon which he infers the power of the Keys, and from thence the power of granting Baptism, which suppose a settled Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of taking into or casting out of the Society of the Church, and unless those that are taken in are taken into the whole Society, and those that are cast out are cast out of the same, they are of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to the purpose to which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd. For unless a Man that is baptised in a particular Church have a right of Communicating with the whole Christian Church, if he change his Habitation, he must leave his Christianity behind him, or his right of holding publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies in the Church. And unless a man that is Excommunicate in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, be thereby cast out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all other Churches, it is but changing his Habitation, and he that was cut off as a corrupt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from the Body of Christ, shall elude the just Sentence of the Church, and not withstanding his Excommunication have as full a right to all Christian Priviledges as if he had never been proceeded against.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42190:133"/>
This is the main stress of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this Subject, which he farther shews by the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting and abating Pennance, that is connected with the Authority of Excommunication or inflicting Censures. And the force of this Argumentation is so evident and unavoidable, that I must confess my self not a little surprised how it was possible that our Learned Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could any way baulk or shift the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its Conviction. Especially when himself saw so clearly that an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Unity of Government in the Church is absolutely necessary to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; for though he founds it only upon the Confederation and consent of Churches and not any divine Command, yet he founds that Consent upon its neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to the Peace of the Church. <q>This course (says he) was very prudential <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 28.</note> and useful for preserving the truth of Religion and Unity of Faith, against Heretical Devices springing up in that free age, for maintaining Concord and good Correspondence among Christians, together with an Harmony in Manners and Discipline, for that otherwise Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom would have been shatter'd and crumbled into numberless Parties, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant in Opinion and Practice, and consequently alienated in affection,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42190:133"/>
which inevitably among most men doth follow difference of Opinion and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, so that in short time it would not have appeared what Christianity was, and consequently the Religion, being overgrown with differences and discords, must have perished.</q> Now is not this a very fair concession for one who is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring only to prove that this Unity of Government among several Churches is not necessary to the Church, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it Christianity must have certainly perish't. But this dropt from his own natural sense and ingenuity, that could not but acknowledge the Evidence of so clear a truth. But though it was an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter subversion of his whole design, yet it seems he was so intent in the pursuit of the Argument, that he had undertaken, that he overlook't even his own thoughts when they stood in his way. And now after this it is so easie to overthrow every particular part of his discourse, that were it not for his Authority, it would be needless. But because by reason of that it must be done, I shall do it with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brevity. First then, <hi>the name of Church is attributed to the whole body of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note> 
                  <hi>which implyeth Unity.</hi> And this he confesses it does, but determines not the kind or ground thereof, there being seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds, any whereof may suffice to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42190:134"/>
ground that comprehensive Appellation. But this by his own Confession is most apparently false, for it determines it self to that kind that consists in an Unity of Government, and the ground of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of it is its necessity to the Peace and Welfare of the Church, and therefore without this kind of Unity, no other sort will suffice to ground the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, because without it there can be no other Unity, this is necessary to all other sorts, and therefore without it they are not capable of that name. But to deal plainly, the Argument is not here sairly represented, for Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> does not argue merely from the name of the Church, but from the nature of the thing to which the name is applied, the Church being a Society or Body Politick, which is the first thing to be either prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or supposed in this dispute, and that being made out, then upon that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition the Argument is very clear, that one Church is one Society. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the name Church is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given in Scripture, not only to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, but to the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, that must be one Society united under one Government, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Government there is no Society, and therefore one Society founds one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the Argument being thus
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42190:134"/>
laid, its force lyes in the nature of things, not an empty name, and it makes its own way by its own reasonableness. Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we consider the Bond of this Society, <hi>viz.</hi> The Communion in Divine Offices, to which every Member of the Catholick Church having a right, the right of all must consist in that one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that one Communion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without one Government, so perspicuously does the Unity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church infer and inforce an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Government in it.</p>
               <p>The next Argument and Answer are to the same purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> from our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Holy Catholique Church, from whence Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> infers its Political Unity but our Author: says, it may as well be understood of any other kind of Unity. But to that it is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered, that as long as it is a Society (and so must all multitudes of men, if they are not riots) it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without this Unity. And therefore it is not precariously assumed and obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as is pretended, but warrants it self by the reason it brings along with it, that determines it to this special kind of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But he adds, the genuine sense of the meaning of this Article may be, <hi>our profession to adhere to the Body of Christians, and to maintain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42190:135"/>
and communicate in holy Offices with them, and to be willing to observe the Laws and Orders Establish't by the Authority or consent of Churches.</hi> This is very true, and very false, for if we are under no Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to all this, then all this meaning is Non-sence, and all these kinds of Unity are nothing; for if we make this professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own free choice and accord, then we may choose whether we will do all this or no, and it is all one whether we adhere to the body of Christians, in Charity, Communion, and Obedience to the Laws of the Church, or whether we refuse it; for if it be no duty by vertue of Obligation, then it may be left undone as well as done. But if all Christians and all Churches are obliged to it, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis true but then are they United under one Common Government, and the making and keeping of this Profession is not voluntary, but it is bound upon them by the indispensable Laws of Christianity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apostles delivered one Rule of faith to all Churches, the embracing of which, was a necessary condition to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into the Church, therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are combin'd together in one politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body. But it is answered;</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That from hence can only be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, That Christians should consent in one Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42190:135"/>
Yes, but an obligation to consent in one Faith makes them one Political Body, for what if any Church forsake this Rule, are they not punishable for it by other Churches? If they are, they are then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together in one Political Body: If they are not, then there is no remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Schisms and Heresies; and beside that, there may be as many different Faiths as Churches, and therefore if all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are obliged to an Unity of Faith, and if they cannot be so without an Unity of Government, then the consequence is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strong from the Unity of one to infer the Unity of the other.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, <hi>By this reason all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind must be United in one Political Body, because they are all bound to observe the same Lawes of Justice and Humanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make short of it, so they are; all Kingdoms and Common-wealths are as much bound to mutual Justice, as private Persons under one and the same Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if any Prince violate this Law by Invading his Neighbours Rights, he is or ought to be looked upon, by Gods natural Law, that equally provides for the good of all, as an Enemy and Traytor to the Society of Mankind, and it is the duty as well as interest of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes not only to oppose his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, but to the utmost of their power
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42190:136"/>
to proceed against him as an Enemy to Humane Society, and endeavour his Extirpation out of it. This upon the supposition of that one Law of Nature, that provides for the wellfare and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of all mankind, is an unavoidable consequence, &amp; so is it upon supposition of Unity ofFaith, that all that are bound to it, must be under one common Government. But because the World is ill-Govern'd, it is an unhappy way of arguing to make that a Precedent, that the Church should be so too. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4 God has granted to the Church certain Powers as the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys, a Power to Enact Laws, a power to Excommunicate, a Power to hold Assemblies, and a power to ordain Governours. But to all this it is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that these Powers are granted to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, not to the whole as distinct from the parts.</hi> They are granted to both, to every particular Church over its own Members, and to the whole Church over every particular Church, and <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as such it be distinct from all its parts,</hi> is a dispute too Metaphysical for me to undertake; but as consisting of them all, it has a Power over every one, and if there were no such Power common to all, it were in vain to grant any of these pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to each particular Church, because without that these would be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42190:136"/>
of their Force and Efficacy; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, supposing a power in a particular Church to punish an Offender by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, unless the force of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication reach to other Churches, it loses its effect, for notwithstanding that, he has a Right to Church-Membership in all the Churches through the whole World beside. And then he is as much cast out of the Church as àny man would be out of <hi>England,</hi> that is driven from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Village. So that from the right of exercising Discipline in each particular Church, the consequence is unavoidable, to infer the same common power in the Church Catholick. And that by our Authors leave was St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Inference. Not merely from these common Grants to infer this right in particular Churches, but to infer the same power in every part over it self, and in the whole over every part. And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is so perpetually beating upon this Argument, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enough wonder how it is possible that this learned Man should here so foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistake him, as if he had confined the exercise of all Ecclesiastical Discipline to each particular Church. But the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it I have sufficiently shewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. And beside what I have already alledged, there is one pregnant passage in his Epistle to <hi>Steven</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:42190:137"/>
against <hi>Marcian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles</hi> to this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 67.</note> purpose. <hi>Idcirco, frater charissime, oopio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum corpus est sacerdotum concordiae mutuae glutino atque unitatis vinculo copulatum, ut si quis ex collegio nostro haeresin facere, &amp; gregem Christi lacerare &amp; vastare tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit, subveniant caeteri, &amp; quasi pastores utiles &amp; misericordes, oves dominicas in gregem colligant.</hi> 
                  <q>Therefore, most dear Brother, is the body of the Priesthood so large combin'd together by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of concord and bond of Unity, that if any of our Colledges shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to raise Heresies and Schisms, the rest ought to come in, and as watchful and tender Pastors reduce the Lords Sheep to his Flock.</q> Every Bishop was to watch over his own Flock, but the whole Body or Colledge of Bishops over every Bishop, and therefore the power lodged in them all, was but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon power seated in the Catholick Church, so far was St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> from dreaming of the consinement of its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise to particular Churches. As for the following Arguments and Answers, they are to the same purpose with these I have already examined, and are for the most part repetitions of the same, and run into the same principles, that all Unity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but either Unity of Faith, or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agreement, both which are already
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42190:137"/>
so often proved to be no Unity without an Unity of Government, that to avoid being tedious I shall say no more but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine our Learned Author's own Arguments, and in them he is more unhappy then in his Answers, for they are so many very good Arguments against himself.</p>
               <p>First then, <hi>This being of so great weight would have been declared in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so it is, and nothing more so to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man of common sense. I will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all the World to shew me any one thing more earnestly enjoyn'd and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recommended then the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity among Christians, and then if without an Unity of Government, no other could be possibly preserv'd, as our Author has proved from common sense and common experience, that must be the thing principally commanded by all those injunctions. But such arguings as these suppose all men very great Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, as if they were not able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing unless it were beaten into them, whereas the Scripture supposes Mankind endued with common sense, that can apply general Laws to particular cases, without being guided, like Beasts,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42190:138"/>
every step they take. And thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour having instituted the Society of his Church, and established Governors in it, when he enjoins them to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve Unity, no Man can be so dull as not to understand, that he thereby requires them to make use of all means of obtaining it, but especially such as are necessary to its preservation in all Societies. And therefore whether this Unity of Government be injoin'd in express words in Scripture, I will not concern my self to enquire, because 'tis as clear there to all Men of common Sense, as if it were so injoined, and that is enough.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, <hi>There appears no such thing in the Apostolical practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What, did not the Apostles keep Unity among themselves? Did they not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church, as much as they could, by common consent? Did not every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Apostle give an account of his own Churches to the whole Colledge? Did they not advise together upon Emergent Controversies? And was not every Man concluded by the Vote of the whole Council? It is strange to me to see it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that they observed no such Polity in founding Christian Societies, when there is no one thing more observable in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42190:138"/>
their whole History, then their great care to maintain Peace, Love, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among all Churches, and that is the very establishment of this Polity; for a duty or obligation common to several Societies, supposes one Government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all, to which every Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is accountable for the discharge of its Duty. Every passage that recommends Union among the Members of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which Christ is Head, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command to this Duty; for he is Head of the Catholique Church, and the Catholique Church is his whole Body, and therefore particular Churches are only Members of it; and therefore as such, they are obliged by such Precepts to keep the Unity of the whole. If our Learned Author mean, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was not establisht between all Churches in the Apostles time; I will grant it, because it was impossible that it should, till the settlement of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in the World was brought to some perfection, and till then such a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Discipline could not be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in all places. For some of them travelling into remote Parts and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Churches there, such distant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches could not keep up any common Discipline among themselves, for want of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42190:139"/>
convenient Correspondence. But as far as this design could be put in practice, it was pursued by the Apostles, keeping Peace and Unity among all Neighbour Churches.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, <hi>The Fathers make the Unity of the Church to consist only in the Unions of Faith, Charity, Peace, not in this Political Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, suppose they do, yet if a Political Union be necessary to preserve those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Unions, that must be implyed in them. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, What Fathers make it to consist <hi>only</hi> in those Unions? Does any Father affirm that there is no other Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church, but only of Faith, Charity and Peace? that were to the purpose; but because they sometime speak of those Unions, to conclude that they affirm that there is no other, only shews a miserable scantiness of proof, and yet beside this the chief Passages that he alledges out of them refer to this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Union. His first Instance of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s refusing to receive <hi>Marcion</hi> to Communion, because he was Excommunicated by his own Father the Bishop of <hi>Sinope,</hi> a small Diocess in <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> is the most remarkable Precedent of this Unity of Discipline that he could
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42190:139"/>
have pitched upon in all the Records of the Ancient Church, for if they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bliged not to admit him into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one Church, when he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate in another, then they were under some Law of Government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both; how else should the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be obliged to put in execution a censure of the little remote Church of <hi>Synope?</hi> And yet too without this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the Discipline of the Church would be utterly defeated, for what had become of that, if it had not been of force at <hi>Rome,</hi> and every where else, as well as at home. And of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the known and famous case of <hi>Synesius,</hi> who, when he had Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated <hi>Andronicus</hi> and his Companions, requires of all Bishops in the World not to receive them to Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Excommunication, as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Unity of the Church which Christ has appointed. Though this was only for the greater caution, for though he had not given this notice, they were all obliged under the same penalty of Excommunication not to admit them to Communion, without their Bishop's Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate or Communicatory Letters; and as long as that rule was observed, which was till the time of the Usurpation, the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42190:140"/>
Discipline of every particular Church was without any trouble effectual in all Churches all the World over. But to return to <hi>Marcion,</hi> the reason, says our Author, why the <hi>Roman</hi> Church refused Communion to <hi>Mercion,</hi> when he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by his Father, was because his Father and they were of one Faith, and one Mind. And let it be the reason if he pleases, for what can follow thence, then that Unity of Faith obliges to Unity of Discipline? And that too is expresly enough infer'd in the following words, which he has omitted, <hi>We cannot,</hi> i. e. <hi>we ought not to act contrary to our fellow Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</hi> But after all we need only refer this whole matter to our Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own decision, who has given his judgment of it in these words: <q>It is a rule grounded upon apparent Equity, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 46.</note> and frequently declared by Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons, that no Church shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into its Protection or Communion, any Persons who are Excommunicated by another Church, or who do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themselves from it.</q> And this he proves by the Canon of the <hi>African</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> by the proceedings against <hi>Marcion,</hi> by St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s repulse of <hi>Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Novatian,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aelicissimus,</hi> by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42190:140"/>
of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> who was deposed for it, and by the Mandate of <hi>Synesius</hi> to all Christian Churches against <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus!</hi> And what can we desire more then this, That as this Rule was a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Law of the Christian Church, so it was grounded upon <hi>apparent Equity;</hi> and such Laws are Obligatory all the World over, because their Violation is apparent Iniquity; in short, it was no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Rule, but such an one as was its own obligation by its own intrinsick Goodness and Usefulness. As for our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Passages out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they do him as little Service as this Precedent of <hi>Marcion:</hi> For they expresly assert this Unity of Discipline in the Catholique Church. <hi>We are one Body by our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Religion, our Unity of Discipline, and our being in the same Covenant of hope.</hi> What can be more evident then that he makes the Unity of the Christian Body to consist in an Unity of Discipline as well as of Faith? And to the same purpose are all his other Passages out of the Ancients, that from the Unity of Faith in all Churches infer this Unity of Discipline, as is obvious to any one that will but peruse them. The Fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is only a Repetition of the two first, and therefore is already consider'd.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42190:141"/>
And so is the fifth, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Unity could not comport with the Apostolical State of the Church, when Christian Churches were founded in such distant places, as could not with convenience correspond. That is to say, it was not reduced to practice till it was practicable, and that I must acknowledge it was not in all places till after the Apostles, but as far as it could be obtain'd it was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observed from the beginning. The Sixth Argument taken from the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or liberty of particular Churches to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themselves, I have answered in the foregoing Discourse, by shewing its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency with its Subjection to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, because as our Learned Author here very well observes, <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Peace of the Church was preserved by Communion of all parts together, not by the subjection of the rest to one part.</hi> But the truth is, in prosecuting this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he has not only answered that but all the rest, by confessing the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity of this Political Verity; so that without it Christianity must have perished, by referring the judgment of the cause to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a double relation or capacity in every Bishop, one toward his own Flock, another toward the whole Church, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42190:141"/>
that is all the Political Union we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for.</p>
               <p>But Seventhly, This Political Unity does not accord with the nature of the Gospel, because it would bring too much Worldly State and Grandeur into the Church, as appears by the Papal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch And that is true, a Monarchical Unity would naturally bring in a World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom, but not such an Unity as consists in the Communion of all Parts together, and not in the Subjection of the rest to one part, as our Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it, or as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it, <hi>That not the infinite Power of one Church, but the Regular Power of all, is the mean provided by the Apostles for attaining Unity in the Whole.</hi> This is the state of the Question between us, and therefore all our Authors flourishes about the Papal Tyranny are nothing but flourish, because it is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Catholick Unity that we own, that it is the whole design of this work to prove, that it is a most execrable and impudent subversion of it. The <hi>8th</hi> and <hi>9th</hi> Arguments proceed upon the same Supposition of a Papal Monarchy. The tenth upon its no Necessity, against our Authors own confession. The <hi>11th</hi> and <hi>12th</hi> because such an Unity was never in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42190:142"/>
fact attain'd. If he means in full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, no more was ever any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore it is not to be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this World; but if he means that it was never put in practice, so as in good measure to attain its end, the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Church, down to the Papal Usurpation contradicts it, as appears by the whole Series of this Discourse. This is all that this learned Man has alledged upon this Argument, and from it the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I hope is sufficiently satisfied, how little that has to alledge for it self, for he was a person of that comprehensive mind that he never omitted any thing perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to his design, was never in debt to any cause that he undertook, nor ever fail'd that, but when that fail'd him, and therefore when we see so great a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to say so little in defence of this unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Assertion, that is the strongest proof that we can have, and perhaps stronger then any we could have had without it, that it is utterly indefensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <p>HAving in the former Part of this Discourse set down the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, both as to the Exercise of its own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction within it self, and its entire subjection to the Civil Powers, whilst it subsisted meerly upon its own Charter, without any Assistance or Protection from them: We are now arrived at a new state of things, as they stood under Christian Emperors. And here we shall find that the Government, and the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Church continued, as it had ever been within it self; and that the Christians, when the Empire was on their side, own'd the same kind of Subjection, and that upon the same Principles of Duty, to the Civil Government, that they had ever done in the times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; and when I have made good both these, it will make up a compleat Demonstration both of the unalienable Power of the Church within it self, and of the Sense of the Catholique Church,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42190:143"/>
unanimously condemning all resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Civil Government in any case, but most of all in the case of Religion. Under <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great it is not to be doubted but that they were forward enough in their Loyalty and Obedience to his Government, for all Men are for the Government, when the Government is for them; and therefore this part of the Enquiry concerning the Peaceable behaviour of Christians under his Reign is wholly superseded, because if they did their Duty; they had no motive or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation not to do it, submission to his Government being no less their Interest then their Duty, and therefore it was no matter of Praise or Vertue in them, if they own'd and honour'd that Power that was their peculiar Deliverance and Protection. So that this side of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie I shall altogether wave in this place, and only consider the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State of things under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where I once intended to have Exemplified the due Exercise of Regal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in the Christian Church from his Example.</p>
               <p>First, As a Sovereign Prince.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As a Christian Sovereign. And that</p>
               <p>First, In matters of Faith and Christian Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:42190:143"/>
Secondly, In matters of Discipline and Christian Government, and here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</p>
               <p>First, Of his Power in Summoning Councils, as Supreme Governor of a N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of that Obligation that he brings upon himself, by becoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>First, To abet the Power of the Church with his own Secular Authority.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To endow it with a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for the maintenance of the Service of God, and those that attend upon it.</p>
               <p>But upon more mature deliberation I thought it much more adviseable to forbear all such Reasonings and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, till I had first set down the whole matter of Fact, as things stood, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under his Reign, but all the Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperors, where we shall find Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents enough to make up a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of all the fore-mentioned Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But because this is the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Uniting Church and State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body, and because this Wise and Prudent Emperor seems to have exerted his Power in both exactly, according to the Rules both of Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I shall the more curiously consider the management of Affairs under his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42190:144"/>
Reign, whereby will be fully exemplified how this Union may be reduced to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, without any Diminution of either Power; or Confusion of one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that will plainly demonstrate wherein consists the Original Rights of the Church in a Christian State, and the due Exercise of the Supremacy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings over all Ecclesiastical Persons, Rights, and Powers. Now because the Supreme Power in all Government is the Legislative Power, and is the thing most disputed in this Controversie, I shall shew that he was so far from annexing this Power in the Church to the Imperial Crown, that he expresly asserted its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Right, and Protected it in its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise within it self, with all his zeal and ability. In that whenever he had a mind to have any Ecclesiastical Laws En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, he never presumed to do it by his own Authority, which he ever declared would have been no less Crime then to invade the Power of God himself, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways referred the matter to the Bishops in Council, and by their Canons he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his Ecclesiastical Laws, but never made any without or against them. And that is a full and clear acknowledgement of that antecedent Authority that they enjoyed by our Saviour's appointment,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42190:144"/>
when he constituted the Apostles and their Successors, Supreme Governors of his Church to the End of the World. So that in all Changes and Revolutions of things, their Government must remain unalterable and indefeasible, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Assistance or Opposition it met with from the Powers of the World, it still kept close to its own Original Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But then again, though this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour permitted the Church the just Exercise of its inherent right of Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ecclesiastical Laws, yet he did it so as to preserve to himself his own Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Prerogative of Supervising all their Acts and Proceedings, and either to give their Decrees force of Law, or wholly to reject them, as seem'd good to his Royal Wisdom. The two great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of the Church in his time (and the greatest that ever were at any time) were the Schism of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and the Heresie of the <hi>Arians;</hi> one concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a point of Doctrine, and another of Discipline; both which he referred not to his Senate, his Privy Council, or his <hi>Praefecti-Praetorio,</hi> but to the Judgment and Determination of Ecclesiasticks, to settle the Debates as they were directed by the Rules of Faith, and the Laws and Customs of the Church, but so as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42190:145"/>
to himself Supreme Inspection of the whole matter, as far as it concerned the Peace of Church and State: Which in all Christian Common-wealths is the same thing, for there all Ecclesiastical Schisms are really so many breaches of the Civil Peace.</p>
               <p>First, As for the Schism of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> it broke out about the beginning of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign, most say the very same year 306, upon occasion of the Laws concerning the Restitution of the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> by which any Clergy-man that had fallen in Persecution, or committed any other enormous Crime, was to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by perpetual deposition, so that though upon Penance and Satisfaction he might be received to Lay-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he was never to be restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his Office in the Church. Thus one of the three <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops, that had been decoyed to the Consecration of <hi>Novatian</hi> in order to a Canonical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his Schism, was upon submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and confession of his fault, received by <hi>Cornelius</hi> into Lay-Communion, as he declares in his Synodical Epistle to <hi>Fabian</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Apud Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 43.</note> And so <hi>Trophimus</hi> a Bishop, that had promoted the same Schism in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, was upon his Repentance
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42190:145"/>
absolved, but yet only admitted to Lay-Communion, as St <hi>Cyprian</hi> declares in his Epistle to <hi>Antonianus, Sic tamen admissus est Trophimus ut Laicus communicet, non quasi locum Sacerdotis Usurpet.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Trophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was so received, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate as a Laick, not that he might Usurp the place of a Priest.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And so the same St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> with great <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 65.</note> indignation complains of the violation of the same Rule by <hi>Fortunatian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Assur, Graviter &amp; dolenter motus sum, fratres charissimi, quod cognoverim Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natianum quondam apud vos Episcopum, post gravem lapsum ruinae suae, pro integro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunc agere velle, &amp; Episcopatum sibi vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare caepisse.</hi> 
                  <q>I am grievously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to hear that <hi>Fortunatian</hi> heretofore your Bishop, should after so foul a fall, presume to take upon himself the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Office.</q> And so in the Case of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silides</hi> and <hi>Martialis Spanish</hi> Bishops, that had sacrificed, and yet challenged their Bishopricks, he sets it down as a judged Case. <hi>That it is in vain for such men</hi>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42190:146"/>
over the Church of God, not to offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when long since it was agreed by all the Bishops in the whole World, and particularly</hi> Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius <hi>our Collegue, a good and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bishop, whom it pleased our Lord to honour with the Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Penance, but never to the Order of the Clergy and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being the received and settled Discipline of the Christian Church, it happened that under the Persecution by <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were put to a new sort of Tryal, for whereas the old way was to bring them to sacrifice the Idol Gods, in this Rescript of these Emperors they were required up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death to deliver up their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42190:146"/>
whence they that did so, had the name of <hi>Traditores,</hi> and were justly esteem'd by the Church Guilty of the same Crime of Apostacy as those that sacrificed, and therefore lyable to the same punishment. And this it was that gave occasion to the Schism of the <hi>Donatists, viz.</hi> That <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> was either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Traditor, and so uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving holy Orders, or that he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by <hi>Faelix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aptung</hi> a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, and so uncapable of giving them. And had their pretence been true, and so judged by the Church, the <hi>Donatists</hi> had been no Schismaticks, because by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary Laws of the Church, <hi>Caecilian</hi> must have been excluded from any capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Office in it. And therefore this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie that created so much trouble to the Christian World, was not at first about any difference of Opinion: for both parties were agreed that no Traditor could be ordain'd to the Office of a Bishop, and that every Bishop that was a Traditor, ought to be deposed from it. But the only dispute was whether the Persons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, were really guilty of the Crimes laid to their Charge. If they were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and so pronounced by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, then after that the Accusers were apparent Schismaticks,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42190:147"/>
in dividing Communion from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bishop. This was the only point at the first Rupture, but when an open Schism was made the Schismaticks soon run into all the extravagancies of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> and there was then no pure Church in the World but their own, and all Christians that were not of their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were no better then <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> whilst all that came from other Churches into theirs, thereby became the only true Children of God. And for that reason they admitted Converts from the Catholicks to their Communion upon the same terms that they did the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> If they were in Orders, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain'd them, if <hi>Laicks,</hi> they rebaptised them, because whatever was done in the Catholick Communion could be of no Effect, as being done out of the Christian Church. These and a great many more Enormities we shall find in their History, because as their Faction grew in strength, so it emproved in Insolence, till it run it self into all manner of rudeness and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and at last perisht in meer Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that was the Case of this Schism, that when there was once a form'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty set up against the Civil Government, all people of perverse tempers naturally flock't into it, not for any love of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42190:147"/>
put purely to rub and gratifie the Scab of their innate peevishness, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they were flatter'd into an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of higher Priviledges and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives then their Neighbours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enjoyed that drunken and transporting pleasure of looking down upon them with holy scorn and disdainful Pity. And by this Artifice they drew almost all <hi>Africa</hi> after them, the <hi>Africans</hi> being of all People most addicted to Innovation, and though the People were outragious in their zeal, yet for what they never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood nor enquired. Insomuch that the Leaders and Writers themselves, that followed after, were utterly ignorant of the Nature and the Rise of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, as <hi>Optatus</hi> plainly proves that <hi>Parmenian</hi> himself was, though he was the Metropolitan of the Schism. And in the Conference at <hi>Carthage</hi> under <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> when they were only put to it to shew in what they differ'd from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and upon what grounds they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Party was so amazed and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with their own want of Pretence, that they were utterly vanquisht only because they could not tell what they would have.</p>
               <p>But of the Progress of this Schism we shall account afterwards, as for its Birth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Pride and Peevishness, supporting it self with a bold and bottomless Lye. Some few persons had in pursuance of their own private Piques and Passions, set up a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against their Bishop, and then to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie themselves load him with all the foul Stories that they could invent, no matter whether true or false, that is all one to the Rabble, who easily run away with any thing that is Factious or ill-natur'd, and if they can but once get in numbers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make up a Faction, all Factions are Snow-Balls. The Story is this, upon the death of <hi>Mensurius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage, Caecilian</hi> was chosen by the Majority of Votes to succeed against the competition of <hi>Botrus</hi> and <hi>Celesius,</hi> and received his Consecration from <hi>Faelix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi> and some of the Neighbour Bishops of the same Province, but from none of <hi>Numidia,</hi> which <hi>Optatus</hi> says, was done by the contrivance of the Competitors, presuming to carry the Plurality of Votes; but St. <hi>Austin</hi> says it was done in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with an immemorial custom, that the Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> was always ordain'd by the Bishops of his own Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; but because he brings no proof of his Assertion, I am afraid it is one of his bold and lavish sayings, when he is in hast or distress; for next to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42190:148"/>
loose and fluent way of Writing, has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd more mistakes in the Records of the Church, then any other of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and men that are so voluminous and write so quick, cannot avoid stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into multitudes of hasty and careless slips. And therefore the Authority of <hi>Optatus</hi> is here rather to be followed, that the disgust was taken by the <hi>Numidian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops because they were not call'd to the Consecration, &amp; this is made the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by the peculiar state of the <hi>African</hi> Church, for though other Provinces were Govern'd by their own Provincial Synods, by whom their own Metropolitans were ordain'd, yet this Church, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it consisted of three Provinces, <hi>Africa</hi> properly so call'd, <hi>Numidia</hi> and <hi>Mauritania,</hi> as they reckoned up in the Council under St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> about rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Hereticks, kept so close a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among themselves, as if they had been but one Province. And we find them all along not acting apart, but all together, as one Common-Council. And that I guess to be the Sense of the words in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epistle to <hi>Cornelius, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs fusa est nostra Provincia; habet etiam Numidiam &amp; Mauritanias duas sibi cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</hi> Where the mention of the <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniae duae</hi> is supposed by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42190:149"/>
to have crept into the Text out of some Marginal Notes, and so it must have done, for there was no such division of that Province, that we ever read of, till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s new division of the Empire, and therefore the true ancient reading must have been this, <hi>habet etiam Numidiam &amp; Mauritaniam sibi coherentes;</hi> but take which reading we will, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s plain meaning can be no other then this, That beside his own peculiar Province of <hi>Africk</hi> properly so called, of which <hi>Carthage</hi> was the Metropolis, he had two other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>Numidia</hi> and <hi>Mauritania,</hi> insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annex't to his Communion, by which means he tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> that he was able to do him so great service in <hi>Africk.</hi> So that the words are not to be understood, as they commonly are, as if he had been the Metropolitan of those three Provinces, but that he was Metropolitan of that Province, to which the two other were United in a particular Communion.</p>
               <p>But to let pass these Critical Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, <hi>Caecilian</hi> is no sooner entered upon his See, but he demands of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Church the Goods that he found delivered to them in an Inventory left by his Predecessor <hi>Mensurius.</hi> But they having embezell'd the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of the Church, and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

I remember <hi>Livy</hi> somewhere tells us, that the <hi>Romans</hi> in times of great Pestilence and Mortality, when they burnt their dead bodies not in single Urns, but in vast Heaps and Piles, were careful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix the womens bodies with the men, as being more unctuous and combustible in themselves, and so more apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the fire to the other Corpses, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42190:150"/>
otherwise would have burnt but slowly without them. This is the very practice of the Incendiaries of the Church in all Ages, when they would enflame the men into a Combustion, they always first set fire on the women, and when they would burn down the House, they thrust the Firebrand into the Thatch, that both easily takes Fire it self, and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs it to the solid Timber. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in our History. The party being thus cemented together by Ambition, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Revenge, they write to <hi>Secundus Primate</hi> of <hi>Numidia,</hi> &amp; to the otherBishops of that Province that were not invited to the Election and Consecration of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> to depose him as having been ordain'd by a Traditor. They met at <hi>Cirta</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call'd <hi>Constantina,</hi> upon pretence of Electing a new Bishop of that Diocess, and having chosen one <hi>Paulus</hi> a very ill man, and a known Traditor, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <note place="margin">

But upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every particular Person, they all Convict one another of Guilt, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve one another by mutual consent. This being done, they adjourn to <hi>Carthage,</hi> summon <hi>Caecilian</hi> to appear before them,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42190:151"/>
but he refuses, they being only a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his profess't Enemies, and upon it they immediately depose him for his Obstinacy, and put <hi>Majorinus,</hi> who was Chaplain to Madam <hi>Lucilla,</hi> in his place, and send their Encyclical Letters to all the Bishops in <hi>Africa,</hi> to signifie that they had renounced Communion with <hi>Caecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and all his Adherents as Traditors. And this being done, the people were told that <hi>Caecilian</hi> was no Church-Officer, that under him they could have no true Sacraments, nor enjoy any means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but were in the same forlorn condition with Pagans and Idolaters. But with themselves were the pure Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ordinances, and all that were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Church, were made Holy without spot or wrinkle. Amongst them the most forward of the Faction was <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus à Casâ Nigrâ,</hi> who being the first that set up a Conventicle, gave name to the Schism. And he having a Natural Faculty of Canting and Insinuating into the Affections of the Rabble, soon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled so great a number into his Party, that they forsook their private Meetings, and built publick Churches, and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed openly against the Idolatry of <hi>Caecilian</hi> and the Catholicks (for that is the custom of all Fanaticks to improve
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42190:151"/>
every thing into Idolatry) bemean the miserable state of all that would not leave that to joyn with them, and scare the People with perpetual Alarms of certain ruine and destruction if they will not come out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> By these Arts they prevail every where, and the Schism is on a suddain spread all over <hi>Africk,</hi> so as not only to enflame the Church, but to endanger the publick Peace. About which time <hi>Constantine</hi> having vanquish't <hi>Maxentius,</hi> he thereby added <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> to his Government, and for the encouragement of Christianity in <hi>Africa,</hi> he sends <hi>Caecilian</hi> large sums of Money to be distributed by him among the Clergy of the three Provinces, and grants them immunities from all publick Burthens. And about the same time, the <hi>Donatists</hi> finding themselves over power'd by the Catholicks, present <hi>Anulinus</hi> the Pro-Consul with a Petition of Appeal to the Emperor; and though afterward, when they found themselves check't by the Civil Government, their great Clamour was, <hi>Quid Christianis cum Regibus? Aut quid Episcopis cum Palatio?</hi> 
                  <q>What have Christians to do with Kings, or Bishops with the Court?</q> Yet they were (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> justly upbraids their dis-ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) the first Christians that ever fled
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42190:152"/>
from the Judgment of the Church, to the Civil Government. Though as for this first Appeal, this is to be said for them, that they did not Appeal to the Emperour's own Judgment, but only Petition'd him, That he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to appoint them Judges of the Cause in the Church of <hi>France,</hi> because that Church having wholly escaped the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, the Bishops of it would be more unconcern'd, and impartial Judges of the Cause of the Traditors. Whereas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were so divided and engaged at home, that it was not possible to have any fair determination in <hi>Africa.</hi> And though the Request hitherto was not very unreasonable, yet the Emperour was highly displeased at it, out of that tender care and solicitude that he ever had for the Peace and Concord of the Christian Church. But however for once he Commissions three <hi>French</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, together with <hi>Melchiades</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to hear the Cause, who calling fifteen other <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops to their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, undertake its judgment, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which Ten Bishops of each Party are commanded from <hi>Africa</hi> to attend the Council at <hi>Rome.</hi> Where three days are spent in Examination of Witnesses, but the <hi>Donatists</hi> bringing no proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42190:152"/>
                  <hi>Caecilian</hi> himself, the Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him innocent. And whether <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> who Ordain'd him, were a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or not, they would not enter into the Enquiry, as altogether remote from the cause of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> because though he were to be deposed by the Canons of the Church, yet till those Canons were put in Execution by the Sentence of the Church, all the Acts of his Office were good and valid. But on the other side, <hi>Caecilian</hi> plyed the <hi>Donatists</hi> so home with their own Weapon of Accusation, and their foul dealings at <hi>Cirta,</hi> and the briberies of Madam <hi>Lucilla,</hi> that they were forced to quit the Council. And yet that was so moderate in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against them, that it Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated none of them, but only <hi>Donatus à Casis Nigris,</hi> that was found guilty of divers other foul Crimes, and the Author of all this mischief. But the rest were invited to return to the Unity of the Church, and offer'd the continuance of of whatever preferments they had in it, though they had been Ordain'd by <hi>Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> or any others in a State of Schism.</p>

to follow, and every one takes his own way, so as that by the great variety of Opinions they have run the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into confusion.

                  <q>Things so many and so great, done in so famous a Council of Bishops known all the World over, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edicts made by the Emperor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Donatists,</hi> could not possibly be altogether unknown to <hi>Optatus.</hi>
                  </q> And therefore this part of the story must needs have been lost, either through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of time, or the fraud of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> which is most likely, for there was not any one Ancient Book, whose Copies were so corrupt and confused as this of <hi>Optatus,</hi> as <hi>Baldwin</hi> justly complains. But which way soever it came to pass, this part of the story being lost, and so
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42190:153"/>
the Transactions that hapned some years after, as the Appeal of the <hi>Donatists</hi> from the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> and his detaining <hi>Caecilian</hi> at <hi>Bress,</hi> immediately following in this place, they are supposed to have been done at this time, though they hap'ned not till after the Council of <hi>Arles.</hi> Thus <hi>Baronius</hi> having procured from <hi>Petrus Pithaeus Constantine</hi>'s Letter to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Bishops upon the <hi>Donatists</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to himself, after the Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them at <hi>Arles,</hi> and divers other Papers relating to that Council, because in <hi>Optatus</hi> they immediately follow the Council of <hi>Rome,</hi> he has thrust them in there, to the great confusion of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if they had been done immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after that Council, when they ought to have been placed after the Council of <hi>Arles.</hi> And this is evident enough from the words themselves, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow the Sentence of <hi>Melchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Sufficit ergo &amp; Donatum tot Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis esse percussum, &amp; Caecilianum tanto judicio esse purgatum, &amp; tamen Donatus appellandum esse ab Episcopis credidit. Ad quam Appellationem Constantinus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator sic respondit, ô rabida furoris au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia; sicut in causis Gentilium fieri so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Appellationem interposuerunt.</hi> Now
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42190:154"/>
beside that this Answer of <hi>Constantine</hi> is certainly known to have been made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Appeal from <hi>Arles,</hi> the <hi>Tot Sententiae</hi> against <hi>Donatus</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, could not be till after the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that great Council; for before that, there was but one Sentence against him, <hi>viz.</hi> by the small Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore these Appeals from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Judgments, and so great a Judicature (as <hi>Optatus</hi> speaks of) must have been after the Council of <hi>Arles.</hi> And that puts an end to the dispute among Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, when the <hi>Donatists</hi> first Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to the Emperor from the Episcopal Judgment, whether after the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> or not till after the Council at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Baronius, Binius, Petavius, Labbè</hi> and others will have the first Appeal to have been from the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> because it immediately follows so in <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus.</hi> But this is confuted by <hi>Valesius</hi> (a Man learned and curious) with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pregnant passages out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> expresly attesting that the <hi>Donatists</hi> only complain'd against the first Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> but Appeal'd from the second at <hi>Arles.</hi> And their different behaviour towards these Councils is every where so carefully remarked by him, that the Testimonies cannot be avoided. But
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42190:154"/>
then the Learned Man knows not how to bring off <hi>Optatus,</hi> but by leaving him under an enormous mistake of Memory, applying that which was done after the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> to the Council of <hi>Rome;</hi> or by some defect and corruption in the Copies, which he only suspects without assigning any ground or reason for his suspition. But if he had only a little consider'd that the whole Story of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> is omitted in the Books of <hi>Optatus;</hi> and that this Passage of the Appeal to <hi>Constantine</hi> relates to <hi>divers Sentences,</hi> which could not be till after the Sentence at <hi>Arles,</hi> he could not but have easily seen where lay the defect of the Copies. To which might be added, that this defect reaches not to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Arles</hi> alone, but to some part of the Council of <hi>Rome;</hi> for whereas that consisted of a double Sentence, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> and the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Donatus,</hi> the latter part is wholly wanting in <hi>Optatus,</hi> and immediately after the Sentence of Absolution follow the words <hi>Sufficit ergo Donatum tot Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiis esse percussum, &amp;c.</hi> From all which it is put past all doubt where lyes the breach of the Copies, and how far it extends, <hi>viz.</hi> From the absolving Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Caecilian</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Appeal
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42190:155"/>
of the Schismaticks from the Council at <hi>Arles.</hi> And this being observed, the story runs smoth and clear, that has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been so confused and involved, as to be thought to report the same Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from both Councils, though it is evident that it can agree but to the last. Now this one difficulty being overcome, our Passage after it will be easie and pleasant, all the rest of the story lying in its due and proper order.</p>
               <p>And what effect the Sentence of the Council at <hi>Rome</hi> had upon the Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, we have a distinct account in the Emperors own Letter to <hi>AElasius,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>AElianus,</hi> his Praefect of <hi>Africa.</hi> For whereas we might reasonably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that they should have acquiesced in the Authority of so fair, so grave and so gentle a Sentence, they return home exasperated with rage, and swoln with insolence, raise new Tumults, perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tease the Emperor with fresh Tales, and Complaints against <hi>Caecilian,</hi> and represent him as utterly unworthy of any Office in the Christian Church. And when the Emperor replies that this was all in vain with him, because the whole business had been so fairly determin'd, by fit and unexceptionable Judges; they cry out, That their cause had not a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42190:155"/>
Tryal, that the Council was packt, that the proceedings were clancular, and the Judgment partial. The Emperour, such was the clemency of his Nature, and his tender care of the Peace of the Church, condescends to their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Summons the famous Council at <hi>Arles,</hi> of a much greater number of Bishops, and more unknown to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as coming out of the distant parts of Christendom, to review the Decree of the Council at <hi>Rome.</hi> This Council meets in the year 314, where the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks repeat their old Stories against <hi>Caecilian,</hi> but without any other proof then Popular Report raised by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and therefore were not only condemn'd by the Council, but rejected with scorn and derision. And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like attempts of Forgery for the time to come, they make Canons to suppress that general way of Accusation, as Canon the 13th, they Ordain, That no Man shall be Convicted of having been a Traditor by bare Testimony, but by publick Acts and Records, and if any Man from that time be so Convicted, that then he shall be degraded from his Holy Orders; but if before his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he have Ordain'd any, that his Crime shall be no prejudice to the validity of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42190:156"/>
his Ordination. And Canon the 14th they Decree, That whoever falsely Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their Brethren (as the Schismaticks had <hi>Caecilian</hi> and <hi>Faelix)</hi> should not be received into Communion even at the hour of death, which was the severest Sentence in the Christian Church. This shameful overthrow makes great numbers of the Schismaticks quit the Faction, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themselves to their Bishop: But the more stubborn and Seditious are not ashamed to Appeal (as it is their first Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal) in the Council it self to the Emperor, and this is signified by the Council to him by Letter, to know his farther will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. From whence it is evident that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himself was not present in Council, as 'tis commonly supposed; and <hi>Baronius, Binius,</hi> and most of the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, are so civil to him as to excuse his presence, though a Lay-man, because the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie was not about any matter of Faith, but a particular matter of Fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Caecilian.</hi> And it is agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that of all such matters Lay-men are as competent Judges as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. But however that may be, and what Right Sovereign Princes have of sitting in Council, whatever the matter of Debate may be, I shall discourse in its proper place. It is certain here that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42190:156"/>
the Emperor was not present in Council, because they signified their proceedings to him by Letter, which if he had been present, they could or need not have done. And beside that, the thing is more then plain enough by the Appeal it self, for if <hi>Constantine</hi> had been there present, to what purpose was it for the <hi>Donatists</hi> to remove the Cause to him, that would have been only to Appeal from himself to himself. But he being inform'd of the design by the Letter from the Council, replies to it, with great detestation of the Schismaticks Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Perverseness, and wonders how they dare to Appeal to his Judgment, when they were already Condemn'd by the Judgment of God in the Votes of the Bishops, who in these matters judged in God's stead, and by his appointment. And therefore he esteems their Appeal as no less then Treason and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God himself. But however he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises them to patience, and to give the Schismaticks some time to consider, and if they persisted in their stubbornness, to give themselves no farther trouble about them, but to repair to their several Homes. And seeing the Schismatiques had been so prophane as to make their Appeal to him, he would take care to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42190:157"/>
provide them Guards for their safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to his Court, <hi>Ut ibi sibi mortem pervideant,</hi> which whatever it signifies, is a very high threatning. So that after all, I do not find that <hi>Constantine</hi> ever in the least accepted of their Appeal, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it as no less sin then an affront to God himself, but only resolved now to proceed against them, as a Sovereign Prince, with all severity, as factious and seditious Persons in the Empire.</p>
               <p>And about this time was the business of <hi>Faelix</hi> of <hi>Aptung</hi> examin'd by <hi>AElian</hi> the Proconsul of <hi>Africa;</hi> for though it is generally supposed that this was done before the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> yet it is evident by the Acts of the Court, that it was done the same year, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there was no notice taken of it in the Council, and therefore the first account of it, that was return'd to the Emperour, must have been after its disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. And this it was, The Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks making such perpetual Clamours about <hi>Faelix</hi> his being a Traditor, and though it was nothing to the Cause of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> yet the Emperour having caught them in so many Factions and Stories, suspects every thing that they say of falshood, and therefore writes to his Proconsul, to enquire into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42190:157"/>
of Fact upon the place where it was transacted. He accordingly Examines all the Officers, that had belonged to the Court of Inquisition at <hi>Aptung</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> at which time and place the Fact was laid against <hi>Faelix,</hi> who all acquit him from any such Crime. And whereas the main Accusation was taken from some passages in a Letter of one <hi>Caecilian</hi> a <hi>Duumvir</hi> of the City of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung</hi> to <hi>Faelix, Ingentius</hi> a publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary confesses, That he was hired and suborn'd by the Schismatiques to forge the Epistle, and foist it into the Records of the Court. Upon which he is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to close Prison, and an account of the whole matter return'd to the Emperour, who now supposing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so fowl a discovery, if it were made publique over the Christian World, it would so shamefully expose the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Schismatiques, that they could never have the confidence to appear more in a Cause so foul and base. But what method to take he could not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly resolve, one while he thinks of sending Commissioners, but then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Obstinacy of the Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, he fears nothing will be effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, but by himself, and therefore resolves upon a Journey into <hi>Africk,</hi> to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42190:158"/>
settle the whole matter there, but upon what occasion I know not, he changes his mind and summons the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to appear before himself at <hi>Rome,</hi> and writes to the present Proconsul <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianus</hi> to send <hi>Ingentius</hi> thither with a good Guard, <hi>That he might publickly shame those seditious and troublesom Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that have the confidence to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Clamours, and raise false Stories against their Bishop, that so these Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities and Contentions being quell'd, the People may be brought to attend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the Church, with due Reverence, and without brawls and discords.</hi> They are the Emperour's own words; but for what cause 'tis not Recorded: <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> appears not, and the <hi>Donatists</hi> that came, either finding themselves disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the coming of <hi>Ingentius,</hi> or for some other reason, endeavour to make their escape, but some of them are detain'd by force and sent in close cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody to <hi>Milan.</hi> But those that Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>AEgypt,</hi> raised such Tumults there, as put the whole Country into an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, of which the Emperour is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Celsus</hi> the Governor, who orders him at present to take no notice of their disorders, but to hasten <hi>Caecilian</hi> and his Accusers to <hi>Milan.</hi> And here I have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42190:158"/>
a strong fancy ought to have come in the mutilated Story of <hi>Caecilian</hi>'s consine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Brixia</hi> in <hi>Optatus;</hi> for as it follows after the <hi>Chasm,</hi> in which the whole Story of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> is lost, so it agrees with <hi>Constantine</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with the variety of his own Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, and the Transactions at <hi>Milan.</hi> For <hi>Brixia</hi> or <hi>Bress</hi> lay not far from that City, so that both of them might make up the Scene of this Affair. And therefore when the Schismatiques gain'd leave to return home, and procured <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> to be detain'd, it was probably up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their dismission, upon some change of the Emperour's Resolutions. But when they came home, they betake themselves to the constant Artifice of all Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, to keep up their Faction by tricks and lyes. And therefore they raise mighty brags of their great Victory, and tell the People that <hi>Caecilian</hi> was Condemn'd, and Imprison'd by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur, and when once they had raised this lye among the Party, it was easie to keep it up for ever, insomuch that we find it confidently insisted upon, in the Conference at <hi>Carthage,</hi> an hundred years after. Upon this <hi>Caecilian</hi> gets leave to return home for undeceiving the People, by which means the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

are raised, and the Tumults enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that occasions two Letters from the Emperor, the former to <hi>Celsus,</hi> to send <hi>Caecilian</hi> and his Accusers, the latter dated from <hi>Brixia</hi> to the <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops, commanding their immediate appearance, and withal assuring them, that if they can but make good any one Article against <hi>Caecilian,</hi> it should weigh as much with him, as if they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the whole Charge, and this I suppose produced the Meeting at <hi>Milan,</hi> but whatever becomes of this conjecture of mine, and fragment of <hi>Optatus;</hi> it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there they met, where all the foul dealings of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> especially the forgery of <hi>Ingentius</hi> being openly exposed, it is needless to tell what was the event, when it could be no other then that the Emperor should publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare the innocence of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> and scoure away the Schismaticks as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of incorrigible Knaves. But here St. <hi>Austin</hi> is concern'd to excuse the Emperour for judging an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical cause after the Episcopal Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a thousand excuses are inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him by the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers; as his being then but a Novice in the Faith, and not sufficiently inform'd of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church; or his being tired
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42190:159"/>
out by the restless importunity of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> so that he could enjoy no quiet till he yielded to it. These things may be true, but they are needless, for though it may not be proper for a Lay-man to judge in Ecclesiastical Causes, yet it may not be altogether unlawful, especially when the Peace of the State depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and that was the Emperour's case at this time, all <hi>Africa</hi> was in an Uproar, and in danger to be lost by the Sedition; and therefore it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd him to exert his own Power, as he would secure so great a part of his Empire, and upon that reason he might take the Judgment upon himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to restrain the <hi>Donatists</hi> from raising Disturbances and Seditions in the State. Though when all is done, it is certain that the Emperour never accepted the Appeal, nay that he protested against it, as an affront to the Divine Authority, and setting up his own Power above God's, appears not only from his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Bishops at <hi>Arles,</hi> but his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Declarations of it. And therefore it is not to be supposed that he would be prevail'd with to take upon himself a Judgment that he so solemnly disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore his design in hearing the Cause after Judgment, was not to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42190:160"/>
judge, but to expose the Schismatiques, or to suffer them to expose themselves. For the cause was already so fully and clearly determin'd at the Council, that it could not admit any Review, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were so restless to have it re-heard before the Emperour himself, he at last seem'd to condescend to their importunity, when he knew it would prove their fatal overthrow, for it is observable that he would not meddle with the business at all, till he had the discovery of <hi>Ingentius</hi> his Forgery in his Pocket, with which they were so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, that instead of following their Suit, it utterly dispersed them. And for the very same reason, he gave them other Hearings after his own Imperial Judgment, only to give them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter scope to lay open themselves and their dishonesty to the World, as will appear anon in the foul discovery of <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarius</hi> the Deacon.</p>

For that they gave out to justifie their stubborness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Imperial Edicts, that whatever punishments the Emperor decreed against them, they were ready to undergo as Martyrs for the truth of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they were so far from dreading any severity, that they desired the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Penal Laws against them. And
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42190:161"/>
so they persist railing at the Emperor for denying Justice, and reviling the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks for inciting him to Persecution. Till at length he is forced to Enact severe Laws against them, and first of all, all their Meeting-houses are confiscated to the Crown, and accordingly seized on, and it hapned very luckily at that time that one <hi>Nundinarius</hi> a Deacon of the Donatists, who was privy to the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Schism, at their meeting at <hi>Cirta,</hi> discovers the whole Conspiracy to <hi>Zenophilus</hi> the Pro-Consul of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and proves both by publick Records, and a great number of Witnesses, that <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> whom they had made Bishop of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and the most facti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very being signified by <hi>Zenophilus</hi> to the Emperor, together with a Catalogue of the Seditious Practices of <hi>Silvanus,</hi> he condemns both <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ring-leaders of the Faction, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Banishment, and that is the utmost severity that he ever proceeded to, for though some of them were sentenced to death, yet such was his natural Clemency,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42190:161"/>
that he turn'd it into banishment and thus by seising their Conventicles and sending away their Leaders, he gave himself ease and quiet for some time from their distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances. But now behold the constant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of all Schismaticks, to be sure to beleager the State, when ever they find it in any distress, and to gain their own ends out of the publick Necessities, and to make what demands they please, when the Government is not in a condition to contend with them. And thus about this time the War between <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> breaking out, the Donatists presently accost the Emperor with a bold Petition, both for granting liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and recalling <hi>Silvanus</hi> and his Collegues from Banishment, are so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to tell him in broad expression, that they would suffer a thousand deaths before they would be reconciled to that <hi>Prelatical Knave</hi> of his, <hi>Caecilian.</hi> And yet so involved were the Emperors Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at that time, that he was forced to grant whatever they demanded, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Verinus</hi> his Vice-Roy in <hi>Africk</hi> to leave them to their own Liberty. And that they used with all manner of Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, whilst the Civil War lasted, neither now would they be satisfied with their own Liberty at home, but endeavour
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42190:162"/>
to spread their Schism into all parts of the Catholick Church, and poyson all the Emperors Dominions with the Spirit of Faction and Sedition. What Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they sent into other Churches is not so well known, but to <hi>Rome</hi> they send one <hi>Victor</hi> as Titular Bishop of that See, who took upon himself all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But whilst he is designing this great and pious work, news is brought him of a worse Flame broke out at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> by means of the Heresy of <hi>Arrius,</hi> that had already engaged not only all <hi>Egypt,</hi> but was blown over into <hi>Asia,</hi> and for the suppression of this dangerous Schism (for so at first he look't upon it,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42190:162"/>
and therefore only endeavoured to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Parties) he Summons the Great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to which among the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Famous Bishops that were present at it, <hi>Caecilian</hi> was summon'd, but no Bishops of the <hi>Pars Donati,</hi> as supposing them out of the Communion of the Catholick Church. But after this Council we hear little or no thing of the Donatists in this Emperor's Reign, himself and the Christian Bishops being wholly employed, in quenching that more fatal and pernicious Heresie, and how effectually and speedily he root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Heresie it self, by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church abetted with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Power, we shall demonstrate in its proper place. For though after the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie it self was vanquish't by this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the Hereticks or rather their Friends, created him infinite trouble about it, by Oblique Arts and for other ends; yet this I affirm, and shall prove, that they durst never own the Heresie it self, not only in his time but in all the time of his Son <hi>Constantius</hi> till the end of his Reign. And now here I ought to break off the Story of the <hi>Donatists</hi> with this Emperors History, but their Progress in Schism af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his indulgence, is such a natural repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the growth and improvement of Peevishness, if once left to its own l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42190:163"/>
that I cannot forbear to represent their whola Story at one View, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because it suits a Parallel case that lyes at our own doors, so exactly, that two Indentures cannot be more like then these two Schisms. And the truth of it is, all Schisms are but the same, for though they are raised about different matters, yet they all move in the very same track of Sedition, till from meer peevishness they advance to the heighth of Cruelty, and end in Rebellion; and it is nothing else then the natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ill-nature and passion, if but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to pursue the bent of its own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. And therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if all Schismaticks, howsoever distant in Time, Place, or Interest, follow one another so accurately in the very same steps, when they are all acted by one and the same Principle of Nature, then it is for Colts to be wild in all Parts of the World, if never brought under the Whip and Bridle. And that is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test benefit of Government, to be a curb to the ill-natur'd Passions of Mankind; for without that Man would be the most unruly of all Beasts, especially the meaner sort of the kind, the Rabble, that are ever drawn in, to be the chief Actors in these Religious Tumults. And that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42190:163"/>
is the reason, that these are more Cruel and Barbarous then other Seditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are carried on by the wildest part of Mankind, that have heightned and enflamed their natural Salvageness, with the heats of Enthusiasm, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of false Religion. All which will evidently appear, by comparing what our selves have seen and felt, with what these wild Schismatiques acted Thirteen hundred years since. The actions of both suiting so exactly to each other, that had they been the very same Men, they could not have acted more like themselves. The Twins that were so like, that their own Mother could not distinguish them, were not more so, then these two Schisms though born at such a distance of Time and Place.</p>

Bodys, and pretended to reform the Government by Plunder and Robbery, and wherever they came, set Apprentices free from their Masters, and Debtors from their Creditors, if they would but join with them, to pull down Idolatry and Arbitrary Government: And force poor Men to deliver up their Bonds and Indentures to save their Lives. And yet all this while they were a very praying People, and sought the Lord for direction in all their Villanies. And now it is no wonder if Men of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Principles, and managed by such a Guide as <hi>Donatus,</hi> proceeded to the heighth both of folly and outrage; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that whilst they were in the heat of their Bloód and Zeal, they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no danger, out of Ambition of being Martyrs for the cause of God, and some of them were so wildly transported, as to hang drown, and stabb themselves for the Glory of the Lord. And thus for many years they harassed <hi>Africa</hi> with their Insolence and Cruelty, and made the habitable parts of the Country more salvage then the Deserts themselves. No Man could dwell in his own House, or Travel abroad about his business with any safety, but all was exposed to the Rapine of these merciless Robbers. Till
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42190:165"/>
at length, after unspeakable Patience, complaint being made by the Catholicks to the Emperor <hi>Constans,</hi> of their deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, he sent two Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Macarius,</hi> with a shew of dividing the Emperors bounty among the poor and distressed, and by that means to soften them from that fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that they had contracted by this wild Schism, to some sense of Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Superiors, and of Humanity towards their Neighbours. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners coming into <hi>Africa</hi> consult with the Bishops what course was fitest to be taken: But the Party of <hi>Donatus</hi> Combine one and all to hinder all their endeavours of Concord, and dispatch Letters and Messengers into all Parts aforehand, forbiding their People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing of the Emperor's Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it being a scandal to the People of God to receive any Alms from Sinners. And beside this, the Rabble are frighted with flying Reports and Stories, that the Commissioners brought along with them the Emperors Images, that were to be placed upon the high Altar, at the time of Celebrating the Eucharistical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; that so the People might be drawn in, to give Divine Worship to the Imperial Image, and so become guilty
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42190:165"/>
of Idolatry, and from this time the words Pagan and Idolator were the two most common Titles that they bestowed upon the Catholicks. Nay farther then all this, when the Commissioners acquaint the great <hi>Donatus</hi> with their Message, he replies with his usual scorn and rage, <hi>Quid est Imperatori cum Ecclesiâ?</hi> reviles the Emperor himself with sawcy and taunting Language, and tells them, that they might give themselves, if they pleased, the pleasure of travelling through the <hi>African</hi> Provinces, but he had taken care to save their Masters Money. And another <hi>Donatus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bagaia,</hi> when the Commissioners came to his City, gathers together Troops of <hi>Circumcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> from all Parts, perhaps into a Malt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, to Assassinate the Commissioners. But they to defend themselves, upon the discovery of the Conspiracy, send for a Party of the Emperor's Forces, some few whereof being upon the Guard, abused and affronted by the Fanatick Rabble, that were Assembled in great Numbers, acquaint their Fellow-Soldiers with the Indignity, who, do what their Officers could, fall upon them with great fury, kill some and disperse the rest. And now the <hi>Donatists</hi> had the beloved cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of all Schismaticks to cry out Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42190:166"/>
only because some of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd in a Tumult of their own raising. But it is no matter who began the fray, the People are to be incensed against the Catholiques with the Blood of their Party. And therefore what Tragical Stories do we ever after, from this slight Occasion, hear of the <hi>Macarian Times,</hi> as if this one Accident, by which they punish'd themselves, had exceeded the Cruelty of the Ten Persecutions. But in short, the Commissioners finding there was no Peace to be settled in <hi>Africa,</hi> whilst <hi>Donatus</hi> and his Associates remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, they sent them all into Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so they continued till the time of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate; but in the mean time the Ring-leaders being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the way, the People were soon at quiet, and betook themselves to to their Callings, and kept their Parish-Churches. And upon this a Council was called by <hi>Gratus</hi> Arch-Bishop of the Catholique Communion at <hi>Carthage,</hi> to give God thanks for their Deliverance, and to take care for the effectual settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Peace of the Church, that lasted till the <hi>Donatists</hi> broke loose under <hi>Julian.</hi> Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing <note place="margin">

thought nothing so effectual to that end, as to encourage Schisms and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and destroy the Discipline and Unity of the Church; and therefore when this Schism was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguisht by the care of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> and his Sons, he took as much care by granting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> to blow it up into a greater flame.</p>
               <p>And yet they on the other side were forward enough to prevent the Apostates Zeal, by presenting him with a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing address, so that though the other day under Christian Emperours, their word was, <hi>Quid Imperatori cum Ecclesiâ?</hi> now under an Apostate, a mortal and avowed Enemy to Christianity, the whole Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church is to be submitted to his disposal, and sacrificed to his malice; and he accordingly finding what eager Zeal they had to disturb the Peace of the Church, gives them all the liberty that they can desire, and permits them to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their Conventicles, at the same time that he opened the Idol Temples, and (as <hi>Optatus</hi> upbraids them) let them and the Devil loose together. And that is another ill quality of all Schismaticks, that they care not what becomes of the common Christianity, so the Faction thrives. This Rescript of <hi>Julian</hi> to the <hi>Donatists</hi> is lost, but it seems it was so very scandalous, that the Emperour <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> many years after, when he was resolved upon their Extirpation, caused it to be publisht in all places, to let the People see the baseness and perversness of the Faction. But they now finding that they had got the upper hand of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, though by the malice of this Apostate Emperor, are not satisfied with their own liberty, but fall soul upon the Catholiques, and treat them with all manner of outrage and cruelty, pull down their Churches, murther their Priests at the Altar, overthrow the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars themselves, and cast their Idolatrous Eucharist (as they call'd it) to the Dogs, dig the Catholiques out of their Graves, with many more outrages, that may be seen in <hi>Optatus</hi> his second and sixth Books.

               <p>To <hi>Donatus</hi> succeeds <hi>Parmenianus,</hi> who publishes a vehement Book against the Catholicks, stuft with the old Fables of <hi>Faelix, Caecilian,</hi> and the <hi>Macarian</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; for as they first founded their Schism upon a Lye, so they resolv'd to continue it to the last, and perhaps by this time they were in good earnest, and had lyed so long, till they at length believed themselves, or at least (as <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus</hi> tells him) they were utterly Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the History of the Schism, and to that end he wrote his Books to rebuke all their wild Fictions by publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and Imperial Rescripts. But to what purpose do you tell the Common People of legal Proceedings? No Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so prevalent with them, as a blind Story in a Corner, tagg'd with dirty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Government. And therefore notwithstanding all these checks, the Ring-leaders of the Faction Lye on, though we hear little of them till the tenth year of the same Reign, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 373, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> publisht a Rescript against their Re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising; which was renewed by <hi>Gratian</hi>

For upon the death of <hi>Parmenian</hi> they cannot agree upon a Successor, some are for <hi>Maximianus,</hi> and some for <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus,</hi> and so both being chosen, they divide Communions, make Decrees, and throw out Anathema's against each other, and which is most of all disingenuous, stir up the Civil Magistrate to put the same Imperial Laws, that were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves, in Execution against their Brethren: And what but t'other day was Tyranny and Persecution in the Catholicks, is in themselves Law and Justice. And so they go on to load one another with all the foul Stories and ill Language, that they were wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon the Catholiques, and their Sentences of Excommunication are more fierce and heavy, than any that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denounced by any other party of Christians.

And so they crumbled on, till they had made the Church no bigger than it was at first, a small grain of Mustard Seed: For every Party confin'd the Kingdom of Heaven to its Conventicle.

And as for St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself, they continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched for his life, and exhorted the People to kill him as they would a Wolf, to preserve the Flock, and assure them that God would forgive all their Sins, how great soever, for so good a piece of Service.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42190:170"/>
who all along interceded with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to spare their lives, till at last being convinced by Experience that they abused all mercy, and would be reduced by nothing but the greatest Severity, he changed his mind, as he declares in his Epistle to <hi>Vincentius,</hi> in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently discourses the necessity of the <note place="margin">

               <p>About this time happened the War with <hi>Gildo</hi> the <hi>African</hi> Rebel, a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Debauch'd, and barbarous in his Manners, and a bitter Enemy to Christianity; with him the <hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Circumcellians</hi> join, and serve in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against the Emperor, according to the constant practice of all Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, whenever there is an opportunity to turn Rebels.

But when <hi>Gildo</hi> was at length overcome, the <hi>Donatists</hi> bated nothing of their wonted insolence, and the Emperor <hi>Honorius</hi> (to whose particular Government <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> appertained) being incensed with continual complaints of their disorders,

resolves by any severity to break the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And first he exposes their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to all the Christian World, by which he hoped at least to take down their confidence, and preserve the People from being any more deluded by their fair pretences. And therefore in the year 400 he sends forth the forementioned Decree to his Praefect in <hi>Africk,</hi> to be publish'd in all places concerning the Transactions of the <hi>Donatists</hi> with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and his Rescript on their behalf, that <note place="margin">

How many (says he) that were engaged in the Party by Education, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd upon what grounds they separated from the Church, being awakened by these Laws to examine into the Nature of the Schism, found nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough in it, for which they should expose themselves to so great Damages, these were without difficulty made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks. How many that only followed the Authority of their Guides, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the difference between the

Church and the Donatists: How many that had been abused with Stories and false Reports of the Catholicks; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that thought it indifferent with which Party they sided, give God and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror thanks for frighting them out of their sloath and stupidity?

And so things continued in a quiet posture till the death of <hi>Stilicho</hi> in the year 408, but upon that the Heathens and Donatists (that were all along one Party against the Catholicks) raise a Report that the Laws against them were made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, <note place="margin">

               <p>But being now resolved to put an end to the trouble that they had given him from the beginning of his Reign, he resolved in the first place to try if it were possible to do any good upon them, by a friendly Conference, which (as himself says) he did by the perswasion of the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, and it was chiefly devised by St. <hi>Austin</hi> to undeceive the People.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42190:177"/>
that the most effectual way to reduce them, was to let the People know what was done in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, in the Synods of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arles,</hi> and before the Emperour himself at <hi>Milan,</hi> and the shameful discoveries of their Forgeries about <hi>Caecilian</hi> and <hi>Faelix</hi> of <hi>Aptung,</hi> by <hi>Ingentius</hi> the Notary, and <hi>Nundinarius</hi> the Deacon.

whom St. <hi>Austin</hi> dedicates his Books <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> though a Secular Judge, is sent into <hi>Africa</hi> with a Commission to preside at the Conference, and that he might do, by the Laws and Custom of the Church, because the Controversie was not about either a matter of Faith, or rule of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but only a matter of Fact. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he the Office of a Judge about that, so much as an Inquisitor; but was by his Commission only to Examine the publick Records, and that was all that he undertook and perform'd. In <hi>March</hi> in the year 411. he Summons both Parties to meet at <hi>Carthage</hi> in the <hi>June</hi> following, and grants to all <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> that would obey his Summons, the free use of their Churches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides all things necessary or useful for their Journey. The whole number of <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops, in all 159, enter <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> in a full Body, with all the shews of Pomp and Ostentation, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their full strength at that time, it shews how their Party had shrivel'd away under this Emperor's Laws against them. For in their Council at <hi>Bagaia,</hi> where the <hi>Maximinianists</hi> were condemn'd by
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42190:178"/>
the other <hi>Donatists,</hi> were present four hundred and sixty Bishops, and yet now all their Force cannot make a third part of that number. But when they came to <hi>Carthage,</hi> they would not meet in the usual house of Convocation, that they call'd the Synagogue of Satan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore met in the <hi>Gargilian</hi> Baths. And before they enter'd upon the Conference, the Catholicks endeavour to Court them with all manner of Civility and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention, if by any means to prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to have some sense of the Peace and Unity of the Christian Church. But all in vain, they were resolved to persist in their Peevishness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they came together, instead of fair and ingenuous Discourse, they only endeavoured to spin out time with trifling and pettifogging Tricks. For whereas the Catholiques first propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for quicker dispatch, to separate the particular matter of Fact, concerning <hi>Caecilian</hi>'s being Ordain'd by a Traditor from the general matter of Right, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their present Separation from the Church. Because that was only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, and carried nothing in it that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the cause of the Church it self, at so great a distance of time; and therefore they would freely grant, tho
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42190:178"/>
nothing could be more false, that <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Faelix</hi> were guilty of all their Indictment: But that being granted, they affirm'd that it was no sufficient reason for them at that time of the day, to separate themselves from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, though it had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years past Communicated with them. But the <hi>Donatists</hi> resolve to insist upon the old Nags-head-story, and wholly baulk the matter of Right; for here they knew that they could wrangle and amuse the People, and this was not only their standing Artifice, but as <hi>Baldwin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, 'tis the last shift of all Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, when they are bafled, to throw dirt. So <hi>Petilian</hi> served St. <hi>Austin;</hi> so the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> so the <hi>Manichees;</hi> but he would not be drawn from his Cause by such foolish divertisements, and still an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd them all, <hi>Quod ad mores nostros</hi>

                  <q>As for my Life and Conversation, it is known to those with whom I live, but our business is about Christian Truth; that is the cause, not I; if you have any thing against me, in God's Name Indict me according to Law, but otherwise it is a base and helpless shift, when you
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42190:179"/>
are Convicted by Argument, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your selves to idle Tales and Slanders, for that is the last Machine of all Hereticks.</q> And therefore 'tis no wonder that the Schismaticks stuck so long at this point, for to Persons of that Kidney, Calumny is much dearer then their Opinion. And it was a long while before <hi>Marcellinus</hi> with all his Art and Temper, could bring them out of this Hold, but being at last forced out of it, they in the next place wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle about matters, that they pleaded ought to be preliminary to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: And first they cavill'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against the time, <hi>viz.</hi> That the time limited by the Emperour's Summons was past; to which cavil they are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, That the Meeting was adjourn'd to the present time by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Then they except against <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> and the Form of proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ecclesiastical matters ought not to be determin'd after the manner of the Secular Courts, but by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. To this <hi>Marcellinus</hi> replies, both that he does not take upon himself the Office of a Judge, and withal that things should be determin'd by the Rule of Scripture as they desired. And beside this the Catholick Bishops satisfie them
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42190:179"/>
by exhibiting the Injunctions, that they had given to those Bishops, that were to manage the Conference, that they had taken sufficient care of that matter. But then this the <hi>Donatists</hi> turn'd into a new Cavil, that they would not trust their Cause to a few Mens management, but would be all Speakers, which they knew could not be done in so great a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, without turning the whole business into Tumult and Confusion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is with much ado over-ruled, that Seven of each Party should manage the Conference, of whom St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Petilian</hi> were the chief of each side. But in the next place the Mandate of the Catholicks to their Commissioners being signed by 286 Bishops, the <hi>Donatists</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that there were not so many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and pretend that to encrease the number they had set down false names, and therefore require that every Bishop should answer to his own name. But all this trifling being at last past through, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> with Hat in hand, desires the Company that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take their Seats, but the <hi>Donatists</hi> insolently refuse his Civility, grumbling out among themselves that of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>Odi Ecclesiam Malig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The second Conference was spent in the same trifles and cavils with the first, and so came to nothing. But at the third Meeting <hi>Marcellinus</hi> keeps them close to the point, and after long strugling and much patience with them, causes all the Records relating to the whole matter to be read, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cause of <hi>Caecilian</hi> and <hi>Faelix</hi> of <hi>Aptung.</hi> And here the <hi>Donatists</hi> were quite undone at the first shock, and had no shift to escape, only to the Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Caecilian</hi> by <hi>Melckiades</hi> they have the Impudence now to say, that <hi>Melchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> himself was a Traditor.

and without any pretence of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then only their own Report, and therefore could not pass. In short, the Schismaticks having nothing to except against the unquestionable Evidence of publick Records, but repeating the same Cavils and Calumnies, the Verdict is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against them, and themselves are brought to subscribe the truth of all the Acts of the Conference, as we now have them, which otherwise they would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have pleaded to be false, so that they had now no shif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here are all the severities that can be inflicted except death it self, for though the Emperor had threatned them with that immediately after his Conquest of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> upon some rude Provocation, that they had given him in his distress, yet now in his cooler and more deliberate thoughts, he resolves to spare their blood, but resolves to spare nothing else. And what milder course

could be taken with such men, that out of meer extravagance, and wantonness, had put off all sense of their natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. And so upon this, those few that would not be reduced, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Fields and the Woods, and wandred up and down the Country in Arm'd Troops, doing all manner of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and violence in all places, usually having one of their Teachers for the Captain of each Rout, such an one was <hi>Macrobius</hi> one of their Bishops, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, roved up and down in his Neighbourhood, <hi>Stipatus cuneis perditorum utriusque sexûs,</hi>

For if that liberty be once admitted in any Case, it breaks down the Bounds, of all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and therefore an Appeal from one Provincial Synod to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother was never allowed of in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, but in Cases of Grievance the only Appeal that lay was to greater Synods composed out of several Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so that when <hi>Arius</hi> took Sanctuary under <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and he protected him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Censure of his own Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42190:186"/>
and by his own Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled and cancell'd the Acts of another Bishop against his own Presbyter, and endeavour'd to engage the Approbation of the whole Church to his irregular actings, that was apparently setting up an open Schism in the Christian Church.

                     <hi>Apud The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. l. c.</hi> 4.</note> Epistle, and loads <hi>Eusebius</hi> with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Apostolical Canon, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>33d,</hi> which injoyns that no Clergy-man Excommunicate by his own Bishop, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to Communion by another. But <hi>Eusebius,</hi> being a man of a proud Spirit, regards it not (neither was this his first breach of the Canons, having skipt out of one Bishoprick into another, which is there severely forbidden, and he was the first man, that I know of, who was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that boldness against that Sacred Law of the Church) but instead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting from his Schismatical proceedings, endeavours to spread the Schism as far as he could, and his Letters fly abroad eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to engage the Bishops to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by which means, he being then a great Man and a Favourite of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the Court then residing at <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> all the Bishops in the World were in a moment engaged on one side or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (not upon the account of <hi>Arius</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:42190:186"/>
but <hi>Eusebius</hi> whose Pride and Ambition was the only cause of all this confusion) this so alarms <hi>Constantine,</hi> that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches away his great Favourite <hi>Osius</hi> of <hi>Corduba</hi> with his Letters to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> if it were possible to allay the heats of both Parties. Though <hi>Baronius</hi> is very earnest in it, that <hi>Osius</hi> was first sent by Pope <hi>Silvester,</hi> as his Legate into the East, <note place="margin">

And in this the Cardinal is very vehement, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it with extraordinary assurance, though there is not the least intimation of it in all the ancient Historians, who make not any mention of the Pope in all this business, but impute the whole transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Constantine</hi>'s own care and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the Scope of the Emperors Letters was to perswade and exhort them wholly to lay aside the Controversie as nice, and unnecessary, and not of weight enough to deserve a determination. Though as <hi>Sandius</hi> tells the story, the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 16.</note> Emperour lays the blame of all upon the Bishop, but this not only without any Authority, but against the express words of the Letter, that equally blames them both for their too much curiosity about a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42190:187"/>
                  <hi>vain Question,</hi> as he calls it. And as for the Letter it self I shrewdly suspect it to have been the contrivance of <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> who was very intimate with the Emperour, and impos'd upon him all along in this whole Affair. I am sure the Scope of the Letter is exactly agreeable with <hi>Eusebius</hi> his whole carriage in this Controversie, which was not to have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd either way, but only silenced as an over curious speculation. I know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he is on all hands represented as a Ring-leader of the Arian Faction, but it is a mistake that has brought confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the whole History, and made the Arian Heresie seem of a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extent then it ever was, whereas <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and his Party were no less Enemies to the <hi>Arians</hi> then to the Orthodox, and yet it was they that all along made the greatest shew and noise in the Contest. And as for the <hi>Arian</hi> Faction it was wholly supprest by the Nicene Council, and all the Tumults that were made after that, are owing to the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> who were as forward as the Orthodox to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize the <hi>Arians,</hi> but then they must have the Decree of the Nicene Council reverst, and what work they made about it we shall see when we come to the Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> all whose
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42190:187"/>
Persecutions of the Catholicks were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raised by these mens wise indiscretion, and had it not been for their unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tampering, prudence, and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie could never have lift up its head more after the Nicene Council. But to return to <hi>Constantine,</hi> who finding the Contest too hot at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> to be allayed by the mediation of <hi>Hosius,</hi> and withal the flame too far spread into other Churches to be quench't by one mans industry, he resolves upon a General Council to compose this and some other spreading Controversies, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that concerning the time of <hi>Easter,</hi> which though it had slept ever since Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> began now to raise new heats in several parts of Christendom.</p>
               <p>The Council being met at the time and place appointed, he entertains them with an Oration exhorting to Peace and Unity, but neither prescribes nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands any thing, only desires them to examine things impartially, and by their Authoritative determination of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Controversies, to settle the Peace of the Church forever, as appears not only from the Tenour of the Speech it self, and the Emperours behaviour in the Council, but from the challenge of St. <note place="margin">

The whole Controversie was reduced to the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> which the <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at first refused to admit, as being no Scripture Word, but without its admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nothing else would satisfie the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and good reason they had for it, because to part with that Word after the Controversie was once raised, would have been to give up the cause; for it was unavoidable, that if the Son were not of the same Substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he must have been made out of the same Common and Created Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42190:189"/>
with all other Creatures, and therefore when the Scriptues give him a greater Dignity of Nature then to any created Being, they thereby make him of the same uncreated Substance with the Father, so that they plainly assert his <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> though they use not the Word. But when the Truth it self was denyed by the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks, and the Son of God thrust down into the rank of created Beings, and defined to be a Creature made out of nothing, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was time for the Church to stop this Heresie, by such a Test as would admit of no Prevarication, which was effectually done by this word, and as cunning and shufling as the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were, they were never able to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or chew it, and therefore it was but a weak part of the <hi>Eusebians</hi> to shew so much Zeal against the word, when they professed to allow the thing; for if our Saviour were not a meer Creature, he must be of the same uncreated sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Father, because there is no middle between created and uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Substance; so that whoever denyed his <hi>Consubstantiality</hi> could not avoid the Heresie of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> which yet the <hi>Arians</hi> themselves professed to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42190:190"/>
defie, for if he were a meer Creature, it is no matter how soon or how late he was created. And therefore <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> a wise and understanding Man soon discern'd the folly of this Scruple, for though he at first opposed the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> in the Council, and tendred a Creed without it, yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on farther consideration he easily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, because as himself gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it to his Diocess, it signifies the same thing as to say, that he is <hi>of the Father,</hi> which the Orthodox Doctrine teaches, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And therefore he declares that he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subscribed to it, not only for Peace sake, but that he might not incur the scandal of Heresie. And as for the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi> against <hi>Arius,</hi> he says, that he readily subscribed them, because they were but a just Sentence against his <hi>Prophane Novelties, without any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Scriptures, from whence proceed all the disturbances of the Church, seeing therefore no Scripture uses such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as</hi>

And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this fair and ingenuous Confession of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and his more full Declaration of his real sense and meaning in his Books against <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with what an unanimous Vote, both of Ancients and Moderns, is he condemned as a Ring-leader of the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> rashly stiles him? But he can spare no Man a good word, that had any kindness for <hi>Origen,</hi> and that was the ground of his displeasure against <hi>Eusebius;</hi> I confess that he never could heartily like the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it being a new word, and not found in

Scripture, it gave the <hi>Arians</hi> advantage of exception against the old Truth, yet he always declared as expresly against the <hi>Arian</hi> Assertions, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But of all Writers those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are most implacable to his Memory, for what reason I cannot imagine, unless it be that his plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the true State and Polity of the Primitive Church is so irreconcileable with the present Grandeur and Power of their Church. As for the unkind usage he has met with from <hi>Baronius, Bellarmine, Binius,</hi> and such like Writers, it is not to be wondred at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they treat all other Authors and Records after the same Rate, that do not suit their turn, so that they are more offended with him as an Historian, then as an Heretick, and <hi>Baronius</hi> cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear blabbing out the true ground of his displeasure against him, in that he too much betrayed that he bore no good Will to the See Apostolick. But as for <hi>Petavius,</hi> a Man of a more free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial enquiry, who does not make it his business, as they do, to force the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records of the Church to comply with its present State, but takes things as he finds them; for him, I say, to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this great Man more roughly then

And knowing the invincible courage of the Man, they first set upon him with Calumnies and Accusations, not doubting but that if they could by any means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him and some few of his Friends out of the way, that they might easily overcome the Word.

                  </gap>, as will appear when we come to his Reign. But as for the Story of the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie under <hi>Constantine,</hi> after the time of the Nicene Council, it is strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42190:198"/>
perplexed by an unusual confusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Historians themselves; for though they all agree in the substance of the Story, yet they all differ as to time and order, but their mistakes are easily rectified by <hi>Athanasius</hi> his own Account, who has in his Apology all along set down the exact order and succession of things, and that is all, that is his own in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology; for he was so modest that he would not have his Narrative trusted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Authority, but has justified every part of it by Testimonials from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, publick Records, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Enemies under their own hands, so that the whole Story being its own Evidence needs no other voucher though it be in all its more materail passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges attested by all other Historians. And therefore I shall by his help set down the Progress of the whole Business with all the accuracy that I can, because it is one of the foulest trains of Villany upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and was the meer contrivance of that wicked men <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a man of great Power and Authority at that time, whence he acquired the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Great,</hi> which <hi>Sandius</hi> says, he acquired by his great power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles; but this Collector is through his whole Rhapsody his own
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42190:198"/>
Author, for though he is every where Prodigal of his Quotations, yet those few that are truly alledged (and they are very few) or that are at all to the purpose (and they are much fewer) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late only to the general Story, as it may be told by all Parties, but his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular remarks for his own cause are the Fables of his own pure invention. Thus here it would have been a considerable advantage on his own side, if <hi>Eusebius</hi> had been so highly favour'd of Heaven as to be endued with a power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, and therefore he tells his simple Reader so, though no body ever told him so; but alas that Ambitious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was so far from being eminent for any good Qualities, that he was only a Prodigy of Vice and Wickedness, neither was he in all this Contest acted by any zeal that he had for Religion, but meerly by an Atheistical spite and malice. And he seems to be one of them, that after <hi>Constantine</hi> embraced Christianity, came into the Church not for Religion butPre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.

Upon this <hi>Constantine</hi> writes a very threatning Letter to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Restitution of <hi>Arius</hi> upon pain of deposition and banishment, to which <hi>Athanasius</hi> returns such a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Answer as made the Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

from interposing any farther in it. <hi>Eusebius</hi> therefore finding himself defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tampers with the <hi>Meletian</hi> Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of <hi>Egypt</hi> to make a Plot against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius.</hi> They were a sort of People that lived in the Boggs and Marshes of <hi>Mareotis,</hi> where one Priest served ten or more Parishes, much resembling our wild <hi>Irish</hi> for dulness and stupidity; and they are thus described by the Bishops of the Council of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42190:201"/>
were so far from opposing his Election, that they had almost run themselves into Tumults to hasten his Consecreation. Then Stories are told of his Arbitrary exactions of Money from the People, but <hi>Macari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> one of his Presbyters happening to be present at the Tale, informs the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that it was nothing but an usual Collection to repair and adorn the Church.

But all this would proceed no farther then Deposition, and therefore he adds, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had with his own hands murthered <hi>Arsenius</hi> a Bishop, and shews a Man's hand, that was cut off by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> when the Fact was done, and <hi>Arsenius</hi> himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Confederacy was to abscond by consent, till <hi>Athanasius</hi> was dispatched out of the way. But so it happened very unfortunately, that <hi>Ischyras</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (it seems Perjury in that Age
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42190:202"/>
was not grown to its full assurance) misgave him, so that he confessed the forgery of the whole Plot in a Letter to <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, subscribed in the presence of a great number of Clergy; but the Caufe had been referred by the Emperor to <hi>Dalmatius</hi> the Governor of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and before the Tryal <hi>Athanasius</hi> had the good luck to find out the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Arsenius,</hi> and had him forth-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the Tryal; and though at first he pleaded ignorance of himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed himself to be the Man, and would have sworn himself out of himself, yet being Convicted by a cloud of Witnesses, he confessed the Conspiracy, and upon the shame of so clear a Conviction (for modesty had not then quite left the Earth) both he and <hi>John</hi> a Ring-lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishop among the <hi>Miletians</hi> confess all the Villany, beg <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. This the good Man could not but think enough to secure his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence against the like attempts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and therefore with all hast he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches away his faithful Presbyter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius</hi> to acquaint the Emperor with all that had passed, and upon the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Constantine</hi> breaks up the Court, clears <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and by his Letters to

                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> declares the Villainy of the <hi>Meletians.</hi> And here the Plot slept for near two years before <hi>Eusebius</hi> durst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it, but having with great pains and promises recover'd his <hi>Evidence,</hi> he and his Party insinuate to the Emperor, That <hi>Athanasius</hi> had taken off Bishop <hi>John</hi> by great sums of Money, and had so threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the poor <hi>Meletian</hi> Nonconformists (for so Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls these plotting Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks) that they durst not appear to give in their Evidence against him; That the shew of <hi>Arsenius</hi> was all a rank cheat, and that the Person that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his stead was hired by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and attested only by a few of his own Combination. The Emperor is both tired and amused with all this intrigue, and therefore summons a Council at <hi>Tyre</hi> to find out the bottom of these Plots, and unravel the whole Information on both sides. Where <hi>Athanasius</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Bishops of his Province, appears with that boldness and security that became his Innocence; for though flying Stories may gain credit among the multitude, whilst they are no more then Stories, yet when they are brought to a publick Examination before Judges, though themselves be Parties, they so visibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

Men have confidence enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and support their falshood. And so it happened here, for <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who was appointed President to see that all things were fairly carried, was himself of the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Faction, and the Bishops that sat were of <hi>Dionysius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> his own packing, and yet for all that the Plot was lost in the management, and came to nothing; and indeed so defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and unfortunate was it in its Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that no disingenuity in the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges could piece it up. The Counterfeit Priest <hi>Ischiras</hi> is re-produced, and in hopes of his Bishoprick, swears all over again that he had before forsworn, but it seems though he stood not Convicted of Perjury, the Court was ashamed of his Evidence, for by the Imperial Law a Man that swore manifest Contradictions was supposed to have sworn himself a perjured Person without the formality of any other Conviction. But after this they bring upon the Stage such a Plot, that if <hi>Athanasius</hi> had not broken through it by a very lucky Counter-Comedy, must have ensnared him beyond all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. On the sudden comes in a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woman, a common Strumpet, that had wit and impudence enough to act her part, and she with abundance of

Tears, and all the Solemnities of Grief declares, That when she had devoted her self to Virginity, she was ravisht by <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And now here you may think that the <hi>Eusebians</hi> were confident they had him fast enough, but they were strangely out-witted, for <hi>Athanasius</hi> stands careless, and like a Person unconcern'd, and <hi>Timotheus</hi> one of his Presbyters that stood next to him, immediately takes the Accusation upon himself, and with great seriousness and passion Expostulates with the Woman, where and when he had ever been in her Company, at which she directing her discourse to him, and pointing directly at him, answers, Yes Sir it was you, you I say, that offer'd me this dishonourable violence and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with other foul form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

being fled for fear of his life (for the <hi>Eusebians</hi> had threatned, that if ever they could reach him, they would make him pay dear for his discovery.) But such was the diligence, and so great the Correspondence of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that he still had him in his Pocket, brings him into Court, demands whether they knew the Man, and he being own'd to be the same, both by the Judges and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he turns back first one side of his Cloak and shews one hand, but they cry that it was the other hand that was <note place="margin">

the chief Actor that he brings upon the Stage, was long since out of the World.

But a Man that can write thus confidently out of his own pure inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a very fit second for <hi>Philostorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and a fit Patron to make out the fair carriage of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Eusebians</hi> in this whole Story.

               <p>But here our faithful <hi>Arian</hi> Historians <hi>Philostorgius</hi> and <hi>Sandius,</hi> are so wise and ingenuous as to say no more of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Ischiras, Arsenius,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Plot, then that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was accused in Council of all the Crimes charged against him, and by them found Guilty, and that when
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42190:209"/>
the Commissioners from the Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd before the Emperor, they so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <hi>Athanasius</hi> of all the Crimes laid to his charge, and so satisfied the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of his guilt, that he immediately sentenced him to banishment; these are worthy Historians, and proper Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for the management of the <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Cause, that have the confidence to out-face publick and undeniable Records; the foulness of all these proceedings was made evident by the Acts of Court yet extant, and the Confessions of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses themselves, particularly <hi>Ischiras,</hi> under Hand and Seal, and all this within short time after the Transactions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, published to the whole World by <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself in the face of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without any contradiction: And now when the whole forgery was thus shamefully exposed in the face of the Sun, and stood so upon Record to all Ages, are not these wise Men to think that they are able to slur so clear an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only by their trifling it? as if all the World were so blind or so foolish as to read or believe nothing but their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And yet this incredible confidence is all the strength of these daring Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:42190:210"/>
This is the true State of the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie, during the Reign of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> and by all the premisses it is evident, that the Heresie it self could never openly appear after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and that all the stirs, that were raised after that, were occasion'd by the folly and malice of the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> who profess't themselves Catholiques; and that their contest with <hi>Athanasius</hi> was not about points of Faith, but his own particular Crimes and Misdemeanors, of which they falsely and wickedly accused him to the Emperor. So that his actings against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil proceeded not from any change of mind in him concerning the Faith (as some surmise) for it is evident through his whole Reign that he was highly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that as it was settled by the great Council, and only proceeded against <hi>Athanasius</hi> as a Person of a Turbulent and unquiet Spirit, as he was represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by the Calumnies of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Though how he could be so long imposed upon after such discoveries as were made of the Villar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letians</hi> appears somewhat unaccountable. For what can be more so, then that men Convicted of Forgery in open Court, should ever after be admitted as Witnesses
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42190:210"/>
in the same Cause and the same Court? But yet if we observe the matter careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all this was done without the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours knowledge, for after the first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that was made to him by <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> all the rest was transacted by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, for he knew nothing of the whole Comedy of the Council of <hi>Tyre,</hi> in which the whole business was managed, neither durst the Managers themselves acquaint him with any thing of theStory, but when they appear before him at his angry Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that he sent only upon suspicion of their injustice, they on a suddain surprise and divert his rage upon <hi>Athanasius</hi> by a new and unexpected Accusation, that they very well knew by experience he could not bear, having for the same thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the man he loved. And therefore as <hi>Constantine</hi> was not only not Privy to the Plot himself, so neither was he guilty of that remisness in its Examination, as is commonly supposed; for beside his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the transactions in the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council, the whole mystery of it lay in the secret Confederacy between the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians</hi> and the <hi>Meletians,</hi> that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour could have no ground to suspect in the Council, for the <hi>Meletians</hi> were an obscure and contemptible handful of men in a remote and neglected part of the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42190:211"/>
Empire, and who could suspect a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy between these poor wretches, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> and some of his own Courtiers? And yet this one unsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected piece of Villany was the bottom of all <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Calamities. Neither do I think the Emperour alone innocent in this whole matter, but several of the Judges and Prosecutors, that were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon by the Forgery; for it is not every one that Acts in a Plot that is privy to its Contrivance: that is kept within the close Cabal; and National Plots in which vast variety of Persons unknown to one another are engaged, are not to be found in every age, for it is but seldom that mankind are so madly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant as to venture their lives at so cheap a rate. At least in the days of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> men were somewhat more wary, and if any man had sworn a Story of such a Plot, the very absurdity of his own Tale would have Convicted him of Forgery. And therefore we may be sure that at that time the secret was kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a few, who till it was discover'd and brought into the Light, might draw in many others to act very enormous things with fair and plausible Pretences. This I take to be the peculiar Apology that wholly clears <hi>Constantines</hi> innocence
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42190:211"/>
in this Matter, his utter ignorance of the Plot, and the little ground he had to suspect it, though beside that, there are divers other Pleas that though they will not wholy justifie, will very much excuse his Actions. As first the great lenity and gentleness of his Nature, that was abused and imposed upon by ill men, who insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated themselves into his favour by a counterfeit Zeal for Christianity, and by that means gain'd the greatest places of Trust and Dignity in the Empire, and such men would be sure to abuse their Power to the ruine and oppression of the People. This is remarqued as the peculiar blot of his Reign by the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of all Parties, <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> says, that it was the Emperour himself that opened the devouring Jaws of his <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Eutropius</hi> observes the very

                     <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 54.</note> left this Character of his whole Reign. <q>The two great Calamities of his time were the intollerable Oppression of wicked and covetous men, that devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all parts of the Empire, and the false and hypocritical pretence to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, to sweep away all the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and to this miscarriage the Emperours own good nature and the assurance of his own integrity betrayed him, so that he would trust any man that did but dissemble Christianity, or pretend any Zeal to his own service, and by this means many shameful and dishonest things were done, as if the Devil had out of meer envy to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dasht this blot upon his other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Praises.</q> And the two remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able instances of this defect in his Reign are <hi>Ablavius</hi> in the State, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in the Church, two as bad men as usually any age produces, and the great power and wickedness of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> was the great infelicity of the Church under <hi>Constantine,</hi> for as <hi>Baronius</hi> has very well observed, (and I will say that for him he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adan.</hi> 336.</note> has been very just to this Great Princes Memory) his Court was fill'd with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians,</hi> by the favour of his Son <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi> who from the time of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

been created <hi>Caesar,</hi> though a younger Brother was the chief manager of Affairs of State, in that he minded Business whilst his Elder Brother <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> followed his Pleasures. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the worship of the Court was made to this active young Prince as the Rising Sun. So that he being Govern'd by <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> (as he always was) he carefully stopt and guarded all passages of Complaint from the Catholicks to the Emperour, as appears by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who could gain no admittance at Court, but was forced to accost him as he rode through the Streets, and the Emperour was possest with so ill an Opinion of him, that he would neither then hear his Complaint, nor order his attendance at Court, which was a very unusual severity in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And yet his love of Justice appears, in that when <hi>Athanasius</hi> Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> nothing else then that he might be heard by the Emperour before his <hi>Tyrian</hi> Judges, he immediately summon'd them at so just and modest an Appeal. And then <hi>Athanasius</hi> might easily have cleared himself, had they not surprized and overwhelm'd him with a new Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation attested by his own best friends, for the Witnesses that they produced of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42190:213"/>
his threatning to hinder the Transportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Corn to <hi>Constantinople</hi> were some of those, that had appeared most eminently in his defence at the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council. This was an Evidence that could not be withstood, nor is it to be avoided but by one of these two ways. Either that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> being vext out of all Patience by so long a Train of base usage, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great and popular interest at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> might in some suddain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Passion have bolted out some such threatning, which though it were a very high Crime in the Emperours Esteem, no less then Treason against his own Royal City, yet its Enormity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in its great rashness and indiscretion; and this to me seems very probable, if we consider his Great Spirit, his Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Constitution, and his Infinite Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: or else that his Friends were since the Council taken off by the Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Flatteries of the <hi>Eusebians.</hi> But if it were so, the Emperour could have no Evidence for it, neither indeed have we any ground to surmise it was so, and therefore the thing being so fully attested by <hi>Athanasius</hi> his own Friends, it was as fair a Testimony as could be given in any Case; no wonder then that it raised the Emperours displeasure so high, that he
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42190:213"/>
would hear no more, when it endanger'd the Peace of the Empire, and the ruine of his own City, that could not possibly subsist without the constant supplies from <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which we may add the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's impatient desire of Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Christian Church, as it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible through his whole Reign, and of this <hi>Athanasius</hi> was all along represented to him as the only Obstacle and therefore <hi>Sozomen</hi> leaves it doubtful whether the Emperour banisht him because he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">

too, supposing that when the Leaders were out of the way, the Schism would dye of its own accord.</p>

For though his Story is pretended to be nothing else then a Translation of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> yet he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd it after that bold and careless rate, as almost to have turn'd the History into a Romance by flourishing it with variety of circumstances of his own invention. And therefore where he adds any thing to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> he is to be turn'd off, as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42190:216"/>
of no Credit, for no worse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then this, because he speaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority, for now he can have but that of <hi>Eusebius.</hi> So that whatever he has given us over and above what <hi>Eusebius</hi> has given him, must pass for an extravagant Dream and Vision of his own over hot Brain. And such is this passage, that <hi>Constantine</hi> himself made by Will the Division of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire between his three Sons, whereas <hi>Eusebius</hi> makes no mention of any Will, but only affirms in general terms, and that in a Panegyrical Stile, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Empire, that is, left it divided to his Sons as it were a Paternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> has boldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translated <hi>[liberis de successione Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Orbis Testamento haeredibus scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis]</hi> And this bold rendring is all the ground of this Conceit, for as for the Story of <hi>Constantines</hi> delivering his Will to an <hi>Arian</hi> Presbyter, it looks so like an Arian Fiction, and is so utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of any timely Authority, that as it can deserve no credit, so I cannot think it worth any Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Especially when it is so evident that he was so far from making the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend between his Sons before his death, that there was an intrigue after it for
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42190:216"/>
three Months and an half, all which <note place="margin">Idatius in Fastis.</note> times his Sons took not upon them the Imperial Authority, which was denoted by the Title of <hi>Augustus,</hi> but kept that of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> which they had before, and is synonimous with that of Prince in other Empires and Kingdoms, till each man took upon him the Government of his own share, so that it is not improbable that the division was made among themselves, as 'tis expresly attested by <hi>Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> and shrewdly intimated by <hi>Julian</hi>

Though after all the most likely conjecture is, that every man kept that part, of which he was in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42190:217"/>
as Vice-Roy at his Eathers death; for it is certain that at the time of his death the Government of the Empire under him was shared among them after the same manner, as it ever after conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and therefore it was but a chance that the eldest Brother succeeded in that part that came from the Grandfather, in that he then happened to be the present Vice-Roy of it; and it is but a lavish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that some would Collect from the Panegyrick of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that he succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it as Heir of the Family, whereas <hi>Eusebius</hi> affirms nothing more, then that the eldest Son had that part that came from the Grandfather; but upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was allotted to him he says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore it is most probable that as he succeeded not by right of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, (for there was no such thing at that time in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and if there had, he must have inherited his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Empire as well as his Grandfathers;) so neither by Will or Testament, for then his Father had dealt very unkindly by his Eldest Son to leave him but a younger Brothers Portion, <hi>viz.</hi> one half of the Western Empire, and that the worst too, the Transalpine Provinces; but meerly by the Casual Title of Possession which he was forced to accept of, because his
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42190:217"/>
Younger Brothers would part with none of their demeans, and therefore which way soever the Lot was cast, he was so dissatified with his own division, that he invaded his younger Brothers Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> but perisht in the attempt: So that though he was a friend to the Orthodox Faith, yet he lived not long enough to do it any considerable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, only he recall'd <hi>Athanasius</hi> from banishment speedily after his Father's death, in that he subscribes his Letter to the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> commanding his reception, by the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which must be within the three Months before the division, and that shews the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his zeal in the cause. Though <hi>Sandius,</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> that would be, if he <note place="margin">

these Letters are so full of respect and honour to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> yet this modest Man blushes not to set down the Prince that sent them for a Patron of <hi>Arianism.</hi> I find strange dealing with the Records of the Church by all Factions, that will not or dare not be honest; but this Man's whole story is nothing better then a meer blot dasht upon them all, and yet because his Tale, though it be as dull as false, is cross to the received Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, from the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to this very day, it is embraced as a great and weighty discovery, and the silly Scribler Canonised among the Wits and the Worthies of this discerning Age, and therefore though, whoever he was, he be a very contemptible thing of himself, yet because he has got the Authority of a fashionable Vogue, I am forced all along as I proceed in this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to expose his want of common Sense as well as common Honesty, only to let the unlearned Scepticks of the Age see by what woful Dunces they are cheated out of their Religion. And next to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorming them of the real Truth of things, I take this way of checking their pride and folly to be the best method to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to Sobriety. But to leave this Pedant, and return to my Story: Upon
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42190:218"/>
the death of <hi>Constantine</hi> the younger, the whole Western Empire falls to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Constans,</hi> and so came in that fatal division both of the Empire and the Church, that at last proved the utter ruine and destruction of both. For after this time we read of nothing so much as Wars and Dissentions between the two States, and Schisms and Divisions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Churches (unless now and then when the Empire hapned to be united in one wise Prince, as in <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Theodosius,</hi> and <hi>Marcian,)</hi> till at last the Empire was swallowed up by its own divisions, and the incursions of the Barbarians, and the Church split a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder by an irreconcileable Schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi> The first Foundation of which breach was laid by these two Brothers, who unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Clergy of the Empire as well as the Civil State: For <hi>Constantius</hi> siding with the <hi>Eusebians</hi> in the East, and <hi>Constans</hi> with the <hi>Athanasians</hi> in the West, which was now become the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, the cause of <hi>Arius</hi> being wholly laid aside by both Parties, and the only contest now was, Whether the word <gap reason="foreign">

necessary defence against the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his friends truly maintain'd. Now each Party having the Power of the Empire to abet and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its interest, and the Division being become a kind of a State-Faction; this to be sure made the breach wider, and the quarrel fiercer then a meer Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Schism could have come to, insomuch that it sometime came very near to a Civil War between the two Brothers. All which was chiefly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the folly of <hi>Constantius,</hi> who being the more zealous and serious of the two (for <hi>Constans</hi> gave himself more up to his pleasure and luxury) he was so much the more busie in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Faction, and it is an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing to observe how childishly he spent his whole Reign in Metaphysical wranglings about Religion, as he is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and too truly censur'd by <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus.

But what if the word did not please his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, what need of all this rage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against it? And granting that it might have been spared at first as those that Seduced him pleaded; yet when it was approved and settled by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> it ought at least for the Peace of the Church to have been submitted to. For to what purpose is it to call Councils for the resolving of Doubts and ending of Controversies, if their determinations have not Authority enough to Warránt and Oblige our Obedience? This word therefore having been planted in their Creed by the great Council, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, it became all modest and peaceable Men, though they had not at first approved it, after that to make no contention about it. And that was the Schismatical humour of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians,</hi> that when it was once fix't by the Authority of the Church, they should be so restless against its admission, which was in effect to destroy and nullifie all
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42190:220"/>
Government in the Christian Church. For if the Decree of so venerable a Council be not of force enough to ver-rule every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mans own conceit, it is but folly and non-sense to talk of any such thing as Government in the Church, and this is that which <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Book <hi>De Synodis</hi> every where charges so home upon them, that they troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to call so many Councils, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose so many Creeds to settle what was already done to their hands by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers. And they are gaul'd with the same objection by <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in his smart Letter to the <hi>Eusebians.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is an affront (says he) to the Synod, and all the Bishops that sate in it, if what they with so much Pains and Piety, God himself as it were being present, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, should be slighted by us as a thing of no Authority. And this to them was a cutting Argument, for they all profess't great Reverence to the great Council, and therefore ought to have acquiesced in it. And as it was in that case, so is it in all cases, when once a Controversie is determin'd by the Church,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42190:221"/>
it ought to conclude all Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it. Not because the Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, or any Council how great soever, but because its determinations are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative, and bind by virtue of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commission in all cases that are are not against the clear, express, and immediate Commands of God himself; so that if any Man dare presume to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say or disobey any Law of the Church, he ought to have an extraordinary assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to warrant his dissent: But if he be refractory upon Surmises and remote Inferences, or about matters of no great Weight, or little Evidence, he plainly runs himself into the sin of Schism in this World, and the punishment of it in the World to come. And that will fall upon him with so much the heavier Load, because the Practice flowing from this Principle is of all things most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of that which God of all things most loves, the Peace and Tranquility of his Church. For that cannot possibly be any other way preserved than by a yielding and submissive Temper in all things, where himself has not apparently determin'd us by an antecedent Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And such cases can rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whilst the Primitive Constitution of the Christian Church is any where
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42190:221"/>
preserved, and at least it is clear, that this was the case of the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> who raised so thick a dust against what was determin'd by the Authority of the Church, only because they supposed the determination unnecessary and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but what then? and granting it were so, it was not unlawful, unless it had expresly contradicted something that was necessary. But that themselves had not the confidence to pretend, and if they had not, then it is plain that they ought not to have quarrell'd with it, but to have quietly submitted to it, though not for its truth, yet for the Peace, and out of respect to the Sacred Authority of the Christian Church. And that would have saved and prevented all that Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil that they brought both upon it and the Empire too for so many years, only to persist in a peevish and (at best) a needless animosity against its Legal and Canonical determination.</p>

And therefore it has been but a vain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that has been so long agitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Authority of this Council in particular. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> when he was kept out of his Bishoprick by virtue of a Canon made in it, pleads that they were <hi>Arians</hi> who made it. And for the same reason, they are rejected by his Patron Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the first Pope, but with what design we shall see in its proper place, otherwise the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has been universally received in the Catholick Church; St. <hi>Hilary</hi> himself reckons it among the <hi>Anti-Arian</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the Canons of it were received into the Code of the Canons that was collected before the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and have ever since been received both by the Eastern and Western Churches, till <hi>Baronius</hi> and the late Romanists endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring them into disgrace, for the Affront that they had given to Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> in rating of him so severely for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling with their Affairs. For thô that transaction is one of the main pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages that they insist upon, to make out the Authority of the Popes Universal Pragmaticalness, yet there is scarce a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42190:224"/>
Testimony against it extant in the Records of the Church. For when he takes upon him to act out of his Province in giving Absolution to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> they charge him with a violation of all the Laws of the Christian Church, and tell him that when <hi>Novatus</hi> was condemn'd by his Predecessors, the Eastern Church would never receive the Schismatick to Communion, and therefore challenge him how he dares make so bold with the Discipline of the Christian Church, as to reverse any of their Decrees, and they afterward proceed so high in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, as to Excommunicate his Holiness for his uncanonical Presumption, and to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their Sentence against him by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyclical Epistle to all the Bishops of the Christian World, which no doubt is a very likely thing, if his universal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy had been then as well known and as much talkt of, as these Men would make us believe; when as it is not in the least challenged, or any way intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Julius,</hi> so is it denyed by the Eastern Bishops, as an utter overthrow of the known Discipline of the Christian Church. And whereas he cited them to appear before the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> that was by virtue of their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Appeal, when they had refer'd
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:42190:225"/>
themselves and their Cause to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, for it was summon'd only at their Request and importunity. Now after all this that was done purely to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themselves, first wholly to baulk and decline the Council, and then whilst it was Sitting, and the Cause depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they had put to reference, to pass Judgment upon it themselves, was such a piece of foul dealing, as is not to be endured in common Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. And that is the very thing that <hi>Julius</hi> himself charges upon them in Answer to their objection against him for intermedling with their Affairs, not that they affronted his Supremacy, but that when they had put him to the trouble of summoning a Council, and while the matter was under Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, they should put such a slur upon it, as meerly to steal away the cause that themselves had seem'd so much concern'd, after so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, to refer to its final determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And in truth the whole business was so involved by the Craft of <hi>Eusebius</hi> from the time of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi> which way soever he turn'd to clear his Innocence, found himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared by the Canons themselves. For as
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:42190:225"/>
he was deposed in Council, so he could not be Canonically restored but by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and that is it they press upon him notwithstanding the Emperour's Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that though he had power to call him from banishment, yet he had none to take off the Censure of the Church. And the Plea had held good if there had not been so much and so exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Villany at the bottom, though by it we may see, by laying one ill Action for a Foundation, what a vast Pile of Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty may be built upon it. For grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sentence of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council to be good (as it would have been, had it not been so enormously base) <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> was, which way soever he moved, catch't in the Canons, and therefore in all his Pleadings he is so wise as to refer his whole Cause to the Acts of that Council, and that at last got him the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory by making known their Villany. But granting them Valid, his Restitution by the Emperour was Canonically void, as to any exercise of his Episcopal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that was the point that they urged to the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Second banishment, but fearing lest if he should make enquiry into the whole matter, all their Forgeries should come to light, they carry their Cause a
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42190:226"/>
great way off, as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> and that with a mighty shew of fair dealing and ingenuity on their part, that they were so far from desiring any partial Judgment, that they would refer it to Judges utterly unconcern'd, and therefore send it into the other Empire. And now when this was done with so much plausibility, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> all on the suddain huddles up a Council at home, and dispatches the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness before the Council at <hi>Rome</hi> could publish their Sentence; and by that trick he very artificially ensconst himself and his Cause in a new Quarrel, that would engage one half of the Christian Church on his side. For now it was become the Quarrel of the Eastern Church against the Western, because when they had sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced a Cause at <hi>Antioch,</hi> what power had they to reverse the Decree at <hi>Rome.</hi> This must be an Invasion of the Liberties of the Oriental Church, and no less then an Attempt to bring them into subjection to the Western Bishops, and thus were they all drawn in by this Crafty Man to back his own Quarrel. And therefore it is observable that this Cause was ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter managed by this very pretence, and it was the very Complaint of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebian</hi> Bishops, that parted from <hi>Sardica</hi> and sat at <hi>Philippi,</hi> against the <hi>Sardican</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:42190:226"/>
Council, that they endeavour'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a new Law, that the Eastern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops should be subject to the judgment of the Western. And thus by this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice did this subtle man remove his <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Villany out of the sight, and then he might go forwardwithout fear or danger, for nothing else but the discovery of that could ever expose himself, ruine his Cause, and defeat his Malice.</p>
               <p>But the most cunning Stratagem of all was that at the same time that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with so much seeming Christian Severity against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> they either Enacted or Ratified so many excellent Laws of Discipline, that yet were but so many Snares to <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Friends after his <hi>Tyrian</hi> deposition, especially the fifth, eleventh, and twelfth. In the fifth it is decreed that if a Presbyter refuse to Communicate with his Bishop, he shall after three Admonitions be deposed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and be punisht by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate as a Seditious Person, a very good Canon in it self, but at that juncture of time it was only a Rod for the Orthodox Clergy of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who the <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> too well knew, would peremptorily refuse all Communion with their new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Gregory,</hi> that was thrust upon them by this Council and a Military Force in
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42190:227"/>
the place of <hi>Athanasius</hi> their true and lawful Bishop. In the eleventh and twelfth Canons all Appeals from Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Censures to the Emperour are strictly forbidden under pain of Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is farther provided that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bishop be Synodically deposed, he is not to be restored but by a greater Synod of Bishops. This reach't <hi>Athanasius</hi> to the quick for his flying from the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council to <hi>Constantine,</hi> and withal cut off his Restitution by the Imperial Mandate. Now these had been good Laws in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cases, but in the Case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> they were nothing but Rods and Snares; And so it is always, when injustice has got the upper hand, the Execution of Laws then becomes nothing but Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Oppression. If the Proceedings against <hi>Athanasius</hi> at <hi>Tyre</hi> had been any way fair and legal, though he had been hardly used, yet his Appeal was against the Ecclesiastical Rule, and it would have been more decent and becoming Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Modesty, to have sate down under an hard Sentence, then to have made a breach upon the Order and Discipline of the Church. But when it was all rank Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany and open Forgery contriv'd on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to take away his life, it was then proper for him to take Sanctuary in the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42190:227"/>
justice of his Sovereign Prince for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Subjects Protection. And indeed wherever injustice is become shameless and enormous, men are not bound to that punctual niceness of Rule, that they are bound to observe in common and ordinary Cases. And so it was here, their Proceedings at <hi>Tyre</hi> were so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously base and impudent, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the common Villany of Mankind, and so were by their own wickedness put out of the Protection of the Laws. I have the longer insisted upon this Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action because it is an extraordinary Case, and has nothing like it in all the Records of the Church in the worst and most degenerate times, and though there have been several of the later Popes both wicked and cunning enough, yet none of them could ever match either the Malice or the Artifice of <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the management of his Contest with <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius.</hi> But whilst he was contriving and plotting his designs against him at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> the Council at <hi>Rome</hi> proceeds to a fair Tryal, and after the Examination of the Acts of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council, and of divers Witnesses clearing <hi>Athanasius</hi> from the Calumnies fast'ned on him, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him innocent, receive him to Communion, and restore him to his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:42190:228"/>
And thus are they according to the Plot of <hi>Eusebius</hi> engaged in a new War, that he knew would swallow up the old Controversie, of which the two heads were the two great Bishops of the two great Imperial Cities, <hi>Julius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for before this time he had violently thrust himself into that See, and these were the first Seeds of that long War between these two ambitious Sees, that I have described at large in a former Treatise. But <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> leaves them to manage their own Fray between themselves, and makes all hast to repair to his own Church of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> where he arrives before <hi>Gregory</hi> could come from <hi>Antioch,</hi> to the great joy of the City, but soon after comes <hi>Gregory,</hi> and what havock he made by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Philagrius</hi> the Prefect an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Christian, may be seen at large in <hi>Athanasius</hi> his encyclical Epistle to the Orthodox Bishops, and as he describes it, it exceeds all the Heathen Persecutions in rudeness and barbarity. But in short, <hi>Athanasius</hi> is forced to fly for his life, and takes Sanctuary at <hi>Rome</hi> a second time, where he knew himself safe, as being out of <hi>Constantius</hi> his Dominions. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time the Popes Legates <hi>Elpidius</hi> and <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> having been
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42190:228"/>
from time to time retein'd and delayed by the Craft of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> return from the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as with no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to themselves, having been Eye-Witnesses of so much foul dealing, so with an huffing and scornful Letter of Defiance to their Master Pope <hi>Julius</hi> and all the Bishops of the Western Church. And by that Character that <hi>Julius</hi> gives of it in his answer to it (for the Letter it self is not now extant) it breaths the very Spirit of <hi>Eusebius:</hi> but as taunting as it was, and as bad as their Actings were, he is forced to return a milder Anfwer then indeed was fitting, because he too well knew that they relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power and assistance of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to bear them out in their Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. But as civilly as he treats them, he deals as plainly with them as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and unravels the whole Plot of Lyes, Perjuries, and Calumnies against <hi>Athanasius</hi> from the beginning to that very day, and so plainly lays open to the Christian World the foulness of all their Proceedings, as to demonstrate to all men, that notwithstanding they had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get the Canons on their own side by shifts and juglings, they had most scandalously broke all the most Sacred and inviolable Laws, not only of Christian
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42190:229"/>
Discipline, but of common honesty. The Epistle it self is extant in <hi>Athanasius</hi> his second Apology, and it is a perfect Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Cause and defence of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, written with equal judgment and smartness. It is large, but the main head of it is in Answer to their great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that they should be cited to <hi>Rome.</hi> To which he replyes, that in some cases it is agreeable to the Canons, that what is determined by one Council, should be reviewed in another; but however that was, he minds them that when they sent their Agents, after they had been pleased to refer the Cause to him, to manage the Evidence against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> they were so shamefully bafled in the whole business, that they had no way left to escape a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal overthrow, but by moving for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of Eastern and Western Bishops to be held at <hi>Rome;</hi> and now when the Council was call'd at their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pretend offence at its being call'd, as it argued very great Guilt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so it could not but raise very odd suspitions in others. And whereas they plead it as an Universal Rule, that what is determined in one Council ought not to be reverst by another, he asks them how then dare you to alter the Faith of the Great Nicene Council, that when
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42190:229"/>
the Bishops of the Christian World were so unanimously concern'd to root out the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, they should so far slight their Authority as to reject those Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they had made against it. And lastly (to pass by their smaller Cavils) he lets them see the necessity of this review, by ripping up all the Villanies of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Plot, and so plainly discovers the gross dishonesty of the whole matter, as must make them cautious of ever reviving it for the time to come. And the Story is told so fully, so plainly, and so reflectingly upon the Persons Guilty, that perhaps it was the dishonour of this Conviction that broke <hi>Eusebius</hi> his proud heart, for he dyed <note place="margin">

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42190:230"/>
Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> and before the Council at <hi>Sardica,</hi> and that agrees exactly with the time of <hi>Julius</hi> his Letters, which could not but strike him to the heart. For by this Epistle he saw all his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness brought to light, and his malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Athanasius</hi> after so much pains and so many deep contrivances, miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. And so dyed one of the worst Bishops that ever lived in the Christian Church, and <hi>Baronius</hi> his Character of him in comparing him to <hi>Ahab</hi> is very just and true, though he saw not through half his wickedness, that there was none like him before or since, who sold himself to the practice of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the sight of the Lord; though <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesius</hi> is of the mind that he dyed a good Christian, and wonders at the Cardinals severity against him, when he dyed in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And that is too much the common sense of the men of that Church, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men are as to all other things, yet if they are but good <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks they are good Christians too. But if he dyed in its Communion, it was because he lived no longer in it, for if he had survived till all his Train of Wickedness had been made publick to the Christian World, as they would have been in a little time,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42190:230"/>
not only the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but all the Bishops of the World must have denyed all Communion to so great a Villain.</p>
               <p>This is the exactest Narrative of all this Affair, that I can discover either by tracing and comparing the Relations out of the Antients of it, or the Observations of the Moderns upon it. <hi>Valesius</hi> indeed has used great subtilty to tell the Story a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <note place="margin">Observ. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. in Soc. &amp; Soz.</note> way. As if <hi>Athanasius</hi> had been but once at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that there had been but one Council held there about his Business, and that both were after the return of the <hi>Legates</hi> from the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that it was then that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was first absolved. But in my poor Opinion this learned man might very well have spared his pains, when it is so plain from <hi>Julius</hi> his Letter that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had been absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him before he received the Letter from <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that one of the main heads of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Letter was to complain of <hi>Julius</hi> his irregularity in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a man to Communion, that they had Excommunicated. And yet <hi>Valesius</hi> says he can find no such thing in the Letter, and thus it is a common thing when men are busie in searching after small matters that are difficultly to be discern'd, to stumble at such great things as they could not but at another time have observed.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42190:231"/>
For otherwise nothing can be plainer then that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was Canonically absolved before the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Letters, for when they complain'd that <hi>Julius</hi> had received him to Communion, that is proof enough of his Absolution, for without that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been once excommunicate, he could not have been received to Communion. And therefore it is but a poor shift of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesius</hi> to help out his niceness, that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> received him as he did the <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans de bene esse</hi> till he could enquire into the merits of the Cause. For the <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> were under no Sentence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to be received in course, but <hi>Athanasius</hi> being under Censure, he could not be received till that was taken off. But this is still more evident from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that <hi>Julius</hi> gives of the reasons of his Proceedings, <hi>viz.</hi> that having taken an exact Examination of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Accusations against <hi>Athanasius</hi> (and so reckons up the Calumnies and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries one by one) he asks them which was most agreeable to the Canons, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, as they had done, or absolve him as he had done. And if after all this, admitting an Accused Person to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:42190:231"/>
down, but by <hi>Valesius</hi> his over nice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is so involved, that I must confess that I cannot trace the Method of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story by it, nor reconcile it with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Antients.</p>

               <p>Having laid the Story of this poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd man together, I return back to our new Commissioners, who finding that though they had framed four several Creeds, in their first Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> none of them would satisfie the Western
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42190:233"/>
Bishops, they Summon a second Council to the same City in the Year 344, and draw up a long new Creed, for the most part consisting of Anathema's against all Branches of the Arian Heresie, and send it to the Western Bishops then Assembled at <hi>Milan,</hi> but they unanimously reject it, for this very reason, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to acquiesce in the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and not be so curious as after the Authority of their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make any farther enquiry; though learned Mr. <hi>Sandius</hi> says, they laid it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 83.</note> aside, because it being written in Greek, they understood it not; a wise account of a Transaction of the Christian Church, that they corresponded in an unknown Language, and understood not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they answer'd each others Papers and gave very good reasons for their disagreement, particularly the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Innovation. And there all along stuck the Controversie with the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Bishops, that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to abide by the Decree of that great Council, and out of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its Authority would never hear of any Alteration. And that is the great Charge with which <hi>Athanasius</hi> perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually loads the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> that for that very reason they could not be in the right
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42190:233"/>
in their belief, because they opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Faith of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> finding things grow worse, and the Schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eastern and Western Churches made daily wider, he Petitions the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Constans</hi> to move his Brother <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> to join with him for a general Council, to which <hi>Constantius</hi> agrees, and the most Convenient place pitch't upon for their Meeting was <hi>Sardica</hi> in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> being the Confines of both the Empires, where in the year 347 met at the time appointed 280 Western, and 76 Eastern Bishops. But they are no sooner met, then they break in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for the Eastern Bishops refuse to sit unless <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Accused may be first removed out of the Council; whereas the Western will have them treated (as they ought to be) as innocent Persons till they are Canonically Convicted. Upon this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divers inter-messages the Easterns for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the City, and sit at <hi>Philippopolis;</hi> and it is more then likely that they never came with any design of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pick't this quarrel only to baulk the Council. And this is roundly charged upon them by the Council it self, in their Encyclical Epistle, extant in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:42190:234"/>
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> his second Apology, as done by Compact; the Passage is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and because it is so, though it be somewhat long, I shall give the Reader the sense of it, as briefly as I can: <q>It is not without cause that these Men, though often cited, would never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but by their constant shifting a fair hearing through the guilt of their own Conscience, confirm'd both the suspition of their own forgeries, and gave ground to believe that the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations against themselves were but too true. And therefore because beside this shuffling, they have not only restored but advanced such as were Deposed for the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, in which design the chief Men after <hi>Eusebius, Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Heraclea, Narcissus</hi> of <hi>Neronias</hi> in <hi>Cilicia, Stephanus</hi> of <hi>Antioch, George</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, Acacius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Menaphantus</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, Ursaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of <hi>Singido</hi> in <hi>Mysia,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> of <hi>Mursa</hi> in <hi>Panonia</hi> are now the chief Ring-leaders. These Men therefore suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd not any of those who came with them out of <hi>Asia</hi> to Communicate with the Church here, or so much as to come to the Council, and in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney call'd several Meetings in the Form of Councils, in which they by their
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42190:234"/>
threat'nings forced the Company to enter into a Solemn Covenant among themselves, that when they come to <hi>Sardica</hi> they should peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the Authority of the Council, and never appear before it, or sit in it; but as soon as they came thither, when they had made a formal shew of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; should immediately vanish. This Treachery is attested by <hi>Macarius</hi> of <hi>Palestine,</hi> and <hi>Asterius</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who were all along present at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and who being offended at so much baseness, discover'd to the Council at their first coming, under what force they were detain'd, and with what wickedness things were to be managed. Adding withal that there were great numbers of Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in their parts, but that these Men kept them at home by force, and with the bloodiest threat'nings if they should dare to appear; and for all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Security of all that came, they obliged them all to lodge in the same house, that so no Man might any way be ticed and drawn away from the Conspiracy.</q> So far the Council, and nothing more evident all along then that the <hi>Eusebians</hi> dreaded nothing more then a fair hearing of the Indictments of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:42190:235"/>
their own framing; and therefore by all the Arts and Methods of disingenuity broke all Opportunities that were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for it. So that though they were forced to make an Appearance at <hi>Sardica,</hi> by the Emperor's Command, yet they came with this resolution, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to suffer the matter to come to any Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue: And withal finding themselves so over numbred that they could not obstruct it, they wisely take pet and quit the Council.</p>
               <p>But the Western Bishops for all that proceed, and reduce the Debate to these three Heads (as they have drawn it up in their Epistle to Pope <hi>Julius.)</hi> First, The settlement of the Faith. Secondly, The Examination of Witnesses, that had been illegally rejected in former Councils. 3dly, An enquiry after all those various injuries, and violences that had been done to the Orthodox Clergy by the <hi>Eusebians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the first, It is unanimously Voted to frame no new Creed, but to acquiesce in the sufficiency of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, They unravel all the Forgeries and Tergiversations of the <hi>Eusebians</hi> in former Councils, and in an Encyclical Epistle certifie all the Bishops of the Christian World of the several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that had been made use of, to raise an Accusation against <hi>Athanasius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orthodox Bishops; and then of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:42190:235"/>
their several disingenuous and dishonest Methods, to shift the proof of their own Indictment, particulary of their running away from their own Appeal to <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but most of all of their awkerd behaviour in this Council, where they would not be prevail'd with by any importunity or intreaty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Tryal, which the Council imputes not only to their knowledge of the defect of their Accusations against others, but to the Conscience of their own guilt. Seeing great numbers of Persons there present, that were ready to testifie of their various Cruelties, and tell sad Stories of their Imprisoning, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, Beating, Starving, Strangling Persons in Holy Orders, only for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to Communicate with the <hi>Aria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Hereticks. And though the Criminals refused to appear, the Witnesses were Examined, and they Deposed, and both the Emperors written to, that their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties would be pleased to set all such at liberty, that were still under restraint, and to order their Officers for the time to come, not to use any force or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against the Clergy for their Faith, but leave them first to be tryed by the Ecclesiastical Judicature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:42190:236"/>
In the next place the whole Intrigue against <hi>Athanasius</hi> is re-examined, the Stories of <hi>Arsenius</hi> and <hi>Ischiras</hi> farther proved by fresh Witnesses, and so both himself and the rest of the Deposed and Banish't Bishops are restored, and the Intruders thrust not only out of their Sees, but out of the Communion of the Christian Church. And then in the last place they enact some Rules of Discipline useful and almost necessary for the Present State of the Church, as against the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Eusebius</hi> and other Bishops of the Faction, that invade other Mens Bishopricks, and though such Offenders were only sent back to their own Sees by the Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, this Council is so severe as not only to Depose but Excommunicate them, so as not to be capable of being admitted to Lay-Communion even at the hour of death. Another Canon they made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wandring of Bishops, and that reach't <hi>Ursacius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> who left their own Diocesses to carry on the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebian</hi> Faction in other Provinces. A third Canon was, That if a Bishop were oppress't by his Com-provincials, he might have leave to make his complaint to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who might judge whether he ought to have a new hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42190:236"/>
or not, and this (beside some secret reasons) was to relieve the Eastern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops from the Oppression of the <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> who carried all before them by force and foul dealing. Though the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> will have it to have been made particularly to justifie <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Appeal to <hi>Rome;</hi> but beside that if it were true, it would do their Cause no service; it is certain that <hi>Athanasius</hi> made not the Appeal himself, but that his Cause was first referr'd thither by the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> and that too with no other design then to remove it as far as they could from their own doors for fear of discovery.</p>

               <p>But as vigorously as the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Bishops proceeded at <hi>Sardica,</hi> the Eastern out-stript them at <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> they first take to themselves the Title of the Council at <hi>Sardica,</hi> they draw up a new Confession of Faith, and call it the <hi>Sardican</hi> Creed, in which they Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matise all the Positions of <hi>Arius,</hi> and only omit the word <hi>Consubstantial.</hi> And as for <hi>Athanasius</hi> they cunningly load him with the Authority of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the Sentence of <hi>Constantine</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Qui omnia ejus flagitia recognoscens suâ illum sententiâ in exilium deportavit,

Who examining into all his Crimes, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish't him by his own Sentence,</hi> as they blush not to aver, as if the abused Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had been acquainted with all the juglings of that Council, when it was their only care to keep their proceedings altogether in the dark from him. But from this they proceed to infer that <hi>Athanasius</hi> being condemn'd by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of so many Bishops, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperor, it was now but a trick to move for a new Tryal, when so many of the Judges, Accusers, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were dead, and therefore they must have the old Sentence allowed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified before they would act, least (as they plead) <hi>They should bring in that prophane Innovation,</hi> Quam horret vetus consuetudo Ecclesiae, ut in concilio Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales Episcopi quicquid forte statuissent, ab Episcopis Occidentalibus refricaretur &amp; vice versa, <hi>That the Ancient Custom of the Church abhors, that the Decrees of the Eastern Church should be reversed by the Western, and so on the contrary.</hi> That was the point they would still be at, that whatever was done in the Eastern Church should not be submitted to the Judgment of the Western Bishops, and then that secured the Authority of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council, and as long as that stood
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:42190:237"/>
firm, so did their Cause too. But to make short work of it (for there are vast numbers of odd casts of disingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Epistle) they Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>Athanasius, Paul</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Julius</hi> of <hi>Rome, Osius, Marcellus,</hi> and all that had any hand in the Absolution of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and this they signifie in an Encyclical Epistle written in the Name of the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> to their friends in all Parts of the World; and among many others it is directed to <hi>Donatus</hi> the Schismatical Bishop of <hi>Carthage, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the Catholique Bishop of that City, with 36 other <hi>African</hi> Bishops being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it against the <hi>Philippopolitans,</hi> who therefore think to strengthen their Party, by courting the Schismaticks to their side. And among other sweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers flatter them with their own dear Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>viz.</hi> That they durst not join with the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council, <hi>Ne prodito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res fidei Traditoresque Scripturarum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camur; Lest we should be esteemed Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Faith, and Traditors of the Scriptures;</hi> thereby insinuating an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their Schism from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks upon that pretence. And this took so luckily, that the Schismatiques pleaded it in the days of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42190:238"/>
prove that they had ever been in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Eastern Church. But both parties having done the business, that they came about, especially the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> whose only project it was to shun the Council, and make the breach more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with the whole Western Church, they break up their Assembly, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come put to death all that refuse Communion with them, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they make a great Massacre at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople,</hi> where they cut off the Bishop's hands, and after that his head, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other outrages recited by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> in his Epistle to the Monks. But as for the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council, having settled things as well as they could, they acquaint both the Emperors with the Issue of their Proceedings, and send three Bishops.

And this was the first thing that opened his Eyes, though they soon closed again, for by this (says <hi>Athanasius)</hi> he was induced to suspect <note place="margin">Epist. ad Solit.</note> the like Villanies against my self, and the other abufed Bishops, and so recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us all from banifhment.

And at his parting only makes this request, that of that vast number of Churches that were under his Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would be pleased to grant one for the use of those who dissented from him; <hi>Athanasius</hi> replies, That he is ready to obey all his Majesties Commands, only he requests the same favour for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters at <hi>Antioch, i. e.</hi> the Orthodox, who would rather set up a separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, then Communicate promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with the <hi>Arians,</hi> as the <hi>Eusebians</hi>
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:42190:239"/>
did This request was so reasonable that the Emperor could not deny it; but the <hi>Eusebians</hi> immediately stifle the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well knowing that they should loose more by this liberty to the Orthodox at <hi>Antioch,</hi> then they should gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Cause by granting it to the <hi>Arians</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

               <p>And so the banisht Bishops are restored to to their several Sees, and they quietly enjoy them till the unfortunate death of the Emperour <hi>Constans,</hi> who in the year 350, was barbarously murthered by his <hi>Rebel slave Magnentius,</hi> who was the first man pretending to Christianity, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of Rebelling against his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Prince, though it is Evident, that he was at best but a counterfeit Christian, in that as soon as he had got the Empire he endeavoured the Restitution of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as appears from the Law of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to abolish the night sacrifices, that <note place="margin">

But this dishonourable submission does but make the Party more outragious and implacable, and they resolve that though <hi>Athanasius</hi> had hitherto escaped all their Snares, that they will have his blood at last, and therefore they only sit still a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while to hatch new matter for Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

of keeping Correspondence with <hi>Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> against the Emperour, though our Arian Historians are here so subtle too as to take no notice of this passage, because the Calumny was afterward so shamefully bafled by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as we shall see in its due place. But however by this and the like devices they once more enrage the Emperour against him, though he is forced to dissemble his displeasure, till he sees the Event of the War. In the mean time <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> dyes, and <hi>Liberius</hi> succeeds, to whom Letters are sent by the <hi>Eusebians</hi> in the East to joyn Communion with them against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi> and others from <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Bishops to enter into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them against the Easterns, <hi>Liberius</hi> at first, being ignorant of his Case, denyes <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but at length upon better Information, rejects the Easterns and Communicates with the <hi>Africans.</hi> But this was such an affront to their haughty Spirits, that they ever after studied and watch't for Revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him as diligently as they ever did against <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And <hi>Liberius</hi> forese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they would raise a Storm upon him; dispatches away his Legates to the Emperour to Petition for a Council, but before they came the Emperour was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

better then mad, for though at the Battel with <hi>Magnentius</hi> he was so far forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all Courage, that he had not so much hardness as but to behold the Fight but retired into a Vault with his worthy Confessor <hi>Valens</hi> Bishop of the place, who had the craft to set his Spyes to bring him the first News of the event of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, that so he might endear himself to the Emperor, by being the Messenger of so good News, if things went right: But if wrong, that then he might save himself in the first place either by flight or by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Master to the Rebel, for Men of his Principles can never boggle at any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. But so it happened that <hi>Magnentius</hi> his Army being put to an utter Rout, that he had that timely intelligence of it, that he had laid by his Spyes. Whereas the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and his Eunuchs a sort of Men that were his great Favourites and inseparable Companions, not having the courage so much as to look out of their hole, could suspect nothing of the Messengers Arrival; and therefore <hi>Valens</hi> to add worship to himself, like a Villain as he was, pretends that the Message was brought him by an Angel, and the poor Emperour in that sad pickle in which he then lay, gladly and greedily believed any thing that was for his own case, and imputed the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

then a scornful smile, and so proceeds to represent the foul dealings of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Council, the Forgeries and Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Ursacius,</hi> but here he is again upon a dangerous point, and so is again interrupted by the Courtiers with rude and impertinent reflections upon the drift of his discourse, and there is an end of all the Conference upon that point. The next great Jealousie that they had blown into the Emperours head was, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had so little Wit, Manners, and Religion as to have made it a great part of his business to make bate between the Emperour and his Brother, and carried it on so effectually, that if <hi>Constantius</hi> had not very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd his own Passion, it had broken out into an open and Fatal War, and he is so much possest with this jealousie, that he professes that the Victory over <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentius</hi> (though he run mad for joy of it) was not more acceptable to him, then one over <hi>Athanasius</hi> would be. But to this the Bishop replyes, That if it were true, it was most proper for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to punish such an Offender at his own Tribunal, and not to force the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Judicature to condemn a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of any Crime unheard. But when nothing will do, he has his choice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42190:245"/>
to subscribe the Condemnation or leave his Bishoprick. The first he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily refuses, and so is banisht to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raea</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Faelix</hi> his Arch-Deacon put into his place.

                     <hi>Theodoret l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> that <hi>Faelix</hi> was no <hi>Arian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but a Stickler for the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, only allowing the <hi>Arians</hi> a capacity of Communion with the Church. And that is the thing that I affirm all along to have been the Eusebian Cause, not to restore <hi>Arianism,</hi> but to piece up the Peace of the Church by comprehending all in one Communion or by mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance. So that notwithstanding that vehement out-cry that has been hitherto made of the Universal Predominancy of <hi>Arianism</hi> under <hi>Constantius,</hi> especially at this very moment of time, I do not find it hitherto so much as own'd, nor any man preferr'd upon the account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Arian.

that the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie it self in all this Controversie never appear'd at top. And those very Bishops that are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as the most zealous <hi>Arians,</hi> were rather Atheists then Heretiques. The Head and Founder of the Party was <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and what a worthy Saint he was, already appears from the Tenour of his whole life. But when by his unfortunate favour at Court, he had got the Power of the Church into his own hands, especially the disposal of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks, and made that the only qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for Preferment, to join with him and his malice against <hi>Athanasius;</hi> in this case it is no wonder if the vilest of Men flockt in to his Party in as great sholes, as <hi>Irish</hi> Evidences to a Plot. And such were <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Ursacius,</hi> Men Educated in Villany, and so harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their wickedness, that they were past shame at its very discovery, and when they could not stand out a Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they would impudently confess it, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

himself to consider, whether it became his Majesty at that time of the day to suffer himself to be made a Tool by such Perjur'd Wretches as <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Ursaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and so in short he denies all compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and defies his threatnings, and upon it he is immediately seized and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and there kept in custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy till the meeting of a Council in that City the year following.</p>
               <p>And though the fury of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's, or rather his Eunuchs Persecution in these European Parts, is here some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what interrupted by the Incursions of the barbarous Nations into <hi>Gaul,</hi> yet he rages so much the more fiercely in <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> especially at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> sending <hi>Syrianus</hi> with some Legions of Soldiers to murther <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who besets his Church in the night, where the People were then Assembled, and are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the Name of God to depart quietly, and himself by a kind of Miracle makes his escape through the body of the Soldiers that had encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him at the Altar, but he being fled and lying conceal'd in the Deserts, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> is prevail'd with to put that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divine (as he calls him) <hi>George</hi> into his Room, but what a notorious Villain he had ever been is already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42190:248"/>
but now being got into Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he commits all manner of outrages in the City, makes divers slaughters in the Churches themselves, imprisons Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Widows and Orphans, seizes on the Orthodox Christians by night, and throws them into Goal; ejects all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops throughout <hi>AEgypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> that refuse to subscribe the Condemnation of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and of these some he bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, others he imprisons, in short, he sweeps all away before him like a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flood, and bears away all the Orthodox Clergy out of their Possessions in the Church, <hi>Athanasius</hi> reckons up no less then Ninty Bishops ejected in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> whereof Sixteen were banisht. But the worst of all is still behind, their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks are sold to Heathens, Soldiers, or any Chapmen that would bid most Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for them; and so all ill Men of what Profession or Religion soever, or rather of none at all, crowded into the Party for the purchase of a Bishoprick; and so was the whole Church put into the hands of wicked and debauch't Men, who could do no service in it, but in the way of out-rage and cruelty; and in short, the sury of this Persecution through all <hi>Africk</hi> is described by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> not only to have equall'd, but exceeded any
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42190:248"/>
of the Heathen Persecutions, both for rudeness and cruelty. But still himself was the Man aim'd at in it all, great rewards are promised by publick Edicts to the Man that shall slay him, and blood-hounds are sent out into all Parts to scent out his Form, but by a great wonder of Providence he lyes undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all the time of <hi>Constantius.</hi> And in this retirement he did himself and the World that right, as to write those two excellent Discourses in his own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>viz.</hi> his Epistle to the Monks, and his first Apology to <hi>Constantius;</hi> in both which he has with that clearness of Reason, and evidence of Record laid open the wickedness of the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> in the contrivance of all his Troubles from the time of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to that very day, that it is not so properly an History as a Demonstration, for he has related nothing that he has not proved by undeniable Records. And the truth of it is, he is the only valuable Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of his own Actions, for all the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are so confused in their account of him, that as they are not to be at all trusted when they differ from him, so are they very little to be relied upon in any Report, that is not vouch't by his Authority.</p>

                  </note> for its Condemnation. And here the Learned <hi>Petavius</hi> is as over-nice to
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42190:249"/>
disturb the plain History of this Council, as I have shewn <hi>Valesius</hi> to have been in reforming the History of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Absolution of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius.</hi> For as he there took a great deal of pains to make but one Council of two, so has our Learned Jesuite here to make two of one. For though there is mention of no more then one in all the Ancient Records of the Church, yet he has lately found out another that (he says) has hitherto lain buried under the ruins of St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Fragments; but alas they are so imperfect and confused, that nothing can with any assurance be built upon their single Testimony, much less upon remote inferences from them, which yet is all the light that this Learned Man is able to strike out of that Rubbish. Neither indeed is it <hi>tanti</hi> to spend so much Learning upon such a lean and barren Enquiry, for whether there were two or one <hi>Sirmian</hi> Councils, they were call'd upon the same Errand, and (as I shall prove) were of the same mind, and what that is we sufficiently know by the Records of that which he would have to be the second, whereas the most that we can know of the first beside this, is only that there was such a Council, and if that be all, I cannot
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:42190:250"/>
see what Temptation the Learned Man could have, to be so proud of his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and to take so much pains to make out a nicety of so little weight. I must confess with him and Father <hi>Labbe,</hi> That there is no part of Ecclesiastical History more involved, then that which relates to the Transactions of this Council, but then the difficulty arises not from any confusion of the two Councils as they imagine, but upon the defect of some Records, that they have not observed, though they are grounded upon an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mistake, as I shall shew in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Story. In the first place, as for the time of the sitting of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, it is become a great Controversie among the Learned, <hi>Baronius</hi> places it in the year 357, <hi>Petavins,</hi> and after him <hi>Valesius,</hi> in the year 351, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see any reason that they have for it, then only to serve the Hypothesis of a double Council. And as for the reasons that <hi>Baronius</hi> gives for his Chronology, they are evident from the very Story, of that time, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Council of <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium</hi> was call'd after the Council of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> the Banishment of <hi>Liberius,</hi> and the Confinement of <hi>Hosius</hi> at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and three years after the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> by St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> &amp; the Orthodox Bishops against
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:42190:250"/>
                  <hi>Saturninus,</hi> all which fall in exactly with this time. To which might have been added, that it was but a little time before the Council of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> where the Bishops that had been present at this Council of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> were surprised with the news of the bold proceedings of <hi>Valens</hi> and his Companions, against their Decrees at <hi>Sirmium;</hi> and yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and proved by <hi>Petavius</hi> himself, that the Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi> met in the year 358, whereas by his Hypothesis there must have been Seven years di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the two Councils, which is utterly inconsistent with the whole Train of the Story. And as for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Baronius,</hi> though they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by <hi>Petavius,</hi> yet I do not find that he has any way attempted either to answer or disprove them, unless by opposing to them the Authority of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who place it in the year after the Consulship of <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>Nigrinianus,</hi> and that is the year 351. But to me it looks very strange, that these Learned Men should lay so much stress upon the Authority of these Writers in a point of Chronology, when themselves so well knew, and have so well proved too, that there is scarce a Transaction in the whole History, that they have not
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42190:251"/>
Mis-timed, Ante-dating, or Post-dating every thing And that they did so here, is evident from the whole Series of the History, especially the time of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of <hi>Hosius,</hi> after the Council of <hi>Milan,</hi> in the first place, which could not be till some years after the year 351, in that the Council of <hi>Milan</hi> it self was not held till the year 355. And in the next place the meeting of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Ancyra</hi> in the year 358, upon the first news of the disorderly proceedings of <hi>Valens</hi> and his Faction against the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Council, which could scarce take up a years time, but much less seven years, which it must have done if the first sitting of the Council had been in the year 351. But beside both these evident Demonstrations, there is another proof of as great force out of the Historians themselves, of which <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Annot. in Socrat. hist. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> has taken notice, but over-lookt the Consequence. <hi>i. e.</hi> That several Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that they affirm to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Council, were not Bishops till some years after the year 351, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patianus</hi> of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> who came not to their Bishopricks till the year 356. And then I hope no Man can doubt but that it was an evident mistake to make them Bishops in the year 351.</p>

Now the time being rightly stated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the over-curious amendment of these Learned Men, the whole Series of the Story will run smooth and easie: For the Emperor coming to <hi>Sirmium</hi> in his Wars against the Barbarians, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi>

the Master objecti on against them, which they could never avoid, though they would never submit to it; and now finding the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenian</hi> Heresie brought in upon them, they are more concern'd then any other Party to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear against it, both to clear themselves of the objection and to vindicate their own Reputation: That the main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Council consisted of <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> is evident from the Subscriptions of the Council of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra,</hi> whereof all were present at this, and from the Presidency of <hi>Basilius,</hi> who was both an Eminent <hi>Eusebian,</hi> and the Chairman and chief Actor in this Council. Neither is there the name of any one Orthodox Bishop that was present at this Council upon Record, but only <hi>Hosius,</hi> who was there by compulsion. Now to give a cast of their Zeal both against the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42190:252"/>
new and the old Heresie, they revive the fourth Creed of the Council of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> which that Council sent to the Emperor <hi>Constans</hi> to clear themselves from all suspition of the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie; and wherein they endeavour'd to express the sense of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and make an effectual bar against <hi>Arianism,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word <hi>Homoousios.</hi> And then to their own Declaration of Faith, in which they affirm, That the Son existed out of no other Substance then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, they annex 27 <hi>Anathema's</hi> against every branch both of the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

certain that it was made after the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Council, or at least out of it, upon this account, that the Council had vouch't the word <gap reason="foreign">

The consequence of which (as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> truly observes) was, that by shutting out the word <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousios,</hi> it must be Decreed either that he was a Creature made out of nothing, or out of another Substance uncreated, and distinct from the Divine Nature. And by the profession of our ignorance of his Divine Generation, that we plainly declare, that we do not certainly know that he is the Son of God, both which consequences being so dangerous, and so

evident, it could not but encrease the Zeal not only of the Orthodox Fathers, but the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> against such an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Creed.

From all which it is more then evident, That this Creed of <hi>Valens</hi> was not drawn up in the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Council, as the Historians unanimously mistake; but after its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution by a rump Faction that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the City, and that appears plain enough without all this proof by the Preamble to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Seeing a Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Faith has been thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, all things have been diligently Examin'd and Discuss't at <hi>Sirmium</hi> in the presence of <hi>Valens, Ursacius, Germi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:42190:254"/>
and others. So that it was not the Act of the Council, but of a few Bishops that protested against it, who by it so net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Eastern Bishops that had been present at the Council, that they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately meet again in Council to condemn the Imposture and restore the true <hi>Sirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Faith. And yet for all this it is unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously agreed by all Writers both Ancient and Modern, even those who acknowledge that this Second Creed was not made till after the Council, that this was the very Creed subscribed by the great <hi>Hosius</hi> in the Council. But methinks though we had wanted this forcible exception against it, that he could subscribe no such Creed in Council because none such there was to be subscribed, yet such an enormous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy should not be so easily believed of a Man so Great, so Good, so Wise, the very Father of the Church in that Age, that had for so many years mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the great Affairs of <hi>Christendom,</hi> presided in all the great Councils Eastern and Western, should at last quit the faith, that he had so long contended for. And therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> bemoans his fall with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Annum.</hi> 357. <hi>n.</hi> 17.</note> most sorrowful Accents to the Tune of, How are the Mighty fallen; and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion had not been ill placed, had it been well grounded, for though all Men from
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:42190:255"/>
that very Age to this very day have run away with the truth of the Story as a thing unquestionable, yet if we trace it up to its very beginning, we shall find it not only destitute of any competent Authority, but grounded upon an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation apparently false and inconsistent with the most evident Records of the Church. And that is the Forgery of <hi>Valens</hi> and his Associates who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst the Decree of their Conventicle into all parts of the Christian World, as the Creed of the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Council and all that consented to it, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with <hi>Hosius</hi> his name in particular annexed to it to give the greater blow by his Authority to the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Party, of which he was the great Oracle, and this they might do with more advantage then they had spread their former Lyes, in that he had after great struggling and resistance complyed with the Council, and they had publish't this Creed as the result of it, and then it was but an easie and plausible addition to it that this was the very thing that he had complyed with. And this being blown abroad with so much confidence must for some time pass without controll, and gaining the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of some few honest Men upon the first surprize, has ever since supported it
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:42190:255"/>
self upon their Authority. This is all the Foundation that this Story has or can have, though I very much suspect it has not so much, but relyes altogether upon one mans mistake, I am sure it does upon his Authority, and that is St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> at a time when he could have no competent Information of the matter, for he was then in Banishment in a distant part of the World, and being there informed that <hi>Hosius</hi> was present at the Council, and reconcil'd with the <hi>Eusebians</hi> upon some complyance to the Council, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal inform'd of this Creed that its Contrivers had given out as the very Creed of the Council, it was natural and easie to conclude that the Subscription to this Creed was the Condition upon which <hi>Hosius</hi> was reconciled. And this mistake was so easie to a man in his Circumstances, that it was almost unavoidable, for as he was at a great distance, so he writ this upon the Information that <hi>Valens</hi> and his Party had sent themselves into the East, and therefore when this Creed was sent by them as the Creed of the Council, and when <hi>Hosius</hi> was present at it and subscribed something to the satisfaction of the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Party, it was natural to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that it was upon his Subscription to this Creed. And this is all the Authority
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:42190:256"/>
upon which the Credit of a Story so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible relyes, for all the following Writers could have no Information but from him, and as he is the only Founder of the Story, so he fell into the surmise upon crude and remote Information. And that he was very ill inform'd about the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Creed is evident from the account he gives of the Subscriptions to it, where among others he reckons up <hi>Basilius, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Fragm. Hil. p.</hi> 458.</note> and others who were so far from subscribing that Creed, that they were not present when it was framed, and as soon as they heard of it, condemned it with as much detestation as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> himself. Neither indeed could this drop from St. <hi>Hilarie</hi>'s own Pen, who very well knew and has given the most accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate account of the Proceedings of <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Silvanus</hi> and others at <hi>Ancyra</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the false Creed of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and therefore could not possibly so far forget himself as to set it down for their contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. So that this addition must have been foisted in by some peevish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful follower of <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> who was angry with the reconciliation of the divided Parties, and equally offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both with the Orthodox and with the <hi>Eusebians</hi> that had United against the <hi>Anomaeans,</hi> and I am very apt to suspect
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:42190:256"/>
that most of the reflecting passages in St. <hi>Hilary</hi> were foisted in by some such hand, and particularly the Title prefixt to this Creed, <hi>Exemplum blasphemiae apud Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium per Osium &amp; Potamium conscriptae;</hi> for there is no such Title in any other Author, it is set down b th by <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> without any mention of the name of <hi>Hosius.</hi> But however that is, it is evident from <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, that the imposture of the second <hi>Sirmian</hi> Creed was not then well understood, for he sets it down in the second Creed made by the same Council that drew up the first, whereas it was made by a Faction in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of it, and imposed upon the World under the false Title of the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Creed, which it seems was swallowed by <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> as it was by St. <hi>Hilary</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> but that it was the Creed of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> is the singular Dream of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> or his forging <hi>Luciferian,</hi> for that it was not St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s own Censure appears from a surly passage annexed to it. <hi>Sed de eo [Hosio] nihil queror: qui idcirco est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatus, ne judicio humano ignoraretur qualis antè vixisset.</hi> 
                  <q>But I shall not complain of him, seeing he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, to let the World know what a life he has lived.</q> Which implyes him to have been a wicked and scandalous Person, which St. <hi>Hilary</hi> nor no man
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:42190:257"/>
else unless a railing <hi>Luciferian</hi> could ever say of <hi>Hosius,</hi> which one dirty reflection is enough to spoil the Credit of the whole Story, in that it betrays the hand from whence it dropt, and the same is to be said of his Book against <hi>Constantius,</hi> where we find the same Calumny repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For how Learned Men came to let that Book pass among St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Works I cannot understand, when it so plainly betrays its own Forgery, first in that the Author of it excuses himself for having never appear'd before in this Controversie, whereas St. <hi>Hilary</hi> had written his 12 Books <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> his Book <hi>de Synodis,</hi> and two Apologies to <hi>Constantius.</hi> Secondly, It is pretended to have been written after the death of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and yet it speaks of things that were transacting at the time of its writing <note n="*" place="margin">At nunc pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namus contra persequutorem, fallentem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra hostem blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientem, contra Constantia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristum.</note> as done in the time of his reign. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a considerable part of it is stoln out of <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus, viz.</hi> Where he justifies his rudeness to the Emperour by the Example of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi> Fourthly, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it has filch't a passage out of St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, in which he tells the Emperour
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:42190:257"/>
that he had taken more pains against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> then against the <hi>Persians;</hi> and therefore it must have been written by some later Rhapsodist when <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Books were grown common, whereas St. <hi>Hilary</hi> does not seem to have been at all acquainted with them. Lastly <note n="*" place="margin">Mandas tibi subscriptiones, Afrorum, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia Ursacii et Valentis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnaverant, reddi: reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentibus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stremum ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripiendos mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> he charges <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> with owning and abetting with all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Creed of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Ursacius,</hi> when it is so very well known that he used all his power to oppose it. But beside all these reasons, though I am no Critick, yet I cannot but discern that Treatise to be so utterly unlike the Spirit and Genius of that Father, that if he would have set his own Wit to mock and burlesque his own way of writing, he could not have writ so unlike himself. As will appear to any one that will but compare it with the remaining fragments of his two other Apologies. For beside the scabby imitation of his Stile, the roughness of the matter was utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with his smooth and gentle way of Address, and perfectly betrays

Whereas <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Calaritanus</hi> the Father of their Sect, was so far from submitting to any terms of Reconciliation, that he would not so much as accept them to Communion upon repentance, and upon this account separated himself from the Catholick Communion, and made that ill natur'd Schism, that his petulant followers were ferced to keep up by Stories and Calumnies against the Catholicks; but as for <hi>Hosius</hi> the head of their Enemies, he must not only do wicked things, but he must be punish't for them by the immediate hand of God, and of this we have a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Story still remaining in <hi>Isidore His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palensis,</hi> that after his Apostacy and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication at <hi>Sirmium, Gregory</hi> a <hi>Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42190:259"/>
and from them <hi>Isidore</hi> pick't up the Story. But to return to the Council of <hi>Sirmium</hi> and conclude this Vindication of <hi>Hosius,</hi> as I have sufficiently taken off the Testimony of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> both from the uncertainty of the Record and the incompetency of his Information, so I think I can destroy it by the Testimony of one greater then he, and that is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi> who as he was the man most concern'd in all this business, so he understood it best, and has left the best and only accurate account of it to Posterity, and yet in the Story of the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Council all that he relates of <hi>Hosius</hi> his compliance is only this, that with long hard usage and great severity, the Emperour at last with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty brought him to this, that he should own Communion with <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Ursa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> but so as not to subscribe against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius;</hi> this is all the Story that he tells of this foul matter, though he seems to suggest in his Apology, as if he had for some time forsook him, through violence of torture, but not one Syllable of his Subscription to any Creed, much less that of <hi>Valens</hi> and his Party, which <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> might take to be the Creed of the Council, because they gave it out to be so, so that in the result of all there is so
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:42190:259"/>
little Evidence of his subscribing that Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard-Creed, that there is plainly none of his making any Subscription at all, all that is certainly known is that he was present at the Council, by force reconciled to the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> and so dismist home. But though the Testimony of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> were clear and certain, and though it were not controlled by the stronger Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> there is one plain Argument that evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates that whatever the Complyance or Subscription of <hi>Hosius</hi> was, it had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with <hi>Valens</hi> his Creed because whatever it was, he was forced to it, as all Writers agree by the Emperours threatnings and torments, whereas the Emperour was so far from ever being so zealously concern'd for this Creed at the Council, that it was framed both out of the Council and without his knowledge, and as soon as he understood any thing of it by the Bishops that were present at the Council, he condemned it with great Passion and Displeasure, and therefore setting aside all Evidences from Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, this one Argument alone is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:42190:260"/>
because the thing it self proves them so, as when <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> say that he was brought by force to subscribe the Creeds of the Council, the ground of their mistake is apparent, in that they supposed the Council to have made three Forms of Faith, when it made but one. As for <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> I regard them not either in this or any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have insisted the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon this particular Subject because it grieved me to see the reputation of so great a Man that had shined so long in the Christian Church to be thought at last to set in so much dishonour, and that so great a blemish should so easily pass upon him through all Ages meerly through mistake and carelesness. But having so fully clear'd him of the foul Calumny laid to his Charge, I may now proceed to do what Service I can of the same nature to Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> who too Poor Man! has had much harder usage upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion then he really deserved, and that from the same Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> A blind Testimony of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> and a bold Lye of <hi>Valens</hi> and his Faction, the first has
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:42190:260"/>
let fly three Anathema's for his Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to which <hi>Baronius</hi> replies, that they were none of his, but foisted into him by some later hand: It may be so, and in truth very little stress is to be laid upon those confused Fragments, but then he might have pleaded the same thing in behalf of <hi>Hosius,</hi> whereas he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great pains to condemn <hi>Hosius,</hi> and acquit <hi>Liberius</hi> by the Authority of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> which is by no means fair dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when by the same shift wherewith he eludes the Testimony of <hi>Liberius,</hi> he might if he had pleased have taken off the Evidence against <hi>Hosius,</hi> which yet he has urged with the utmost severity against him, though with what candour and justice is evident from the Premisses. And as their case was the same as to the Testimony of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> so was it as to the lyes and slanders of the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> who at the same time when they boasted of <hi>Hosius</hi> his rejecting the Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, if we may believe <hi>Sozomen,</hi> they make the very same braggs of <hi>Liberius,</hi>

                     <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> as if he too had made the same Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But though they had Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Testimonies against him, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more flying Reports, his Innocence clears it self by his own actings, for the true account of his whole compliance is
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42190:261"/>
best stated and understood from his own Epistles, where it is as express as words can make it, that he desired to be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon his Subscription to the Faith of the <hi>Sirmian</hi> Council and yielding to the Condemnation of <hi>Athanasius:</hi> And what is that to <hi>Valens</hi> his Faith forged in his own Conventicle after the conclusion of the Council? But though it be an easie matter to clear him of all suspicion of Heresie, yet we shall not be able to bring off his integrity with that clearness that we have <hi>Hosius.</hi> For if <hi>Hosius</hi> had done what was laid to his charge, it was all done by force and compulsion, whereas <hi>Liberius</hi> his compliance was a Free-will-offering; he courted the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with such perjur'd Villains in the ruine of an innocent Person, only that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self might escape scot-free from their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?

so troublesome and impertinent in all Company that the Pedant was kickt out of Town.

to encounter the great. <hi>Aphthonius,</hi> the then admir'd Man, both for Subtilty and Eloquence, and at the very first Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter disputes him to death. And when the mighty Hero had Conquer'd all the Giants of disputation, he grows so generous as to turn Quack, and kill of tree-cost. And last of all he creeps into Deacons Orders by the help of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxius,</hi> who was lately made Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> by the help of the Eunuchs, and being an ignorant and unlearned Man, had the ill-fortune to admire this Mechanick Fop, but being got into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he leaves his own Countrey to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> because it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, forsooth, that some body should be there, who was able to cope with the great <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and after a while he is falsely accused to <hi>Gallus,</hi> by <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Eustathius,</hi> two great Bishops that he had bafled in disputation, but he acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself so well, that <hi>Gallus</hi> took him for his own Chaplain, after whose death these spightful Bishops accuse him again to <hi>Constantius</hi> as privy to <hi>Gallus</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against him, and he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by the Emperor into their hands, they banish him to <hi>Pepuza</hi> in <hi>Phrygia.</hi> This Tale, as ridiculous as it is, is the fairest Story that they could raise to the

Thô the Truth of the whole matter is, that he was a meer Fanatique, for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to himself of his want of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having a mind to be thought something in the World, he pretends an immediate Revelation from God of all things that he had kept secret from the Apostles, particularly a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Son was so far from being of the same or the like Substance with the Father (as the Church had taught from the time of the Apostles) that he was unlike him in all things.

they proceed to enquire and determine of Faith, but as the Council of <hi>Arminium</hi> consisted of Catholicks and <hi>Arians,</hi> this was made up of <hi>Acacians,</hi> that followed the Blasphemy of <hi>Aetius,</hi> and the old <hi>Eusebians</hi> that approved all things in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but the word Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial, whereas the <hi>Acacians</hi> defied the Council it self and all its Decrees, and must have not only the word Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial but that of Substance too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolisht. But to prevent this the <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at the motion of <hi>Silvanus</hi> set up the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Creed for the Standard of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, and depose all that refuse subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to it, <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Party on the contrary give in a Libel in which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually condemn all unscriptural words, &amp; anathematise their own Doctrine of Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, that they might the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Adversaries, for that they knew would take with the Emperour to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the discriminating words of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But when this new Faith was read, <hi>Sophronius</hi> an <hi>Eusebian</hi> cryes out, if we must be making new Faiths every day, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time we shall have none at all But to that it is replyed by <hi>Acacius,</hi> If you laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith for yours at <hi>Antioch,</hi> why may not we lay aside yours for one more unexceptionable? and thus were they caught in their own Snare for not acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escing
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:42190:271"/>
in the first determination of the Church, and after the infinite turmoil of so many Councils they are now convinced of their own folly. But however they proceed on to wrangle so intemperately that <hi>Leonas,</hi> who was appointed by the Emperour to see things fairly managed, was so out of all patience, that he turn'd them out of doors, and bid them go trifle among themselves. So both Parties had their ends, having escaped each others Accusations, and establisht their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with the formality of a Council. This being done both post to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to tell their own Story, but the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacians</hi> coming first they so prepossess the Emperour with prejudice against his old friends as to engage him on their side a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself and his own opinion. They tell him that <hi>Basilius</hi> and the other Party were stiff and inflexible in their own deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and would yield nothing for the reconciling of Dissenting Parties, nor remove any of the Offensive Words that were the cause of all these Dissentions, not so much as that of Dissimilitude; now they knew the Design of reconciling to be the Emperour's Darling and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Dissimilitude his particular aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Upon this he in great haste and fury calls a Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> of Fifty Bishops, where these crafty men gain
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:42190:272"/>
more ground for themselves by seeming to promote his great reconciling project, in order to which they present him with a Creed wide enough to take in all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which they banish not only the word, Substance, and Consubstantial, but that of Hypostasis, and though they held a Dissimilitude in Substance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet to blind him they now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, and by leaving it undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they serve his design of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, and therefore instead of his own <hi>Sirmian</hi> Creed, That the Son was like the Father in all things, they put him off with this general and ambiguous Form, That the Son is like the Father in the sense of the Scriptures, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they believed, in Will, but not in Substance. Now this Creed was a meer contrivance to let in Aëtianism, of which of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies the Emperour had the greatest abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yet such was his dotage and infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to compass his long look't for project, that he embraces it with both his hands, and all his heart. And grows so fond of the new Darling, that when his old Friends <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Silvanus</hi> and the rest came he refused to hear them, and when <hi>Basilius</hi> thought he might freely discourse with him as he was wont to do, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him silence at his Peril as a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:42190:272"/>
of the Churches Peace. Upon this <hi>Eustathius</hi> takes the confidence to inform the Emperour that those Men were not the Men that he took them to be, but were <hi>Aëtians,</hi> and held the Blasphemy of Dissimilitude, and this he proves parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon <hi>Eudoxius</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> This turns the Tide of his Fury, and puts him into such a Storm that <hi>Eudoxius</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease it is forced to throw his Friend <hi>Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> into it, by laying the Book that <hi>Eustathius</hi> had laid to his own Charge at <hi>Aëtius</hi> his door. Upon this <hi>Aëtius</hi> is immediately sent for to Court, whither he repairs with all joy and speed, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing but the praise that the Emperour would give him for his subtle knack at disputing, and no sooner comes into to the presence but upon the first question greedily owns himself Father of the Brat, and upon it is immediately ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht into <hi>Phrygia</hi>

But the Emperour is so in love with this new <hi>Acacian</hi> Faith, and so eager in pursuit of his old <hi>Homoousian</hi> Enemy, that he at last quits the Party that he had all his life-time with so much vehemence abetted, to joyn in with these very Men that he had always and even at this very time detested.

And thus by his unskilful tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with the Church, he leaves it at last buried and lost in its own confusions, for instead of making up the breaches of the Church, by this comprehensive and indefinite Creed of the <hi>Acacians,</hi> it was every where broke into tumult and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War.

               <p>This that I have described as accurately as I could by comparing the best Records of those times, was the true state of the Christian Church under the Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those perpetual Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed by him through his whole Government, the two great Articles that I am proving, <hi>viz.</hi> the inherent right of determining Controversies within the Church it self by its own Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and its entire submission to the Civil Powers howsoever oppressed by them, were nicely and religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:42190:278"/>
by both Governments. The first evidently appears from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's summoning so many Councils to gratifie his own Will. For his only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was to amend and reform the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Creed for the reconciling of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which if he had thought that he might have done by his own Imperial Authority, to what purpose need he have broke up all the High-ways in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi> by conveying Bishops to and from Councils? He might have proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med down the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Rescript, if he had supposed that a proper Authority for it. So that when he summoned such Variety of Councils, by the Countenance of their Authority to compass his Will, that demonstrates it to be a fixt Principle with him, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of the Church ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Authority of the Church. And therefore though it was scarce ever more oppressed or abused by any Prince then himself, yet his very illegal Actions are the highest acknowledgement, that is upon record of that religious reverence that is due to that power, that was setled by our Saviour upon his Apostles and the Bishops their Successours forever. For though it so frequently crost his own design, yet he durst never directly
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:42190:278"/>
invade or usurp it, but was forced from time to time to solicite their compliance with his own wicked Will, or rather mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd judgement. And though he carried things with so rough a violence, yet he would never attempt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Liberties of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he could bear himself out by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Council.</p>
               <p>But if he so much own'd that, how comes it to pass that the Ancients charge him so highly for usurping it, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Athanasius, Hosius,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> who freely and boldly reproved him for it to his own face? And so they did, and that too upon very just grounds; for though he did not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Authority of the Church to himself, yet he endeavoured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule it by down-right force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which is in effect to destroy it.</p>
               <p>And that is the ground of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that they were not allowed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Council, but that himself and his Prefects took upon them to forestall the Judgement of the Church by Restraints and Threatnings. This is the standing complaint of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Bishops in all their Writings. It is the grievance insisted upon by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in their Synodical Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

Eusebius</hi> and his Eunuchs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Council at <hi>Rome</hi> in the cause of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> In which it does not appear that the Emperor had any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, farther then to put their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Execution. And was in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability imposed upon, as the good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Council were in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> For it was all grounded upon the Acts of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council, and had they been legal his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position had been but just, so that their validity being (as here it was) suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, no wonder that the Bishops Vote so freely against him, though for the most part neither <hi>Arians</hi> nor <hi>Eusebians.</hi> The Council at <hi>Sardica</hi> was a full and free Council, and though the <hi>Eusebians</hi> were forced to be cross and peevish in their own defence, yet all things were mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Council it self fairly and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, without any appearance of force or fraud in the Emperor, insomuch that when the banisht Bishops were restored to the Exercise of their Function by the Decree of the Council, he restored them too to the possession of their Bishopricks, by his Imperial Rescript. The first Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Milan</hi> was wholly Western, and under the Jurisdiction of the Emperour <hi>Constans,</hi> where they had all free liberty
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:42190:281"/>
both of debating and determining as they pleased. So that hitherto all Powers, Priviledges, and Jurisdictions in the Church were preserved, as far as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were concern'd, but after the death of <hi>Constans,</hi> the overthrow of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentius,</hi> and the murther of <hi>Gallus,</hi> when <hi>Constantius</hi> run mad either through guilt or insolence, we read of nothing but Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Tyranny. For in the year 355, when <hi>Gallus</hi> was murthered, he sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or rather musters a Council at <hi>Arles</hi> for the Condemnation of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> commands the Bishops to subscribe it, and banishes <hi>Paulinus</hi> of <hi>Trevers</hi> for refusing the Subscription. In the same year meets the second Council at <hi>Milan,</hi> and that for the same purpose, in which <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Verselles, Liberius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and at last <hi>Hosius</hi> of <hi>Corduba</hi> are sent on the same Errand after <hi>Paulinus</hi> for the same Offence. In the year 357 follows the Council of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> where, as we have seen, all things were carried by Force. Then comes the Council of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi> in the year 359, where a Council of near 400 Bishops are compelled to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and submit to the pleasure of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> and his fifty Men. The Council of <hi>Seleucia</hi> came to the worst end of all, being only a contest between the <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:42190:281"/>
and <hi>Acacians,</hi> who finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over-numbred, appeal to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and are received by him, draw up a new Creed, in which they not only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiere the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but (as they phrased them) all other Exotick words. And this indefinite Faith is imposed upon all Christian Bishops by an Imperial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script upon pain of banishment; by which the <hi>Acacians</hi> outed the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> and so got themselves into the best and fattest Preferments. In the year 360 comes the last Conventicle of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in which <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> was deposed for asserting the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and that against the Publick Faith of the Emperour, given him under Hand and Seal for his Security. These were wild actings in the Church, but they all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Magnentian</hi> and <hi>Gallian</hi> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that is the excuse that is made for him by <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, that after <note place="margin">Ep. ad So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit.</note> that he was not himself, but was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern'd by other Men, that (as he expresses it) had no more brains in their Skuls then in their Toes. But before this time of outrage and distraction he kept up that reverence and regard that is due to that Authority, that our Blessed Saviour has committed to his Church. Nay even after this loosing himself and
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:42190:282"/>
his understanding by getting the whole World, he kept up that respect to our Saviour's Institution, as at least to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant all his irregular Proceedings by a shew of its Authority. For though he endeavour'd to carry all things by force and violence, yet he never attempted any thing without a pretended Council. This was the Interval of time, in which the Ancients complain of his invading the Power of the Church, and as it were by these wild Practices, thrusting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Evangelical Priest-hood. Thus was it in the year 355, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the mad Council at <hi>Milan,</hi> when the Dialogue between the Emperour and <hi>Liberius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> pass't, in which <hi>Liberius</hi> insists upon that one Proposal, that the Emperour would be pleased to call a free Council, and not over-aw it by his own Sovereign Power. <q>Let <note place="margin">

In the same year, and upon the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:42190:282"/>
it was that the wise <hi>Hosius</hi> gave him that famous advice. <hi>Tibi Deus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium commisit, nobis quae sunt Ecclesiae concredidit. Et quemadmodum qui tuum Imperium malignis oculis carpit, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ordinationi divinae: Ita &amp; tu cave, ne quae sunt Ecclesiae ad te trahens, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no crimini obnoxius fias; neque enim fas est nobis in terris Imperium tenere, neque tu thymiatum &amp; sacrorum potestatem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, Imperator.</hi> 
                  <q>God has committed the Empire to you, the Church to us, and as he would rebel against God, that should malign your Authority, so take heed left by drawing the Affairs of the Church to your self, you prove guilty of the same Rebellion: for as it is a sin in us to challenge any temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; so know, O Emperor, that you have not the power of the holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q> This was plain dealing, and but necessary at that time, when he had made so foul an inrode upon the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Liberties of the Church, and overborn all its Divine Authority by Military force and sury. So that his meaning was not, as the <hi>Romanists</hi> would have it, to cut off the Emperor from all interposing in Church Affairs, because he that had been so much employed in them under <hi>Constantine,</hi> could not think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:42190:283"/>
in it self. But though that be no fault but a duty, yet to use his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with meer force and violence, to destroy the Judgment of the Governors of the Church by compulsion in matters of Faith, and to take upon himself the determination of them, as he had in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect done, and that in contradiction to the Authority of a General Council, was such a bold contempt of our Saviour's Institution, and such an Invasion of the rights of his Kingdom, that the good Bishop could do no less then threaten it with the Terrors of the last day. About the same time St. <hi>Hilary</hi> address't his Apology in behalf of the Catholicks to the Emperor, where among divers other abuses, that he Petitions to be redress't, this is none of the least. <hi>Provideat &amp; decernat Clementia vestra, ut omnes ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Judices, quibus Provinciarum admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strationes creditae sunt, ad quos sola cura &amp; solicitudo publicorum negotiorum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere debet, à religiosa se observantia ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stineant: neque posthac praesumant, atque usurpent, &amp; putent se causas cognoscere Clericorum &amp; innocentes homines variis afflictationibus, minis, violentià, terrori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus frangere atque vexare.</hi> That was the deplorable State of the Church at that time, that the Emperor's Prefects
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:42190:283"/>
and Officers took upon them a Power of Summoning the Orthodox Clergy to their Tribunals to give an account of their Faith, and to banish them if they refused compliance with the Emperor's Will, and not only so, but to take the Accusations of their Enemies against them, and right or wrong, and without any regard to Justice, or understanding the merit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This just complaint of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press't Catholiques so wrought with the Emperor, that notwithstanding his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage against them, because his Affairs in <hi>France</hi> were then embroil'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of the Barbarous Nations, he publishes that seemingly kind Rescript in Answer to their Request. <hi>Mansuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis nostrae lege prohibemus in Judiciis</hi>

with it in the whole Code, for though there are divers Laws of other Emperors, that refer all Controversies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion to the Episcopal Audience, yet as for the Criminal causes of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons, I do not remember any beside this that wholly exempted them from the cognisance of their own Courts. And therefore that this Emperor should grant such an Universal exemption seems a courtesie more then ordinary, and is thought to have been meerly extorted by the importunity of the Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and the present difficulty of his own Affairs. And that they then insisted upon the exemption of Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as well as Causes, it was for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son peculiar to the State of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie at that time, that was then mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not so much by Arguments as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, though that weapon was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed against the great <hi>Athanasius,</hi> into whose single Person the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was at last contracted, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were distinguisht by nothing but subscribing and refusing his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he being the great Pillar of the Catholick Cause, the <hi>Eusebians</hi> knew well enough that if they could but blow him up, the cause must fall with him, and for that reason is it that they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:42190:284"/>
labour'd so hard to overwhelm him with Criminal Accusations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Catholicks perceiving their fraud, interposed as vehemently in defence of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> as of their Faith because all the blows that were levell'd at him were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to aim at that, insomuch that to subscribe his Condemnation was the same thing as to quit the Party, as we have seen in the case of Pope <hi>Liberius.</hi> And for this reason chiefly it was necessary at that time, that the Emperor if he would refer the Ecclesiastical Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie then on foot to the Bishops, he should do the same as to the Criminal Causes of the Clergy, because they were then uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally join'd together. And yet as kind as this Law might appear to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them from the oppressions of the Imperial Courts, it was but a fraudulent favour, and only design'd to ensnare the Catholicks. For this gracious Rescript was publisht in the same year, in which he call'd the violent Council at <hi>Milan,</hi> that was on purpose packt out of the fiercest <hi>Eusebians,</hi> to carry things thorough with an high hand, and without any contradiction. So that when in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script he refer'd the Orthodox Bishops to an Ecclesiastical Judgment, he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but their Oppression in this
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:42190:285"/>
mad Council; and that it is evident, was so far from any kindness, that it was the sharpest severity he could have contrived against them: For if they had just ground of complaint against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just actings of the Secular Courts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not their proper Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet when they were so rudely outraged in Council, as it was done in the proper Court, so was it at their own request; and that both took away all ground of complaint, and left them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any means of relief. <hi>Gothofred</hi> has a Conjecture, that this Rescript was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted not before but after the Council, and that in favour of the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> who were overcome by the Orthodox at their own weapon of Accusation; and yet by the partiality of the Council were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, whilst the Catholicks were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and denyed the very formalities of Justice; this, says the Learned Man, might provoke them to make their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Secular Courts, where they might at least hope to meet with some humanity and regard to the Laws: And therefore the Emperor to spoil this shift, brings them all back to the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judicature, that if they would come thither, there they might be heard, but no where else. But this contradicts the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:42190:285"/>
whole state of Affairs at that time, when the partiality and oppression of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judges was the universal Groan of the Catholicks, and when this Rescript was enacted upon or at least after their reiterated complaints against it, and therefore there is no ground to imagine that the Catholicks, how much soever oppressed in Council, would think of seeking relief there. But whatever was the intent of the Rescript (and no doubt it was malicious enough) it is certain that it was at least pretended to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the complaint of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks against the Secular Courts for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to themselves the Judgment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Faith, whereas they ought to have referred them to the Synods of Bishops, whom our Saviour had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the proper Guides and Judges in those matters. And that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Hosius</hi> and the rest in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the Emperor, not that he used his Authority in the Church, but that he abused it by opposing it to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a general Council, by whose advice he ought both as a wise Man and a good Christian, to have been directed in the use of his Power in such matters. And that was the grand miscarriage of his Reign, that he would not sit down

But however it is evident from all the Premisses, that how enormously soever he abused his own Power in the Church, he never attempted to Usurp the Churches Power, and he never took upon him to make any Alterations in the Faith, till they were first made and decreed in Council; and though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Use and Authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils by denying freedom of Vote, yet that was an abuse of his Power, not an usurpation of theirs. For that he ever own'd with a Religious regard in his most unwarrantable Oppressions. And as I have observed at the beginning he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greater respect to the Power of the Church then any Emperor in the whole Succession, when he called such sholes of Councils, only to have his Will of one Man, and one Word, which he durst not controul himself, because they had been own'd and justified by the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And if we carefully observe his motions, we shall find him a cordial friend both to the Church and to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:42190:286"/>
and the end of all his mistaken Zeal was the lasting settlement of Peace and Concord, that was the word that he had always in his mouth; all the misfortune was, that he fell into ill hands, and by their advice endeavour'd it the wrong way. His high Opinion of the honesty of some ill Church-Men, was the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that exposed him to all that abuse that was put upon him all his life time. It was his confidence in <hi>Eusebius</hi> and his Partisans that did drive him into that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy course that he took for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his desired Peace. All their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was Oracle to him, and made him both deaf and blind to all other informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But otherwise setting aside this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy oversight of being over-rul'd by ill Men, he seems to have been so far from all thoughts of robbing the Church of its own inherent rights, that he thought he could never shew it kindness enough, by heaping continual favours of his own upon it, he granted it more Priviledges and greater Immunities then any other Emperor; and whereas his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Constantine</hi> only exempted Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks from all Personal burthens in the Common-wealth, he has in divers Rescripts freed them from all manner of Taxes and Impositions whatsoever; and

And this is the ground of those high Commendations that are given him by <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> because he was of himself a true lover of Religion, and designed nothing but the Peace and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Church, though under that plausible pretence his good nature and integrity were imposed upon by wicked Men, to compass their own wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against the true peace of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. And that was the folly and misfortune that they drew him into, not to acquiesce in the Authoritative deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Church, in so great a Council as that of <hi>Nice,</hi> which had he done, it had continued in the same Peace, and Tranquility, in which his Father left it. But when instead of that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove the setled Foundation,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:42190:288"/>
as it was laid by the true and proper Builders; it is no wonder if the whole Fabrick fell upon his own head, and buried his whole Reign under its Ruins. And it is very likely that his impatience under so awkerd a Burthen, when he could not clear himself of it, put him at last upon those angry courses, that he took to obtain his Will. And as at last it perplext, so it debaucht his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for till the Conquest of <hi>Magnentius</hi> he seem'd to have behaved himself like a wise and able Prince, but had not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to attempt, much less perform any thing great, by reason of his perpetual attendance upon this Controversie. And that may be a warning to all Princes, That when a Controversie of Religion is once laid by a fair and legal decision, to beware how they suffer it to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, lest it prove too strong and stubborn to submit to a second Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.</p>
               <p>However by the different behaviour of these two Princes in interposing in the Controversies of the Church, and the different event of their actings in it, we have before our Eyes clear examples of right and wrong methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Constantine</hi> when he found a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Church, settles peace by the
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:42190:288"/>
Authority of the Church, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any restraints upon it; and what that determin'd he first made a Law to himself, and then to his Subjects, and would never after permit it to be call'd in question; and by this means he quell'd a dangerous Faction, and freed himself from any direct disturbance from it all his own Reign. But his Son <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> on the contrary not acquiescing in the Canonical determination of the Church, broke down all the Banks of Government, and let in that Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dispute that overwhelm'd his whole Reign But being sensible of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he had brought upon himself by having once dismantled the Churches Authority, he thought to help himself out by retrieving its force, but still the more he strugled the more he entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himself, because instead of setling things by fair and free Councils (and unless they are so, they are no Councils of Christs Officers, but meer Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Princes Commands) himself ever endeavour'd to over-rule all the Councils that he call'd, either by fraud or violence. And then no wonder when they were so hamper'd, if they were not able to attain the end of their Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that was the fatal miscarriage
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:42190:289"/>
of his Reign, his garbling the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Councils, turning them into Courts of Guards, and abetting forty or fifty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Men against the whole Body of Catholick Bishops, otherwise if they had been permitted the free exercise of their own proper Authority, all things had been carried with that gravity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency that became the Christian Church, as we see by the great Councils of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica</hi> and <hi>Ariminum,</hi> that had effectually setled the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, had not the Emperor cut asunder their Decrees with his Sword, and set up an <hi>Eusebian</hi> Rump in defiance and opposition to the whole Council. And therefore whereas some Men are pleased to upbraid the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority with the miscarriages of these Councils under <hi>Constantius,</hi> they might have been pleased too to consider, that the main Body of Christian Bishops discharged their duty with entire faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and integrity, and that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Emperor and his Court-parasites that were guilty of all the Exorbitancies committed in the Church in his time, which he committed so altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Churches consent, that by them he oppressed it with all the outrage and violence of Persecution. But from this clamour raised against the Authority of
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:42190:289"/>
the Church upon this account, and kept up at this very day with so much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (for we find it among the dole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Secondly, as the Emperour in all his exorbitant actings own'd and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the power of the Church, so the Catholicks submitted to all their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under him with the same patience and upon the same Principle that they did to the Heathen Emperours.

And yet notwithstanding all the wildness of his fury, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged by the Fundamental Laws
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:42190:292"/>
of their Religion to pay him the same duty of Loyalty and Allegiance, that they payed to the Christian Emperours. But the History of his Reign has of late been made the Subject even of popular discourse, and that will in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prevent me in this part of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, the Trifle of <hi>Julian</hi> having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sufficient Correction, and much more then it deserved, and I doubt the Jest is now spoil'd, and the jolly Doctrine prevented from being popular, by its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Application. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I shall proceed in my old Method to shew, first how the Church took care to Govern and preserve it self by its own Authority against all the Apostates Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and by the right and effectual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it, was too hard for all his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks against it. And Secondly what a tender and a religious sense of Duty and Loyalty they profest and practised to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in spight of his unparallel'd Provocations. Of which I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour so to discourse, as not to repete or interfere with other Mens Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>As for the first, it is highly observable that when the Apostate came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he was all on fire for the destruction of Christianity out of it, for though he
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:42190:293"/>
had suppress't his Apostacy all the time of <hi>Constantius,</hi> yet his zeal was perpetually boiling in his Breast, and impatient to burst into open Liberty. And therefore the very first moment of Opportunity, that it had to discover it self, it broke forth (as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it) like fire from its confinement. He immediately commands all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Temples to be opened, and the Sacrifices to be brought to the Altars, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemny renounces his Christianity, and purges away his Baptism with the Blood of Sacrifices, is immediately install'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the old and abrogated dignity of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex Maximus,</hi> and officiates at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Rites in his own Person. So that tho the former Emperours took it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves only as a Title of Honour, he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously takes the Office too, and acts all the Phantastick Postures and Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Heathen Priests. And the fury of his zeal swell'd so high, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less would serve his turn then to be created a Priest of the <hi>Eleusinian</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, because those were esteemed the most sacred and recondite part of their Religion. And then he goes on every where to re-edifie and adorn the Heathen Temples, and to place Heathen Priests in them. And having thus in the first
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:42190:293"/>
place taken all speedy care for the re-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of his own Religion, his next thought is how to contrive the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> as he always stil'd the Christians in contempt and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The best and most obvious Policy that he could pitch upon for that, was to bring confusion into the Church. For which purpose he grants Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to all Factions, calls back all the banish't Bishops, particularly <hi>Athanasius, Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Verselles,</hi> and St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores all the Hereticks, particularly <hi>Aetius,</hi> whom he invites to Court, and returns all their Churches to the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and what mighty endearments there were between the Apostate and the Donatists, we have seen above in their History. Now from an uncontroll'd li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness granted to such a vast varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of quarrelsome People, he doubted not to make the Church contemptible to all the World by turning it into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-scuffle. For he look't upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as the most contentious Sect in it, usually saying. <note n="*" place="margin">

And yet alass so far was he from attaining his ends, that his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was utterly defeated by the wisdom of the good Bishops; for they being now freed from that violence and oppression, that was put upon the Discipline of the Church, by <hi>Constantius</hi> with his Prefects and Eunuchs; and so being at liberty to exert that power, that was settled upon them by our blessed Saviour, they effectually restored that Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to the Church, which they could never compass under the oppressive Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> put an end to the vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie, establish't the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith over all the Christian World, and prevented new Schisms and Factions, that were at that time breaking out in the Christian Church.</p>

After this <hi>Athanasius</hi> returns to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he is no sooner come then he calls a Council for resettling the State of the Catholick Church, that had been interrupted by <hi>Constantius</hi> his fierce and long Oppression of it.

               <p>And now here the first question is, as in all other Persecutions, concerning the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> or those Bishops that had joyn'd with the <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Eusebians</hi> in any of <hi>Constantius</hi> his Councils, whether upon their return to the Catholick Church, they should be received in their Episcopal Capacity, or only according to rigour of Canon, be admitted to Lay-Communion.

And in this they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shewed Justice then Mercy, for in all those Transactions, as we have seen above, there appear'd nothing of Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism above board, and at the same time that they quitted <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> for Peace sake, they anathematised all the Points of the Arian Heresie. So that their complyance, though it was a defect
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:42190:295"/>
in prudence, it was no Apostacy from the Orthodox Faith. And if the leading <hi>Eusebians</hi> had a design by removing that word to supplant and undermine the true Faith, as 'tis plain by the last issue of all that some of them had, <hi>i. e. Valens</hi> and his Party, yet that was kept secret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, and honest well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men had no ground to suspect it, because it was always protested against. And it is certain that the greatest part of them had no such design, for <hi>Basilius</hi> and all his Party, who so fiercely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Acacians,</hi> when they turn'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> had been all along vehement <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians</hi> and Enemies to Consubstantiality. And therefore it is evident that their zeal against that was not at all for any love of <hi>Arianism,</hi> but only of the Peace of the Church, which they conceived to be obstructed by that unscriptural and unwarrantable Word. And therefore it was no such kindness to receive such Persons, as had innocently join'd with them, upon such easie terms, when by it they were not in the least tainted with the Heresie it self, and so St. <hi>Jerom</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self states it. <hi>Post reditum Confessorum</hi>

                  <q>After the Return of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors from banishment, it was decreed in a Synod at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> That excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Authors of the Heresie, that no surprise can excuse, the Repenting Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops should be received, not that they could be Bishops, that had been Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but because it was evident that they that were received had not been Hereticks.</q> And as for their depriving the Authors and Ring-leaders of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie forever, so as never to be raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Lay-Communion, that was no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, but agreeable to the standing discipline of the Church. And in the next place whereas there had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly started an unhappy Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Greeks and Latins, concerning the Words <hi>Hypostasis</hi> and <hi>Persona,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the word <hi>Hypostasis</hi> being Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous with <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, when the Greeks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess't the belief of three Hypostases, they seem'd to the Latins to own three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Substances: And the Latins, who rejected that word, and in lieu of it used the word <hi>Persona,</hi> seem'd not to assert any thing real, but a meer relative di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,

the word <hi>Persona</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally used to denote not the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but his Office and Relation. This contest run very high, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, to the endangering a breach between the Churches, and therefore St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> prudently proposes that both words should be promiscuously u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in both Churches, and that would effectually take away the Jealousie on both sides, and so it did, for it silenced the controversie forever, and it continues so settled to this very day. And lastly, whereas some Men cryed up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith presented by the <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Party to the Council at <hi>Sardica,</hi> as if the Council had approved of it, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it was utterly rejected by the Council, and that it refused to alter any thing of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith. These De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, with some other, they draw up in an Encyclical Epistle to the Bishops of the Christian World. And after the same manner that <hi>Athanasius</hi> bestir'd himself for the settlement of the Church in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary</hi> labours for the Restitution of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures frequent Councils, particularly one at <hi>Paris,</hi> to condemn the proceedings at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and restore the Church to that Ancient State, that it enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>But the Apostate finding the Peace of the Christian Church so well setled, he grows into a rage to see both his wit and his malice so dexterously defeated, and now can dissemble no longer, pulls off his Vizor of pretended Kindness, and turns open Persecutor. And in the first place he flies upon <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who had with wonderful success advanced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death he must immediately leave the City.

And here he brings off his former seeming Lenity to the <hi>Galilaean</hi> or Christian Bishops, that he had restored from Banishment, with this slender sham, that he only gave them leave to return to their own Countries, but never intended to restore them to the Jurisdiction of their Churches. And therefore <hi>Athanasius,</hi> having presum'd to usurp his Episcopal Seat without the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Grant, must once more be gone.
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:42190:298"/>
And accordingly he withdraws, with this comfort to his friends, that were weeping at his departure, that it was but a flying shower, and would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if he had not made hast, it had not only wet him to the skin, but overwhelm'd him forever, for now the Apostate becomes Treacherous and Cruel, and privately sends his Assassinates to cut his Throat. Of this <hi>Athanasius</hi> being inform'd, he immediately takes Boat for <hi>Thebais,</hi> but being close pursued by the Murtherers, instead of Landing and Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring himself in the Woods, as his friends advised him, he according to his usual readiness of Wit, commands the Boat-man to row back to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the other Boat that pursued him, the Captain of the Cut-throats calls to them, to know whether they met <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi> and how far off they might suppose him to be? <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself answers, That he knew him very well, and that he was hard by, bids them row hard, and then there could be no doubt but that they must overtake him, and so for that time he escapes to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and there lyes hid till the Storm was over.

               <p>But first, if it were true, it is a very poor and impertinent Precedent to Warrant the new Christian-duty of our modern Apostates (for all Rebel-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians renounce Christianity with much more dishonour to it, then <hi>Julian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ever did) of Resistance and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Sovereign Princes. For what if the Christians at that time had been real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of any miscarriages in that kind, what objection is that one miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage against the constant Doctrine and Tradition of the Christian Church in all Ages? This is to be taken from its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice and sense, and not from the irregularities of a few private Persons, for it is too hard to expect that all Men should live up to their Principles, and that every one that profess't himself a Christian, should be free from all misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours against his own Profession. That is too great a persection to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this life. There is no Church but that in Heaven without some miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and faulty Members, and therefore it is but a mean and childish underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that argues great malice, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:42190:300"/>
wit, though it were true, to find out in all the Records of the Church one or two instances of old, in which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did not behave themselves with that decency, as they ought and profess't to owe to their Governors. For what if it be true? What does that prove, but that they were so much Men, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have fall'n short both of their Duty and Profession? What is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the general and declared Sense of the Church? Upon the same terms the Primitive Christians may be loaded with all the Crimes in the World, because some that professed Christianity, some time or other fell into all but this. What then, if it were true that the behaviour of some Christians towards the Apostate, was not such as became their duty towards their Sovereign, what is that to the Sense of the Catholick Church in all Ages before, and for many after, to the year 1073? Can it reasonably be expected that in so long a Tract of time there should not be one instance of the miscarriage of Christians in this kind? and yet this at the best is the case of this wonderful Precedent, to overthrow the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine of Passive Obedience. But Seditious Persons are fond of any Pretence, and will rather forfeit their
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:42190:301"/>
Understanding, then not gratifie their ill-nature, how else could any Man be so transported out of his common Sense from one miscarriage to warrant our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, against the constant sense of the Church for so many Ages? And yet with what joy and greediness has this poor trifle been embraced, as a new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery dropt from Heaven; and how confident are we that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, were no such softly fools (as they have been hitherto represented) as to preach and practise that Sheepish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Passive Obedience? Which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews how ready some Parties of Men among us are for seizing any pretences for Resistance and Rebellion. Otherwise certainly if Men would Judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and without Faction, of this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work, the whole Mystery of it is no more then this, that an Industrious Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher into the Records of the Church has at last found out one instance, in which some Christians failed of their Duty to their Prince. A great performance this! wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the applause and admiration of this learned Age; and therefore to deal ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy with it, I care not though I grant the truth of the Assertion, but then I must crave leave to let them know, that this is the only instance of this kind that
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:42190:301"/>
hap'ned in Eleven hundred years. For that is the thing that I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to maintain, That from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christianity down to the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, who was the 159th Pope, and succeeded not till the year 1073, no one Christian of the Western Church, no not a Pope, or taught or put in practice the Doctrine of Resistance to Sovereign Princes, or disown'd the duty of Passive Obedience, under the worst of Persecutors, and after this much good may this little Story of <hi>Julian</hi> do them. For they cannot but see what a mean and foolish design it is to set up one single Tale as a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f of the Sense of the Primitive Christians, when it stands all alone, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the declared Sense of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church for so many Ages. So that they gain so little advantage to their Cause by this admired Performance, that it proves the most unlucky Argument, that could have been contrived against it. For this is a demonstration to all the World, that there is in all the Records of the Church but one Precedent of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian disrespect or disobedience to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Princes. And that is but a single exception to its universal practice, and if it be, it confesses its own Enormity from
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:42190:302"/>
it. So that methinks Men that design'd to preach up Resistance and Rebellion from the Precedents of the Primitive Christians, should rather have taken any other method to abuse the People, then by telling them this single Story of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian:</hi> For hereby they are brought to understand that they have no more then one Tale for their Cause, and that if it were true, it is controuled by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal practice of all Churches in all Ages, and that I think is as much as any reasonable Man can desire to shame and bafle the Assertion.</p>
               <p>Especially when it is so evident, that Christians before this time were become in a great measure like other Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when Christianity became the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Empire, and the darling of Princes, all Men would equally embrace it for present Advantage and Preferment. And in these circumstances bad Men will be sure to appear as forward in their Zeal as the best Christians, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to outstrip them in outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. So that if at that time there had been any Christians found guilty of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty towards their Prince, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, when such Numbers came into the Church, not for any love of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but for other ends and designs of
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:42190:302"/>
their own? And such Men were as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually loose from all the Obligations of Christianity, as if they had never own'd it. And therefore the true Sense of Christians ought not to be taken from their practice, after it had been the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Religion, for then it was made a Trade, but from their Professions in such times, when they had no other Motive to embrace it but it self, for then it is certain that all that did so, were in good earnest. It being then so evident that the Christians through all Ages down to <hi>Constantine</hi> profess't and practiced the duty of Non-resistance, or Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all Princes, without reserves and exceptions, as an indispensible Law of their Religion, that is a clear, full, and unanswerable declaration of the Sense of the Primitive Church in this matter, however any might fall into a contrary behaviour in times of ease and prosperity. For then it is impossible but that there would be many in the Church, that were not of it, as we have shewn above from the complaint of <hi>Eusebius</hi> and others, how the Credulity of <hi>Constantine</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by pretended Converts, to the great dishonour of his Government, and Oppression of his People. And yet I think no Man could think it reasonable
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:42190:303"/>
to upbraid Christianity with their Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and if <hi>Julian</hi> found multitudes of such Men in the Church, when he came to the Empire, what wonder would it be if Men that were in reality no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, made any unchristian Attempts against him? So that granting our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states the truth of their Plea, from the behaviour of Christians towards <hi>Julian,</hi> this one thing utterly barrs their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that this was the avowed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Christians at that time, when at the time that he came to the Empire, there were as many in the Church, that were not, as that were Christians. But because it is to be supposed that the Counterfeits fell off with the Apostate; I will allow the Plea, that if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians who persevered in the Faith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any of those disloyal and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pranks, that the Apostates charge upon them, that then the blame shall lye at the Church door. And yet so as not to make a Precedent for imitation, because it is a single Enormity both from the plain Laws of the Religion, and the universal Practice of all its Professors, and after that it is a very impertinent way of arguing to draw any Conclusion from such an Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="585" facs="tcp:42190:303"/>
And yet secondly as impertinent as it is, it is much more false, for there is not any one instance of any one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in all his Reign, that ever made any resistance to any one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And then whatever they did beside to affront him, that is nothing to warrant the practice of Resistance, and shews, that in whatsoever hatred and contempt they held his Person, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound in duty to an entire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his Government. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of their ill manners, and uncourtly behaviour towards him, I shall discourse by it self, because that concerns not the Argument of Resistance, and shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent only shew that they were so far from putting any such design in practice, that they all expresly disclaimed and defied it, as utterly inconsistent with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Religion; and then I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what our new Apostates can gain by minding us of the <hi>Julian</hi> Christians. And if their case was particular, in that they had the Laws on their side (as 'tis falsely and ignorantly pretended) and yet for all that taught the same Doctrine of Submission and Passive Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and that upon the same unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Principle, as they did under all
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:42190:304"/>
their former Persecutions, that will be the greatest demonstration of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of their Doctrine, and set it above all manner of exception upon any pretence whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The Apostates first fury was vented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the military Men, Men that from the very nature of their Profession are most apt to resent and revenge Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and though he provoked them more by the Contempt and Indignity of his Persecution, then by its Severity, yet they would rather swallow and digest an Affront, the hardest Point in the World to a Soldier, then repulse it with the least rudeness, much less violence to their Sovereign Lord. And first he caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Images of the Heathen Deities to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that was another peculiar En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancement of his Persecution, never to punish the Christians as Christians, but
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:42190:304"/>
as Criminals, and to the old Cruelties of Persecution to add this new one of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, first martyr their Innocence, and then themselves. And though by this little device he deceived some into shews of respect to his Deities, yet the wiser easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing through so slight a design, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give any Signs of Honor, and so by their Example soon put an end to the little Stratagem; and yet neither they that were cheated into the Folly, nor they that were fraudulently punisht for withstanding it, made any other resistance to his Commands, or shewed any other disrespect to his Person. His next Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem was somewhat more fine then this: It was an old Custom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the Emperors on their own Birth-days, or other Holy days, to give Donatives to their Soldiers, and this <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> does, but so orders it, that near his Throne where he sat, was placed a Fire with Incense, some of which the simple Soldiers were told, as they came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Donative, by some that were set there for that purpose, they were bound by ancient Custom to sprinkle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fire. And so, great numbers were ignorantly drawn in to offer his kind of Sacrifice, but coming afterward to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Cheat, they run up and
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:42190:305"/>
down the Streets and Market-places cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, That they are Christians and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were so, that they were over-reacht and meerly drawn in it, and they had sacrificed with their Hands, they had not with their Hearts, and so they address to the Emperor in a Body, and request him to take his Gold again, and if he pleased, to put them to death, for they were resolved never to renounce their Religion, but were ready to lay down their Lives for it. To this Relation <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> adds, That the Emperor immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately commanded them to be beheaded, and they were conveyed out of the City to the place of Execution, whither they went with extraordinary courage and cheerfulness, requesting the Heads-man to dispatch the youngest first, lest by beholding the bloody Execution of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his courage might faint, and so one <hi>Romanus</hi> is first prepared, and his head laid upon the Block, but just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blow was to be given, a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger from the Emperor cries out at a great distance to stop it; at which the young man sighing says, <hi>Romanus</hi> was not thought worthy to be a Martyr of Christ. I conceive this is as high an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Passive Obedience, as any we have upon Record in all the former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:42190:305"/>
and indeed exceeds that of the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion, for they were only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimated at first, and so the greatest part were sure to escape, but here the whole Body submit themselves one and all to the Ax of the Executioner, without spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an angry or a reproachful word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperor. And for this very act of Christian Loyalty they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly commended by St. <hi>Austin.</hi> And yet these very Men (one would scarce believe it) are produced as one of the most remarkable instances of the ill-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the Christians towards <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>

disgraceful punishment (says <hi>Palladius)</hi> he endured with all patience and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thanks to the Emperor for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as he had it from his own mouth. But whatever his Persecution was against their Persons, it was much more then all others against their Religion, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side those perpetual shams that he put upon it to make it ridiculous; he dugg at the Foundations by rooting up the Clergy, that so the People having no Publick Assemblies for Divine Worship, they might in time grow barbarous and lose their Religion. And his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against them was their raising Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. And thus he banisht <hi>Seleusius</hi> and his Clergy from <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> because the Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans were so numerous in the City, that it was in vain to attempt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them any other way. And so he commanded the Magistrates of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra</hi> to expel <hi>Titus</hi> their Bishop, and threatned, that if the People made any Sedition, he would lay the blame and the punishment of it upon the Bishop and his Clergy; upon this <hi>Titus</hi> presents him an humble Address, shewing that though the Christians were an overmatch for the Heathens, yet he need not fear any Tumult from them, because he knew that they would follow his Exhortations
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:42190:307"/>
to Peace and Patience. Upon this the Apostate spitefully and childishly writes to the People to instigate them against their Bishop for slandering their Loyalty, as if they were not peaceable of their own accord, but were only wheedled into it by his Wit and Eloquence. To such mean and dirty Arts did his malice stoop by any ways to do mischief: but yet instead of provoking them to any disturbance by all his abuses, we find nothing else preached even at this time then the old superannuated and unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Doctrine of Passive Obedience. The Apostate's last pranks against the Christians were plaid at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the great Scene of his shame and folly. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his first coming <hi>Artemius</hi> an old Commander under <hi>Constantine,</hi> and who for his good Services had obtain'd a good <note place="margin">

<pb n="594" facs="tcp:42190:308"/>
are by the Emperor cast into Prison up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sham of Treason, where divers attempts are made upon them to betray their Religion, but all in vain, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant answer is, That they are always ready to lay down their Lives but never their Religion, and so at length they are privately beheaded. This is all the harm that we know of them, and yet they are exhibited to the World among that Pack of <hi>Julian</hi> Christians, that pursued their Prince, as if he were a midnight Thief, or an High-way-Robber. The next Set of bloody Conspirators against the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state's life, were <hi>Abbass Publia</hi> and her Quire of Virgins, that persisted to sing Anthems against Idolatry, at such times as his Majesty passed by their Chappel, at which he was at last so enraged, that he very honourably commanded one of his Souldiers to beat the old Woman that was Mistress of the Quire, so that he made her nose bleed. Which contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Usage (says the Historian) she received as the highest honour, as the Apostles did, when they were beaten too, that they were accounted worthy to suffer shame for Christ. And therefore the old Woman and her Maids were so far from pursuing him as a Thief and a Robber, that they did not so much as
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:42190:308"/>
return him any warm Language. These are all the instances of Rebellion against the Apostate that I know of, unless we may add that very credible Romance of an old decrepit Bishop, threatning to kick the Emperor in the head of his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Bands, at which the great Soldier that had fought so many Battels, was so scared, that he was forced to betake himself to his Heels. These are all those numberless Instances, in the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety whereof a man may almost lose himself, which may be given of the Christians hatred and contempt of <hi>Julian</hi> when he was Emperor. How they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Religion to his very beard; beat his Priests before his face, and had done him too, if he had not got out of the way. But whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of all the other Outrages, there is no other instance of the danger of his own being beaten, but by this old man that had lost the use of his Limbs, who yet it seems would have kick't him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Guards, had he not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Any Passive Obedience, how snea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king soever, would have been much more Manly and Heroick, then to kick one that was so great a Coward, that in the head of his Troops, had not courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to stand the brunt against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:42190:309"/>
fury of Fourscore and Ten.</p>
               <p>But what shall we say to the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That if the old Bishops did not beat him, yet the young Divines jear'd him, gave him Nick-names, and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon'd him to his beard? This I must confess is a great fault to offer any indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the Person of a Sovereign Prince, and reflects scorn and contempt upon his Government: But yet I hope there is some distance between breaking an indiscreet jest, and breaking out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebellion. For that is our design to prove, that in the days of <hi>Julian,</hi> the Doctrine and Duty of Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was out of doors, and that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who would have quietly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Laws under a <hi>Nero</hi> or a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian,</hi> pursued <hi>Julian</hi> as a midnight Thief, or an High-way Robber. That is, plainly, that they thought it Lawful to resist and pursue him by force, and that I think is Rebellion; though indeed ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was no need of such broad Expressions, as of hunting a Thief or a Robber; for if the obligation to Passive Obedience be once taken off, active Resistance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately takes place, and that again is actual Rebellion. Now what a strange leap in arguing is this, from a jest upon a Princes Beard, to raise an Army to cut
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:42190:309"/>
his Throat? For that is the inference here, to prove that the Christians in his time thought it Lawful to resist and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against his Government, because they Lampoon'd his Whiskers. But certainly men must have a very sharp stomach to Rebellion, that can encourage themselves to fall on upon such slender Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But to state the matter aright between the Imperial Beard, and its sawcy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; if it met with any rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil usage, it may thank its Owner for it, who indeed brought that rude treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into fashion by Lampooning all his Predecessors. And if Princes will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so low as to write Libels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they must pardon the Poets if they give them as good as they bring, for there is no King of Wit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Pedantick Prince putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon such an equal Level with his Subjects, by vying Wit or rather Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry with them, which no Prince beside himself ever did, it can scarce amount to an act of Treason if they made so bold with his Beard. And the truth of it is, his Beard was so very singular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that no Stoick could well pass it by without a fling at it, for it was the very Comet of a Beard upon a Boys face,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:42190:310"/>
and that alone was a very provoking and ridiculous sight. <note n="*" place="margin">

And long before this Beard was assaulted by the ill-bred <hi>Antiochian</hi> Citizens, it had been Canonised, when he was much younger, in the Court of <hi>Constantius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> where, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrist informs us, he was Nick-named the Goat for his long Beard, and not only so, but a pratling Mole, a Monkey in Purple, a Greek Pedant. All which the Historian imputes to their Envy of his great Glory, and parallels his Case with <hi>Cimons,</hi> that Envy accused of Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and with <hi>Scipio</hi>'s that it charged with too much love of Ease, and with <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, that was blamed for too much neatness. These are little defects inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to great Men, that their spiteful Enemies might take advantage of to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clypse the Glory of their Vertue, with the Rabble, but as for these Pedantick Affectations, for which <hi>Julian</hi> was so highly despised, they could not be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any Man, that was not a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fopp.</p>
               <p>But beside all this, we must consider
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:42190:310"/>
to what sort of Men the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation was given, and that was to the Poets, by his discountenancing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Play-Houses, by which they were undone, and they are a sort of men, whose Wit ought to be allowed some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of Revenge upon their Enemies, especially when he sharpned the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by keeping them hungry as well as poor, having occasion'd a great scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Provisions in the City by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Edict. Now laying all these things together, the Royal Beard had no such great reason to complain, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much its Owner exposed both it and himself, of so much hard usage, as if it had been pursued like a midnight Thief, or an High-way Robber. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, it does not appear that these Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were Christians, <hi>Julian</hi> indeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them, that their City was over-run with the <hi>Galilaean</hi> Superstition, that had wrought too great an indifferency for the Worship of the Gods, and that for the sake of <hi>Constantius</hi> their great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor and Patron, they had too much kindness for, or rather too little zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Religion. But that the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were Heathens is very probable from the cause of the quarrel; the chief ground whereof was his discouraging of the Plays,
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:42190:311"/>
of which the Christians of those times were so far from being very fond, that it was accounted no less then Idolatry to frequent them, because their Scenes were really nothing else then represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the old Heathen Impieties.</p>
               <p>But yet beside the singularity of the Beard it self, it was made somewhat more ridiculous, and contemptible by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the man that wore it, who in a word was the very <hi>Hudibras</hi> of his Age. And, as himself tells us, the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of his humour was the thing that made him the common Laughing-Stock to the <hi>Antiochians.</hi> He was by nature <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. 4ta, p.</hi> 122.</note> says he made a right guess what he would prove, when he saw him a young Student at <hi>Athens:</hi> 
                  <q>By his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Shoulders, his wild and wandring Eye, his shufling and restless feet, his

continual Grinning, and abusive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, the variety of his Looks, and sudden alterations of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nodding this way, and in the same moment that way, and that at nothing, asking impertinent Questions without staying for any Answer:</q> with a great number more of indecencies of behaviour, that plainly betrayed an odd Constitution of Nature.</p>
               <p>And this natural lightness was very well improved by a careful Education, he was throughly instructed in all the Greek Pedantry, he had upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion a Verse out of <hi>Hesiod</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> he could not so much as muster his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without dispersing amongst them some Apothegms out of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> But the most apish Deformity in him, was his ill favour'd Imitation of great Men, and therefore <hi>Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus,</hi> when he conjures up all the <note place="margin">

<pb n="602" facs="tcp:42190:312"/>
take <hi>Julian's</hi> own Word, for in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Themistius</hi> he declares himself Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great for Courage, and to <hi>M. Aurelius</hi> for Vertue; so that by equalling both in their several Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he might exceed both in real Worth and Greatness. And he was so apish in his imitation of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he spent all his Nights in the same hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that the old Romantick Historians say he spent his, one third part in Sleep, another in Business, and a third in Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which continual watchfulness added to the natural warmth of his Brain must unavoidably heat it into ridiculous fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, and make every passage of his Life very phantastick and affected. Now when such a Pigmee and Pedant as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was, would swell and strut and look big, and really believe himself of equal Bulk to the greatest Gyants, and affect to make every Step he takes as large as theirs, it must be a sight so comical and pleasant, as could not but work through the dullest Spleen of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And this, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> himself reports it, was one thing that made the <hi>Antiochians</hi> merry. <hi>Rideba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ut Circops, homo brevis, humeros ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentans angustos, &amp; barbam prae se ferens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

he might have beside, must be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. Thus whereas he admires him for his Clemency, his affectation of it was so awkerd and preposterous, that he would let the most barbarous Crimes go unpunished for the glory of it, in so much that when the Parents of a ravisht Maid complain'd to him of the injury, though by Law the punishment was death, he dismissed the Offender with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Penalty; upon which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents complaining of it as a dishonour to their Family, let the Laws (says he) find fault with Clemency, it becomes a Courteous Emperor to be more civil then the Laws. This foolish action is the only instance that the Historian gives of this vertue in him. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was a great pretender to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick patience, there was never any Man so Extravagant and intemperate in his passion, as 'tis described by <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the greatest subject for contempt of him was his immense Superstition, which in a Learned Philosopher we may suppose much more ridiculous then in an old woman, the description of it in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus Marcellinus</hi> is very pleasant, <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. beside several other strange Stories of his <hi>Euthusiasms,</hi> to which <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen</hi> is so so kind as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all his madness, and it is certain that he was so hot-headed as to pretend to Visions and Correspondence with the Gods, and I doubt not but he believed himself.

Vision from all his Puppet Gods to assure him of success. But to forbear the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Catalogue of his Follies, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down an Account of one of his Pious Processions at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who was an Eye-witness of it. <q>He Published an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict <note place="margin">Orat. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> through the whole Empire, that the Idol-Temples and Altars should be Rebuilt, the ancient Worship given to the <hi>Daemons,</hi> and great Revenues setled for its maintenance, upon which Edict immediately the Magicians, the Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Augurs, the Diviners, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, the Tavern <hi>Hocus-pocus</hi> Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd from all parts of the World. And here might you behold the Court reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht with the most infamous, profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and vagabond Persons; for all that were ready to starve for Bread, all that were Convicted of Villany, all that were condemned to the publick Prisons, and the Mines, all the mean People that could not live upon their Trades, immediately professed themselves Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Priests, and you cannot imagine in what honour and esteem they were held by his Imperial Majesty. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised the great Commanders and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of his Army in comparison of these poor jugling Cheats. He made solemn Processions through the City with a
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:42190:314"/>
rout of Bawds, and Carted Whores, and whilst his Royal Guard, and Praetorian Bands kept their distance, this wretched rout of Infamous Cattle, Pimps, Bawds, Harlots, Sodomites, encompass't his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in his Passage through the <hi>Forum,</hi> venting all the way such mirth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as became such an Holy Rabble. A matter of Fact (says he) so absurd and ridiculous in it self, that I know cannot but seem incredible to Posterity. Neither indeed is it possible that any private Person, that was bound to any sense of shame or modesty, could appear in publick in such a foul and indecent action. And yet I hope there is no need of appealing to the Testimony of this Age for the truth of it, for there are many that were Spectators, who know, and can and will attest the Truth of my Report, and for that reason I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it to the Witnesses that are yet alive, lest Posterity should suspect my fidelity in telling such an Extravagant Story. And therefore I conjure all, both young and old, that were Eye-witnesses of it as well as my self, that if I have made the least addition to the foppery, they would publickly shame and convince me of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

hard-hearted as to impose such a rigid se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity upon the pleasant Gentlemen of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as not to enjoy some mirth from so much folly? Nay, though they were Christians, that did not keep their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity as they were wont to do, they were to be indulged in their sport, though it were for nothing else then the great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and satisfaction that they must take, in seeing the greatest Enemy to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the greatest fool in the World. But however if they jear'd him they did no more, and therefore from their breaking Jests upon himself, his Beard, and his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; to infer the Lawfulness of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king assaults upon his Government, only proves what an aking Tooth some Men have to be at their own Conclusion, but I hope by this time it is drawn out: And now having thus far brought down the contrary both Doctrine and Practice of the Christian Church from its first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of this Reign, through all Varieties and Vicissitudes of condition, I shall at present here break off, because it is enough for its own Demonstration.
